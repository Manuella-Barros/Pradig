Comedians, ex-teammates, and coaches roasted Brady, who took it in stride. Despite a joke about Brady's ex-wife, Kraft and Belichick showed support with a shared shot. Brady poked fun at Belichick's lack of Super Bowl wins since his departure. Brady's preparedness and willingness to laugh at himself were praised. The roast was seen as a testament to his greatness and a celebration of it in a lighter vein.\n\nThree months before Tom Brady gets roasted by critics as Fox Sports' top NFL analyst, he took his share of barbs from comedians, former teammates and his longtime coach Sunday night during a made-for-streaming comedy live event on Netflix.\n\nAnd it is safe to say after the one liners and jokes Brady heard during three hours of \"The Greatest Roast of All Time\" at The Forum, he will do just fine.\n\n\"It's like a football game. You run with a game plan, and then you get to see kind of how the strategy goes, and then you adjust on the fly,\" Brady said before the event. \"This is what a locker room has been like for me for all these years. So it's not like I'm used to people not making fun of me.\" Comedian Nikki Glaser, whose monologue was among the funniest of the night, termed the roast as \"the comedians' Super Bowl\" and how the competition level was ramped up because everyone wanted to one-up each other.\n\nBrady sustained more blitzes and pressure than he did during an average NFL game as an impressive lineup of comedians, former teammates and opponents took the stage . Host Kevin Hart said before the event that no topic was off limits, and Hart went on the offensive early with jokes about Brady's ex-wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\n\"Gisele gave you an ultimatum. She said you retire or we're done. When you got a chance to go 8-9 and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids, you've got to do what you've got to do,\" Hart said, referring to Brady coming out of a brief retirement in 2022 for one more season.\n\nThe only time Brady objected to a joke was when Jeff Ross made a reference to Patriots owner Robert Kraft and massages. In 2019, Kraft received a misdemeanor charge that he paid for sex at a Florida massage parlor.\n\nBrady walked up to Ross and said in his ear \"don't say that (stuff) again\", but it was caught on the microphone.\n\nLater, Kraft and former Patriots coach Bill Belichick did a shot together on stage after some coaxing from Hart.\n\nBelichick was fired in January after 24 seasons with the Patriots, and a lot has been written about friction between the six-time winning Super Bowl coach and owner over the past couple years.\n\nAfter joking about this being like a reunion and \"unlike many family reunions there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid\", Kraft praised Belichick for what the two accomplished.\n\n\"I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done. And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me,\" Kraft said.\n\nIt wasn't the first shot (of alcohol) that Belichick took. Rob Gronkowski got Belichick and Brady to do a shot together after his monologue. Gronkowski celebrated by spiking his shot glass.\n\nBelichick appeared at the beginning of the roast during a pre-taped segment when he told Brady that he was \"starting the roast\" instead of Drew Bledsoe. Brady replaced Bledsoe in 2001 when Bledsoe was injured in a Week 2 game against the Jets and led the Patriots to their first Super Bowl title that season.\n\n\"For all of you out there who think about who's responsible for the Patriots' success during the time Tom and I were together -- was it Tom or me -- in reality the truth of the matter was it was both of us because of me,\" Belichick said.\n\nBrady did have some fun at Belichick's expense though near the end of the show.\n\n\"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious, how many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left?,\" Brady said. \"Maybe it's not just the guy on the sideline. When I go to the Indy 500, I don't ask the winning driver, 'Hey, you gassed up your car?\" Hart said before the show that he thought Brady was in a great mindset going into the event. Brady did come in well prepared, going over his monologue with a group of people, including those at Fox Sports.\n\n\"You have to be able to laugh at yourself and I love what he is doing in this forum,'' Hart said. ''I love that he is embracing the things that some people think he runs away from. It is a celebration of greatness and we are doing it in a fun way.\" Bledsoe also said that Brady has had a sense of humor, but that this was a different stage.\n\n\"I thought he was very brave. There's plenty of material to make fun of him,'' Bledsoe said. ''The truth is when you're a professional athlete, roasting each other is kind of what we do every day in the locker room. And so, you better have thick skin going in. Now, people laugh along with it.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monologue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monologue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spike (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/AdminFiles/UserFiles/22_11_2018_14_00_28_6024474.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Three months before Tom Brady gets roasted by critics as Fox Sports' top NFL analyst, he took his share of barbs from comedians, former teammates and his longtime coach Sunday night during a made-for-streaming comedy live event on Netflix.\n\nAnd it is safe to say after the one liners and jokes Brady heard during three hours of \"The Greatest Roast of All Time\" at The Forum, he will do just fine.\n\n\"It's like a football game. You run with a game plan, and then you get to see kind of how the strategy goes, and then you adjust on the fly,\" Brady said before the event. \"This is what a locker room has been like for me for all these years. So it's not like I'm used to people not making fun of me.\"\n\nComedian Nikki Glaser, whose monologue was among the funniest of the night, termed the roast as \"the comedians' Super Bowl\" and how the competition level was ramped up because everyone wanted to one-up each other.\n\nBrady sustained more blitzes and pressure than he did during an average NFL game as an impressive lineup of comedians, former teammates and opponents took the stage . Host Kevin Hart said before the event that no topic was off limits, and Hart went on the offensive early with jokes about Brady's ex-wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\n\"Gisele gave you an ultimatum. She said you retire or we're done. When you got a chance to go 8-9 and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids, you've got to do what you've got to do,\" Hart said, referring to Brady coming out of a brief retirement in 2022 for one more season.\n\nThe only time Brady objected to a joke was when Jeff Ross made a reference to Patriots owner Robert Kraft and massages. In 2019, Kraft originally received a misdemeanor charge that he paid for sex at a Florida massage parlor. Prosecutors later dropped the charge after courts blocked the use of video from cameras installed by police inside the massage parlors.\n\nBrady walked up to Ross and said in his ear \"don't say that (stuff) again\", but it was clearly caught on the microphone and heard by those watching the roast at home. It was not heard by those in attendance.\n\nLater, Kraft and former Patriots coach Bill Belichick did a shot together on stage after some coaxing from Hart.\n\nBelichick was fired in January after 24 seasons with the Patriots, and a lot has been written about friction between the six-time winning Super Bowl coach and owner over the past couple years.\n\nAfter joking about this being like a reunion and \"unlike many family reunions there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid\", Kraft praised Belichick for what the two accomplished.\n\n\"I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done. And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me,\" Kraft said.\n\nIt wasn't the first shot (of alcohol) that Belichick took. Rob Gronkowski got Belichick and Brady to do a shot together after his monologue. Gronkowski celebrated by spiking his shot glass.\n\nBelichick appeared at the beginning of the roast during a pre-taped segment when he told Brady that he was \"starting the roast\" instead of Drew Bledsoe. Brady replaced Bledsoe in 2001 when Bledsoe was injured in a Week 2 game against the Jets and led the Patriots to their first Super Bowl title that season.\n\n\"For all of you out there who think about who's responsible for the Patriots success during the time Tom and I was together -- was it Tom or me -- in reality the truth of the matter was it was both of us because of me,\" Belichick said.\n\nBrady did have some fun at Belichick's expense though near the end of the show.\n\n\"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious, how many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left?,\" Brady said. \"Maybe it's not just the guy on the sideline. When I go to the Indy 500, I don't ask the winning driver, 'Hey, you gassed up your car?;\"\n\nHart said before the show that he thought Brady was in a great mindset going into the event. Brady did come in well prepared, going over his monologue with a group of people, including those at Fox Sports.\n\n\"You have to be able to laugh at yourself and I love that he is doing in this forum,\" Hart said. \"I love that he is embracing the things that some people think he runs away from. It is a celebration of greatness and we are doing it in a fun way.\"\n\nBledsoe also said that Brady has had a sense of humor, but that this was a different stage.\n\n\"I thought he was very brave. There's plenty of material to make fun of him on,\" Bledsoe said. \"The truth is when you're a professional athlete, roasting each other is kind of what we do every day in the locker room. And so, you better have thick skin going in. Now, people get to laugh along with it.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monologue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monologue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spike (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/preview-454.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

When you got a chance to go 8-9 and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids, you've got to do what you've got to do,\" Hart said, referring to Brady coming out of a brief retirement in 2022 for one more season.\n\nThe only time Brady objected to a joke was when Jeff Ross made a reference to Patriots owner Robert Kraft and massages. In 2019, Kraft originally received a misdemeanor charge that he paid for sex at a Florida massage parlor. Prosecutors later dropped the charge after courts blocked the use of video from cameras installed by police inside the massage parlors.\n\nIn the sketch, Ross joked about Kraft offering Brady a massage when he first joined the Patriots. On Sunday, Brady walked up to Ross and said in his ear \"don't say that shit again\", but it was clearly caught on the microphone and heard by those watching the roast at home. It was not heard by those in attendance.\n\nLater, Kraft and former Patriots coach Bill Belichick did a shot together on stage after some coaxing from Hart.\n\nBelichick was fired in January after 24 seasons with the Patriots, and a lot has been written about friction between the six-time winning Super Bowl coach and owner over the past couple years.\n\nAfter joking about this being like a reunion and \"unlike many family reunions there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid\", Kraft praised Belichick for what the two accomplished.\n\n\"I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done. And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me,\" Kraft said.\n\nRob Gronkowski got Belichick and Brady to do a shot together after his monologue. Gronkowski celebrated by spiking his glass.\n\nBelichick appeared at the beginning of the roast during a pre-taped segment when he told Brady that he was \"starting the roast\" instead of Drew Bledsoe. Brady replaced Bledsoe in 2001 when Bledsoe was injured against the Jets and led the Patriots to their first Super Bowl title that season.\n\n\"For all of you out there who think about who's responsible for the Patriots success during the time Tom and I was together - was it Tom or me - in reality the truth of the matter was it was both of us because of me,\" Belichick said.\n\nBelichick also took a jab at Gronkowski. \"A lot people connect me with the saying 'Do Your Job' and some people do their job. Gronk, I've been watching you on Fox NFL Sunday, and I'm begging you, please, stop doing your job,\" Belichick said.\n\nBrady did have some fun at Belichick's expense though near the end of the show.\n\n\"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious, how many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left?,\" Brady said. \"Maybe it's not just the guy on the sideline. When I go to the Indy 500, I don't ask the winning driver, 'Hey, you gassed up your car?'\"\n\nBledsoe was given his own line to jab at his successor, with another reference to Brady's divorce.\n\n\"Look, buddy, you have more rings than I do,\" Bledsoe said. \"But I've experienced a couple of things that you will never experience: The feeling of being the No 1 overall draft pick in the NFL and a 28th wedding anniversary. It was yesterday.\"\n\nBrady countered with a joke that touched one of the most painful moments in US history.\n\n\"Like the rest of America, I will always remember where I was that fateful day in September 2001 when, tragically, those two Jets slammed into Drew Bledsoe,\" Brady said.\n\nBrady came in well prepared, going over his monologue with a group of people, including those at Fox Sports, where he will take up a role as a pundit. He referenced OJ Simpson, who died last month, as he took aim at his long-time rival Peyton Manning, who ended his career with the Denver Broncos.\n\n\"When I heard there was a slow, white Bronco heading down the 405 to come here tonight, I thought we might actually see a real football legend,\" Brady said.\n\nHart said he thought Brady had performed well.\n\n\"You have to be able to laugh at yourself and I love that he is doing in this forum,\" Hart said. \"I love that he is embracing the things that some people think he runs away from. It is a celebration of greatness and we are doing it in a fun way.\"\n\nBledsoe also said that Brady has had a sense of humor, but that this was a different stage.\n\n\"I thought he was very brave. There's plenty of material to make fun of him on,\" Bledsoe said. \"The truth is when you're a professional athlete, roasting each other is kind of what we do every day in the locker room. And so, you better have thick skin going in. Now, people get to laugh along with it.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_NFL_Sunday", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox NFL Sunday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.

When I go to the Indy 500, I don't ask the winning driver, 'Hey, you gassed up your car?\"\n\nHart said before the show that he thought Brady was in a great mindset going into the event. Brady did come in well-prepared, going over his monologue with a group of people, including those at Fox Sports.\n\n\"You have to be able to laugh at yourself and I love that he is doing in this forum,\" Hart said. \"I love that he is embracing the things that some people think he runs away from. It is a celebration of greatness and we are doing it in a fun way.\"\n\nBledsoe also said that Brady has had a sense of humor, but that this was a different stage.\n\n\"I thought he was very brave. There's plenty of material to make fun of him on,\" Bledsoe said. \"The truth is when you're a professional athlete, roasting each other is kind of what we do every day in the locker room. And so, you better have thick skin going in. Now, people get to laugh along with it.\"", "source": {"uri": "wmur.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WMUR9"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wmur.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

What were the most hilarious moments?\n\nAfter torturing opposing fans on Sundays for over two decades, former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was finally on the receiving end of some torture on Sunday night. Brady was the target of Netflix's live special, 'The Greatest Roast of All Time.'\n\nThe night started off with a hilarious moment, as former Patriots head coach Bill Belichick informed Drew Bledsoe that it wasn't his night, since he was essentially being benched for Brady once again. That kicked off what would turn out to be an R-rated night, as there was arguably as much profanity thrown about as there were jokes.\n\nHowever, Brady might have immediately regretted his decision to volunteer as the target of Netflix's live roast.\n\nMost Hilarious Moments From The Roast of Tom Brady\n\nBrady was roasted by several comedians, former teammates, and other famous celebrities. Will Ferrell turned back the clocks and appeared as Ron Burgundy from 'Anchorman' to remind Brady that he lost twice to former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning.\n\nEven Kim Kardashian made an appearance for Brady's roast. Kardashian hurled several jokes at Brady, and most notable was her refusal to defend Brady from the other's jokes.\n\nKardashian hilariously cited her own family's history of defending former football players, in a call back to her father, Robert Kardashian's, defense of O.J. Simpson.\n\nOne of Brady's biggest rivals during his playing career was former Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning. While they traded touchdowns on the field, the legendary quarterback rivals traded jokes on Sunday night.\n\nManning took the stage to once again remind Brady how he lost twice in the Super Bowl to Peyton's brother, Eli. Peyton threw several jabs at Brady, including a hilarious reference to what his own children now call their trips to the bathroom.\n\nPeyton finished his segment by introducing Brady to the stage, announcing him as a \"three-time Super Bowl loser.\"\n\nBill Belichick Steals the Show\n\nBefore Brady took the stage to close out the event, his former head coach stole the show. Despite being notably stoic during press conferences, Belichick let loose while roasting Brady and several of his former players in New England.\n\nBelichick seemed to focus more on other former Patriots players, most notably legendary tight end Rob Gronkowski. The greatest head coach in the history of the NFL was relentless with his jokes targeting Gronkowski.\n\nHe mentioned how he has watched Gronkowski on 'Fox NFL Sunday' and hilariously begged him to \"stop doing your job.\" That naturally goes directly against Belichick's famous team slogan of \"do your job\" in New England.\n\nPatriots owner Robert Kraft also held the microphone on Sunday night, cracking a few jokes and eventually praising Brady. It was refreshing to see Brady, Belichick, and Kraft all together on Sunday night, considering the amount of chaos surrounding the franchise since the trio went their separate ways.\n\nOnce Kraft wrapped up his speech, he was asked by Hart to share a toast with Belichick. At first, it seemed like the moment wasn't going to actually happen. Yet Kraft and Belichick put their reported differences aside and cheered together on stage.\n\nIt was a shocking moment to witness, given reports that Kraft potentially blocked Belichick from landing another head coaching job in the NFL this offseason. While we may never know what truly happened, Kraft and Belichick may have stolen the show on Sunday night.\n\nYet Brady wasn't going to go down without a fight. In typical fashion, he didn't let the opposition win, seemingly mounted a late-game comeback with a hilarious barrage of his own jokes and firing back at all of his critics to close out the show.\n\nBrady Pulls Off Another Comeback, 'Admits' to Deflategate\n\nBrady quickly recovered once he finally took the stage. He fired back at nearly everyone who roasted him throughout the event, including Peyton, who he quickly reminded will always live in Brady's shadow.\n\n\"I know sometimes you live in Denver, and sometimes you live in Louisiana,\" Brady said. \"But you will always live in my shadow.\"\n\nAfter hitting Peyton with a few more jokes, Brady shifted topics and asked where NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was. Brady was bashed several times during the roast about his controversial involvement in the 'Deflategate' controversy.\n\nYet Brady joked about the NFL's costly investigation, even stating that they could have paid him $20 million and he would have admitted to deflating footballs.\n\nWhile we'll never likely know how serious Brady was about admitting to these allegations, it was a hilarious response. After being on the receiving end of several jokes throughout the night, Brady bounced back in the typical fashion that we've all become far too familiar with over the last two decades.\n\nIt wouldn't be an event involving Brady if it didn't include an impressive comeback. While Brady took most of the jokes on Sunday night in stride, he did seem to take offense to a shot from comedian Jeff Ross.\n\nDespite all of that, Brady stole back the show with his final words. Netflix's live special was an overall success filled with memorable moments.\n\nHowever, after seeing the jokes that Brady was targeted with, it will be interesting to see who the next volunteer for this torture is.", "source": {"uri": "profootballnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pro Football Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Will Ferrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eli Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_NFL_Sunday", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox NFL Sunday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.

Here's what Tom Brady couldn't handle during his Netflix roast", "body": "No Brady Rule. No Pads. No Mercy. \"The Greatest Roast of All Time: The Roast of Tom Brady\" airs on Netflix in May.\n\nThe roast of Tom Brady happened Sunday night and it was as funny, offensive and foul as many of us expected. It was a roast. This is what happens. They are not for the easily offended.\n\nBut out of all the moments from the night, from all of the tawdry jokes and one liners, there was one moment that was extremely telling. It said a lot about the relationship between Brady and someone he's extremely close to: Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\n\"The Greatest Roast of All Time: The Roast of Tom Brady\" was part of the annual \"Netflix is a Joke\" festival. It aired live on the site and as someone who is a roast geek, it was one of the better ones you'll see. Everyone caught strays. Poor Rob Gronkowski was absolutely brutalized.\n\nThere were a number of former Brady teammates, coaches and others in attendance including Bill Belichick, Peyton Manning, Randy Moss, Drew Bledsoe, Julian Edelman, Rodney Harrison, Willie McGinest, Matt Light and Nate Solder.\n\nOut of all the moments in the show it was one involving Kraft that was the most interesting.\n\nComedian Jeff Ross would be on the Mount Rushmore of offensive roast comedians. At roasts in general, no one is untouchable. To Ross, the more uncomfortable he makes people, the better. He started off one of his jokes by telling the story of how Brady, at the time a rookie, and a sixth-round pick, had the audacity to tell Kraft that drafting him was the best decision the organization had ever made.\n\nRoss then joked that Brady added, \"Would you like a massage?\"\n\nOh. Man.\n\nThe joke was referring to Kraft's 2019 arrest for soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor - charges that were dropped in 2020.\n\nAfter the joke, Brady immediately stood, approached Ross at the lectern, and said, \"Don't say that (expletive) again.\" His remark was caught on the microphone and could clearly be heard by the home audience.\n\nIt's possible this was part of the act and Brady was acting. Maybe that will be what Brady says at some point. But it didn't seem that way. It looked like Brady wasn't joking. He seemed deadly serious.\n\nRoss then said, \"OK, OK.\" Ross next pointed to Kraft in the audience: \"He's having fun, look at him.\"\n\nBrady looked unmoved.\n\nThere's a simple reason why Brady was irritated. While Brady and Belichick's relationship has been at times frayed, Brady and Kraft have been close for decades. They have remained good friends and that description might be understating the true nature of how close they are.\n\nAs the Patriots won Super Bowls, and then fractured, Brady and Kraft stayed close. At every opportunity, Kraft has publicly supported Brady, and recently, Brady did the same. Last year, when Kraft was up for the Hall of Fame, Brady publicly jumped in to support him.\n\n\"In my mind, this is a no-brainer,\" Brady said of Kraft's candidacy. \"I want this bad for him because he deserves it.\"\n\n\"When it comes to the league, nobody, in my opinion, has contributed - since I've been in the league - the way he has,\" Brady said. \"As an owner on all the important committees, he successfully navigated multiple labor agreements. I know in the 2011 agreement, he was instrumental in the success of it.\n\n\"I remember that picture of him and Jeff Saturday, with their arms around each other, bringing everyone back to football, which was great. You can care about that on a team level, but you can also look at that from a league level.\"\n\nTo Brady, you don't mess with Kraft. You can take all the shots you want at Belichick or Gronk. Jokes were made about Aaron Hernandez being a murderer and a bevy of a number of other tasteless quips.\n\nBrady even made fun of himself.\n\n\"The NFL spent $20 million and found it was 'more probable than not' that I was 'generally aware' that someone may have deflated my footballs,\" Brady said. \"You could have just given me the $20 million and I would just told you I (expletive) did it.\"\n\nMost of the jokes on the night were funny and inappropriate and even terrible.

You run with a game plan, and then you get to see kind of how the strategy goes, and then you adjust on the fly,\" Brady said before the event. \"This is what a locker room has been like for me for all these years. So it's not like I'm used to people not making fun of me.\"\n\nComedian Nikki Glaser, whose monologue was among the funniest of the night, termed the roast as \"the comedians' Super Bowl\" and how the competition level was ramped up because everyone wanted to one-up each other.\n\nBrady sustained more blitzes and pressure than he did during an average NFL game as an impressive lineup of comedians, former teammates and opponents took the stage. Host Kevin Hart said before the event that no topic was off limits, and Hart went on the offensive early with jokes about Brady's ex-wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\n\"Gisele gave you an ultimatum. She said you retire or we're done. When you got a chance to go 8-9 and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids, you've got to do what you've got to do,\" Hart said, referring to Brady coming out of a brief retirement in 2022 for one more season.\n\nThe night also featured Patriots owner Robert Kraft and former Patriots coach Bill Belichick doing a shot together on stage after some coaxing from Hart.\n\nBelichick was fired in January after 24 seasons with the Patriots, and a lot has been written about friction between the six-time winning Super Bowl coach and owner over the past couple years.\n\nAfter joking about this being like a reunion and \"unlike many family reunions there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid,\" Kraft praised Belichick for what the two accomplished.\n\n\"I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done. And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honour the good Lord gave me,\" Kraft said.\n\nIt wasn't the first shot (of alcohol) that Belichick took. Rob Gronkowski got Belichick and Brady to do a shot together after his monologue. Gronkowski celebrated by spiking his shot glass.\n\nBelichick appeared at the beginning of the roast during a pre-taped segment when he told Brady that he was \"starting the roast\" instead of Drew Bledsoe. Brady replaced Bledsoe in 2001 when Bledsoe was injured in a Week 2 game against the Jets and led the Patriots to their first Super Bowl title that season.\n\n\"For all of you out there who think about who's responsible for the Patriots success during the time Tom and I was together -- was it Tom or me -- in reality the truth of the matter was it was both of us because of me,\" Belichick said.\n\nBrady did have some fun at Belichick's expense though near the end of the show.\n\n\"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious, how many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left?,\" Brady said. \"Maybe it's not just the guy on the sideline. When I go to the Indy 500, I don't ask the winning driver, 'Hey, you gassed up your car?;\"\n\nHart said before the show that he thought Brady was in a great mindset going into the event. Brady did come in well prepared, going over his monologue with a group of people, including those at Fox Sports.\n\n\"You have to be able to laugh at yourself and I love that he is doing in this forum,\" Hart said. \"I love that he is embracing the things that some people think he runs away from. It is a celebration of greatness and we are doing it in a fun way.\"\n\nBledsoe also said that Brady has had a sense of humour, but that this was a different stage.\n\n\"I thought he was very brave. There's plenty of material to make fun of him on,\" Bledsoe said. \"The truth is when you're a professional athlete, roasting each other is kind of what we do every day in the locker room. And so, you better have thick skin going in. Now, people get to laugh along with it.\"", "source": {"uri": "toronto.citynews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityNews Toronto"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucas_casaletto@toronto.citynews.ca", "name": "Lucas Casaletto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monologue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monologue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://toronto.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/10/2024/05/06/Brady-1040x572-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The former head coach, notorious for his interaction with the media, took the stage to thunderous applause and wasted no time taking his first crack, saying Burgundy is the only member of the media he respects.\n\nBelichick then took aim at the recent documentary on the Patriots dynasty that criticized him heavily, painting him as somewhat of the villain in the downfall of Pats historic run.\n\n\"I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix. It's not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10-part Apple TV series,\" Belichick quipped.\n\nHe went on to allude to how he was perceived to be hard on Brady, saying, \"A lot of mean things being said about Tom tonight. Wonder why they invited me?\"\n\n\"Really Tom, why are all these people so hard on you? Do you miss me?\"\n\nHe turned his attention toward Gronkowski next. Belichick, who became associated with the \"Do your job\" mantra, said to the former tight end, \"Gronk I've been watching you on Fox NFL Sunday and I'm begging you, please, stop doing your job.\"\n\nOthers to take the stage included Ben Affleck, Nikki Glaser, Edelman, Jeff Ross and Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe reality TV star delivered a few jokes after being welcomed to the stage with audible boos from the crowd. She playfully mocked dating rumors involving her and Brady.\n\nThere were some crude jokes, as well, including from Glaser about B\u00fcndchen's new boyfriend.\n\nOne joke from Ross about Robert Kraft's massage parlor controversy seemed to trigger Brady.\n\n\"So Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\" Ross joked.\n\n\"I love Robert Kraft, I....,\" Ross started to say before Brady approached him and said in his ear, \"Never say that sh** again.\"\n\nRoss pointed out that Kraft was \"having fun\" during the roast.\n\nLater, Kraft was back on stage for some brief comments and a joke or two, saying to Brady, \"Tom, good luck buying the Raiders. They did your favorite thing already -- they got rid of Jimmy Garoppolo.\"\n\nHart then invited Kraft and Belichick to the stage to take a shot together because they're \"so far apart\" -- and yes, it was as awkward as it sounds.\n\n\"Bill, Bill, this is a big moment, Bill,\" Hart said as he encouraged Belichick to meet Kraft on stage.\n\nAs he made his way there, Kraft interrupted to say, \"I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done, and having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord game me, so cheers.\"\n\nBelichick for his part seemed to have a somewhat pained smile plastered on his face, with no affection shown towards his former employer as they downed their shots.", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com",

The target was New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, the man who signed Brady's paychecks for the first 20 years of his 23-year NFL career.\n\nAfter host Kevin Hart opened the show with a blistering monologue -- \"Why didn't we go to the Crypto.com Arena downtown? Well, the reason why we didn't go there is because we didn't want to remind Tom's fans of how much money he owes them \" -- comedian and celebrity roast staple Jeff Ross kept the hits coming. He talked about how Brady was drafted in the sixth round with the 199th pick of the 2000 NFL draft \"when Bill Belichick 's dog stepped on the keyboard by accident.\"\n\n\"So Tom became a Patriot,\" Ross said, \"moved up to New England and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\"\n\nThe joke was a reference to Kraft being arrested in 2019 on charges of soliciting sex from a prostitute during an encounter at a Florida day spa. Kraft pleaded not guilty, and the charges were dropped the following year after his lawyers prevented video and audio footage from being used as evidence in court.\n\nAs the crowd laughed and Ross blew a kiss in Kraft's direction, Brady could be seen shifting in his seat behind and to the right of the comedian. The camera cut to a close shot of Ross, who said \"I love Robert Kraft.\"\n\nBrady then approached Ross. The NFL's all-time leader in passing yards and touchdown passes had a bit of a smile on his face, but his tone was dead serious when he leaned in and said to Ross, \" Don't say that s -- again.\"\n\nAs Brady returned to his seat, Ross laughed, put his hands up and said, \"OK, OK!\" He pointed in Kraft's direction and said, \"He's having fun, look at him.\" As Ross added some sincere words of praise for Kraft, the Patriots owner was shown smiling in the crowd.\n\nBrady didn't appear to hold a grudge and could be seen laughing during the rest of Ross' set. The two men embraced and spoke after Ross' performance -- a scene Hart mocked by implying Ross was kissing up to the GOAT. \"I heard you over there,\" Hart said. \"'Tom, you all right? Yeah? Your hair's so straight.'\"\n\nBrady absorbed many more barbs throughout the evening without feeling the need to step in again.\n\nMany others came out to take their best shots at Brady and often one another.\n\nKim Kardashian recovered from being booed for about 15 seconds upon taking the podium to receiving big laughs and applause for some of her quips.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast you, but I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players,\" said the daughter of Robert Kardashian, who was a member of O.J. Simpson's legal team during the former USC and NFL star's murder trial in the 1990s.\n\nShe also got a big laugh from Brady when she told him, \"I think it's so great the way you're showing everyone that even after winning seven Super Bowls, you can still have a midlife crisis.\"\n\nBelichick and several of Brady's former teammates -- including Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman, Randy Moss and Drew Bledsoe, whom Brady famously replaced at the Patriots' starting quarterback in 2001 -- all had their turns at the podium, as did his former on-field rival Peyton Manning.\n\n\"Honestly, it is great to be here with a bunch of people sitting around talking smack about Tom Brady,\" Manning said. \"Or as we call that in the Manning family: Thanksgiving.\"\n\nPeyton's brother Eli Manning, who led the New York Giants to two Super Bowl wins over Brady and the Patriots, was not present for the show but offered a jab of his own on X the next morning.\n\n\"I thought about attending the Roast of Tom Brady last night,\" Manning wrote, \"but I did not want to Roast him for a 3rd time!!\"\n\nOthers who joined in the roast Sunday included stand-up comic Nikki Glaser, UFC president Dana White and actor Will Ferrell in character as Ron Burgundy from the \" Anchorman \" movies.\n\nAs is custom at these events, Brady got his chance at the podium -- and he didn't hold back. He said to Belichick, \"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious, how many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left? Maybe it's not just the guy on the sideline. When I go to the Indy 500, I don't ask the winning driver, 'Hey, who gassed up your car?'\"\n\nHe even (jokingly) admitted to Deflategate. \"The NFL spent $20 million and found that it was 'more probable than not' that I was 'generally aware' that someone may have deflated my footballs. You should've just given me the 20 million and I would've told you I f -- did it.\"\n\nBrady was also one of several speakers who made jokes at the expense of Aaron Hernandez, the former Patriots tight end who hanged himself in a prison cell in 2017 while serving a life sentence for first-degree murder. Hernandez, whose death was ruled a suicide, was later determined to have had CTE and early brain atrophy.\n\nTMZ reports that Hernandez's former fiance, Shayanna Jenkins Hernandez, the mother of their now 11-year-old daughter, thinks those jokes went too far.\n\n\"It's sad that I'm trying to raise my children in such a cruel world,\" she told the website.\n\n\u00a92024 Los Angeles Times.

It was hosted by comedian Kevin Hart.\n\nIt was a night filled with comedians and other celebrities spewing filthy insults at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles, and the brunt of the the joke was Brady.\n\nFor more than three hours, different comics took turns taking shots - some of them cheap at - Brady, while the all-time quarterback sat there and took it in good humor.\n\nThat is, until the end of the night, when Brady was allowed to fire back for a few minutes, and that's exactly what he did - and he proceeded to speak words you most likely have never heard Brady utter.\n\nThe roasters, which has not been released prior to airing, included:\n\nThere was only one joke that drew a rise out of Brady.\n\nRoss made a joke about Kraft and massage parlors.\n\n\"Tom became a Patriot, moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made.' Would you like a massage?\" Ross said.\n\nAfter that joke, Brady stood up and told Ross that during his monologue, \"don't say that (expletive) again.\"\n\nIt seemed to be the only joke that Brady didn't like.\n\nIf you have a Netflix account, you can still see the roast on that streaming service.\n\nHow to watch: 'The Greatest Roast of All Time': Tom Brady will be roasted live on Netflix.\n\nHere are some of the best one-liners from the three hour roast.\n\nBrady was drafted to the New England Patriots by Belichick in 2000. He was the 199th pick in the 2000 draft, being taken late in the sixth round of that draft.\n\nBrady played 23 seasons in the NFL, winning seven Super Bowls. He won six of those with the New England Patriots and one of them with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nBrady has the most Super Bowl appearances than any other quarterback in history, with 10 trips to the big game.

However, after retiring two years ago, the seven-time Super Bowl champion is no longer playing any football games.\n\nPreviously, Brady was targeted by opposing defenders on a Sunday night. But for Netflix's live event, \"The Roast of Tom Brady, AKA The Greatest Roast of All Time,\" the quarterback was under attack by a variety of former teammates and comedians including Rob Gronkowski, host Kevin Hart, Julian Edelman, Bert Kreischer, Tom Segura, Randy Moss and Jeff Ross.\n\nBut the program started with a gag likely more familiar to football fans than celebrity culture followers. Bill Belichick appeared on camera, telling someone, \"The fans want you. Everyone wants you. But it's not your night. Sorry, Drew.\"\n\nWe then see he's talking to Drew Bledsoe, former New England Patriots quarterback and Brady's predecessor at the position before getting injured. And the man of the night walks into frame.\n\nThat basically set the tone for the night. Easy jokes and plenty of f-bombs.\n\nAs could be expected at a celebrity roast, Brady's divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen was a frequent subject of jokes. Also as could be expected, many of them are unsuitable for documenting here.\n\nOne of the best was during Hart's opening. Mocking Brady for apparently choosing his football career over his marriage, Hart said, \"When you got a chance to go 8-9 and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids, you gotta do it.\"\n\nThere can't be a celebrity roast without Jeff Ross. The \"Roastmaster General\" has been insulting celebrities on television for 20 years. Coming out to the stage in a jersey that said \"Roast J Simpson\" on the back, Ross eventually poked fun at a key part of Tom Brady's legend.\n\n\"Tom was eventually 199th in the NFL Draft,\" Ross said. \"He sat there for days, waiting and waiting, and then you were finally picked in the 6th round when Bill Belichick's dog stepped on the keyboard by accident.\"\n\nHowever, Ross may have crossed a line with Brady when he referenced Patriots owner Robert Kraft and the massage parlor scandal he was involved with in 2019.\n\n\"Don't do that s*** again,\" Brady said in Ross' ear after that joke.\n\nBledsoe earning a place in football history by losing his starting quarterback job was the subject of many quips. But after joking that he hated Brady for taking his position, Bledsoe took a shot at Belichick, a now unemployed NFL coach.\n\n\"Who's more hateable than the most successful quarterback of all time? I mean, except maybe Belichick,\" Bledsoe said. \"There were rumors that coach Belichick was going to be here tonight. Turns out he has some time on his hands. Look, at least when I got fired, someone else wanted me.\"\n\nAs mentioned, Brady's divorce and low NFL Draft status were two constant objects of ridicule. Bledsoe took down both of them with one throw.\n\n\"Look, buddy, you have more rings than I do,\" Bledsoe said. \"But I've experienced a couple of things that you will never experience: The feeling of being the No. 1 overall draft pick in the NFL and a 28th wedding anniversary. It was yesterday.\"\n\nRob Gronkowski was the second-most popular target for jokes after Brady on Sunday night. Most of the wisecracks focused on Gronk's intelligence. The best of them came from comedian Nikki Glaser, who probably had the best material of the show.\n\nTom lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that?\" Glaser said. \"Even Gronk was like, 'Me know that not real money.'\"\n\nGronk got his turn on the stage and took his share of shots at Brady, Hart, Belichick and Edeleman. He ended his set by sharing a shot with Brady and Belichick followed by, of course, a spike of the shot glass.\n\nThat preceded another surprise moment featuring a round of shots. Patriots owner Robert Kraft took the stage alongside Belichick and praised him as \"the greatest coach in the history of the game\" then shared a shot with his former head coach.\n\nWhen it was nearly done after three-plus hours, Brady was introduced by a surprise guest -- his biggest NFL rival, Peyton Manning.\n\n\"It is great to see the greatest coach in NFL history, Bill Belichick, here,\" Manning said. \"For those that don't know, coach is going to be doing some work on Eli and my 'Monday Night Football' show this year.\n\n\"I gotta tell you, it's gonna be awesome. Eli and I are super excited, and it's gonna give coach Belichick something he hasn't had in a while: The chance to be around quarterbacks he respects.\"\n\nThen Brady finally had his turn. And he set his sights immediately on Manning.\n\n\"I know sometimes you live in Denver,\" Brady said. \"And sometimes you live in Louisiana. But you'll always live in my shadow.\"\n\nHe wasn't done.\n\n\"When I heard there was a slow, white Bronco heading down the 405 to come here tonight, I thought we might actually see a real football legend,\" Brady continued.\n\nHe soon set his sights on most everyone on stage including Gronkowski and Moss. He saved one of the edgiest jokes of the night for Bledsoe.\n\n\"Like the rest of America, I will always remember where I was that fateful day in September 2001 when, tragically, those two Jets slammed into Drew Bledsoe,\" Brady said.\n\nHe gave a sly nod to Roger Goodell and deflategate.\n\n\"The NFL spent $20 million and found that it was more 'probable' than not, that I was 'generally' aware that someone may have deflated my footballs. You could've just given me the 20 mil and I would've just told you I f***ing did it.\"\n\nAnd he closed with, of course, with jokes at Belichick's expense.\n\n\"You are a true coaching genius,\" Brady said. \"You had to choose between an aging, injured, overpaid Drew Bledsoe and a young healthy minimum-wage superstar. I could have got a f***ing coach from Foxboro f***ing high school to make that decision. ...\n\n\"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious. How many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left? Maybe it's not just the guy on the sideline. When I go to the Indy 500, I don't ask the winning driver 'hey, who gassed up your car?\"\n\nBrady compiled a 251-82 regular season record and 35-13 postseason mark during his 23-year NFL career. Whether he took another win or loss being roasted depends on how funny viewers thought those jokes were. Whether those viewers won or lost by watching \"The Greatest Roast of All Time\" is another question worth asking.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"},

I'm removing the discomfort from this room. Speaking of discomfort, let's talk about Bill Belichick for a second,\" Hart said to Brady. \"The world knows that you left Bill Belichick high and dry, you left him and then you went to Tampa and won a championship. Holy s---! Holy s---! You left Bill Belichick with Mac Jones.\"\n\nThe star-studded roast featured the expected jokes about Brady's ex-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen, as well as her jiu-jitsu instructor turned new boyfriend, Brady's close relationship with Alex Guerrero, and even how much money Brady lost in cryptocurrency and walking away from Bridget Moynahan when she was pregnant with their child, but the real surprise was that Belichick stole the show.\n\nBelichick, not exactly known for his sparkly personality, absolutely crushed it with his jokes -- not only about Brady, but about Rob Gronkowski, Danny Amendola and the recent Apple TV+ documentary \"The Dynasty.\"\n\nIt had been reported in recent days that Belichick would be one of the roasters, but it was still a surprise to see the normally gruff, former head coach, who had well-documented differences with Brady at the end of their time together, poke fun at his former QB.\n\nBelichick was introduced by none other than Will Ferrell in character as Ron Burgundy from \"Anchorman.\" The former head coach, notorious for his interaction with the media, took the stage to thunderous applause and wasted no time taking his first crack, saying Burgundy is the only member of the media he respects.\n\nBelichick then took aim at the recent documentary on the Patriots dynasty that criticized him heavily, painting him as somewhat of the villain in the downfall of Pats historic run.\n\n\"I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix. It's not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10-part Apple TV series,\" Belichick quipped.\n\nHe went on to allude to how he was perceived to be hard on Brady, saying, \"A lot of mean things being said about Tom tonight. Wonder why they invited me?\"\n\n\"Really Tom, why are all these people so hard on you? Do you miss me?\"\n\nHe turned his attention toward Gronkowski next. Belichick, who became associated with the \"Do your job\" mantra, said to the former tight end, \"Gronk I've been watching you on Fox NFL Sunday and I'm begging you, please, stop doing your job.\"\n\nGronk also spoke during the special event, talking about how much Edelman sucked up to Brady, and comparing the quarterback to avocados. Gronk later took a shot with Edelman, Brady and Belichick, spiking his shot glass onto the stage -- it's possible he didn't think that one through considering glass appeared to go flying into the first row of the audience.\n\nHart joked on stage afterwards about Gronk's stunt, saying, \"We're live so there's no way to hide the fact that Gronk might be on a little more than alcohol. Yeah, no, it's okay, yeah, no, Gronk we'll get it. Yeah, no we'll clean it up, Gronk. Yeah just sit down when you get a chance bro. Jesus Christ. Just lay down. Just lay down.\"\n\n\"I'm gonna say what everybody else is saying ... this is just my truth,\" Hart continued. \"Gronk scares me. He scares me. Gronk is, he's the unsafe white drunk guy.\"\n\nWhen it was his turn, Edelman had some great digs at Belichick, saying his only employment offer came from Foxborough High School, and at Brady, whose \"wife\" is Guerrero -- \"the snake oil salesman who transformed Brady into a weirdo.\"\n\nOther roasters to take the stage Sunday night included Drew Bledsoe, Randy Moss, Ben Affleck, Nikki Glaser, Jeff Ross and Kim Kardashian, who delivered a few jokes and playfully mocked dating rumors involving her and Brady after she was welcomed with audible boos from the crowd.\n\nThere were several crude jokes from Glaser including about B\u00fcndchen's new boyfriend, and Ross had a slew of jokes that could have hit a nerve -- from one about the Boston Marathon bombings to allegations that Brady cheated.\n\n\"Tom, I really wanted you to be our first GOAT to be roasted because you're an example to future generations that if you work hard, eat right, film the other teams' practices, deflate the balls and have the NFL make new rules just for you, then you, too, can be the third most famous guy in a Dunkin' Donuts commercial.\"\n\nBut it was actually a joke about Robert Kraft's massage parlor controversy that really seemed to trigger Brady.\n\n\"Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\" Ross joked.\n\n\"I love Robert Kraft, I ...,\" Ross started to say before Brady approached him at the podium and said in his ear, \"Don't say that s--- again.\"\n\nRoss pointed out that it appeared Kraft was \"having fun\" during the roast and commended him on all he does for the Jewish community before he got back to his bit.\n\nLater, Kraft was on stage himself for some brief comments and a joke or two, saying to Brady, \"Tommy, thank you for having me here for this unique experience. I thought I'd seen it all but this is special. But you know the Patriots are more than a football team for me. They are family. And guys, it's so good to see all of you here again. Thank you so much for everything you did for us.\"\n\nThe Patriots owner also had a joke or two, speaking about Belichick when he said: \"And like many family reunions, there are some people I'm desperately trying to avoid ... Coach Belichick, good to see you. You really look debonair in sleeves.\"\n\nAnd to Brady, touching on his long-suspected negative feelings about Jimmy G being drafted so highly by the Pats, Kraft said, \"Tom, good luck buying the Raiders. They did your favorite thing already -- they got rid of Jimmy Garoppolo.\"\n\nKraft raised a glass to Brady, telling him he'd always be special to him before telling Vladimir Putin to give him his ring back.\n\nThings took another strange turn when Hart invited Kraft and Belichick to the stage to take a shot together because they're \"so far apart from each other\" -- and yes, it was as awkward as it sounds.\n\n\"Robert wants to do it. Bill? Let's make the uncomfortable comfortable ... Bill, Bill, this is a big moment, Bill,\" Hart said as he tried to encourage Belichick to meet Kraft on stage.\n\nAs he made his way there, Kraft interrupted to say, \"I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done, and having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord game me, so cheers.\"\n\nBelichick for his part seemed to have a somewhat pained smile plastered on his face, with no affection shown towards his former employer -- in fact Belichick's arm was around Hart as Kraft spoke, and he didn't down the entire shot.\n\nHart went on to introduce one of his great friends who he called a very special guest and one of the most famous guys from Boston: \"Seriously, one of THE most, I would say there are only about two or three but this guy here in my opinion is the one.\"\n\nBen Affleck then walked out, saying, \"Hi you may know me as an extra from Tom's Dunkin' boy band commercial.\"\n\nThe night ended with the man of the hour at the podium, taking shots at Peyton Manning, who was the last to speak on stage calling Brady a 3x Super Bowl loser, as well as jabs at league commissioner Roger Goodell, and other NFL teams like the Kansas City Chiefs, Indianapolis Colts and Buffalo Bills.\n\n\"Kansas City, you say your stadium is the loudest. It helps when all your fans are 14-year-old girls,\" Brady said referencing the Swifties who are bandwagon Chiefs fans after Taylor Swift started dating Travis Kelce. \"And in honor of Tay Tay, let's take a look at the Chiefs Eras -- terrible for 50 years, good for five. Shake it off!\"\n\n\"Remember Deflategate? The NFL spent $20 million and found that it was more probable than not that I was generally aware that someone may have deflated my footballs. You could have just given me the $20 million and I would have just told you I f------ did it.\"\n\n\"But I don't wanna get the NFL too upset, I'm trying to buy a piece of the Raiders, I'm tired of owning just the Colts and the Bills.\"\n\nBrady's best shot at Belichick came when he pointed out how he fared without him in his finals years as the Patriots head coach: \"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious -- how many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left?\"\n\nIn the end, it really was like a family reunion Sunday night, as Gronk said. So while Brady may have spent his last three seasons in Tampa Bay, this roast was for Pats fans.

There were familiar faces from Brady's NFL days, too.\n\nHighlights Netflix debuted Tom Brady's roast series, featuring big names in comedy and Patriots stars. Brady will executive produce more roasts while gearing up for a lead announcer role at Fox. The roast featured teammates and opponents taking hilarious jabs at Brady's legacy.\n\nSince entering the streaming game, Netflix has become the home of several major comedy specials and now the service is focusing on roasts as well. On Sunday night, Netflix debuted The Greatest Roast of All-Time: Tom Brady.\n\nIt was one of the first times that Netflix has done a live event, and while it went smoothly, at about three hours of run time, it nearly tripled the length of the previous longest Comedy Central roast of all-time.\n\nSome of the biggest names in comedy were in attendance, such as Kevin Hart, Bert Kreischer, and the 'Roastmaster General' Jeff Ross. Of course, many famous New England Patriots figures were there too, like Rob Gronkowski, Robert Kraft, and Bill Belichick, the latter two of whom somewhat buried the hatchet with a little help from Hart.\n\nBrady retired following the 2022 campaign and spent the 2023 football season largely out of the public eye. But he will be taking to the booth for the 2024 season as a lead announcer for FOX's football broadcasts. He also made a deal with Netflix to executive produce several more roasts, the first of which was last night.\n\nRelated Tom Brady Open To NFL Return With Raiders, Patriots Tom Brady has been retired for just over a year, but the GOAT hasn't ruled out an MJ-esque return to the league. Brady's Teammates Were More Than Willing to Have Fun With Him Opponents like Peyton Manning were there as well\n\nBill Belichick was one of the first non-comedians to hit the stage, and he wanted to answer the question of who was responsible for the Patriots Dynasty. \"Was it Brady,\" he asked. \"Was it me? Was it Brady? Was it me? In reality, the truth of the matter is it was both of us. Because of me.\"\n\nJulian Edelman also took to the stage and made some jokes about his famous bromance with his former quarterback. The former wide receiver also got in one of the best jokes of the night when he noted that Brady was, \"Leonardo DiCaprio's ex-girlfriend's ex-husband.\"\n\nWill Ferrell, as he did previously for the Justin Bieber roast in 2015, was there in character as Ron Burgundy from the Anchorman films. He said of the quarterback:\n\nI never liked you Tom in all my years of watching professional football. I never saw a more boring quarterback. He actually made me look forward to all the fun and laughter of a Bill Belichick postgame interview.\n\nThe comedian also delivered one of the most succinct and punchy jokes about a subject everyone was expecting to get more traction during the roast: Eli Manning.\n\nPeyton Manning, Eli's older brother and Brady's most iconic rival, was also in attendance. Brady got a great shot in at Manning, saying, \"Thank you so much for coming out to L.A. to do this. I know sometimes you live in Denver, and sometimes you live in Louisiana, but you'll always live in my shadow.\"\n\nRandy Moss also had a funny bit asking Tom Brady why he didn't try to cheat while the Hall of Fame wideout was there from 2007-2010. And Gronkowski played into the whole \"big dummy\" persona that the other roasters placed on him perfectly. Here's a full list of the people who got a word in at the roast:\n\nRich Eisen (Intro) Kevin Hart (Host) Jeff Ross Nikki Glaser Sam Jay Andrew Schulz Tom Segura & Bert Kreischer Tony Hinchcliffe Kim Kardashian Dana White Ben Affleck Will Ferrell as Ron Burgundy Bill Belichick Drew Bledsoe Julian Edelman Rob Gronkowski Randy Moss Peyton Manning Robert Kraft\n\nBrady also sat a handful of his former teammates on stage in a row behind the roasters as a nod to their impact on his career. Some of these included Rodney Harrison, Willie McGinest, Matt Light, and LaVonte David.\n\nThe Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady is currently available to watch on Netflix.\n\nRelated Top 5 New

I'm removing the discomfort from this room. Speaking of discomfort, let's talk about Bill Belichick for a second,\" Hart said to Brady. \"The world knows that you left Bill Belichick high and dry, you left him and then you went to Tampa and won a championship. Holy sh--! Holy sh--! You left Bill Belichick with Mac Jones.\"\n\nThe star-studded roast featured the expected jokes about Brady's ex-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen (as well as her jiu-jitsu instructor turned new boyfriend), Brady's close relationship with Alex Guerrero, and even how much money Brady lost in cryptocurrency and walking away from Bridget Moynahan when she was pregnant with their child, but the real surprise was that Belichick stole the show.\n\nBelichick, not exactly known for his sparkly personality, absolutely crushed it with his jokes -- not only about Brady, but about Rob Gronkowski, and Danny Amendola and the recent Apple TV+ documentary The Dynasty.\n\nIt had been reported in recent days that Belichick would be one of the roasters, but it was still a surprise to see the normally gruff former head coach, who had well-documented differences with Brady at the end of their time together, poke fun at his former QB.\n\nBelichick was introduced by none other than Will Ferrell in character as Ron Burgundy from \"Anchorman.\" The former head coach, notorious for his interaction with the media, took the stage to thunderous applause and wasted no time taking his first crack, saying Burgundy is the only member of the media he respects.\n\nBelichick then took aim at the recent Apple TV+ documentary on the Patriots dynasty that criticized him heavily, painting him as somewhat of the villain in the downfall of Pats historic run.\n\n\"I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix. It's not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10-part Apple TV series,\" Belichick quipped.\n\nHe went on to allude to how he was perceived to be hard on Brady, saying, \"A lot of mean things being said about Tom tonight. Wonder why they invited me?\"\n\n\"Really Tom, why are all these people so hard on you? Do you miss me?\"\n\nHe turned his attention toward Gronkowski next. Belichick, who became associated with the \"Do your job\" mantra, said to the former tight end, \"Gronk, I've been watching you on Fox NFL Sunday and I'm begging you, please, stop doing your job.\"\n\nGronk also spoke during the special event, talking about how much Edelman sucked up to Brady, and comparing the quarterback to avocados. Gronk later took a shot with Edelman, Brady and Belichick, spiking his shot glass onto the stage -- it's possible he didn't think that one through, considering glass appeared to go flying into the first row of the audience.\n\nHart joked on stage afterwards about Gronk's stunt, saying, \"We're live so there's no way to hide the fact that Gronk might be on a little more than alcohol. Yeah, no, it's okay, yeah, no, Gronk we'll get it. Yeah, no we'll clean it up, Gronk. Yeah just sit down when you get a chance bro. Jesus Christ. Just lay down. Just lay down.\"\n\n\"I'm gonna say what everybody else is saying...this is just my truth,\" Hart continued. \"Gronk scares me. He scares me. Gronk is, he's the unsafe white drunk guy.\"\n\nWhen it was his turn, Edelman had some great digs at Belichick, saying his only employment offer came from Foxborough High School, and at Brady, whose \"wife\" is Guerrero -- \"the snake oil salesman who transformed Brady into a weirdo.\"\n\nOther roasters to take the stage Sunday night included Drew Bledsoe, Randy Moss, Ben Affleck, Nikki Glaser, Jeff Ross and Kim Kardashian, who delivered a few jokes and playfully mocked dating rumors involving her and Brady after she was welcomed with audible boos from the crowd.\n\nThere were several crude jokes from Glaser including about B\u00fcndchen's new boyfriend, and Ross had a slew of jokes that could have hit a nerve -- from one about the Boston Marathon bombings to allegations that Brady cheated.\n\n\"Tom, I really wanted you to be our first GOAT to be roasted because you're an example to future generations that if you work hard, eat right, film the other teams' practices, deflate the balls and have the NFL make new rules just for you, then you, too, can be the third most famous guy in a Dunkin' Donuts commercial.\"\n\nBut it was actually a joke about Robert Kraft's massage parlor controversy that really seemed to trigger Brady.\n\n\"Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\" Ross joked.\n\n\"I love Robert Kraft, I....,\" Ross started to say before Brady approached him at the podium and said in his ear, \"Don't say that sh-- again.\"\n\nRoss pointed out that it appeared Kraft was \"having fun\" during the roast and commended him on all he does for the Jewish community before he got back to his bit.\n\nLater, Kraft was on stage himself for some brief comments and a joke or two, saying to Brady, \"Tommy, thank you for having me here for this unique experience. I thought I'd seen it all but this is special. But you know the Patriots are more than a football team for me. They are family. And guys, it's so good to see all of you here again. Thank you so much for everything you did for us.\"\n\nThe Patriots owner also had a joke or two, speaking about Belichick when he said: \"And like many family reunions, there are some people I'm desperately trying to avoid... Coach Belichick, good to see you. You really look debonair in sleeves.\"\n\nAnd to Brady, touching on his long-suspected negative feelings about Jimmy G being drafted so highly by the Pats, Kraft said, \"Tom, good luck buying the Raiders. They did your favorite thing already -- they got rid of Jimmy Garoppolo.\"\n\nKraft raised a glass to Brady, telling him he'd always be special to him before telling Vladimir Putin to give him his ring back.\n\nThings took another strange turn when Hart invited Kraft and Belichick to the stage to take a shot together because they're \"so far apart from each other\" -- and yes, it was as awkward as it sounds.\n\n\"Robert wants to do it. Bill? Let's make the uncomfortable comfortable....Bill, Bill, this is a big moment, Bill,\" Hart said as he tried to encourage Belichick to meet Kraft on stage.\n\nAs he made his way there, Kraft interrupted to say, \"I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done, and having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord game me, so cheers.\"\n\nBelichick, for his part, seemed to have a somewhat pained smile plastered on his face, with no affection shown towards his former employer -- in fact Belichick's arm was around Hart as Kraft spoke, and he didn't down the entire shot.\n\nHart went on to introduce one of his great friends who he called a very special guest and one of the most famous guys from Boston: \"Seriously, one of THE most, I would say there are only about two or three but this guy here in my opinion is the one.\"\n\nBen Affleck then walked out, saying, \"Hi you may know me as an extra from Tom's Dunkin' boy band commercial.\"\n\nThe night ended with the man of the hour at the podium, taking shots at Peyton Manning, who was the last to speak on stage calling Brady a 3x Super Bowl loser, as well as jabs at league commissioner Roger Goodell, and other NFL teams like the Kansas City Chiefs, Indianapolis Colts and Buffalo Bills.\n\n\"Kansas City, you say your stadium is the loudest. It helps when all your fans are 14-year-old girls,\" Brady said referencing the Swifties who are bandwagon Chiefs fans after Taylor Swift started dating Travis Kelce. \"And in honor of Tay Tay, let's take a look at the Chiefs Eras -- terrible for 50 years, good for five. Shake it off!\"\n\n\"Remember Deflategate? The NFL spent $20 million and found that it was more probable than not that I was generally aware that someone may have deflated my footballs. You could have just given me the $20 million and I would have just told you I f-----g did it.\"\n\n\"But I don't wanna get the NFL too upset, I'm trying to buy a piece of the Raiders, I'm tired of owning just the Colts and the Bills.\"\n\nBrady's best shot at Belichick came when he pointed out how he fared without him in his finals years as the Patriots head coach: \"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious -- how many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left?\"\n\nIn the end, it really was like a family reunion Sunday night, as Gronk said. So while Brady may have spent his last three seasons in Tampa Bay, this roast was for Pats fans.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The three-hour roast featured comedians, former teammates, and even his longtime coach, Bill Belichick, who took aim at Brady with a barrage of jokes and one-liners.\n\nThe roast was hosted by comedian Kevin Hart, who set the tone by stating that nothing was off-limits. He wasted no time poking fun at Brady's personal life, including his recent divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen. Hart joked, \"Gisele gave you an ultimatum. She said you retire or we're done. When you got a chance to go 8-9 and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids, you've got to do what you've got to do.\" This jab referred to Brady's brief retirement in 2022 and his subsequent return to play one more season.\n\n80 For Brady - Official Trailer\n\nAlthough Brady laughed off most of the jokes, he had one objection when Jeff Ross made a reference to Patriots owner Robert Kraft and massages. In 2019, Kraft faced a misdemeanor charge related to a Florida massage parlor.\n\nThe roast also featured a reunion between Kraft and Belichick, who did a shot together on stage after some encouragement from Hart. Despite past reports of tension between the Patriots owner and coach, Kraft praised Belichick, saying, \"I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done. And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me.\"\n\nBrady had a few jokes of his own, asking Belichick how many Super Bowl rings he had won since Brady left the Patriots.\n\nKevin Hart said that he felt Brady was in a great mindset for the event and appreciated how he was willing to embrace humor, even if it meant laughing at himself. \"It is a celebration of greatness and we are doing it in a fun way,\" Hart noted.\n\nDrew Bledsoe, who Brady replaced as the Patriots' starting quarterback in 2001, also commended Brady for his courage in participating in the roast. He mentioned that in a locker room, athletes often roast each other, so Brady should be used to it, even if this event was on a larger stage.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Yes, it featured \"outsiders\" as well -- including, among others, host Kevin Hart, ex-NFL QB Peyton Manning, actor Ben Affleck, and comedian Nikki Glaser -- but the main event was Brady and his colleagues.\n\nAnd there were a lot of them besides the future Hall of Famer.\n\nBill Belichick and Robert Kraft participated, as did Drew Bledsoe, Randy Moss, Julian Edelman, and Rob Gronkowski. In addition, Rodney Harrison, Matt Light, Nate Solder, Dan Koppen, Danny Amendola, Willie McGinest and Lonie Paxton also were on stage. Bill O'Brien and Berj Najarian were spotted in the audience.\n\nIn a way, the special was a Patriots dynasty reunion.\n\nIt also had a much more upbeat vibe that the The Dynasty docuseries meant to chronicle the team's unprecedented two-decade run of success. If there was one show meant to bring closure to the dynasty, it was this one rather than the more serious product produced by Apple TV+.\n\nBesides the reunion aspect, here are some of our favorite moments from The Roast of Tom Brady.\n\nAs noted above, former Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning -- whose rivalry with Brady remains one of the best in NFL history -- participated in the event as well. When Brady took the stage for a final rebuttal, though, he made sure not to let his former rival and good friend know about their place in league annals.\n\n\"I know sometimes you live in Denver, and sometimes you live in Louisiana,\" Brady said. \"But you will always live in my shadow.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the show, a brief clip was played that saw Bill Belichick, Drew Bledsoe and Tom Brady showcase their acting skills. Those are nothing to write home about, obviously, but the scene was still a fun reference to Brady overtaking Bledsoe as the Patriots' starter in 2000.\n\nBledsoe did get some jabs in himself when it was his time to roast. He spoke about experiencing two things Brady never will -- being the first overall draft pick and celebrating a 28th wedding anniversary -- and also took a dig at his former coach.\n\n\"At least when I got fired, somebody else wanted me,\" he said, addressing Belichick.\n\nEven before they announced their mutual split in January, there was plenty of chatter about the relationship between Bill Belichick and Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Both men took the stage on Sunday, with Kraft singing the praises of both his long-time coach and his long-time quarterback.\n\nIn fact, the two even did a shot together.\n\nThat was not the only time alcohol was involved. A group of ex-Patriots -- Brady, Belichick, Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski -- did a shot at one point, with Gronkowski spiking the glass on stage. The tight end in general had a wild night between smashing glasses, absorbing some jokes himself, and several references of male genitalia (and more) during his own set.\n\nThe debate about whether Brady or Belichick was more responsible for the Patriots' dynasty -- when the truth instead is that they were in a perfect situation they both actively helped build -- will continue for years to come. At least on Sunday, though, it was part of a playful back-and-forth between the two NFL legends.\n\n\"For all of you out there that think about who's responsible for the Patriots' success during the time Tom and I were there. Was it Brady? Was it me?\" Belichick said. \"Was it Brady? Was it me? In reality, the truth of the matter is it was both of us -- because of me.\"\n\nBrady countered by talking about his superior Super Bowl rings count after leaving New England, followed by an Indy 500 metaphor.\n\n\"Maybe it's not just the guy on the sideline,\" he said. \"When I go to the Indy 500, I don't ask the winning driver, 'Hey, who gassed up your car?'\"\n\nBelichick's set was one of the highlights of the special, showing a side of him few people actually get to experience on a regular. He even mentioned The Dynasty, a show criticized for its storytelling seemingly looking for negativity and controversy.\n\n\"It's an honor to be here at the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix,\" Belichick said. \"It's not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10-part Apple TV series.\"\n\nBrady and the others present were not the only ones to occasionally become the butt of jokes. In fact, a wide variety of people were caught up in the event as well.\n\nThe likes of Mac Jones, Nate Ebner, Jimmy Garoppolo, Aaron Hernandez, and Alex Guerrero were mentioned, too.\n\n\"Tommy, good luck buying the Raiders,\" said Robert Kraft, for example. \"They already did your favorite thing -- get rid of Jimmy Garoppolo.\"\n\nBelichick and Edelman went after Brady's personal trainer Guerrero, who was in attendance as well.\n\n\"It was hard to butt heads with Tom because he was so far up Alex Guerrero's a--,\" Belichick said.\n\n\"In case you didn't know, Alex Guerrero is the snake oil salesman who turned Tom Brady into a f---ing weirdo,\" Edelman noted.\n\nEven English soccer team Birmingham City was mentioned. The club, which has Brady as a minority owner, was recently relegated to the third tier and brought up by Belichick.\n\n\"Not so easy running a team. Is it, Tom?\" he asked.\n\nOther NFL clubs were also brought up, with Brady pointing to two in particular -- the Indianapolis Colts and Buffalo Bills.\n\n\"I don't want to get the NFL too upset. I'm trying to buy a piece of the Raiders,\" he said. \"I'm tired of owning just the Colts and the Bills.\"\n\nFormer Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman can be referred to as a \"Belichick guy\" through and through, which is why he would not let the opportunity go to waste to also come after his former coach when it was his turn to take the podium.\n\n\"I've been waiting for this for so long: look a--hole, Foxboro High's the only job offer you f---ing had,\" Edelman said.\n\nBelichick seemed amused by the joke.\n\nWhile jokes were naturally the preferred method of communication on Sunday, Belichick had one of the best lines of the night when he spoke in a serious voice for a second. Talking about former Patriots safety Rodney Harrison, Belichick said that him not being in the Pro Football Hall of Fame \"might be the biggest joke of the night.\"", "source": {"uri":

Stop being a b****, Jeff, and sit down. Stop kissing his a**. 'Are you OK? It was just jokes?'\"\n\nAmong others to roast the NFL GOAT was Bill Belichick, the New England Patriots head coach who won six Super Bowls alongside Brady - however, at first, he didn't mind poking fun at himself as he took to the podium.\n\n\"It's an honour to be at the Roast of Tom Brady on Netflix tonight. It's not to be confused with the 10-part Bill Belichick roast during the Apple TV documentary,\" Mr Belichick said, referring to Apple TV's The Dynasty documentary that focused on the Patriots' reign under Mr Belichick and Brady that was released earlier this year.\n\nHowever, the coach did eventually turn his attention to Brady, giving him some advice after Birmingham City, the UK football team that Brady minority owns, was relegated from its league.\n\n\"Believe it or not, I've got a lot of nice things to say about Tom, but I'm running out of time here,\" Mr Belichick said during the roast. \"I see your soccer team, Birmingham City, got knocked down another tier in the English Football League.\n\n\"Not so easy running a team is it, Tom? Little coaching advice, stick to American football. You're really good at that.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty_(1981_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dynasty (1981 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patriot (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/6e14a7c7c621fe834d11f4ecc4398c2c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The Roast of Tom Brady remains available on the streaming service.\n\nWhile the majority of the roast featured those celebrities making jabs at Brady, the longtime Patriots quarterback also took time for his own brief monologue. It was then when Brady, who was suspended for four games for his role in deflating footballs during the 2014-15 season, made his admission.\n\n\"Remember Deflategate?\" Brady asked. \"The NFL spent $20 million and found that it was more probable than not that I was generally aware that someone may have deflated my footballs.\n\n\"You could have just given me the $20 million and I would have just told you I [expletive] did it.\"\n\nBrady, who retired in 2023, sat on the stage and took most of the slights in stride. He appeared agitated when comedian Jeff Ross took a shot at Kraft, referencing charges of solicitation he faced in 2019. He was later cleared of those charges.\n\n\"Don't say that [expletive] again,\" Brady said in Ross' ear.\n\nSeveral of Brady's roasters joked about his divorce from Brazilian model Gisele Bundchen, who did not attend. Belichick referenced the long-had debate between sports fans about whether he or Brady deserves more credit for the Patriots' dynasty.\n\n\"For all of you out there that think who's responsible for the Patriots success during the time Tom and I were there,\" Belichick said. \"Was it Brady? Was it me? In reality, the truth of the matter is, it was both of us, because of me.\"\n\nBrady, who was drafted by Belichick in the sixth-round of the 2000 NFL Draft, also referenced the argument, but took another point of view.\n\n\"How many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left? Maybe it's not just the guy on the sideline,\" Brady said. \"When I go to the Indianapolis 500, I don't ask the winning driver: 'Hey, who gassed up your car?'\"\n\nBelichick also took a shot of alcohol with Kraft during the broadcast. The duo announced a parting of ways in January. The split ended their 24-year union, which reportedly turned tumultuous.\n\nBelichick, who failed to land a head coaching job this off-season, was the target of several jokes. Former Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman was among those who issued the jabs.\n\n\"Remember when you used to yell at us, 'Look, [expletives], the [expletive] kids down at Foxboro High can make that [expletive] play,'\" Edelman said. \"Well, look, [expletive], Foxboro High is the only job offer you [expletive] had!\n\n\"Do your job? More like 'need a job,' coach.\"\n\nFerrell made a surprise appearance while portraying Anchorman star Ron Burgundy. He made fun of Brady by bringing up his two Super Bowl losses to former NFL quarterback Eli Manning and the New York Giants. He also triggered an Eli Manning chant from the crowd.\n\n\"I thought about attending the Roast of Tom Brady last night, but I did not want to roast him for a third time,\" Manning wrote Monday on

Brady's decades-long NFL career offered a rich tableau of roastable nuggets - his divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen (and her jujitsu instructor), Spygate, Deflategate, his TB12 diet and relationship with his friend/\"body coach\" Alex Guerrero (\"the snake oil salesman that turned Tom into a complete weirdo,\" as Edelman put it).\n\nBrady's journey from 199th draft pick to Roast City began when he replaced injured New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe in 2001, so it seemed appropriate to let Bledsoe take the first shots. \"A lot of people assume I have a lot of animosity toward Tom Brady,\" he said, \"so I'm here tonight in front of millions of people to tell you -- they're correct.\"\n\nHere's a rundown of some of the best lines (minus most of the profanity):\n\nMoss, who never won a ring with Brady: \"I'll tell you what you deflated: my legacy. I want my ring ... Drew Bledsoe was in the freakin' hospital, and he has a Super Bowl ring. Nate Ebner - who the f--- is Nate Ebner? - he has three Super Bowl rings.\"\n\nGronkowski on Brady and Belichick, noting that both hate fun: \"You both live and breathe football. Neither of you are married anymore. You're both even divorced from football - and both of you take full credit for the dynasty.\"\n\nBelichick: \"Really, Tom, why are all these people so hard on you? Do you miss me?\"\n\nPatriots owner Robert Kraft spoke of Brady's interest in becoming part owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and his reported feelings about a former teammate: \"Tom, good luck buying the Raiders. They did your favorite thing for you already - they got rid of Jimmy Garoppolo.\"\n\nPeyton Manning, calling Brady a three-time Super Bowl loser: \"My [golf] handicap is 6.4, while Tom's handicap is blowing leads in the Super Bowl to my brother, Eli.\"\n\nEli Manning chimed in Monday morning on X: \"I thought about attending the Roast of Tom Brady last night, but I did not want to roast him for a 3rd time!!\"\n\nKraft: \"Vladimir Putin if you're watching, give me my f---ing [Super Bowl XXXIX] ring back.\"\n\nAs roasts do, this one turned into a free-for-all in which no one escaped unscathed, although Brady seemed to tell comedian Jeff Ross to back off the massage jokes concerning Kraft. But if you thought perhaps there would be no cracks about the late Aaron Hernandez and murder or CTE, you were sadly mistaken. And you probably didn't foresee the night's star turn by a smiling, laughing, relaxed ... Belichick, who seemed to enjoy taunts about his inability to find a coaching job since parting with New England in January.\n\nRoss, known as the \"Roastmaster General,\" kicked things off by acknowledging Brady's teammates in the audience, such as Gronkowski. \"Forum is how Rob Gronkowski counts to 5.'' And he continued several times in the show, telling the others, \"please explain that joke to Gronk.\"\n\nMost of the very filthy jokes were about Brady's time with the New England Patriots and his marriage to super model Gisele B\u00fcndchen, with teammate Julian Edelman calling him \"Leonardo DiCaprio's ex-girlfriend's ex-husband.\" And comedian Andrew Schulz told him, \"No matter how big you get, you end up as a twice-divorced supplement salesman in Tampa, Florida.\"\n\nKardashian took the stage to squash rumors she is dating Brady. \"An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair, you remind me too much of my stepdad now,\" Kardashian continued, referencing her mom Kris Jenner's former spouse, Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nThis roast, held during the Netflix is a Joke comedy festival, was the first time in history that a roast has aired live and unedited on television or streaming, according to Netflix.\n\nAmong the top burns:\n\n* \"Tom, I wanted you to be our first G.O.A.T. to be roasted, because you're an example to future generations. If you work hard, eat right, film the other team's practices, deflate the balls and have the NFL make new rules just for you, you too can be the third-most famous guy in a Dunkin' Donuts commercial.\" -- Jeff Ross\n\n* \"Tom Brady. Five-time Super Bowl MVP, most career wins, most career touchdowns. You have seven rings -- well, eight, now that Gisele gave hers back. The only thing dumber than saying yes to this roast was when you said, 'Hey babe, you should try jiu-jitsu.'\" -- Nikki Glaser\n\n* \"When we played together, Tom, you used to scream, 'Laser focus! Laser focus!' Now that's what he screams at his plastic surgeon. Who's laughing now Tom? Not you, because your face can't move and you don't have a sense of humor.\" -- Julian Edelman\n\n* \"Tom is making a donation to every one of his former teammates' charities that came here tonight. And I gotta tell you, Tom, that is first class. Hey fellas, don't let him pay you in crypto.\" -- Peyton Manning\n\n* \"Despite everything we've seen here tonight, Gronk was actually useful on the field. Although the bar for Patriots tight ends was pretty low back then: block, catch, don't murder.\" -- Tom Brady\n\nEdelman also took the opportunity to poke fun at his now-unemployed former coach, Belichick.\n\n\"Remember when you used to yell at us, 'Look, a------, the f---ing kids down at Foxborough High can make that f---ing play!\" Edelman recalled. \"Well ... Foxborough High is the only job offer you have! ... Do your job? More like need a job, coach.\"\n\nBledsoe had a rip for Belichick, too: \"Turns out he has some time on his hands. At least when I got fired, somebody else wanted me.\"\n\nBut Belichick didn't take it sitting down. \"It's an honor to be at the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix tonight,\" he said. \"It's not to be confused with the 10-part Bill Belichick roast during the Apple TV documentary.\" Known for his \"do your job\" mantra to players, he begged Gronk, who now appears on Fox's NFL broadcasts, to \"please stop doing your job.\"\n\nIt felt a little like a Patriots dynasty family reunion for Kraft and, he said, \"like many family reunions, there are some people I'm desperately trying to avoid - Coach Belichick, good to see you. You really look debonair in sleeves.\"\n\nBut the night, and the last words, belonged to Brady or Brady's writers:\n\nAbout those deflated balls: \"The NFL spent $20 million and found that it was more 'probable' than not, that I was 'generally' aware that someone may have deflated my footballs. You could've just given me the 20 mil and I would've just told you I f---ing did it.\"\n\nOn the Peyton Manning rivalry: \"I know sometimes you live in Denver, and sometimes you live in Louisiana. But you will always live in my shadow.\"\n\nOn his interest in being part owner of the Raiders: \"I'm tired of owning just the Colts and the Bills.\"\n\nOn the Chiefs and Taylor Swift: \"Kansas City, you say your stadium is the loudest. It helps when your fans are 14-year-old girls ... in honor of TAY TAY ... Let's take a look at the Chiefs' eras; Terrible for 50 years, good for five. SHAKE IT OFF.\"\n\nAnd to Belichick: \"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious. How many Super Bowls have you won since I left? ... When I go to the Indy 500 I don't ask, 'Hey, who gassed up your car?'\"\n\n(Material from the Tampa Bay Times was used in this report.)", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news",

Everything from his divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Spygate, Deflategate and Brady's relationship with Alex Guerrero were all on the table.\n\n\"Before I got to the New England Patriots, we heard about Spygate. Then after I left, we heard about Deflategate,\" Randy Moss said. \"So I only got one question for you, Tom: 'Why the f -- didn't we cheat when I was there?! I wanted to cheat, too. My kids always ask me, 'Daddy, why does everyone have a ring but you?' You know how hard it is to look your kids in the eyes and say, 'They just don't trust me enough to cheat'?\"\n\nA wide array of former teammates and comedians spent a few hours trading barbs with each other -- but especially Brady.\n\n\"A lot of people assume I have a lot of animosity toward Tom Brady,\" Drew Bledsoe joked. \"So I'm here tonight in front of millions of people to tell you -- they're correct.\"\n\nAnd then, toward the end of the night, Bill Belichick, the uber-serious, seldom-joking former head coach of the Patriots, crushed with a 10-minute set.\n\n\"People have said it -- Tom and I butted heads a lot,\" Belichick said, setting up his joke. \"And in a way that was true. But it was hard to butt heads with Tom -- because he was so far up Alex Guerrero's ass.\"\n\nAt first, Brady sat in good spirits and tried to laugh off the relentless (and often ruthless) jokes -- even if there were some uncomfortable moments. Here are some of the highlights from the roast.\n\nMoss: \"Even though we didn't win it all, I still got everything that I wanted because I got to play with the greatest quarterback that ever lived. And for three years -- it was a short time -- we scared the entire National Football League. Tom, you're still my quarterback -- even though you did not want me to be your accomplice.\"\n\nBledsoe: \"There were rumors that coach (Bill) Belichick was going to be here tonight. Turns out he has some time on his hands. At least when I got fired, somebody else wanted me.\"\n\nBelichick: \"I'm honored to be here at the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix. Not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10-part Apple-TV series.\"\n\nJulian Edelman: \"Alex Guerrero is the snake oil salesman that turned Tom into a complete weirdo.\"\n\nRob Gronkowski on the similarities between Brady and Belichick: \"You're both hard asses that hate fun. You both live and breathe football. Neither of you are married anymore. You're both even divorced from football -- and both of you take full credit for the dynasty.\"\n\nComedian Jeff Ross: \"Tom was drafted 199th in the NFL draft. He sat there for days waiting and waiting and was finally picked in the sixth round when Bill Belichick's dog stepped on the keyboard by accident.\"\n\nNikki Glaser: \"You have seven rings -- well, eight now that Giselle gave hers back.\"\n\nIt wasn't all just laughs. It seemed Brady learned pretty quickly that this wasn't going to be some light-hearted, good-natured ribbing. That started with Kevin Hart's opening monologue which went heavy on jokes about B\u00fcndchen and her reported new boyfriend with a background in jiu-jitsu.\n\nBut the most awkward moment may have been after Ross made a joke about Robert Kraft and massages. Afterward, Brady stood up from his seat and seemed to say to Ross, \"Don't say that s -- again.\"\n\nThe best set of the night probably goes to Glaser, though Belichick's bit was great and hit on everyone from comedians (joking that Hart can't say no to an opportunity) to Danny Amendola's career highlights (that's \"what Randy would call a decent first half\") to, of course, Brady (\"Really, Tom, why are all these people so hard on you? Do you miss me?\" Belichick joked.)\n\nWith Belichick back in the fold, he opened himself up to ribbing, including from Edelman who noted that Belichick for several years used to say in team meetings that players at Foxboro High School could've done what the Patriots messed up.\n\n\"(Now) Foxboro High is the only job offer you have,\" Edelman said. \"... Do your job? More like need a job, coach.\"\n\nWith the rift between Kraft and Belichick well known, the Pats owner figured he'd quickly address it when he got the mic while Belichick was seated next to Edelman on stage.\n\n\"Like many family reunions, there's some people here I'm desperately trying to avoid -- coach Belichick, good to see you,\" Kraft joked.\n\nThen he turned toward Brady's impending purchase of a share of the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\n\"Tom, good luck buying the Raiders,\" he said. \"They did your favorite thing for you already -- they got rid of Jimmy Garoppolo.\"\n\nFinally, at the end of a long night with some brutal jokes, Brady cracked a few jokes of his own while displaying a cocky version of himself fitting of a roast.\n\nHe said that Gronkowski was a great tight for the Patriots -- \"Although the bar for Patriots tight ends was pretty low back then.\" He joked that the NFL could've saved the $20 million they spent on Deflategate \"and I would've just told you I f -- king did it.\" And Brady added that he's trying to buy a share of the Raiders because, \"I'm tired of owning just the Colts and the Bills.\"\n\nAt the end, Brady turned toward Belichick, the coach with whom he's had a turbulent relationship.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chad_graff@theathletic.com", "name": "Chad Graff", "type":

Bill Belichick, Ben Affleck and Kim Kardashian were among the famous roasters and no topic was off-limits -- OK, just one topic -- as Brady heard relentless jokes about his marriage to Gisele B\u00fcndchen, deflategate, his looks and much, much more.\n\nHere are five things you didn't see on TV from inside the Brady roast.\n\nKevin Hart made it clear from the outset that Brady's high-profile divorce from B\u00fcndchen was not going to be off-limits. Aside from Brady's relationship with former coach Bill Belichick, it was one of the topics most roasted.\n\n\"The world knows that you left Bill Belichick high and dry, man... You know who else f***ed that coach? Gisele,\" he said, referring to B\u00fcndchen's reported relationship with their children's jujitsu teacher, Joaquim Valente. \"She f***ed that karate man.\"\n\nBrady took a sip (OK, a lot of sips) out of whatever he was drinking during this particular joke.\n\n\"I mean, Jesus Christ, Tom. One of the smartest quarterbacks ever played a game,\" Hart continued. \"How did you not see this coming? Eight f***ing karate classes a day.\"\n\nThe comedian had some other jabs about Brady's 13-year marriage that ended, but clearly Hart didn't go too far in the quarterback's mind. After Hart introduced Jeff Ross, who kicked things off on Sunday night, Brady leaned over to Hart and gave him a \"no hard feelings\" pat on the back and whispered something in his ear.\n\nThe NSFW Gisele joke that had Brady mouth \"oh my God\" came courtesy of Ross. (\"You really put the j*** in Gisele.\")\n\nSpeaking of Ross, he's the only one who seemingly went too far in Brady's mind -- but it wasn't about the athlete's ex-wife. It was when Ross went after Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\n\"Tom became a Patriot, moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\" Ross said, before turning to Kraft who was in the audience. (In 2019, Kraft was charged in a Florida sting aimed at breaking up prostitution rings at massage parlors.)\n\n\"I love Robert Kraft, I...\" Ross said before Brady got up and whispered something in his ear: \"Never say that shit again.\"\n\nThere was a dedicated camera inside the Kia Forum trained on Brady throughout the roast, and it was clear the seven-time Super Bowl champ thought the massage joke was off-limits. There were multiple teleprompter's set up for roasters, so there's a chance Brady caught a look at where Ross was about to go and didn't like it.\n\nThe boos inside the theater when Kardashian took the stage were even louder than you heard. But it was clear Brady wanted the audience to cool it, as he kept clapping for the reality star when she was up there. Kardashian seemed surprised by the prolonged negative reaction she received when she began her roast but ultimately powered through and won some people over as she poked fun at last year's dating rumors. But the audience was still pretty brutal whenever she was shown onscreen.\n\nWhen Brady took the podium at the end of the night, he had an opportunity to respond to everyone who roasted him, including Kardashian. When the camera flashed to her in the audience, the boos started up once again, but quickly turned to laughs as Brady delivered one of his biggest zingers of the night.\n\n\"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight ... not because of this but because her kids are at home with their dad,\" he said.\n\nFifteen minutes before the show kicked off, comedian Alonzo Bodden got the audience warmed up. He also gave everyone fair warning the content was not going to be PG.\n\n\"At a roast, they are gonna go hard at Tom,\" he explained, telling everyone they were going to hear \"inappropriate shit\" and \"your job is to laugh.\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear none of that cancel culture bullshit,\" he added.\n\nIt's safe to say the audience was up for it -- for all three hours.\n\nThe comedian delivered a perfect roast, as Hart declared, even though she had Brady squirming at moments. Glaser was the first one to go after the quarterback for leaving Bridget Moynahan for B\u00fcndchen.\n\n\"Tom, you're the best to ever play for too long. I mean, you retired, then you came back and then you retired again. I mean, I get it. It's hard to walk away from something that's not your pregnant girlfriend [Bridget Moynahan],\" Glaser said. (Brady kept a somewhat serious look on his face for that one.) \"To be fair, he didn't know she was pregnant.

The comment came as Ross recounted Brady's humble start with the Pats, when he was selected as the 199th draft pick.\n\n\"He sat there for days, waiting and waiting, and then you were finally picked in the sixth round when Bill Belichick's dog stepped on the keyboard by accident,\" Ross quipped during the roast.\n\n\"On the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made,'\" he continued, pausing for the punchline: \"Would you like a massage?\"\n\nRoss' joke was in reference to a 2019 incident in which Kraft was charged with soliciting prostitution in a Florida massage parlor. He was cleared of all charges.\n\nBrady appeared visibly uncomfortable, shifting in his seat after the gag. He then stood up to approach Ross at the podium as the latter blew a kiss toward Kraft, who was seated in the audience.\n\nPlacing a hand up to Ross' ear, Brady could be heard on the hot mic saying, \"Don't say that s**t again.\"\n\nRoss placed his hands up in surrender and replied, \"OK, OK,\" before directing his attention back to the 82-year-old businessman.\n\n\"He's having fun, look at him,\" Ross said of Kraft. \"I love what you do for the Jews, Robert Kraft. You're incredible.\"\n\nCameras then cut to Kraft, who appeared to be smiling in response.\n\nAt the end of his set, Ross and Brady hugged and exchanged pleasantries on stage.\n\nNetflix's The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady went down on Sunday at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, with Kevin Hart hosting. Kraft was among a handful of New England Patriots' alum on hand to support Brady, along with the team's former coach, Bill Belichick, and tight end, Rob Gronkowski.\n\nRoasters tackled a number of hot topics about Brady, including Deflategate and his failed marriage with Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\nJust before the event began, Hart spoke with ET on the red carpet and said that he was approaching the roast with a take-no-prisoners attitude and that nothing was off limits.\n\n\"I'm being mean today,\" Hart, 44, said. \"I'm not nice Kevin today... I'm expecting to lose the relationship with Tom after today. I've already come in with that.\"\n\nThe actor and comedian added, \"Tom knows I love him. He knows all my stuff is coming from a place of fun and good heart, but I do have a job to do. I have a job to do.\"\n\nThe roast also brought out famous faces and friends close to the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers star, including Kim Kardashian -- who was met with boos from the audience -- and Ben Affleck -- who recently starred in a Dunkin' commercial with Brady.\n\nOn the red carpet, the seven-time Super Bowl champion admitted to ET that he was \"not prepared\" for the jokes that were about to come his way -- but with teenagers at home, he has some thick skin.\n\n\"I'm just their dad, so everything I do is lame and, you know, there's nothing I do that's right,\" Brady said with a laugh. \"But it's fun being a dad. I've got some great kids.\"\n\nBrady shares 14-year-old son Benjamin and 11-year-old daughter Vivian with B\u00fcndchen. He's also dad to 16-year-old son Jack, from a previous relationship with Bridget Moynahan.\n\n\"I'm gonna obviously hope they don't tune in tonight because there's gonna be way too many things that are inappropriate,\" Brady added, \"but oh well! They'll learn it somehow.\"\n\nBrady also addressed comments he made last month when he said he \"wouldn't be opposed\" to someday making a comeback and playing in the NFL once more. When asked directly if he ever thought he'd return from retirement, Brady told ET, \"No, man, I'm good. I'm in a great place.\"", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Moynahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridget Moynahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Affleck"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2024-05/GettyImages-2151621338%20%281%29.jpg?h=cf960307", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The former NFL quarterback proved to be a good sport as he was roasted about his divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen, his appearance, his two retirements, \"deflategate\" and his FTX investment scandal, among many other sore topics.\n\nComedian and notorious \"Roastmaster General\" Jeff Ross served as a producer and kicked off the event, quipping that Brady is as an example to future generations that \"if you work hard, eat right, film the other team's practices, deflate the balls and have the NFL make new rules just for you, then you, too, can be the third most famous guy in a Dunkin Donuts commercial.\"\n\nIn a surprise appearance, Kardashian took to the dais to tease Brady about speculation the two briefly dated last year.\n\n\"I'd never say if we did or not, I'd just release the tape,\" she said, referring to many headlines inspired by recorded scenes in her life.\n\nBoston-native and Brady fan Ben Affleck revealed that while the two were filming a Super Bowl spot, Brady asked the actor and director to look at his social media comments.\n\n\"It was the most toxic thing that I have ever experienced - and that's saying something,\" Affleck joked.\n\n\"That doesn't make you a fan,\" he said to Brady's trolls. \"That makes you a b -- .\"\n\nWill Ferrell appeared as his \"Anchorman\" character Ron Burgundy, calling Brady a \"true Patriot until he was not, of course,\" and joking that it took B\u00fcndchen \"13 years to learn what we all know: Tom is boring.\"\n\nBrady and B\u00fcndchen's divorce was fodder for many bits throughout the night, with Brady frequently shown sipping his beverage whenever it was mentioned. The former couple jointly announced in October 2022 that they were parting ways.\n\nRob Gronkwoski, Julian Edelman, Randy Moss and Drew Bledsoe, who all played with Brady throughout his career, and former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick took turns roasting the MVP. Peyton Manning and Patriots owner Robert Kraft also appeared.\n\nGronkowski talked about how \"psyched\" he was to have both Brady and Belichick together, saying, \"everyone thinks you guys hate each other but I saw it firsthand, you two are exactly alike. You're both hardasses that hate fun.\"\n\nComedians Bert Kreischer, Tom Segura, Nikki Glaser, Andrew Schulz, Tony Hinchcliffe and Sam Jay had fun taking their shots, with Glaser joking that Brady was \"the best to ever play for too long.\"\n\nBrady may have seen certain defeat on Sunday but his decades-long NFL career is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nOver the course of his 23-years as the league's leading quarterback, Brady won seven Super Rings - six with the Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He is also a five-time Super Bowl MVP and won three NFL MVP awards.\n\nHe first announced his retirement in February 2022. He ended up reversing his decision and returned to the field for one more season with the Buccs before officially retiring last year.\n\nAt the end of the roast, Brady finally had the chance to defend himself, saying that people had asked him why he agreed to do the event.\n\n\"It's simple,\" Brady said. \"I can take all the hits.

What's even more surprising is that it wasn't one of the vicious barbs made about Brady personally, his ex-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen or his family that raised his ire -- it was a joke about Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nIt did happen to come from the most savagely infamous roaster of the modern era, Jeff Ross, also known as the Roastmaster General for his many epic takedowns in previous roasts. But nonetheless it was rather stunning that this was the moment Brady felt crossed the line.\n\nFor those who missed it, the most viral clip of Netflix's first of its kind special, The Greatest Roast Of All Time: Tom Brady, centered on Brady getting up from the roastee chair in the middle of Jeff Ross' set to tell him \"Don't say that sh- again.\" Ross nervously laughed it off and said \"Ok, ok...\" before continuing gamely with his roast.\n\nSo what was the joke that caused Brady so much offense on Kraft's behalf? Possibly the easiest of targets from the numerous New England Patriots scandals over the years -- a reference to Robert Kraft's 2019 arrest as part of a prostitution ring in Florida in which he was captured on video paying for sex acts at a day spa.\n\nRoss had an elaborate build up to the joke, talking about Tom Brady confidently strolling into Robert Kraft's office after he was drafted in the sixth round, and telling the powerful businessman and New England Patriots owner, \"I'm the best decision your organization has ever made...\" to the applause of numerous Boston sports fans in attendance. Ross then added, \"Would you like a massage?\" Big audience laughs ensued, except for Brady, who shifted uncomfortably in his seat as he clearly debated whether or not to step in and say something.\n\nWhen Ross' next words after the laughter died down were \"I love Robert Kraft -\" Brady could take it no longer and quickly hopped up to the podium to tell Ross \"Don't say that sh- again,\" which was rather awkwardly picked up by the microphones for all to hear.\n\nWas this the best instant Brady meme since \"You mad bro?\"\n\nThis was instantly the best Brady sure-to-be-meme since his post-game \"You mad bro?\" run-in with Richard Sherman.\n\nThe question is -- why? Why was a joke about his former boss the thing that got under Brady's skin, when so many other cruel things were said about Tom Brady and his family over the course of the evening?\n\nThat's the million dollar question yet to be answered.\n\nBrady sat there patiently enduring vicious slams and references galore to his ex wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, and her new jiu-jitsu trainer beau, his past cheating scandals on the Patriots, being an absentee father, his pretty boy superficiality, his falling for a crypto investing fraud scheme, and numerous other biting jabs that might have set off even the most saintly of souls. But head scratchingly (and kind of hearteningly), it was his defense of Robert Kraft that was the one thing that made Tom Brady leave his seat in anger.\n\nMaybe Brady sees Kraft as a grandfather figure and didn't want the old man to get his feelings hurt. Maybe Brady assured Kraft that he wouldn't be subject to the roasters' material and Brady didn't want Kraft to view him as a liar (though that didn't seem to bother Brady during the deflategate scandal).\n\nWhatever the reasoning, Tom Brady felt the need so strongly to defend his former boss Robert Kraft that, for a moment, he broke with roast tradition and etiquette to tell revered roaster Jeff Ross not to \"say that sh- again.\" It was a rather shocking blip on an otherwise freewheeling and fun night. And perhaps if Brady doesn't want Kraft subjected to such jesting in the future, he should tell his wealthy friend to stay away from massage parlors (or at least live public roasts).", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_silverstein@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Josh Silverstein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Sherman_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Sherman (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage_parlor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massage parlor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujutsu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jujutsu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infidelity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athletic trainer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Medical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Medical", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Why-was-Robert-Kraft-joke-the-one-thing-Tom-Brady-couldnt-handle-at-Netflix-roast.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Football\" - Tom Brady's Response To His Own Roast Was Worthy Of GOAT Status", "body": "Ladies and gentlemen... roasts are officially BACK.\n\nThe art of the roast has long been a part of comedy, but it went away for a while only to come storming back. Kind of like when Tom Brady retired, right? And ironically enough, Brady was the center of the live Netflix event \"The Greatest Roast of All Time,\" and it did not disappoint to say the least.\n\nWithout a doubt, it's the most shots that Tom Brady has taken in his entire storied career. Everyone from Kevin Hart to Peyton Manning (and even his own former coach Bill Belichick) took to the podium to tell Tom how they really felt. It was surely somewhat of a rough night for Brady, though he did agree to do it, and there was still plenty of praise for the seven-time Super Bowl winning QB during the roast.\n\nThere were plenty of highlights from the night, whether it was Tom trying to shut down a massage parlor joke early on to former New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman making an unhinged joke about the late Aaron Hernandez. Nothing was off the table during the roast, and it was truly one of the better comedy events that I can remember.\n\nAnd it definitely became memorable when, at the end of the night, Tom Brady got to answer to all of the roasting he had to sit and take for three hours. For those that categorize Brady as lifeless and stiff when it comes to his personality, the NFL great proved people wrong with his own roasting monologue.\n\nHe first got things started with a killer (no pun intended) joke about Patriots tight ends:\n\nThat let people know he wasn't messing around.\n\nTom continued with one of his more bold jokes of the night: Poking the bear that is the \"Swifty\" community. Everyone knows you stay away from Taylor Swift and her fans, but Brady decided to dive right in with this joke about Swift and the Kansas City Chiefs:\n\nLooks like Swifties have a new public enemy number one.\n\nAnd in what could be the most shocking part of Brady's roast response, he seemingly admitted to Deflategate? It was a wild moment, and it garnered a standing ovation from the Kia Forum in Los Angeles, California. Even Bill Belichick stood up when Tom went scorched Earth on the NFL:\n\nObviously, a lot of the jokes through the night targets Tom's good looks (wow, how difficult that must have been), his failed crypto currency investments, and his ex-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen. Brady pulled a fast one on everybody watching when he started out another of his jokes with this line:\n\n\"There have been a lot of jokes tonight, but I miss the love of my life...football.\"\n\nTom still has that quick release, I see.\n\nAnd before he wrapped things up, Tom even put his former head coach Bill Belichick in the crosshairs. Brady referenced a very \"chronically online\" meme that popped up in the past year, which was a Ring doorbell video that appeared to show Belichick doing a walk of shame:\n\nIt was a really fun night, and Tom Brady handled it with a lot of class... and a lot of nervous laughter. But when it came time for him to answer to everyone else, he did what Tom Brady does and proved that he's one of the best. His double bird exit off the stage paired with a parting shot to all of the haters was pretty tasteful as well:", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Hernandez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Hernandez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Tom-Brady-7.png?fit=1009%2C582&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The Greatest Roast Of All Time: Tom Brady.\"\n\nUnlike many other televised roasts, Brady's roast was live and ran for more than three hours, giving the roasters plenty of time to throw quips at the former quarterback.\n\nSeveral notable names in the football and entertainment worlds made appearances on Sunday as well. Bill Belichick and former New England Patriots players, such as Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman, Randy Moss and Drew Bledsoe, were on one side of the dais. On the other side, comedians Jeff Ross, Nikki Glaser and Sam Jay were among those to make jokes at Brady's expense. There were also multiple special appearances, such as Will Ferrell as \"Anchorman\" character Ron Burgundy, Peyton Manning and with Kevin Hart serving as the roast master.\n\nLet's take a look at some of the best moments from Sunday's event.\n\nThe show opened in a similar fashion as Brady's career did. In a pre-taped segment, Belichick pulled Bledsoe aside and let Brady take center stage.\n\n\"It's great seeing you again,\" Belichick said. \"This is a big night. The fans want you. Everyone wants you. But it's not your night. Sorry, Drew.\n\n\"Brady ... You're in, let's go!\"\n\nBledsoe was the first former Patriots player to take the mic, firing off a joke at Belichick's employment status after the show opening.\n\n\"There were rumors Coach Belichick was gonna be here tonight,\" Bledsoe quipped. \"Turns out he has some time on his hands. Look, at least when I was fired somebody else wanted me.\"\n\nEdelman also made a jab at Belichick's inability to land a head coaching gig this offseason.\n\n\"Remember when you used to yell at us, 'Look ---holes, the ----ing kids at Foxborough High can make that ----ing play,'\" Edelman said. \"I've been waiting for this for so long: Look ---hole, Foxborough High is the only job offer you ----ing had.\n\n\"Do your job? More like, need a job, coach.\"\n\nEdelman's joke got a hearty laugh out of Belichick and some claps.\n\nPatriots owner Robert Kraft also made jokes on Sunday night even though he wasn't on the dais, taking the mic while in the audience. One of his jokes centered on the possible awkwardness between him and the former head coach of his football team.\n\n\"Like many family reunions, there's some people I'm desperately trying to avoid,\" Kraft said. \"Coach Belichick, good to see you. You really look debonair in sleeves.\"\n\nArguably the most memorable part of the roast didn't involve Brady at all. Shortly after Kraft made a handful of jokes, Hart called the Patriots owner to come up to the dais and take a shot with Belichick. While it looked awkward, the two eventually took a shot together, but not before Kraft shared a message.\n\n\"I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done,\" Kraft said. \"And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me.\"\n\nBelichick and Kraft mutually agreed to end their working relationship after 24 seasons in January. While Belichick's tenure with the Patriots is arguably the best ever for a coach in NFL history with six Super Bowl titles, Kraft recommended the Atlanta Falcons not to hire his former head coach this offseason, according to a report from ESPN in April.\n\nThe former Patriots coach had jokes for nearly everyone involved in the roast, expressing how happy he was that he wasn't the center subject of the event.\n\n\"It's an honor to be here at the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix,\" Belichick said. \"It's not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10-part Apple TV series.\"\n\nBelichick also roasted former players.\n\n\"A lot of people connect me to the saying, 'Do your job,' and telling people to do their job,\" Belichick said. \"Gronk, I've been watching you on FOX NFL Sunday, and I'm begging you: Stop doing your job. Do another job. Do somebody else's job!\"\n\nHis roast of Gronkowski didn't end there.\n\n\"Rob landed some endorsement deals with some of his favorite foods,\" Belichick said. \"Campbell's soup, Dunkin Donuts, and don't forget Tide Pods. One-hundred percent true story: I used Rob's Tide Pod commercial to teach our team that this is when you say no. Just because somebody asks you to do something stupid, you don't have to do it. Say no!\"\n\nBelichick also took aim at a few other former Patriots players, including Danny Amendola.\n\n\"Danny Amendola up here on the stage, he came with us,\" Belichick said. \"Danny joined us in 2014 and got us 200 yards that year. Then in 2016, he picked up another 250. Or to put it another way, what Randy [Moss] would call a decent first half.\"\n\nBelichick also roasted the roast master.\n\n\"Whenever Kevin talks I go into a Cover 2 defense: Cover both ears.\"\n\nThe coach also made a self-deprecating joke about his demeanor.\n\n\"The fellas invited me up here to lighten the mood tonight.\"\n\nBelichick gave his take on who was more responsible for the Patriots' dynasty on Sunday.\n\n\"For all of you out there that think about who's responsible for the Patriots' success during the time when Tom and I were there, was it Brady? Was it me? Was it Brady? Was it me? In reality, the truth of the matter is, it was both of us -- because of me.\"\n\nBrady made sure to point out, though, that he won a Super Bowl after leaving the Patriots in 2020.\n\n\"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious, how many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left?\" Brady said, looking toward Belichick. \"Maybe it's not just the guy on the sideline. When I go to the Indy 500, I don't ask the winning driver, 'Hey, who gassed up your car?'\"\n\nThe rivalry between Brady and Manning went from the gridiron to the dais on Sunday, with each tossing a few jokes at each other.\n\n\"Honestly, it is great to be here with a bunch of people sitting around talking smack about Tom Brady,\" Manning said in one joke about Brady. \"Or as we call that in the Manning family: Thanksgiving.\"\n\n\"For those who don't know, Coach [Belichick is going to do some work on Eli [Manning] and my Monday Night Football show this year,\" Belichick added in another. \"Eli and I are super excited, and it's going to give Coach Belichick something he hasn't had in awhile: The chance to be around quarterbacks he respects.\"\n\nBrady's jokes at Manning focused on how the Hall of Fame quarterback typically played second fiddle to him.\n\n\"I know sometimes you live in Denver, and sometimes you live in Louisiana,\" Brady said in one joke. \"But you will always live in my shadow.\"\n\nHart opened the night by joking that Joe Montana was really the \"GOAT\" while Bledsoe made a pair of cracks at Brady's demeanor toward speaking with referees.\n\nMoss, meanwhile, was more upset that he wasn't able to win a ring with Brady during their time together in New England.\n\n\"Why the ---- didn't we cheat when I was there?\" Moss jokingly asked.\n\nEdelman made a crack at Brady's look.\n\n\"When we played together, Tom, you used to scream, 'Laser focus! Laser focus!' Now that's what he screams at his plastic surgeon,\" Edelman said. \"Who's laughing now Tom? Not you, because your face can't move and you don't have a sense of humor.\"\n\nGronkowski also made jokes about Brady, but celebrated afterward by getting Belichick and the former quarterback to take a shot with him. Of course, Gronkowski spiked his shot glass after.\n\nKraft made a joke about Brady's impending deal to become a part owner of the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\n\"Tommy, good luck buying the Raiders,\" Kraft said. \"They already did your favorite thing -- get rid of Jimmy Garoppolo.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Which celebrities would show up to roast the G.O.A.T.? Would the panel of assembled comedians treat Brady with kid gloves, or would they unleash every weapon in their arsenal? And which of Brady's former teammates would actually be funny?\n\nAs it turns out, \"G.R.O.A.T. The Greatest Roast Of All Time: Tom Brady\" was a surprisingly profane, no-holds-barred roast featuring one-liners that would get most people fired from their jobs.\n\nClocking in at just over three hours, the roast was filled to the brim with jokes about Brady, his divorce, his ex-wife's new romance, his vanity, his awful business decisions, his complex relationship with Bill Belichick, and so much more.\n\nThe evening called to mind the ill-fated 2017 roast of David Ortiz, which was filmed at the House of Blues and was supposed to be televised on NESN but never aired -- likely because the material was deemed too inappropriate for basic cable.\n\nBut Netflix is not basic cable, which means viewers were treated to some truly outrageous moments, including:\n\n-- Julian Edelman talking in graphic detail about deflating Tom Brady's balls\n\n-- Rob Gronkowski setting a new record for genitalia jokes per minute\n\n-- Brady comparing Drew Bledsoe's injury to 9/11\n\n-- Nearly every roaster making an Aaron Hernandez joke, including several of his former teammates\n\n-- Will Ferrell, in character as Ron Burgundy from \"Anchorman,\" leading the crowd in a chant about Brady being Eli Manning's b****\n\n-- Brady, Belichick, and Robert Kraft taking a shot together (though Belichick looked considerably less happy than he did for much of the night)\n\nFollowing roast host Kevin Hart, who opened the ceremonies and kept things light throughout the evening with his cheerful frequent refrain of \"f*** you Tom,\" more than a dozen comedians, celebrities, and Patriots greats stood at the dais and took the G.O.A.T. to the woodshed.\n\nSome of the roasters were in top form, particularly comedians Nikki Glaser, Jeff Ross, and Boston native Sam Jay.\n\nOf the athletes who participated, Edelman, Bledsoe, and Peyton Manning probably acquitted themselves best. Others, like Randy Moss, didn't quite have the roast cadence down pat.\n\nOne of the bigger disappointments of the night was Ben Affleck. The Cambridge native seemed unclear on the fact that roasts are supposed to zing the people in the room, instead spending his five minutes ripping a faceless (and seemingly apocryphal) online commenter. Even Kim Kardashian, who was booed by many in the room when she initially took the stage, fired off more actual jokes than Affleck.\n\nThe most pleasant surprise of the night was undoubtedly Belichick. The famously dour coach not only delivered withering one-liners with a wry smile, but even addressed the Apple TV+ \"The Dynasty\" series, which many saw as an attack on his reputation. Not to be outdone, Robert Kraft fired off a few jokes from the audience, addressing the tension.\n\nFor all of its chaotic energy, the Netflix roast of Tom Brady is absolutely worth watching, and is already available streaming on Netflix for those who missed it.\n\nBut if you're stuck at work and aren't able to watch some of the more off-color bits, here are 19 of the best jokes from the Tom Brady roast that our editor will let us publish.\n\n\"Gisele gave you an ultimatum. Gisele said, 'You retire or we're done.' [...] Lemme tell you something: When you got a chance to go 8-9 and all it'll cost you is your wife and kids, you gotta do what the f*** you gotta do.\" -- Kevin Hart\n\n\"Give it up for the Lord of the Super Bowl Rings, my friend Tom Brady. A man who has so many rings he could melt them down and forge a sword to go on a quest to get Gisele back from that jiu-jitsu teacher.\" -- Jeff Ross\n\n\"Tom Brady. Five-time Super Bowl MVP, most career wins, most career touchdowns. You have seven rings -- well, eight, now that Gisele gave hers back. The only thing dumber than saying yes to this roast was when you said, 'Hey babe, you should try jiu-jitsu.'\" -- Nikki Glaser\n\n\"There's been a lot of jokes tonight, but the truth is I miss the love of my life -- football.\" -- Tom Brady\n\nTom, I wanted you to be our first G.O.A.T. to be roasted, because you're an example to future generations. if you work hard, eat right, film the other team's practices, deflate the balls and have the NFL make new rules just for you, you too can be the third-most famous guy in a Dunkin Donuts commercial.\" -- Jeff Ross\n\n\"I started a winery. It's called Doubleback. It's named after what Tom does every time he walks past a mirror.\" -- Drew Bledsoe\n\n\"You retired, then you came back, and then you retired again. I mean I get it, it's hard to walk away from something that's not your pregnant girlfriend.\" -- Nikki Glaser\n\n\"When we played together, Tom, you used to scream, 'Laser focus! Laser focus!' Now that's what he screams at his plastic surgeon. Who's laughing now Tom? Not you, because your face can't move and you don't have a sense of humor.\" -- Julian Edelman\n\n\"People said that Tom and I butted heads a lot. In a way that was true, but not really. It was hard to butt heads with Tom because his was so far up Alex Guerrero's a**.\" -- Bill Belichick\n\n\"Tom is making a donation to every one of his former teammates' charities that came here tonight. And I gotta tell you, Tom, that is first class. Hey fellas, don't let him pay you in crypto.\" -- Peyton Manning\n\n\"The fellas invited me up here to lighten the mood tonight.\" -- Bill Belichick\n\n\"I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix. That's not to be confused with The Roast of Bill Belichick, the ten-part Apple TV series.\" -- Bill Belichick\n\n\"A lot of people connect me to the saying, \"Do your job,' and telling people to do their job. Gronk, I've been watching you on FOX NFL Sunday, and I'm begging you: Stop doing your job. Do another job. Do somebody else's job!\" -- Bill Belichick\n\nFor those who don't know, Coach is going to do some work on Eli and my Monday Night Football show this year. [...] Eli and I are super excited, and it's going to give Coach Belichick something he hasn't had in awhile: The chance to be around quarterbacks he respects.\" -- Peyton Manning\n\n\"Like many family reunions, there's some people I'm desperately trying to avoid. Coach Belichick, good to see you. You really look debonair in sleeves.\" -- Robert Kraft\n\n\"Tom brought Boston with him tonight. Goddamn. I've never seen Inglewood so white. It's so f****** white in here. It looks like a Bruce Springsteen concert just let out.\" -- Kevin Hart\n\n\"This is pretty f****** ballsy of you. Is life too f****** good? You're like, you know what, I want somebody to kick my a** for three hours. This settles it: You won't see me volunteering for the Ben Affleck Roast. Or as I like to call it, Thursday.\" -- Ben Affleck\n\n\"Despite everything we've seen here tonight, Gronk was actually useful on the field. Although the bar for Patriots tight ends was pretty low back then: Block, catch, don't murder.\" -- Tom Brady\n\n\"People ask, 'Tom, why would you do this roast now?' It's simple: I can take the hits. I would've done this earlier, but I've just been too busy winning championships. Which explains why Peyton did this roast 8 years ago.\" -- Tom Brady", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_slane@boston.com", "name":

The former NFL quarterback showed that he was a good sport when he was ridiculed for a variety of sensitive subjects, including his appearance, his two retirements, his divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen, \"deflategate,\" and his FTX investment controversy.\n\nAs the event's producer and comedian, Jeff Ross -- better known as the \"Roastmaster General\" -- kicked things off by saying that Brady should serve as an example to future generations of how, \"you too can be the third most famous guy in a Dunkin Donuts commercial if you work hard, eat right, film the other team's practices, deflate the balls, and have the NFL make new rules just for you.\"\n\nKardashian made an unexpected appearance on the dais and teased Brady about rumours that the two had a brief relationship last year.\n\nShe made reference to several headlines that were based on clips from her life, saying, \"I'd never say if we did or not, I'd just release the tape.\"\n\nBen Affleck, a Boston native and supporter of Brady, disclosed that during the Super Bowl production, Brady urged the director and actor to have a look at his remarks on social media.\n\n\"It was the most toxic thing that I have ever experienced - and that's saying something,\" Affleck joked.\n\n\"That doesn't make you a fan,\" he said to Brady's trolls. \"That makes you a b -- .\"\n\nWill Ferrell appeared as his \"Anchorman\" character Ron Burgundy, calling Brady a \"true Patriot until he was not, of course,\" and joking that it took B\u00fcndchen \"13 years to learn what we all know: Tom is boring.\"\n\nThroughout the evening, several jokes made reference to Brady and B\u00fcndchen's divorce, with Brady regularly seen drinking his drink. Together, the former couple declared their separation in October 2022.\n\nFormer New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, along with teammates Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman, Randy Moss, and Drew Bledsoe, took turns making fun of the MVP. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Patriots, and Peyton Manning were also present.\n\nSpeaking on how \"psyched\" he was to having Brady and Belichick together, Gronkowski remarked, \"I witnessed firsthand how much you two are same, despite everyone's perceptions to the contrary. Both of you are jerks who detest having fun.\n\nComedians Nikki Glaser, Andrew Schulz, Tony Hinchcliffe, Tom Segura, Bert Kreischer, and Sam Jay enjoyed themselves while delivering their skits. Glaser made a joke about Brady being \"the best to ever play for too long.\"\n\nBrady's NFL career has been nothing short of extraordinary, despite the fact that he saw inevitable defeat on Sunday.\n\nBrady was the top quarterback in the NFL for 23 years, during which time he won seven Super Rings: six with the Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Bucs. Moreover, he has won five Super Bowl MVP and won three NFL MVP awards.\n\nHe first announced his retirement in February 2022. He ended up reversing his decision and returned to the field for one more season with the Buccs before officially retiring last year.\n\nAt the end of the roast, Brady finally had the chance to defend himself, saying that people had asked him why he agreed to do the event.\n\n\"It's simple,\" Brady said. \"I can take all the hits. I would have done this earlier but I've been too busy winning championships.\"", "source": {"uri": "opinionnigeria.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Opinion Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The former NFL quarterback proved to be a good sport as he was roasted about his divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen, his appearance, his two retirements, \"deflategate\" and his FTX investment scandal, among many other sore topics.\n\nComedian and notorious \"Roastmaster General\" Jeff Ross served as a producer and kicked off the event, quipping that Brady is as an example to future generations that \"if you work hard, eat right, film the other team's practices, deflate the balls and have the NFL make new rules just for you, then you, too, can be the third most famous guy in a Dunkin Donuts commercial.\"\n\nIn a surprise appearance, Kardashian took to the dais to tease Brady about speculation the two briefly dated last year.\n\n\"I'd never say if we did or not, I'd just release the tape,\" she said, referring to many headlines inspired by recorded scenes in her life.\n\nBoston-native and Brady fan Ben Affleck revealed that while the two were filming a Super Bowl spot, Brady asked the actor and director to look at his social media comments.\n\n\"It was the most toxic thing that I have ever experienced - and that's saying something,\" Affleck joked.\n\n\"That doesn't make you a fan,\" he said to Brady's trolls. \"That makes you a b -- .\"\n\nWill Ferrell appeared as his \"Anchorman\" character Ron Burgundy, calling Brady a \"true Patriot until he was not, of course,\" and joking that it took B\u00fcndchen \"13 years to learn what we all know: Tom is boring.\"\n\nBrady and B\u00fcndchen's divorce was fodder for many bits throughout the night, with Brady frequently shown sipping his beverage whenever it was mentioned. The former couple jointly announced in October 2022 that they were parting ways.\n\nRob Gronkwoski, Julian Edelman, Randy Moss and Drew Bledsoe, who all played with Brady throughout his career, and former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick took turns roasting the MVP. Peyton Manning and Patriots owner Robert Kraft also appeared.\n\nGronkowski talked about how \"psyched\" he was to have both Brady and Belichick together, saying, \"everyone thinks you guys hate each other but I saw it firsthand, you two are exactly alike. You're both hardasses that hate fun.\"\n\nComedians Bert Kreischer, Tom Segura, Nikki Glaser, Andrew Schulz, Tony Hinchcliffe and Sam Jay had fun taking their shots, with Glaser joking that Brady was \"the best to ever play for too long.\"\n\nBrady may have seen certain defeat on Sunday but his decades-long NFL career is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nOver the course of his 23-years as the league's leading quarterback, Brady won seven Super Rings - six with the Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He is also a five-time Super Bowl MVP and won three NFL MVP awards.\n\nHe first announced his retirement in February 2022. He ended up reversing his decision and returned to the field for one more season with the Buccs before officially retiring last year.\n\nAt the end of the roast, Brady finally had the chance to defend himself, saying that people had asked him why he agreed to do the event.\n\n\"It's simple,\" Brady said. \"I can take all the hits. I would have done this earlier but I've been too busy winning championships.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN. All Rights Reserved.

For instance, his divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen was a frequent subject of ridicule -- Kevin Hart and Nikki Glaser went particularly hard -- \"You have seven rings -- well, eight now that Giselle gave hers back,\" or \"the only thing dumber than you saying yes to this roast was saying yes to Gisele doing jiu-jitsu,\" a reference to the jiu-jitsu instructor with whom B\u00fcndchen is in a relationship. Even Drew Bledsoe, the quarterback Tom Brady replaced back in 2001, went there, joking, \"I have experienced a couple of things that you will never experience. The feeling of being the number one overall draft pick in the NFL and a 28th wedding anniversary.\"\n\nNikki Glaser even went where I suspect even Brady's closest friends would never go: His ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan, who was pregnant with Brady's child when he left her for B\u00fcndchen. \"Tom, you're the best to ever play for too long. You retired, then came back, then retired; I get it. It's hard to walk away from something that isn't your pregnant girlfriend. To be fair, he didn't know; he just thought she was getting fat.\"\n\nIn addition to jokes at the expense of Brady's divorce, there were a number of jokes made about former Patriot Aaron Hernandez, who hung himself in prison after being convicted of murder. \"Everyone always asks me how big [Rob Gronkowski's] dick is,\" Julian Edelman joked. \"Now don't get me wrong, it gets the job done. But there was this other Patriots tight end. Now he was hung.\"\n\nAmong others making appearances as roasters was Will Ferrell -- as his Anchorman character, Ron Burgundy -- who led the crowd into a chant of, \"Tom Brady is Eli Manning's bitch,\" and Brady's former coach, Bill Belichick, who delivered one of the colder jokes of the night. \"People have said it -- Tom and I butted heads a lot. And in a way that was true. But it was hard to butt heads with Tom -- because he was so far up Alex Guerrero's ass,\" he joked, referencing Brady's athletic trainer who turned him onto his bizarre diet. Belichick, famously, at one point had Guerrero banned from the locker room because of the negative influence he felt that the trainer was having on Brady, or as Edelman put it: \"Alex Guerrero is the snake oil salesman that turned Tom into a complete weirdo.\" (Guerrero was in the audience).\n\nRandy Moss took aim at the two scandals that plagued Brady and the Patriots dynasty, Spygate and Deflategate, which came before Moss arrived and after he departed, during a three-year period in which the Pats did not win a Super Bowl ring. \"I only got one question for you, Tom: 'Why the fuck didn't we cheat when I was there?! I wanted to cheat, too.\"\n\nBrady's friend, actor Ben Affleck, also appeared, though he did very little roasting of Brady, opting instead to defend him in what is being characterized as something of a manic speech that ended with Affleck mimicking the oral sex he would give Brady if he were lucky enough to be his coach. Peyton Manning was the last speaker, and while his jokes were successful, he did not hit below the belt, opting mostly to stick to football.\n\nAs is often the case with roasts, which have fallen out of fashion in recent years, there were also some dark jokes, such as when Julian Edelman joked about what he had in common with Jeff Ross: being Jewish. \"When people look at me, they think, 'Oh, he's Jewish?' But Jeff is the kind of Jew that makes you want to join Hamas.\" Brady also made a 9/11 joke at the expense of Drew Bledsoe, whose job Brady took after Bledsoe was badly injured during a game with the New York Jets. \"I'll always remember where I was on that fateful day in September 2001 when two Jets slammed into Drew Bledsoe.\"\n\nThe ceremony ultimately ended with Brady taking the dais to insult all those who came before him. Brady, who has never exhibited much of a sense of humor, delivered his insults with a mix of arrogance and cringe, essentially claiming to be immune from their jokes because he has been so successful in his career.\n\n\"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious,\" Brady said, turning to Belichick, \"how many Super Bowls have you won since I left? ... When I go to the Indy 500, I don't ask, 'Hey, who gassed up your car.'\" In a joke that's not likely to sit well with the NFL, Brady also joked that the league spent $20 million to investigate Deflategate, saying they could have saved the $20 million and given it to him \"and I would've just told you I fucking did it.\"\n\nThe roast's success, largely due to a few standout comedians such as Glaser and Sam Jay (but notably not Jeff Ross or Burt Kreischer), may prove difficult for Netflix to replicate in future attempts. Tom Brady was an ideal subject for roasting, given his long history of scandal and controversy that he has never publicly addressed in an honest manner. This dynamic created moments of uncomfortable viewing, which often contributes to the most successful aspects of roasts. It is difficult to envision another celebrity of Tom Brady's stature allowing their personal lives to be subjected to such vicious scrutiny. The caliber of stars roasted on Comedy Central for 14 seasons, primarily washed-up celebrities like Charlie Sheen and Roseanne Barr who presented as overly easy targets, would likely fail to attract a comparable audience or interest, which may mean the title of Brady's Roast may ultimately be befitting for Netflix: The Greatest Roast of All Time.

The actor and comedian didn't hold back, taking jabs at Brady's career and his well-publicised split from Gisele Bundchen.\n\nHowever, it was Jeff Ross who took things up a notch. One particular joke seemed to hit a nerve with Brady, prompting the ex-New England Patriots quarterback to stand up and warn Ross not to repeat it. The joke revolved around Brady's arrival at the Patriots in 2000.\n\nREAD MORE: New York Jets' NFL Draft pick makes bold Aaron Rodgers prediction after joining team\n\nREAD MORE: SNL presenter sends apology to Taylor Swift over sharing bed with Kansas City Chiefs' Travis Kelce\n\nRoss, discussing Brady's draft where he was famously picked at 199th, quipped: \"So, Tom became a Patriot, moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp the scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said 'I'm the best decision your organisation has ever made...would you like a massage?'.\"\n\nBrady, breaking his silence, stood up and confronted Ross, warning: \"Don't say that ---- again. \" Ross immediately raised his hands in surrender and responded: \"OK, OK.\" He then added: \"He's [Kraft] having fun, look at him.\"\n\nKraft was indeed present at the Los Angeles Forum, taking the joke in stride. The evening wrapped up on a positive note with Ross and Brady hugging it out after his section, which Hart playfully mocked.\n\nTom Brady's Netflix Roast didn't hold back\n\nThe Patriots' legacy was well represented; Bill Belichick also attended and even joined in the fun, humorously 'benching' Drew Bledsoe in a skit. Belichick quipped to Bledsoe during the act, \"It's great seeing you again. This is a big night. The fans want you. Everyone wants you. But it's not your night. Sorry Drew. Brady, you're in!\"\n\nThe sketch paid homage to Brady's rise over Bledsoe as the Patriots' quarterback. However, Bledsoe had his moment for a witty comeback. On stage, he remarked: \"The last time I was up on stage before Tom Brady, I ended up in the hospital for five days and I lost my damn job.\"\n\nBledsoe continued with a mix of jest and earnest: \"Real talk, a lot of people just assumed that I have a lot of animosity toward Tom Brady. I'm here to tell you tonight in front of millions of people that you're correct. I hate him. But let's just be honest, a lot of you guys kind of hate him too. I mean, who is more hateable than the most successful quarterback of all time?

Brady's decades-long NFL career offered a rich tableau of roastable nuggets - his divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen (and her jujitsu instructor), Spygate, Deflategate, his TB12 diet and relationship with his friend/\"body coach\" Alex Guerrero (\"the snake oil salesman that turned Tom into a complete weirdo,\" as Edelman put it).\n\nBrady's journey from 199th draft pick to Roast City began when he replaced injured New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe in 2001, so it seemed appropriate to let Bledsoe - the former Washington State quarterback who was drafted No. 1 in 1993 - take the first shots. \"A lot of people assume I have a lot of animosity toward Tom Brady,\" he said, \"so I'm here tonight in front of millions of people to tell you - they're correct.\"\n\nHere's a rundown of some of the best lines (minus most of the profanity):\n\nMoss, who never won a ring with Brady: \"I'll tell you what you deflated: my legacy. I want my ring ... Drew Bledsoe was in the freakin' hospital, and he has a Super Bowl ring. Nate Ebner - who ... is Nate Ebner? - he has three Super Bowl rings.\"\n\nGronkowski on Brady and Belichick, noting that both hate fun: \"You both live and breathe football. Neither of you are married anymore. You're both even divorced from football - and both of you take full credit for the dynasty.\"\n\nBelichick: \"Really, Tom, why are all these people so hard on you? Do you miss me?\"\n\nPatriots owner Robert Kraft spoke of Brady's interest in becoming part owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and his reported feelings about a former teammate: \"Tom, good luck buying the Raiders. They did your favorite thing for you already - they got rid of Jimmy Garoppolo.\"\n\nPeyton Manning, calling Brady a three-time Super Bowl loser: \"My [golf] handicap is 6.4, while Tom's handicap is blowing leads in the Super Bowl to my brother, Eli.\"\n\nEli Manning chimed in Monday morning on X: \"I thought about attending the Roast of Tom Brady last night, but I did not want to roast him for a 3rd time!!\"\n\nKraft: \"Vladimir Putin if you're watching, give me my ... [Super Bowl XXXIX] ring back.\"\n\nAs roasts do, this one turned into a free-for-all in which no one escaped unscathed, although Brady seemed to tell comedian Jeff Ross to back off the massage jokes concerning Kraft. But if you thought perhaps there would be no cracks about the late Aaron Hernandez and murder or CTE, you were sadly mistaken. And you probably didn't foresee the night's star turn by a smiling, laughing, relaxed ... Belichick, who seemed to enjoy taunts about his inability to find a coaching job since parting with New England in January.\n\n\"Remember when you used to yell at us, 'Look ... the ... kids down at Foxboro High can make that ... play!\" Edelman recalled. \"Well ... Foxboro High is the only job offer you have! ... Do your job? More like need a job, coach.\"\n\nBledsoe had a rip for Belichick, too: \"Turns out he has some time on his hands. At least when I got fired, somebody else wanted me.\"\n\nBut Belichick didn't take it sitting down. \"It's an honor to be at the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix tonight,\" he said. \"It's not to be confused with the 10-part Bill Belichick roast during the Apple TV documentary.\" Known for his \"do your job\" mantra to players, he begged Gronk, who now appears on Fox's NFL broadcasts, to \"please stop doing your job.\"\n\nIt felt a little like a Patriots dynasty family reunion for Kraft and, he said, \"like many family reunions, there are some people I'm desperately trying to avoid - Coach Belichick, good to see you. You really look debonair in sleeves.\"\n\nBut the night, and the last words, belonged to Brady (or Brady's writers):\n\nAbout those deflated balls: \"The NFL spent $20 million and found that it was more 'probable' than not, that I was 'generally' aware that someone may have deflated my footballs. You could've just given me the $20 mil and I would've just told you I ... did it.\"\n\nOn the Peyton Manning rivalry: \"I know sometimes you live in Denver, and sometimes you live in Louisiana. But you will always live in my shadow.\"\n\nOn his interest in being part owner of the Raiders: \"I'm tired of owning just the Colts and the Bills.\"\n\nOn the Chiefs and Taylor Swift: \"Kansas City, you say your stadium is the loudest. It helps when your fans are 14-year-old girls ... in honor of TAY TAY ... Let's take a look at the Chiefs' eras; Terrible for 50 years, good for five. SHAKE IT OFF.\"\n\nAnd to Belichick: \"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious. How many Super Bowls have you won since I left? ... When I go to the Indy 500 I don't ask, 'Hey, who gassed up your car?'\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Would you like a massage?'\" Ross joked.\n\nBrady smiled initially before squirming in his seat. He then got up and approached the lectern as Ross looked at Kraft in the crowd. Brady attempted to whisper into Ross' ear, telling him, \"Don't say that s--- again.\" His message, which may or may not have been scripted, was picked up by the microphone.\n\n\"OK, OK,\" Ross replied with a laugh before finishing his roast.\n\nThe joke was in reference to Kraft receiving a misdemeanor charge for soliciting prostitution at a Florida massage parlor in 2019. Kraft pleaded not guilty to two counts of solicitation and issued an apology.\n\n\"I am truly sorry,\" Kraft said in a statement at the time. \"I know I have hurt and disappointed my family, my close friends, my co-workers, our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard.\"\n\nHe added, \"As I move forward, I hope to continue to use the platform with which I have been blessed to help others and to try to make a difference. I expect to be judged not by my words, but by my actions. And through those actions, I hope to regain your confidence and respect.\"\n\nThe solicitation charges were dropped by Florida prosecutors in September 2020, per NBC News.\n\nStill, Ross' joke made for one of the more uncomfortable moments of the three-hour roast.\n\nKraft later had his chance to take some shots of his own at Brady.\n\n\"Good luck buying the Raiders,\" Belichick told Brady, who has made a bid for a minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders. \"They did your favorite thing for you already, they got rid of Jimmy Garoppolo.\"\n\nGaroppolo, Brady's former backup in New England who the Patriots traded in 2017, was recently released by the Raiders.\n\nKraft also joked about his reunion with former Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, who parted ways with the team in January after 24 seasons.\n\n\"Unlike many family reunions, there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid,\" Kraft joked before acknowledging Belichick.\n\nKraft and Belichick then stopped taking shots at Brady...and starting doing shots of alcohol, with the help of comedian Kevin Hart.\n\n\"I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done,\" Kraft said. \"And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good lord gave me.

I used to say ''the next one'',' Brady said at first. 'But now that I am retired, my favorite Ring is the camera that caught Coach Belichick slinking out of that poor girl's house a few months ago...'\n\nThen, after pointing in his former coach's direction, Brady said: 'Hey, you still got it! Respect baby!!'\n\nStunned, Belichick lit up with an awkward smile but wasn't exactly tearing up like one of his former players - Julian Edelman - who had his arms wrapped around the six-time Super Bowl winning head coach.\n\nTom Brady delivered a few jabs during his Sunday roast, including one for his ex-head coach\n\nIn Nov., Ring doorbell footage of Bill Belichick went viral as he left a random home shirtless\n\nSpeaking of which, Brady said about Belichick's credentials: 'I've been out of the game for a minute, so I am curious how many Super Bowl have you won since I left.\n\n'Maybe it's not just the guy on the sidelines. When I go to the Indy 500, I don't ask the winning driver who gassed up your car,' the legendary quarterback added.\n\nBrady sustained more blitzes and pressure than he did during an average NFL game as an impressive lineup of comedians, former teammates and opponents took the stage. Host Kevin Hart said before the event that no topic was off limits, and Hart went on the offensive early with jokes about Brady's ex-wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\n'Gisele gave you an ultimatum. She said you retire or we're done. When you got a chance to go 8-9 and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids, you've got to do what you've got to do,' Hart said, referring to Brady coming out of a brief retirement in 2022 for one more season.\n\nThe only time Brady objected to a joke was when Jeff Ross made a reference to Patriots owner Robert Kraft and massages.\n\nAt one point on Sunday, Brady toasted to Belichick as the pair appear to now be on good terms\n\nThe quarterback-head coach duo won six Super Bowl titles throughout their era on the Patriots\n\nIn 2019, Kraft originally received a misdemeanor charge that he paid for sex at a Florida massage parlor. Prosecutors later dropped the charge after courts blocked the use of video from cameras installed by police inside the massage parlors.\n\nBrady walked up to Ross and said in his ear 'don't say that (stuff) again', but it was clearly caught on the microphone and heard by those watching the roast at home. It was not heard by those in attendance.\n\nLater, Kraft and Belichick did a shot together on stage after some coaxing from Hart.\n\nBelichick was fired in January after 24 seasons with the Patriots, and a lot has been written about friction between one of the most accomplished pro football coaches in history and owner over the past couple of years.\n\nAfter joking about this being like a reunion and 'unlike many family reunions there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid', Kraft praised Belichick for what the two accomplished.\n\n'I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done.

(AP) - Three months before Tom Brady gets roasted by critics as Fox Sports' top NFL analyst, he took his share of barbs from comedians, former teammates and his longtime coach Sunday night during a made-for-streaming comedy live event on Netflix.\n\nAnd it is safe to say after the one liners and jokes Brady heard during three hours of \"The Greatest Roast of All Time\" at The Forum, he will do just fine.\n\n\"It\u00b4s like a football game. You run with a game plan, and then you get to see kind of how the strategy goes, and then you adjust on the fly,\" Brady said before the event. \"This is what a locker room has been like for me for all these years. So it\u00b4s not like I\u00b4m used to people not making fun of me.\"\n\nComedian Nikki Glaser, whose monologue was among the funniest of the night, termed the roast as \"the comedians' Super Bowl\" and how the competition level was ramped up because everyone wanted to one-up each other.\n\nBrady sustained more blitzes and pressure than he did during an average NFL game as an impressive lineup of comedians, former teammates and opponents took the stage . Host Kevin Hart said before the event that no topic was off limits, and Hart went on the offensive early with jokes about Brady's ex-wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\n\"Gisele gave you an ultimatum. She said you retire or we're done. When you got a chance to go 8-9 and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids, you've got to do what you've got to do,\" Hart said, referring to Brady coming out of a brief retirement in 2022 for one more season.\n\nTom Brady poses at \"The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady\" at the Kia Forum, Sunday, May 5, 2024, in Inglewood, Calif. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nThe only time Brady objected to a joke was when Jeff Ross made a reference to Patriots owner Robert Kraft and massages. In 2019, Kraft received a misdemeanor charge that he paid for sex at a Florida massage parlor.\n\nBrady walked up to Ross and said in his ear \"don't say that (stuff) again\", but it was caught on the microphone.\n\nLater, Kraft and former Patriots coach Bill Belichick did a shot together on stage after some coaxing from Hart.\n\nBelichick was fired in January after 24 seasons with the Patriots, and a lot has been written about friction between the six-time winning Super Bowl coach and owner over the past couple years.\n\nAfter joking about this being like a reunion and \"unlike many family reunions there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid\", Kraft praised Belichick for what the two accomplished.\n\n\"I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done. And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me,\" Kraft said.\n\nIt wasn't the first shot (of alcohol) that Belichick took. Rob Gronkowski got Belichick and Brady to do a shot together after his monologue. Gronkowski celebrated by spiking his shot glass.\n\nBelichick appeared at the beginning of the roast during a pre-taped segment when he told Brady that he was \"starting the roast\" instead of Drew Bledsoe. Brady replaced Bledsoe in 2001 when Bledsoe was injured in a Week 2 game against the Jets and led the Patriots to their first Super Bowl title that season.\n\n\"For all of you out there who think about who's responsible for the Patriots success during the time Tom and I was together - was it Tom or me - in reality the truth of the matter was it was both of us because of me,\" Belichick said.\n\nBrady did have some fun at Belichick's expense though near the end of the show.\n\n\"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I\u00b4m curious, how many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left?,\" Brady said. \"Maybe it\u00b4s not just the guy on the sideline. When I go to the Indy 500, I don\u00b4t ask the winning driver, 'Hey, you gassed up your car?;\"\n\nHart said before the show that he thought Brady was in a great mindset going into the event. Brady did come in well prepared, going over his monologue with a group of people, including those at Fox Sports.\n\n\"You have to be able to laugh at yourself and I love that he is doing in this forum,\" Hart said. \"I love that he is embracing the things that some people think he runs away from. It is a celebration of greatness and we are doing it in a fun way.\"\n\nBledsoe also said that Brady has had a sense of humor, but that this was a different stage.\n\n\"I thought he was very brave. There\u00b4s plenty of material to make fun of him on,\" Bledsoe said. \"The truth is when you\u00b4re a professional athlete, roasting each other is kind of what we do every day in the locker room. And so, you better have thick skin going in. Now, people get to laugh along with it.\"\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nHost Kevin Hart poses at \"The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady\" at the Kia Forum, Sunday, May 5, 2024, in Inglewood, Calif.

The fans want you. Everyone wants you. But it's not your night. Sorry, Drew.\"\n\nThe camera then switched angles to show Belichick was actually speaking to Drew Bledsoe, the quarterback he inherited when he took over as head coach of the Patriots in 2000 and later benched in favor of Brady in 2001.\n\n\"Brady,\" Belichick went on to say, as Brady slid into the frame. \"You're in. Let's go.\"\n\n\"Are you [expletive] kidding me?\" Bledsoe said, as Belichick and Brady walked off together. \"Again?\"\n\nThe harmless joke was hardly indicative of what was to come, as no topics were off limits for what Netflix called \"The Greatest Roast of All Time.\" More than a dozen people took the stage at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles to rib Brady, poking fun at everything from his sexuality to his failed marriage with Gisele B\u00fcndchen to B\u00fcndchen's new romance with jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente to Brady's involvement with crypto exchange FTX.\n\nAmong those also participating were Patriots owner Robert Kraft, former Patriots wide receivers Julian Edelman and Randy Moss, ex-tight end Rob Gronkowski, Brady's longtime rival (and soon-to-be Belichick's coworker) Peyton Manning, actor Ben Affleck, reality star Kim Kardashian, host Kevin Hart, and a slew of comedians.\n\nA vast majority of the jokes -- including nearly the entirety of Gronkowski's segment -- were too inappropriate to reprint in this story. The only one that prompted Brady to interject pertained to Kraft's Orchids of Asia visit in January 2019.\n\nJeff Ross, introduced as the \"roastmaster general,\" made an addendum to what Brady, as a rookie, famously told Kraft. Not only did Brady say, \"I'm the best decision your organization has ever made,\" Ross quipped, but then he also asked, \"Would you like a massage?\"\n\nBrady then walked up to the podium and said in Ross's ear, \"Don't say that [expletive] again.\"\n\nNot every punchline was off-color, however.\n\nBelichick's segment was essentially clean, with his first joke acknowledging his negative portrayal in the \"Dynasty\" series.\n\n\"I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix,\" he said. \"It's not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10-part Apple TV series.\"\n\nBelichick then went on to poke fun at his former players, including Gronkowski for his Tide Pod commercial in 2018 and Danny Amendola for his limited production early in his Patriots tenure. He struck a more serious tone when discussing former safety Rodney Harrison, calling the fact that Harrison is still not in the Pro Football Hall of Fame \"the biggest joke of the night.\"\n\nWhen Belichick finally got to Brady, he leaned into the fact that their relationship soured over time and the speculation that Belichick's lack of praise affected Brady.\n\n\"Believe it or not, I got a lot of nice things to say about Tom, but I'm running out of time here,\" Belichick cracked.\n\n\"Tom, you had so many clutch moments, so many big plays, so many unbelievable plays that will live on forever. I remember the pass you threw to Amendola when we beat Baltimore in the playoffs in '14. No, no, that was Julian who threw that pass. There was the pass you threw to [Phillip] Dorsett when we beat the Eagles in 2019. No, no, Julian you threw that one, too. Oh. Tom threw a lot of touchdown passes. I can't remember, but he threw a bunch of them.\"\n\nBelichick also took a shot at Brady's longtime trainer and business partner Alex Guerrero, who became a point of contention in his relationship with Belichick.\n\nBelichick couldn't escape the jokes, either, as his relationship status and job status proved to be popular talking points as well.\n\n\"You remember when you used to yell at us, 'Look, the [expletive] kids at Foxborough High can make that [expletive] play,'\" quipped Edelman. \"I've been waiting for this for so long: 'Look, Foxborough High is the only job offer you [expletive] had.\"\n\nBrady took the stage for the final 10 minutes of the program, punching back at nearly all of the participating roasters. He joked about Manning living in his shadow, Edelman's perceived infatuation with him, Gronkowski's intelligence, and Deflategate, among other topics.\n\nBefore the night ended, though, Brady delivered one final message.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe",

The greatest quarterback of all time was the subject of Netflix's Tom Brady Roast that included many, many jabs thrown his way by former teammates, coaches and celebrity alike.\n\nBut similar to his football career, Brady was in control of the proceedings at the end, capping off the night with some perfectly executed zingers of his own.\n\nThe roast included many memorable moments that will surely dominate the headlines during an otherwise lazy Monday on the NFL calendar. Here's a rundown of the top moments from Brady's roast. Six moments were ranked, which is fitting, given Brady won six Lombardis during his legendary run in New England.\n\nSome of the videos shared below include graphic language.\n\n6. Edelman goes after Belichick\n\nBrady wasn't the only one that got roasted Sunday night. Former Patriots receiver Julian Edelman went after his former coach, Bill Belichick, for not landing another head coaching job after leaving the Patriots this offseason. Edelman's ribbing included his patented Belichick impression.\n\n5. Belichick, Kraft do a shot together\n\nYes, you read that right. This moment truly encapsulated the sheer absurdity of the night. Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who has received a ton of flack for his criticism of Belichick since the two parted ways (including the Apple TV documentary on the Pats' dynasty that Kraft had a role in making), went out of his way to praise his former coach before taking a shot with him at the request of comedian/actor Kevin Hart.\n\n4. Gronk being Gronk\n\nLet's just say that Rob Gronkowski more than lived up to his reputation when it was his turn at the mic. I'm not going to try to summarize what he said (check it out here if you so wish), but just know that it included Belichick blowing a whistle at him to try to get him to skip one of his graphic jokes, which Gronk declined to do.\n\nOh, Gronk also spiked his shot glass, because, Gronk.\n\n3. Bledsoe's revenge\n\nDrew Bledsoe, the quarterback Brady replaced at the start of the Patriots' two-decade long dynasty, finally got his payback on Sunday night.\n\nBledsoe took no prisoners. He made more than a few jokes about Brady's divorce with Gisele.\n\n2. Belichick takes swipe at Pats\n\nWell, it wasn't at the Patriots, per se, but more at Kraft and his role in \"The Dynasty\" documentary. The doc was largely viewed as a Belichick hit piece, which clearly wasn't lost on the six-time championship head coach.\n\n\"Im so honored to be here for the Roast of Tom Brady on Netflix,\" Belichick said. \"It's not to be confused with the Roast of Bill Belichick, the 10-part Apple TV series.\"\n\nBelichick's time at the mic also included a dig at Gronkowski and his new gig as a TV analyst. He did so while adjusting his trademark phrase, \"Do your job.\"\n\n\"Gronk, I've been watching you on Fox NFL Sunday,\" he started, \"and I'm begging you, please, stop doing your job.\"\n\n1. Brady takes no prisoners\n\nAfter getting raked over the coals, Brady turned the tables at the end of the night. His roasting included a jab at two of his former rivals.\n\n\"I'm trying to buy the Raiders. I'm tired of owning the Colts and Bills,\" he said.\n\nBrady also went after Chiefs fans while alluding to their most famous fan, Taylor Swift.\n\n\"Kansas City, you say your stadium is the loudest. It helps when your fans are 14-year-old girls,\" Brady said. \"In order of Tay Tay ... let's take a look at the Chiefs' eras: terrible for 50 years, good for five. Shake it off.\"\n\nBrady nearly brought down the house when he alluded to the NFL spending $21 million to try to prove that Brady deflated footballs in 2014.\n\n\"If they had given me the $21 million, I would have just told them I (expletive) did it,\" Brady said, a fitting ending to quite possibly the greatest roast ever.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_deardo@cbssports.com", "name": "Bryan DeArdo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gronk_(artist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gronk (artist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty_(1981_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dynasty (1981 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_NFL_Sunday", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox NFL Sunday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_(ball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football (ball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/09/12/a1d86d20-1d8a-4888-b2d1-1de2c1253aec/thumbnail/1200x675/afa632b5108e7a8a2ee18eadff44d1fa/getty-tom-brady-patriots-jets.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Everyone seized the opportunity to unleash their best jabs at Tom Brady's expense, from Bill Belichick to Kim Kardashian to Drew Bledsoe.\n\nHosted by Kevin Hart, the event was a rollercoaster of laughter and surprise, with jokes flying fast and furiously, sparing no aspect of Brady's illustrious career or personal life. As the night unfolded, the roasters pulled no punches, delving into everything from Brady's on-field and off-field controversies to his recent divorce from Giselle Bundchen.\n\nDespite all the serious digs and amazing jokes, a few moments felt like therapy for New England Patriots fans and the stars on stage. Following a speech by Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Kevin Hart asked Kraft if he would do a shot with former Patriots Coach Bill Belichick. And they both obliged. Before the two Patriot legends shared cheers, Robert Kraft referred to Bill Belichick as \"the greatest coach in the game's history.\"\n\nSince Tom Brady left New England, there has been an endless amount of conversation regarding the ever-souring relationship between Brady and Belichick. And despite Brady praising his former coach multiple times, fans and the media still believed there was a severe rift between the two. But perhaps all they needed was former Patriot tight end Rob Gronkowski to play mediator.\n\nThe shot between Belichick and Kraft wasn't the only libation shared between two Patriot legends who have had a tumultuous relationship lately. Following Gronkowski's roast of Brady, the legendary tight end asked Belichick and Brady to share a shot with him. And in wild Gronk fashion, he \"gronk-spiked\" the shot glass right after.\n\nIt was a truly great moment to witness the Patriot legends coming together on stage to share cheers and acknowledge and display that there really is no feud and that the past is obviously behind both of them. In a bit of an ironic twist, both Belichick and Brady will now be part of the football media as Belichick is set to join a show with the Manning brothers as well as The Pat McAfee Show, and Brady will be the lead color analyst for FOX this upcoming football season.\n\nThere were so many unforgettable moments, and quite a few that were NSFW. But, some topics needed to be aired out, and this was the perfect forum. Belichick addressed what many hoped he might, the 10-part documentary, \"The Dynasty,\" on Apple TV. The docuseries is about the Patriot's epic run as a dynasty, but it has received harsh criticism for its focus on the many controversies during the Patriot's unparalleled run. The doc appears explicitly to paint Belichick as the source for most issues within the Patriots organization at those times.\n\nEven Kraft, who had his name in the documentary's credits but had no creative control, expressed his disappointment with the final product.\n\nDespite how harsh the doc is, Belichick addressed it hilariously. Belichick started his segment by saying, \"I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix, not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick, the 10-part Apple TV series. \"\n\nAfter everyone on the dais took their shot at Tom Brady, the legendary quarterback got the last laugh. One of his best jokes was a direct shot at his former coach, and the packed crowd at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles loved it. Brady started the joke by addressing Belichick and asking, \"How many Super Bowls have you won since I left?\" Brady continued, and the ensuing joke was incredible. \"Maybe it's not just the guy on the sideline. When I go to the Indy 500, I don't ask the winning driver, hey, who gassed up your car?\"\n\nWith the freedom of a live Netflix production, the roasters didn't shy away from pushing the boundaries of what's deemed appropriate, resulting in a wild and raucous evening that kept viewers on the edge of their seats. Former Patriot Julian Edelman had an excellent set, as did Rob Gronkowski, comedian Niki Glaser, Andrew Shulz, and comedian Tony Hinchcliffe. The special event even featured a guest appearance from Ron Burgundy. Belichick hilariously said that Ron Burgundy was \"the only member of the media that I respect.\"\n\nUltimately, the Roast of Tom Brady was a deliciously entertaining spectacle, serving up a heaping plate of laughter and irreverence that left audiences craving more. It was a night to remember, as Brady was at the center of a comedic storm unlike any other. Above all, it felt like Patriots fans and the legends on stage could get some closure regarding rumors and headlines that have been seeping out of Foxborough since the Patriots parted ways with Belichick. And that closure came in some fantastic and heartwarming moments.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_lynch@heavy.com", "name": "Colin

(Yes, you read that correctly.)\n\n\"You and Bill are so far apart from each other,\" Hart said to Kraft after his speech, noting the distance between their seats. \"I just feel like, why don't y'all take a shot together?\"\n\nHe added: \"Let's make the uncomfortable comfortable.\"\n\nDespite Belichick's parting from the Patriots in January, the former coach joined Kraft at the podium to share a drink and a few kind words.\n\n\"I want to say, this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done,\" Kraft said before they drank their shots. \"And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me.\"\n\nThere was no shortage of stars at Sunday night's roast of Brady, but the most surprising celebrity attendee to show up had to be Will Ferrell dressed up as Ron Burgundy, his legendary newscaster character from the \"Anchorman\" movies.\n\nFerrell kept up the Burgundy schtick while roasting Brady and didn't hold back with his jokes. \"I never liked you, Tom,\" the former \"Saturday Night Live\" star said after taking the mic. \"In all my years of watching professional football, I never saw a more boring quarterback.\"\n\nOf course, Brady's divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen was a hot topic all night long, and Ferrell couldn't help but sneak in a few jabs.\n\n\"Poor Gisele,\" Ferrell said. \"It took her 13 years to learn what we all know: Tom is boring.\"\n\nFerrell also poked fun at the ex-NFL star's pair of Super Bowl losses to the New York Giants, telling Brady, \"You'll always be remembered as Eli Manning's [expletive].\"\n\nThe \"Anchorman\" star went on to tease Brady over his involvement in the FTX crypto controversy, as well as his health and fitness brand TB12.\n\n\"Don't worry, Tom, the nightmare is over,\" Ferrell said. \"You can just sit back, relax, and talk about football, invest in cryptocurrency scams, and drink your protein shakes.\"\n\nFor all of the jokes about Belichick's dour demeanor, the former Patriots head coach was pretty much all smiles during his surprise appearance Sunday night. In addition to appearing in the show's cold open bit with Brady and Drew Bledsoe, Belichick took the stage to sling a few jokes of his own.\n\nIntroduced by Ferrell (and with \"The Imperial March\" from \"Star Wars\" playing as he walked to the podium), Belichick received possibly the night's biggest round of applause. Belichick kept the laughs going as he made fun of his contentious relationship with Brady (and his personal trainer).\n\n\"You know, people have said that Tom and I have butted heads a lot,\" Belichick said. \"In a way that was true, but not really. It was hard to butt heads with Tom because he was so far up Alex Guerrero's [expletive].\"\n\nBelichick also ribbed former tight end Rob Gronkowski with a joke about his new job in sports broadcasting that got a huge laugh from the crowd.\n\n\"A lot of people kind of connect me with a saying called 'do your job,' telling people to do their job,\" Belichick said. \"Gronk, I've been watching you on Fox NFL Sunday, and I'm begging you, please: Stop doing your job.\"\n\nA number of former teammates gave Brady the business on Sunday night, including former quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who infamously lost his job to Brady back in the day.\n\nBledsoe was a good sport and took all the jokes about losing his job to Brady like a champ. The former Patriots and Bills quarterback also landed a few big laughs of his own at Brady's expense.\n\n\"You have more rings than I do, but I've experienced a couple things that you'll never experience,\" Bledsoe said. \"The feeling of being the No. 1 overall draft pick in the NFL . . . and a 28th wedding anniversary.\"\n\nFrenemy Peyton Manning got a chance to grill Brady as well, serving as the evening's final roaster before the former Patriots star took over the mic. While Manning acknowledged his rival's superior collection of Super Bowl rings, he also poked fun at Brady for his TB12 business issues and the whole Deflategate controversy.\n\n\"We all know Tom has five more Super Bowl rings than I do,\" Manning said. \"He also has more touchdowns than I do. More passing yards. More retirements. More fake hair. More TB12 bankruptcies, that is all true.\"\n\n\"I remember once Tom told me numbers don't matter,\" he added. \"Sure, it was right before he deleted every number in his phone because NFL investigators were about to kick down his door. But it was still nice of him to say.\"\n\nWhile a lot of the jokes from Sunday's roast are just too inappropriate for us to print, one line that brought the house down was Nikki Glaser's quip about Brady's cryptocurrency scandal.\n\n\"Tom also lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that? Even Gronk was like, 'Me know that not real money,'\" Glaser said while doing an impression of Gronk that sounded like the Cookie Monster meets a Neanderthal.\n\nThe joke had Hart and Gronkowski falling out of their seats with laughter as the arena burst into applause, later giving Glaser a standing ovation when her set ended.\n\nAnother surprise cameo that had people talking was Patriots superfan and actor Ben Affleck, who showed up to offer his support. \"You may know me as an extra from Tom's Dunkin' boy band Super Bowl commercial,\" Affleck joked, referencing their DunKings ad.\n\nWhile Affleck's time on stage was more like a disgruntled sports radio caller going on a five-minute rant about why Brady is the best and above criticism, he couldn't help but roast the quarterback a bit for his interception in the Super Bowl against the Falcons in 2017.\n\n\"Tom, you shoulda seen the [expletive] cornerback when you threw that pick-six in the Super Bowl against Atlanta,\" Affleck said. \"Actually, that was terrible. There was no excuse for that.\"\n\nKim Kardashian got in on the fun as well Sunday night, although she was greeted with a rough reception by the crowd after Hart introduced her to the stage. After powering through the initial boos, Kardashian found her footing and cracked a few jokes of her own.\n\nThe reality TV star earned laughs (and groans) when she addressed rumors of her dating Brady, saying it would never work out because he reminds Kardashian of Caitlyn Jenner. Kardashian added that Jenner can serve as an example for how Brady can navigate his post-NFL career.\n\n\"She's one of the best athletes in the world who proved you can do anything in this next chapter of your life,\" Kardashian said. \"You can become a commentator, a far-right Republican, or even a strong, confident woman.\"\n\n\"I think it's so great the way that you're showing everyone that, even after winning seven Super Bowls, you can still have a midlife crisis,\" she added. \"Honestly it's hard for me to watch people roast you, but I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players.\"\n\nAs the \"Roastmaster General,\" comedian Jeff Ross is a veteran of celebrity roasts, so it's no surprise that he showed up to push some buttons on Sunday night. In one of the show's more controversial segments, Ross channeled the late O.J. Simpson as he arrived on stage, saying, \"the juice is loose tonight.\"\n\nIf that wasn't enough, Ross also stirred the pot with an Aaron Hernandez joke that received an audible gasp from the crowd and various Patriots players onstage.\n\n\"What's up, Patriots, I just came from hell,\" Ross said. \"Aaron Hernandez says hello.\"\n\nBut the joke that really got Ross in trouble (with Brady at least) was his quip that touched on Kraft's Florida massage parlor scandal. Ross joked that Brady asked Kraft if he wanted a massage during their first meeting after Brady was drafted.\n\nWhile the former Patriots quarterback smirked at the joke, he quickly walked up to Ross on stage and could be heard saying, \"Don't say that [expletive] again,\" in the comedian's ear.\n\nAs the night's host, Hart had plenty of opportunities to make fun of Brady, something he seemed to relish as a diehard Eagles fan. From jokes about his divorce from B\u00fcndchen to dropping f-bombs at Brady's expense throughout the night, Hart wasn't afraid to dig in.\n\nWhile some of his jokes were hit or miss (see his opening bit about Joe Montana or his Antonio Brown joke), Hart got a nice response from the crowd during a poignant moment where he praised Belichick for coming out to support Brady.\n\n\"Way to come out and be supportive tonight,\" Hart said to the cheer of the crowd. \"I love it.\"\n\nNiceties aside, Hart mostly used his time to roast anyone and everyone at the event (including stars in the crowd like UFC president Dana White and comedian Chelsea Handler). Gronk was a particular target all night long..\n\n\"Gronk scares me,\" Hart said after witnessing the former NFL star spike a shot glass. \"He scares me.\"\n\nPretty much all of Gronk's jokes at the roast were too expletive-filled to recount here, but suffice it to say, it sounded like the filter was completely off as he roasted his former teammates.\n\nGronk brought the party, providing shot glasses for Brady, Belichick, and himself, inviting them to imbibe together.\n\n\"Tonight we're doing a [expletive] shot baby,\" Gronk shouted.\n\nHaving endured nearly three hours of jokes at his expense, the night ended with Brady getting his turn to fire back. He kicked things off by taking Manning to task.\n\n\"Peyton, thank you so much for coming out to L.A. to do this,\" he said. \"I know sometimes you live in Denver, sometimes you live in Louisiana, but you'll always live in my shadow.\"\n\nHe added, \"When I heard there was a slow, white Bronco heading down the 405 to come here tonight, I thought we might actually see a real football legend.\"\n\nBrady went even further with his edgy humor, getting a few groans as he made a Hernandez joke while talking about Gronk's abilities on the field.\n\n\"Gronk was actually useful on the field,\" Brady said. \"Although the bar for Patriot tight ends was pretty low back then: Block. Catch. Don't murder.\"\n\nOverall, it seemed like Brady wanted to make it known that he was done with all the haters and trash talkers.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Here's why", "body": "Tom Brady is used to getting slammed on the field and he was expecting to take some hard hits in Sunday's \"The Greatest Roast of All Time: The Roast of Tom Brady\" on Netflix. But he nearly had a Will Smith moment when one joke seemingly went out of bounds.\n\nHis former New England Patriots teammates, his longtime coach Bill Belichick, a starting line of comedians and even actor Ben Affleck took turns blitzing the seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback (or, as former Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman called him, \"Leonardo DiCaprio's ex-girlfriend's ex-husband\") at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California as part of the \"Netflix is a Joke Festival.\" Cracks about his divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Deflategate, Spygate, and his connection to controversial physician Alex Guerrero were all fair game.\n\nFormer Patriots QB Drew Bledsoe asked him, on behalf of what he said were most NFL fans, \"Can you please stay (expletive) retired?\" Comedian Nikki Glaser congratulated Brady on his seven rings. \"Well, eight now that Giselle gave hers back.\"\n\nBelichick slammed Brady over English soccer team Birmingham City, which was relegated to a lower league in Brady's first year as part-owner. \"Not so easy running a team, is it Tom? Stick to American football,\" he said.\n\nWill Ferrell, in character from his role in the movie \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,\" told Brady he never liked him and he was a \"dead robot of a quarterback.\"\n\n\"You were just a sexy decoy,\" he said.\n\nBrady took the hits in stride for nearly three hours. But it was legendary roastmaster Jeff Ross that finally got a rise out of Brady.\n\nTom Brady roast on Netflix: 12 best burns* of NFL legend, Bill Belichick and Patriots\n\nRoss, known for his ruthless attacks, described a conversation Brady supposedly had with Patriots owner Robert Kraft after the quarterback was drafted with the 199th overall pick in 2000.\n\n\"'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made,'\" Ross said as Brady, to cheers from the audience. And then, \"Would you like a massage?\"\n\nLaughter and groans filled the room to the reference to Kraft's charges of soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2019. Ross blew a kiss, apparently at Kraft. Brady left his chair on stage to speak quietly to Ross at the podium, and the microphone picked it up.\n\n\"Don't say that (expletive) again,\" he said.\n\nRoss nodded, smiling, and pointed toward Kraft. \"OK, OK. He's having fun, look at him,\" Ross said.\n\nWarning, there is explicit language in this clip.\n\nIn 2019, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, then 77, was charged with two counts of soliciting prostitution at a spa in Jupiter, Florida, along with more than 250 other people in three counties.\n\nThe Orchids of Asia Day Spa where Kraft had been a customer was one of 10 shut down after being tied to an international human trafficking ring during a massive multi-county investigation. Women in the spas were being held in \"sexual servitude,\" according to arrest records.\n\nThe Jupiter police chief said they had video evidence of Kraft engaging in sex acts on two separate visits to a local massage parlor, including once on the day of the AFC Championship.\n\nKraft pleaded not guilty but publicly apologized, saying he was \"truly sorry.\"\n\n\"The last thing I would ever want to do was to disrespect another human being,\" Kraft said. \"I have extraordinary respect for women.\"\n\nAfter a county judge ruled two months later that the hidden video evidence was wrongfully acquired and inadmissible and an appeals court agreed in 2020, the misdemeanor charges against Kraft and the others were dropped. Jupiter police were ordered, twice, to destroy the video recordings.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His off-field resilience was tested on Sunday as he withstood three hours of barbs and jabs during a live roast on Netflix.\n\nComedians, former teammates and coaches took the stage to deliver jokes about the seven-time champion's divorce from Gisele Bundchen, his Deflategate controversy in New England and his turbulent relationship with former coach Bill Belichick.\n\n\"I'm honored to be here at the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix,\" the infamously stoic Belichick said during a 10-minute monologue. \"Not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10-part Apple-TV series.\"\n\nThose who took the stage balanced praising Brady's on-field achievements while prodding at his off-field headlines.\n\n\"You have seven rings,\" comedian Nikki Glaser said. \"Well, eight now that Giselle gave hers back.\"\n\nFormer teammates took aim at controversies that followed Brady and the Patriots throughout their dynasty.\n\n\"Before I got to the New England Patriots, we heard about Spygate. Then after I left, we heard about Deflategate,\" Hall of Fame wide receiver Randy Moss said. \"So I only got one question for you, Tom: 'Why the f -- - didn't we cheat when I was there?\"\n\nThough Brady seemed to remain in good spirits for most of the night, some jokes pushed boundaries.\n\nComedian Jeff Ross joked that Brady must have offered Patriots owner Robert Kraft a massage after the quarterback was drafted in 1999. The joke alluded to a controversial subject -- Kraft was suspected of paying for sex at massage parlors in 2019, though authorities later dropped the charges.\n\n\"Don't say that s -- - again,\" Brady whispered to Ross.\n\nThe night concluded with Brady poking fun at himself, as he flippantly confessed to deflating footballs.

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt was hard to know what to expect from the Netflix Roast of Tom Brady which aired live on the streaming network Sunday night.\n\nFull disclosure, I wasn't optimistic. In fact I entered the night with a fair amount of trepidation.\n\nA lot of people Patriots fans hold in extremely high regard were leaving themselves open and exposed in a way they never had before. It's unimaginably difficult to play in front of tens of thousands of screaming fans. But a live roast is a level of pressure and scrutiny I'm not sure anyone up on that dais Sunday night had ever faced before.\n\nMix in some existing hostility involving some of the main players in attendance and there was potential for this to go very badly.\n\nThis however was not the squirmy cringe fest I feared it might be. In fact, Sunday night turned into the Patriots reunion no one asked for and none of us knew we needed.\n\nThe event was hosted by actor/comedian Kevin Hart and 'Roast Master' Jeff Ross. It also featured outsiders like former QB Peyton Manning, actor Ben Affleck, and a host of standup comedians.\n\nBut this was about Brady and all the people his greatness has pulled into this immediate orbit over the years.\n\nPatriots former head coach Bill Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft were in attendance and both spoke, as did former teammates Randy Moss, Rob Gronkowski, Drew Bledsoe, and Julian Edelman. Several other former Patriots also shared the stage.\n\nWhat followed was a hilarious, raunchy, no holds barred gauntlet run through memory lane. But like in sports, there are winners and losers, so without further ado...\n\n\"You gotta get uncomfortable, before you get comfortable.\" That's what host Kevin Hart told the audience after joking that Brady's ex-wife Giselle attended the roast as Antonio Brown's plus one. That was the first but definitely not the last time we saw Brady squirm and collectively realized 'oh, he's NOT ready for this.\"\n\nAs roast master, Hart set the tone for what the entire evening. Like the Patriots game plan in SuperBowl XX, hit 'em early and often.\n\nAnd it got worse. Much, much worse.\n\nMoments later talking about how Brady 'f-ked' his coach by leaving for Tampa Hart turned it back to Giselle.\n\n\"You know who else f-ked their coach? Giselle, when she 'f-ked that karate instructor.\"\n\nAnd that was it. That was the moment Brady realized he had made a huge mistake. This was not going to be a tame affair and absolutely nothing was going to be off limits.\n\nThere was NO reason for Drew Bledsoe to be here. He has accomplished much in his life on the football field and off but he is largely known as a footnote in Tom Brady's Hall of Fame career. The guy whose job Brady took on the way to becoming the GOAT.\n\nBut Drew slayed as the first non-comedian to roast Brady. He was comfortable, self deprecating and delivered his zingers with incredible timing. The former rocket armed QB took aim not just at his successor but Bill Belichick, the man who pulled the plug on Bledsoe's Patriots career after he got injured week 2 of the 2001 season.\n\n\"At least when I got fired somebody else wanted me,\" Bledsoe quipped about his former head coach's inability to find a new head coaching gig after being let go by the Patriots.\n\nIt kills me to say a bad thing about Ben Affleck so I'd rather pretend his 'roast' never took place but it did and, sheeesh.\n\nNever at any point did Affleck attempt comedy. I'm not sure anyone even told him what a roast is. Instead the Boston born actor ranted angrily, and incessantly about all of Brady's online 'haters.' And then he took aim directly at Bill Belichick as the NetFlix production team was trying to get him to wrap up his interminably long and meandering monologue.\n\n\"Bill!\" Affleck shouted looking directly at the coach. \"Like, the look on your face that everybody works for you. I've got season tickets! You work for me, motherf*cker!\n\nAffleck then called out Belichick for his evasive press conferences before pressing him on why he doesn't show Tom Brady more love.\n\n\"What does [Tom Brady] have to do to make Bill Belichick happy? How do we see some teeth, like you got to cure a cancer? They're watching the Superbowl, Tom throws a touchdown pass win again, and Bill's looking at him like, no, like f*cking Tom sh*t in his cereal or something.\"\n\nConsidering how poorly things have gone for Belichick since Tom Brady left the Patriots in 2019, (losing record in 3 of 4 seasons, fired, didn't get another job, divorce) just showing up to this event puts him squarely in the win column.\n\nBut Bill wasn't there just to show he can take a punch, he was there to throw some haymakers of his own. And on this day he settled all family business.\n\n\"It's an honor to be at the 'Roast of Tom Brady' on Netflix tonight. Not to be confused with the 10-part Bill Belichick roast during the Apple TV documentary,\" Belichick said, referencing Apple TV's \"The Dynasty\" which featured heavey involvement for the Kraft family.\n\nBelichick was tame with Brady but did take a shot at his former business partner.\n\n\"People say that Tom and I butted heads a lot, and in a way, that was true, but not really,\" Belichick said. \"It was hard to butt heads with Tom because he was so far up Alex Guerrero's ass.\"\n\nHe absolutely crushed Rob Gronkowski when he told his former Patriots tight end and current Fox Football analyst to ignore the Patriots long standing mantra and the \"stop\" doing his job.\n\nBut oddly Belichick's harshest dig came at the expense of Danny Amendola. The former Patriots receiver has been critical of Belichick since leaving New England and took some shots at his former coach in the \"Dynasty\" docu-series.\n\n\"Danny joined us in 2014 and had 200 yards,\" Belichick quipped. \"In 2016 he had 250. Or what Randy [Moss] would call a decent first half.\"\n\nKraft didn't deliver a roast as much as a toast with a couple one liners mixed in. After which he was drawn to the stage by Hart who coaxed Kraft and Belichick to take a shot together. It was....awkward and clear Belichick didn't want any part of it. While on stage Kraft tried diffuse the obvious tension.\n\n\"I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done. And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me,\" Kraft said.\n\nLook, we all believe Kraft believes that. But, it rings pretty hollow in light of the \"Dynasty\" series and some recent reporting about how Kraft trashed Belichick to prospective employers. Best to stop the charade and allow all parties to move on and see if time heals some of these gaping wounds.\n\nWhat can you say about Gronk, he's a big target.\n\nHis buffoonish charm left him rife for jokes about his perceived lack of intelligence and he may have gotten it just as bad as Brady all night long.\n\nTony Hinchcliffe thanked Gronk for taking time away from \"writing letters to Santa\" to attend and said he \"knew [Gronk was] here after we ran out of chocolate milk in the back.\"\n\nComedian Nikki Glaser also took a jab at him while roasting Tom Brady, saying, \"Tom lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that? Even Gronk was like, 'Me know that not real money.'\"\n\nBut Gronk wins because, rather than try and run from his well earned meathead persona, he leaned into it. Hard.\n\nHe was shockingly at his best when he went off script. Which was good because he seemed to be struggling with the teleprompter and was hilariously urged by Hart at one point to \"sound it out.\"\n\nBut Gronk was real, and raw. And though I'm not sure what he did up there qualifies as comedy, it was a show well worth the price of admission.\n\nThe performance ended with a toast and shared shot with Brady and Belichick whom Gronk genuinely lamented he'd never had a drink with before. The toast was punctuated by a signature spike of Gronk's empty shot glass.\n\nPure Gronk. Nothing else would do.\n\nRandy, comedy is hard. Maybe ask someone to write your jokes for you next time like everyone else did.\n\nIf you have beef with some of the jokes and some of the targets, I don't blame you. Nothing was off limits and there were some cringy and uncomfortable moments and more than a fair share of jokes that crossed a lot of lines.\n\nBut, this is what roasts are. They are meant to be raunchy and push boundaries, and if you sign up to be part of it, it's open season. From Nikki Glazer to Tony Hinchcliffe to Andrew Schulz and Sam Jay, the actual comedians killed it.\n\nI'm not sure if this was a money grab after blowing $30 million in a crypto scam. Or to maintain a high profile for future business ventures. Whatever the reason, it didn't make sense to me beforehand and it doesn't now.\n\nBrady never struck me as a guy who has much of a sense of humor, certainly not about himself. He is a serious guy who has used every slight he's ever received in his life as jet fuel on his path to becoming the greatest of all time.\n\nBut on this night he broke and broke early. It was evident from the jump that the Giselle divorce jokes were hard to stomach. He also really didn't like being called a deadbeat dad for leaving Bridget Moynihan while she was pregnant with their first child.\n\nAnd Brady almost had his Will Smith moment during Roast Master Jeff Ross's set after Ross took a shot at Robert Kraft for soliciting an illegal massage. While Ross blew a kiss to Kraft in attendance, he was then approached by Brady at the podium, who whispered into Ross' hot microphone, \"Don't say that shit again.\"\n\nWhen it was Brady's turn to take the microphone to defend himself there was nothing good natured about any of his routine. In fact it was oddly arrogant and cruel.\n\nAnd while it's not clear whether Brady needed this, it's certain his family didn't. They caught a lot of strays and I can't fathom Brady's 3 kids - all aged 16 and under - watching this or being able to avoid hearing about it today and all days going forward. Like Brady's football legacy, this roast is now part of his permanent record.\n\nThis coulda gone sideways and at times it almost did. But this entire special felt like it was produced just for you and your closest pals. Like getting together with your high school buddies. A safe space where no one is safe. Sharing the same stories you've been tossing around for 25 years and laughing just as hard at each re-telling.\n\nAnd yes there was a certain level of catharsis seeing a few participants air some grievances, some good natured, others more recent and real. But also to know that there is genuine love and respect among the majority of those brave enough to take the stage. All of whom blessed Patriots fans with 20 plus years of unforgettable memories and for at least one night reminded us what it was like to be great.", "source": {"uri": "clnsmedia.com", "dataType":

Whether it was the legendary quarterback's former teammates in Randy Moss, Julian Edelman, Drew Bledsoe and Rob Gronkowski, his former coach in Bill Belichick, or a long list of comedians, the jokes were flying.\n\nKevin Hart hosted, but it was Belichick who helped kick off the show by telling Bledsoe that it was once again Brady's time to shine.\n\nThere were jokes about Spygate, deflated footballs, trainer Alex Guerrero, Belichick's job status, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, cryptocurrency, Brady losing to Eli Manning in the Super Bowl multiple times and much more.\n\nAnd there was no shortage of reactions from those who watched:\n\nHart, Ben Affleck, Nikki Glaser, Jeff Ross, Will Ferrell, Sam Jay and other actors and comedians expectedly delivered one-liners about Brady and the other athletes. Ferrell even arrived as his famous character Ron Burgundy and told Belichick, \"it was Tom, it was never you\" when talking about the Patriots' success.\n\nBut the athletes also drew plenty of laughs with Edelman and Gronkowski holding nothing back and Bledsoe telling Brady, \"I'm really glad that you enjoyed all this amazing success with the team I built\" while also telling Belichick, \"at least when I got fired somebody else wanted me.\"\n\nThen there was Moss, who didn't ring a ring with the Patriots. His time in New England also came outside of the Spygate and deflated football controversies, which had him asking Brady, \"why didn't we cheat when I was there?\"\n\nBrady was the target of most of the roasts, but Gronkowski didn't escape some of the jokes.\n\nThe most notable one came from Belichick himself, who played off his \"do your job\" slogan by telling Gronkowski, \"stop doing your job\" as a Fox studio analyst.\n\nBelichick had the room cracking up but was also part of arguably the most notable moment of the evening when Hart convinced the legendary coach to take a shot with Kraft in an effort to quell any bad blood.\n\nThat wasn't the only surprise of the show, as Peyton Manning was the final roaster who landed a number of amusing jokes before introducing Brady as a three-time Super Bowl loser.\n\nBut it all built toward Brady's rebuttal, and the greatest of all time once again delivered.\n\nWhether it was him telling Roger Goodell the NFL should have just given him the $20 million it used to investigate the deflated football scandal or roasting all of his rival fanbases and Belichick, Brady seemed to be in his element:\n\nIt was quite the mic drop from Brady, who once again thrived under the spotlight.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_polacek@bleacherreport.com",

The world found out on Sunday night, when the seven-time Super Bowl champion sat for The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, which streamed on Netflix. Held at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles as a part of the Netflix Is a Joke Fest, the special featured Brady getting roasted by host Kevin Hart and a number of notable personalities, including Kim Kardashian, Ben Affleck, Peyton Manning, and even Will Ferrell in character as Anchorman's Ron Burgundy. It also featured at least one joke that seemed to make the former Patriot piping hot.\n\nThat joke came courtesy of Roastmaster General Jeff Ross, who took a shot at Patriots owner Robert Kraft's arrest for allegedly soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor in 2019. (The charges were later dropped.) Ross said that after Brady was drafted by the Patriots, he told Kraft, \"I'm the best decision your organization has ever made.\" Ross joked that Brady then added, \"Would you like a massage?\" While the crowd laughed, a tense Brady got up from his seat, went up to Ross, and audibly whispered into his ear, \"Don't say that shit again.\" Ross said, \"Okay, okay\" before pointing to Kraft and telling Brady, \"He's having fun. Look at him!\"\n\nRoss's quip was fairly tame, especially compared to other jokes told over the course of the night. Brady's ex-wife, supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen, found herself in the line of fire as Kevin Hart took aim at her divorce from Brady as well as her new relationship with jiujitsu coach Joaquim Valente. \"Gisele gave you an ultimatum. She said you have to retire or we're done. But when you got a chance to go eight and nine and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids, you gotta do what the fuck you gotta do,\" said Hart. He went on to joke that Brady \"fucked\" his longtime Patriots coach, Bill Belichick, by leaving the New England Patriots for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. \"You fucked him good. You did, Tom, you fucked your coach. But let me tell you something, people...that's what you've got to do to maintain your happiness. You sometimes got to fuck your coach. You know who else fucked their coach? Gisele. She fucked that karate man.\"\n\nHart didn't stop there. \"I mean, Jesus Christ, Tom. One of the smartest quarterbacks ever played a game. How did you not see this coming? Eight fucking karate classes a day. Eight karate classes a day, and she's still a white belt. Fuck, Tom. The only bruises she had were on her ass. Everybody should have known it.\" Comedian Nikki Glaser also took shots at Brady for his divorce. \"You have seven rings. Well, eight, now that Gisele gave hers back,\" she quipped. She also riffed about B\u00fcndchen's new love interest, joking to Brady that it must be difficult knowing that \"your ex-wife's new boyfriend can beat your ass while eating hers.\" Vanity Fair has reached out to B\u00fcndchen for comment.\n\nKim Kardashian received audible boos as she approached the lectern. But when she finally did get a chance to speak, she didn't hold back. The reality TV star and mogul made jokes about her rumored flings with Brady, comparing him to Caitlyn Jenner. \"I do know it would never work out. An ex-athlete, high cheek bones, silky hair -- you remind me too much of my stepdad now,\" said Kardashian. \"Part of me thinks you would want to undress me just to try on my clothes. I know the transition from the NFL must have been really hard, but I think my stepdad is a great example for you. She's one of the greatest athletes in the world, who's proved you can do anything in this next chapter. You can become a commentator, a far-right Republican, or even a strong, confident woman.\" Not bad for a girl with no talent.\n\nWhen Brady finally got a chance to roast his roasters, he had a joke ready for Kardashian about her ex-husband, Kanye West. \"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight...not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad,\" quipped Brady. As for his own ex-wife, Brady made one sly reference to his marital status. \"There have been a lot of jokes tonight, but I miss the love of my life...football,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

But when you have a chance to go 8-9 you gotta do it.\"\n\nHe also made fun of Brady over B\u00fcndchen's new boyfriend, her karate coach Joaquim Valente.\n\n\"You know who also f---ed their coach? Gisele, she f---ed her karate coach,\" Hart said. \"Tom, how did you not see this coming? Eight karate classes a day?\"\n\nA visibly uncomfortable Brady responded by raising his glass to the crowd and drinking.\n\nAfter Hart, several more of Brady's roasters came after the former NFL QB about his marriage.\n\nTalking about how rarely Brady would get sacked on the field, former Patriots QB Bledsoe -- who Brady replaced on the team back in 2001 -- joked that he's \"pretty used to not being touched. Just like at the end of the marriage.\"\n\nA few minutes later, Glaser, 39, continued going after Brady for his divorce.\n\n\"You have seven rings. Well, eight now that Gisele gave hers back,\" she said.\n\nAnd Brady's former teammate, Edelman, joked that he now refers to the QB as \"Leonardo DiCaprio's ex-girlfriend's ex-husband.\"\n\nBrady was also roasted for his failed crypto commercials, his losses to the New York Giants and, from Kardashian, his looks. Mocking both Brady and Caitlyn Jenner in one (along with her rumored romance with the former NFL star), Kardashian, 43, told him that they can't date because \"you remind me too much of my stepdad now.\"\n\nRelated: Tom Brady Is Forced to Choose Between Tampa Bay and New England in New Ads -- See His Reaction!\n\nBrady and B\u00fcndchen filed for divorce on Oct. 28, 2022, after 13 years of marriage. The pair first met in December 2006 on a blind date set up by mutual friends.\n\nThey share two children: son Benjamin, 13, and daughter Vivian, 10.

The arena. The Roast of Tom Brady,\" Hart said in a voiceover. \"No helmets. No mercy. No Brady Rule.\"\n\n\"No f---in' problem,\" Brady deadpaned to the camera, as the arena behind him exploded.\n\nBrady officially retired from the NFL for a second time in February 2023, announcing his decision in an emotional post on social media. \"I'm retiring. For good. I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning I figured I'd just press record, and let you guys know first,\" Brady said emotionally.\n\n\"It won't be long-winded, you only get one super-emotional retirement essay, and I used mine up last year, so. I...really thank you guys...so much,\" he continued. \"To every single one of you, for supporting me, my family, my friends, teammates, my competitors. I could go on forever. There's too many. Thank you guys for allowing me to live my absolute dream.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't change a thing. Love you all.\"\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!\n\nRead the original article on People.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors":

But when you have a chance to go 8-9 you gotta do it.\"\n\nHe also made fun of Brady over B\u00fcndchen's new boyfriend, her karate coach Joaquim Valente.\n\n\"You know who also f---ed their coach? Gisele, she f---ed her karate coach,\" Hart said. \"Tom, how did you not see this coming? Eight karate classes a day?\"\n\nA visibly uncomfortable Brady responded by raising his glass to the crowd and drinking.\n\nAfter Hart, several more of Brady's roasters came after the former NFL QB about his marriage.\n\nTalking about how rarely Brady would get sacked on the field, former Patriots QB Bledsoe -- who Brady replaced on the team back in 2001 -- joked that he's \"pretty used to not being touched. Just like at the end of the marriage.\"\n\nA few minutes later, Glaser, 39, continued going after Brady for his divorce.\n\n\"You have seven rings. Well, eight now that Gisele gave hers back,\" she said.\n\nBrady was also roasted for his failed crypto commercials, his losses to the New York Giants and, from Kardashian, his looks. Mocking both Brady and Caitlyn Jenner in one (along with her rumored romance with the former NFL star), Kardashian, 43, told him that they can't date because \"you remind me too much of my stepdad now.\"\n\nRelated: Tom Brady Is Forced to Choose Between Tampa Bay and New England in New Ads -- See His Reaction!\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nIn April, Netflix released a teaser for the event, part of the Netflix Is a Joke festival showcasing comics around Los Angeles, showing Brady walking away from L.A.'s iconic Forum as the building is jokingly set on fire.\n\n\"The man. The arena. The Roast of Tom Brady,\" Hart said in a voiceover. \"No helmets. No mercy. No Brady Rule.\"\n\n\"No f---in' problem,\" Brady deadpaned to the camera, as the arena behind him exploded.\n\nBrady officially retired from the NFL for a second time in February 2023, announcing his decision in an emotional post on social media. \"I'm retiring. For good. I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning I figured I'd just press record, and let you guys know first,\" Brady said emotionally.\n\n\"It won't be long-winded, you only get one super-emotional retirement essay, and I used mine up last year, so. I...really thank you guys...so much,\" he continued. \"To every single one of you, for supporting me, my family, my friends, teammates, my competitors. I could go on forever. There's too many. Thank you guys for allowing me to live my absolute dream.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randy Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermodel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supermodel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlyn Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eadGe6vPzGFiM5uebfWh2g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/1e4a5cdaebb93c17b49893a45a7cc715", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 408, "textEnd": 413}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Would you like a massage?'\" Ross joked.\n\nBrady smiled initially before squirming in his seat. He then got up and approached the lectern as Ross looked at Kraft in the crowd. Brady attempted to whisper into Ross' ear, telling him, \"Don't say that s--- again.\" His message, which may or may not have been scripted, was picked up by the microphone.\n\n\"OK, OK,\" Ross replied with a laugh before finishing his roast.\n\nThe joke was in reference to Kraft being charged with soliciting prostitution at a Florida spa in 2019 as part of a multi-county human trafficking investigation. Kraft pleaded not guilty to two counts of solicitation and issued an apology.\n\n\"I am truly sorry,\" Kraft said in a statement at the time. \"I know I have hurt and disappointed my family, my close friends, my co-workers, our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard.\"\n\nHe added, \"As I move forward, I hope to continue to use the platform with which I have been blessed to help others and to try to make a difference. I expect to be judged not by my words, but by my actions. And through those actions, I hope to regain your confidence and respect.\"\n\nThe solicitation charges were dropped by Florida prosecutors in September 2020, per NBC News.\n\nStill, Ross' joke made for one of the more uncomfortable moments of the three-hour roast.\n\nKraft later had his chance to take some shots of his own at Brady.\n\n\"Good luck buying the Raiders,\" Belichick told Brady, who has made a bid for a minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders. \"They did your favorite thing for you already, they got rid of Jimmy Garoppolo.\"\n\nGaroppolo, Brady's former backup in New England who the Patriots traded in 2017, was recently released by the Raiders.\n\nKraft also joked about his reunion with former Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, who parted ways the team in January after 24 seasons.\n\n\"Like all family reunions, there are some people you just don't want to run into,\" Kraft said before mentioning Belichick.\n\nKraft and Belichick then stopped taking shots at Brady...and starting doing shots of alcohol, with the help of comedian Kevin Hart.\n\n\"I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done,\" Kraft said. \"And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good lord gave me.

Tom Brady ended the night giving back roasts to everyone who had jokes for him, including Miss Kardashian. Brady made a joke at the expense of Kim K that involved her ex-husband, Kanye West.\n\nWhen it came to Brady's turn to grab the mic and hand out some roasts himself, he joked about Kanye's parenting skills. Brady hit back at Kim K, saying: \"Thank you so much for being here. I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this, but because her kids are home with their dad.\" The audience gave a boisterous reaction to the joke.

Some of Brady's former teammates, Julian Edelman, Randy Moss, and Rob Gronkowski attended the event. Former New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick even attended and made an appearance during the roast. Comedians and actors like Kevin Hart, Will Ferrell, Ben Affleck, and roast master Jeff Ross., also made appearances. Brady took a lot of jokes on the chin. Almost every presenter made jokes about his divorce from Gisele Bundchen, which were uncomfortable for the former QB.\n\nBrady was typically a good sport, but it seemed like one of Jeff Ross's jokes about Patriots owner Robert Kraft bothered him. Ross joked, \"So Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\" Brady walked over to Ross and told the comedian in his ear, \"Don't say that sh*t again.\" The joke alludes to Kraft's 2019 prosecution for allegedly requesting illegal acts from a Florida massage parlor.

But when you have a chance to go 8-9 you gotta do it.\"\n\nHe also made fun of Brady over B\u00fcndchen's new boyfriend, her karate coach Joaquim Valente.\n\n\"You know who also f---ed their coach? Gisele, she f---ed her karate coach,\" Hart said. \"Tom, how did you not see this coming? Eight karate classes a day?\"\n\nA visibly uncomfortable Brady responded by raising his glass to the crowd and drinking.\n\nAfter Hart, several more of Brady's roasters came after the former NFL QB about his marriage.\n\nTalking about how rarely Brady would get sacked on the field, former Patriots QB Bledsoe -- who Brady replaced on the team back in 2001 -- joked that he's \"pretty used to not being touched. Just like at the end of the marriage.\"\n\nA few minutes later, Glaser, 39, continued going after Brady for his divorce.\n\n\"You have seven rings. Well, eight now that Gisele gave hers back,\" she said.\n\nBrady was also roasted for his failed crypto commercials, his losses to the New York Giants and, from Kardashian, his looks. Mocking both Brady and Caitlyn Jenner in one (along with her rumored romance with the former NFL star), Kardashian, 43, told him that they can't date because \"you remind me too much of my stepdad now.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nIn April, Netflix released a teaser for the event, part of the Netflix Is a Joke festival showcasing comics around Los Angeles, showing Brady walking away from L.A.'s iconic Forum as the building is jokingly set on fire.\n\n\"The man. The arena. The Roast of Tom Brady,\" Hart said in a voiceover. \"No helmets. No mercy. No Brady Rule.\"\n\n\"No f---in' problem,\" Brady deadpaned to the camera, as the arena behind him exploded.\n\nBrady officially retired from the NFL for a second time in February 2023, announcing his decision in an emotional post on social media. \"I'm retiring. For good. I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning I figured I'd just press record, and let you guys know first,\" Brady said emotionally.\n\n\"It won't be long-winded, you only get one super-emotional retirement essay, and I used mine up last year, so. I...really thank you guys...so much,\" he continued. \"To every single one of you, for supporting me, my family, my friends, teammates, my competitors. I could go on forever. There's too many.

The event, which was part of the sprawling Netflix Is a Joke Festival and broadcasted live on the streaming service, offered those up in droves. Host Kevin Hart emceed a three-hour showcase of unfiltered comedic venom from a mix of A-list celebrities (Ben Affleck, Kim Kardashian, and Will Ferrell in character as Ron Burgundy), NFL greats (Rob Gronkowski, Randy Moss, and Julian Edelman), and longtime roast staples like Jeff Ross and Nikki Glaser.\n\nBut while jokes about Gronkowski's intelligence (Glaser won the night with a quip about how Brady fell for a cryptocurrency scam because he thought Bitcoin referred to the retired tight end \"chewing on handfuls of nickels\") and Brady's divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen abounded, the night may well end up remembered most for the dose of closure it brought to the world of football.\n\nBy now, the story of the New England Patriots dynasty and its subsequent fallout is known to even the most casual NFL fans. The pairing of Brady as quarterback and Belichick as coach and general manager turned the franchise into one of the most dominant teams in modern sports history, winning a record six Super Bowls (and appearing in three more) between the years 2002 and 2018. Brady and Belichick shared an intense approach to football that made for a lethal combination, but their strong personalities eventually caused the dynasty to end on a sour note as they butted heads.\n\nTo simplify a very long story, Belichick allegedly felt that the 42-year-old Brady was nearing the end of his productivity after the 2019 season and declined to sign him to the kind of lucrative extension the quarterback wanted. This prompted Brady to sign with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as a free agent. Brady's first season with the new team saw him win his seventh Super Bowl ring, while Belichick's Patriots floundered for several years due to questionable assistant coaching hires and the coach's icy relationship with new quarterback Mac Jones.\n\nBrady retired from the Buccaneers after the 2022 season, while Belichick and the Patriots \"mutually agreed\" to part ways after the 2023 season. The parting was largely interpreted as a face-saving measure to spare the legendary coach the indignity of being fired. Belichick was expected to land another head coaching job somewhere else. But despite interviewing with the Atlanta Falcons and making his interest in several other vacant jobs known, Belichick failed to find a landing spot and will likely be forced to sit the 2024 season out before pursuing new jobs next offseason.\n\nBut Brady and Belichick leaving professional football and pivoting to media careers (Brady will provide color commentary for NFL games on Fox this season, while Belichick signed a TV deal with ESPN) did not do much to dull the football world's obsession with them. Being a sports fan in the 2020s is a 24/7, 365-day-a-year endeavor, and the sports media ecosystem thrives by filling each offseason with arguments about the legacies of players and coaches. Few topics have received more attention in recent years than the Brady-Belichick Patriots dynasty, as TV shows and podcasts have devoted thousands of hours to debating which man was more responsible for the team's success.\n\nFor years, it was seen as acceptable to claim that Brady's talent was overstated and that the sixth-round draft pick was simply a chess piece that Belichick used brilliantly. But that argument went out the window when Brady won a Super Bowl in Tampa Bay. Belichick's failure to rebuild the Patriots without Brady, meanwhile, tipped the discourse scales in the other direction, with many loud voices claiming that the coach was simply lucky to have access to the prime years of the greatest quarterback of all time.\n\nThe recent Apple TV+ docuseries \"Dynasty: The New England Patriots\" poured even more gasoline on the fire. Many fans and critics felt like the 10-episode series painted Belichick in an overly negative light and minimized his contributions to the team's success. Patriots owner Robert Kraft was highly involved with the series, in terms of both on-camera interviews and granting access to allow it to be made in the first place, and many Belichick supporters dismissed its portrayal of the coach as self-serving revisionism from Kraft. Credible sports journalists had long reported that Kraft resented Belichick for convincing him to part ways with Brady and subjecting the owner to the embarrassment of seeing his star quarterback win a championship in another city. It was also reported that Kraft spoke with Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank -- and may have convinced him not to hire Belichick this past offseason.\n\nAll of which is to say that, regardless of the happy faces the three men have put on for the media in recent years, all was not well in the world of the New England Patriots. A live Netflix comedy special may not have been the obvious venue to resolve that tension, but the roast ended up as the perfect mix of elements to provide fans some closure about the dynasty.\n\nBelichick's presence at the roast was unsurprising, as the famously stiff coach has been lightening up in recent media appearances after being pushed out of the league. He appeared in a cold open segment in which he once again snubbed Drew Bledsoe (the former Patriots quarterback whom Brady famously replaced after an injury) and introduced Brady as the man of the hour. Later in the show, the coach took the dais for some good-natured ribbing of his former players -- and joked that the Apple documentary functioned as his own personal roast.\n\nAmid jokes about Gronkowski's embarrassing commercials (the coach delivered a very online joke in which he said that Gronk appeared in a Tide Pod ad because they're one of his favorite foods), Belichick showcased glimmers of the extensive knowledge that earned him his status as the world's biggest football geek. He highlighted the importance of left tackles in offensive schemes and singled out several of his former players in attendance who didn't end up speaking.\n\nBelichick wisely avoided the kinds of deeply personal jokes about Brady that many of the other comics relied on -- though he improvised a crack about Brady's ill-advised cryptocurrency venture that was not on the teleprompter. But he ended his set by referencing the endless debate about who was responsible for the team's six Super Bowl rings, ultimately saying the source of the success was \"both of us, because of me.\"\n\nThe comment delivered the tongue-in-cheek bravado you'd expect at a roast, but it seemed to mask some truth. The mere fact that the gruff 72-year-old coach -- who famously hated sports media and the distractions it created -- weighed in on this extremely online debate gave the conversation a kind of legitimacy that had previously evaded it. It's hard to imagine that either Brady or Belichick would dispute the notion that they both played key roles in the team's success and were better because they had the chance to work together. But after years of swirling gossip about rumored resentment between the quarterback, his coach, and his owner, putting things out in the open might have been the first step toward finally putting this debate to rest.\n\nBelichick continued to sit on stage throughout the night, playfully blowing whistles and throwing penalty flags when roasters crossed lines in jokes about his personal life. His presence appeared to give players permission to blow off steam about their own tenures with the famously demanding coach. Gronkowski lamented the fact that they never had a drink together, prompting Belichick and his former players to do a shot together on stage.\n\nThe only missing link was Kraft, who later appeared from the audience and took the microphone to deliver a few playful jokes before waxing nostalgic about what Brady and Belichick achieved together. Hart quickly began goading the coach and owner to do a shot of their own together, prompting Kraft to eagerly take the stage while Belichick stayed seated and appeared resistant until the crowd's energy made it impossible to say no. Belichick eventually made his way to the dais and acquiesced, as the men behind the greatest dynasty in NFL history temporarily buried their differences and raised shot glasses together.\n\nIt certainly won't be the last time fans see Brady, Belichick, and Kraft on stage together, as the men seem destined to appear at Hall of Fame inductions and celebratory reunions in Foxborough for years to come. But those future moments of sentimentality may well be the Aristotelian denouement made possible in part by the catharsis we saw on stage Sunday night. The moment speaks to the cultural value that roasts continue to provide. While the show was far from perfect, it offered a lighthearted excuse for the friends-turned-foes to appear in the same room and a comedic permission structure to air exaggerated versions of grievances that likely had some truth to them.\n\nIn a world where public figures increasingly feel the need to watch every word they say, we might need more of these no-holds-barred comedy battlegrounds if we want to get any honesty out of our heroes.", "source": {"uri": "indiewire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndieWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_zilko@indiewire.com",

The jokes flew for nearly three hours and came from a variety of people including Ben Affleck, Peyton Manning, Bill Belichick, Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman along with experienced roasters like comedians Jeff Ross, Nikki Glaser and Tony Hinchcliffe.\n\nNothing was off limits and Brady learned that the hard way early on when Kevin Hart, who was the host of the event, kicked things off by making a few jokes about the quarterback's divorce from Gisele Bundchen. Although Brady looked slightly uncomfortable with the one-liners about Gisele, only one joke seemed to get under his skin and that came from Ross, who is an experienced roaster.\n\nWhen it was his turn, Ross made a joke about Patriots owner Robert Kraft. During the joke, Ross was recounting a conversation that Brady and Kraft had shortly after the seven-time Super Bowl winner was drafted with the 199th overall pick in 2000.\n\n\"'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made,'\" Ross said, pretending to be Brady.\n\nAfter the crowd cheered, the comedian finished his joke.\n\n\"'Would you like a massage?'\"\n\nRoss' joke was making light of the fact that Kraft got hit with two charges of soliciting another to commit prostitution in 2019 following a multi-county police investigation that involved massage parlors in Florida. Although the Patriots owner was eventually cleared of all charges, the joke still didn't seem to sit well with Brady, who left his chair to walk up to the podium where Ross was standing.\n\nAt that point, Brady gave Ross a stern warning.\n\n\"Don't say that shit again,\" Brady said.\n\nRoss then responded by pointing to Kraft.\n\n\"OK, OK. He's having fun, look at him,\" Ross said of Kraft.\n\nIt's certainly possible this was all part of the act, but it definitely felt like Brady was legitimately upset with the joke. On a night where there were plenty of uncomfortable jokes, this seemed to be the only one that truly got under Brady's skin.\n\nIf you missed the roast, we ranked all the best moments and you can check those out here.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_breech@cbssports.com", "name": "John Breech", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hinchcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Hinchcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Affleck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/06/77df265f-4053-475a-9b59-787305a67e26/thumbnail/1200x675/15fcf180e4a3f296798ea18d51459f65/getty-tom-brady.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The actor and comedian didn't hold back, taking jabs at Brady's career and his well-publicised split from Gisele Bundchen.\n\nHowever, it was Jeff Ross who took things up a notch. One particular joke seemed to hit a nerve with Brady, prompting the ex-New England Patriots quarterback to stand up and warn Ross not to repeat it. The joke revolved around Brady's arrival at the Patriots in 2000.\n\nREAD MORE: New York Jets' NFL Draft pick makes bold Aaron Rodgers prediction after joining team\n\nREAD MORE: SNL presenter sends apology to Taylor Swift over sharing bed with Kansas City Chiefs' Travis Kelce\n\nRoss, discussing Brady's draft where he was famously picked at 199th, quipped: \"So, Tom became a Patriot, moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp the scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said 'I'm the best decision your organisation has ever made...would you like a massage?'.\"\n\nBrady, breaking his silence, stood up and confronted Ross, warning: \"Don't say that ---- again. \" Ross immediately raised his hands in surrender and responded: \"OK, OK.\" He then added: \"He's [Kraft] having fun, look at him.\"\n\nKraft was indeed present at the Los Angeles Forum, taking the joke in stride. The evening wrapped up on a positive note with Ross and Brady hugging it out after his section, which Hart playfully mocked.\n\nThe Patriots' legacy was well represented; Bill Belichick also attended and even joined in the fun, humorously 'benching' Drew Bledsoe in a skit. Belichick quipped to Bledsoe during the act, \"It's great seeing you again. This is a big night. The fans want you. Everyone wants you. But it's not your night. Sorry Drew. Brady, you're in!\"\n\nThe sketch paid homage to Brady's rise over Bledsoe as the Patriots' quarterback. However, Bledsoe had his moment for a witty comeback. On stage, he remarked: \"The last time I was up on stage before Tom Brady, I ended up in the hospital for five days and I lost my damn job.\"\n\nBledsoe continued with a mix of jest and earnest: \"Real talk, a lot of people just assumed that I have a lot of animosity toward Tom Brady. I'm here to tell you tonight in front of millions of people that you're correct. I hate him. But let's just be honest, a lot of you guys kind of hate him too.

You have seven rings -- well, eight, now that Gisele gave hers back,\" comedian Nikki Glaser, hailed as one of the funniest comics of the evening at the marquee event for the annual Netflix is a Joke Festival, said in her monologue, referring to Brady's ex-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\nEight of Brady's former New England Patriots teammates joined him onstage -- Drew Bledsoe, Randy Moss, Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman, Rodney Harrison, Willie McGinest, Matt Light and Nate Solder -- as well as his longtime head coach Bill Belichick who made a surprise entrance and reunion with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who delivered rips at Brady's expense.\n\nKevin Hart, who hosted the special event, taunted Brady about his Brazilian model ex-wife, whose reported new boyfriend is a jiujitsu instructor.\n\n\"How do you not see this coming? Eight karate classes a day and she's still a white belt,\" Hart joked.\n\nThe evening included an array of humorous jabs from some of the biggest names in stand-up comedy -- Jeff Ross, Tom Segura, Tony Hinchcliffe, Bert Kreischer and more. Will Ferrell also showed up in character as Ron Burgundy to rile up the crowd. Actor, writer, director and notable Bostonian Ben Affleck, who recently co-starred in a Dunkin' Super Bowl commercial alongside Ferrell, was also in attendance.\n\nKim Kardashian also got in on the action. \"Honestly its hard for me to watch people roast you, but I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players,\" she told Brady, referring to her father Robert Kardashian, who famously defended friend O.J. Simpson in the latter's 1995 murder trial.\n\nTom Brady says 'blame and shame media atmosphere' took Netflix cameo 'out of context'\n\nAt one point in the evening, as expertly crafted insults were hurled across the stage, Brady's former tight end Gronkowski got tripped up reading the teleprompter and ended his shtick with his trademark celebratory move, spiking a shot glass in lieu of a football, which created a shattered mess for Hart to clean up.\n\nElsewhere in the evening, Belichick reunited onstage with Kraft, and the two did a shot together as Kraft praised the coach and Brady alike, in a rare lighter moment.\n\nFellow NFL great Peyton Manning arrived at the tail end of the night to re-up the two men's friendly rivalry and razzed Brady for losing two Super Bowls to his younger brother Eli Manning, later handing off the podium to the \"three-time Super Bowl loser.\"\n\nTom Brady's best rebuttals at Netflix Greatest Roast of All Time\n\nIn the end, Brady had the last laugh, delivering blows to each of the aforementioned guests.\n\n\"I know sometimes you live in Denver, and sometimes you live in Louisiana.

The first of those came at the conclusion of the 2001 season when Tom Brady led the Patriots to an upset over the explosive and heavily favored St. Louis Rams. Notable in that game is that Belichick had to make the choice of inserting second-year quarterback Tom Brady into the starting lineup over Drew Bledsoe.\n\nSince Brady would go on to an incredible career that would include seven Super Bowl titles, it may seem like it was an easy choice for the coach. However, it was anything but. Bledsoe had been injured early that season and that's what gave Brady a chance to play in the first place.\n\nBledsoe recovered late in the year, and he played a key role for New England in their AFC Championship Game triumph over the Pittsburgh Steelers on the road. As a result, many expected Belichick to go with the veteran quarterback in the Super Bowl. He did not do that, and it was clearly a disappointment for Bledsoe. With a different decision, Bledsoe could have been the quarterback that kicked off the Patriots dynastic run.\n\nMore than 22 years after that historic NFL moment, all the parties got together at a live roast televised by Netflix for Brady. In one scene, Belichick sees Bledsoe and tells him it is great seeing him again.\n\n\"This is a great night,\" Belichick said while looking directly at Bledsoe. \"The fans want you, everyone wants you. But it's not your night. Sorry Drew.\n\n\"Brady, you're in. Let's go.\"\n\nBledsoe was seemingly unhappy with the decision and he clearly had a scowl on his face. \"Again?\" Bledsoe says. \" Are you f**king kidding me?\"\n\nThe hilarious send up was a part of the Brady roast that included comedians Kevin Hart and Nicky Glaser.\n\nGlaser roasted Brady, and also got in a shot at his former tight end Rob Gronkowski.

Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman, the champions of the Super Bowl, also had a shot.\n\nFor the cornerstones of the Patriot dynasties, it seemed like a somewhat healing evening.

One of the jokes made at his expense during the special came from stand-up comedian/actor Jeff Ross, who told the audience:\n\n\"So Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\"\n\nAn uncomfortable Brady stopped Ross, who by then was blowing kisses in Kraft's direction, from continuing the joke by climbing the stage and whispering in his ear:\n\n\"Never say that sh*t again.\"\n\nWhat other jokes were made at Tom Brady's Netflix roast?\n\nIt goes without saying that The Roast of Tom Brady is a must-watch for both NFL fans looking for some respite from the brutal on-field action and comedy fans wanting something unique.\n\nThe episode goes deep into many aspects of the seven-time Super Bowl champion's career and life, from his humble beginnings as a sixth-round pick in 2000 to his rise to superstardom.\n\nOne of the most notable guests was former head coach Bill Belichick, who referenced Brady's transcension of Drew Bledsoe in the depth chart (after winning their first-ever Super Bowl, the Patriots traded Bledsoe to the divisional rival Buffalo Bills):\n\n\"It's great seeing you again. This is a big night. The fans want you. Everyone wants you. But it's not your night. Sorry, Drew. Brady, you're in. Let's go.\"\n\nBelichick even alluded to Apple TV's 10-part documentary on his longtime team's dynasty:\n\n\"Seriously, I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix... not to be confused with the 10-part Bill Belichick roast during the Apple TV doc.\"\n\nComedian (and noted Patriots hanger-on) Kevin Hart also got a shot in, this time aimed at Brady's tumultuous 2022 season and concurrent divorce from Gisele Bundchen, and her subsequent relationship with karate coach Joaquim Valente:\n\n\"Gisele gave you an ultimatum. She said you have to retire or you're done. But when you have a chance to go 8-9 you gotta do it.\n\n\"You know who also f---ed their coach? Gisele, she f---ed her karate coach.

Raunchy, tasteless jokes are kind of the reason when everyone is attending and we're all watching at home. And, the fact of the matter is, the scandal happened.

The evening was marked by friendly jabs from friends and ex-teammates including Kevin Hart, Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, Randy Moss, and Kim Kardashian. Everything seemed fine until host Hart \"crossed the line,\" targeting Brady's separation from supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\nHart kicked off the event by humorously criticizing Brady's decision to exit retirement for a less successful final season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He joked, \"Gisele gave you an ultimatum. She said you have to retire or you're done.\" Hart also made light of B\u00fcndchen's relationship with her karate coach, Joaquim Valente. \"You know who also f---ed their coach? Gisele, she f---ed her karate coach...Tom, how did you not see this coming?\" This left the NFL star visibly uncomfortable.\n\nFollowing Hart's lead, other celebrities also made fun of Brady's marital life. Former Patriots QB Bledsoe joked about Brady's infrequent sacks on the field, saying he's \"pretty used to not being touched. Just like at the end of the marriage.\" Comedian Nikki Glaser added her own quip: \"You have seven rings. Well, eight now that Gisele gave hers back.\" Edelman referred to Brady as \"Leonardo DiCaprio's ex-girlfriend's ex-husband.\"\n\nMeanwhile, during the special, one moment went viral when Brady left his seat to whisper something to Jeff Ross. Ross -- known as the \"Roastmaster General,\" -- joked about Brady's humble beginnings as the 199th overall pick in the NFL draft, quipping, \"I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?\" As the audience reacted, the camera cut to Brady, who appeared uncomfortable. Ross started to defend himself, but Brady approached him, whispering, \"Never say that sh** again.\"\n\nBrady and B\u00fcndchen ended their marriage on October 28, 2022, after 13 years together. The roast was a part of the Netflix Is a Joke festival -- a comedy celebration in Los Angeles. In an April promotional clip by Netflix, Brady was seen leaving LA's iconic Forum as it humorously explodes behind him. Hart narrates, \"The man. The arena. The Roast of Tom Brady,\" adding, \"No helmets. No mercy. No Brady Rule.\" To which Brady responded with a deadpan \"No f---in' problem.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randy Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermodel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supermodel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadpan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leonardo DiCaprio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l2720240506093415.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Last November, a Ring camera video surfaced that showed a man looking a lot like Belichick leaving a residence shirtless, and Brady didn't hold back.\n\n\"Everybody asks me which ring is my favorite,\" Brady said. \"I used to say 'the next one.' But now that I'm retired, my favorite Ring is the camera that caught Coach Belichick slinking out of that poor girl's house at 6 a.m. a few months ago... hey, you've still got it! Respect, baby.\"\n\nBrady kept it rolling from there.\n\n\"You know we've been through so much and after two decades I've finally had to admit that all along it was you,\" Brady said. \"You're the reason for the Patriots dynasty because you, Bill Belichick, you are a true coaching genius. I mean, you had to choose between an aging, injured, overpaid Drew Bledsoe and a young, healthy, minimum wage superstar. I could have gotten a (expletive) coach from Foxboro (expletive) high school to make that decision.\n\n\"I've been out of the game for a minute so I'm curious, how many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left? Maybe it's not just the guy on the sideline. When I go to the Indy 500 I don't ask the winning driver, 'Hey, who gassed up your car?'\"\n\nOn the flip side, the coach got Brady just as good earlier in the night. Belichick began by talking about the struggling soccer team that Brady has an ownership stake in, and delivered one of the lines of the night at Alex Guerrero's expense.\n\n\"We've already talked about the cryptocurrency, I'll stay away from that one. But I see your soccer team Birmingham City got knocked down to another tier in the English football league,\" Belichick said. \"So for those not familiar with English football and the intricacies to their obscure (relegation) system, just let me put it in English for you: They suck! Not so easy running a team, is it Tom?\n\n\"So little coaching advice, stick to American football. You're really good at that. People have said that Tom and I butted heads a lot, and in a way that was true, but not really. It was hard to butt heads with Tom because it was so far up Alex Guerrero's (butt).\"\n\nBelichick finished by poking fun at the trick plays that Patriots used to call that took the ball out of Brady's hands.\n\n\"You know, Tom, you had so many clutch moments, so many big plays, so many just unbelievable plays that will live on forever. I remember the pass that you threw to (Danny) Amendola when we beat Baltimore in the playoffs in '14 -- no, that was Julian (Edelman) that threw that pass to Amendola. There was the pass you threw to (Phillip) Dorsett when we beat the Eagles -- (Philly fan Kevin Hart) you remember that one -- in 2019. No, Julian, you threw that one too. Oh. Tom threw a lot of touchdown passes. I can't remember them, but he threw a bunch of them.\n\n\"Seriously, Tom and I had our differences, but you know it only comes with love and respect about our relationship and we did some special things together. For all of you out there that think about who's responsible for the Patriots' success during the time when Tom and I were there, was it Brady? Was it me? Was it Brady? Was it me? In reality, the truth of the matter is, it was both of us because of me. Great event. Netflix, great night to be here. Thank you very much. Love you. Tom, (inaudible), love you guys. Thank you!\"\n\nAll parties seemed to enjoy the evening, and Belichick, Brady and Rob Gronkowski took a shot together at one point as well.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_mason@masslive.com", "name": "Chris Mason", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "cmason@masslive.com", "name": "cmason", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady\u2013Belichick_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brady\u2013Belichick era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Guerrero_(alternative_medicine)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Guerrero (alternative medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxborough,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Dorsett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Dorsett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/GVSZMY4AFNGLFNZZ64JXZSO7FY.jpg?auth=2de034f723bb36ba253ea1a401c8dab61f015671d2aa2f9b08a810112493d8ab&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Get a sneak peek at the final episode of the AMC series.\n\nNFL legend Tom Brady had a night he'll never forget on Sunday, May 6, as he took to the stage at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles to be roasted by comedians and his former teammates.\n\nThe Netflix live event, The Greatest Roast of All-Time: Tom Brady, uniquely honored the Patriots great by having his peers brutally roast him about all aspects of his life, from his former marriage to Gisele B\u00fcndchen to the deflate-gate controversy.\n\nHosted by Kevin Hart, the event saw the likes of Kim Kardashian, Nikki Glaser, Robert Kraft, Jeff Ross, and Will Ferrell take to the stage to deliver their best Tom Brady burns.\n\nCheck out some of the most memorable moments below.\n\nComedy roast stalwart Jeff Ross, aka the Roastmaster General, received admonishment from Brady after one particularly brutal joke.\n\n\"So Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\" Ross quipped.\n\nThe comedian was referencing the 2019 incident where Kraft and others were charged with solicitation in an anti-sex trafficking investigation into several Florida massage parlors. Prosecutors later dropped the charges against the Patriots owner.\n\nAfter Ross made the joke, he turned to where Kraft was sitting, saying, \"I love Robert Kraft...\" He was then interrupted by Brady, who walked on stage and whispered in Ross' ear, \"Don't say that s*** again.\"\n\nRoss also brought up the 2015 scandal in which the NFL disciplined Brady and the Patriots for lowering the inflation of game footballs.\n\n\"I really wanted you to be our first G.O.A.T. to be roasted because you're an example to future generations that if you work hard, eat right, film the other team's practices, deflate the balls, and have the NFL make new rules just for you, then you too can be the third most famous guy in a Dunkin Donuts commercial, Tommy,\" Ross joked.\n\nReality star Kim Kardashian made a surprise appearance at the event, but she didn't receive the most welcome response. As she started speaking, the crowd drowned out her speech with loud boos.\n\n\"All right, all right, all right,\" she said, trying to calm the boos down. Meanwhile, Hart could be heard off-screen saying, \"Whoa, whoa.\"\n\nAfter the audience finally quieted down, Kardashian got off her jokes, including comparing Brady to Caitlyn Jenner.\n\n\"You remind me too much of my stepdad now,\" she said. \"Oh, part of me thinks you would want to [date] me just to try on my clothes. I know the transition from the NFL must have been really hard. But I think my stepdad is a great example for you. She's one of the best athletes in the world, who proved you can do anything in this next chapter of your life. You can become a commentator or a far-right-wing Republican or even a strong confident woman.\"\n\nIntroduced as \"a living legend, a world-class lover, and the No. 1 news anchor in all of Sunday,\" Will Ferrell took to the stage as his Anchorman persona, Ron Burgundy.\n\n\"My name is Ron Burgundy,\" he started. \"I am a very big deal, but tonight is not about me... We are here to honor a champion of the gridiron, a great American, a father and a sexy man, a true patriot -- until he was not.\"\n\nAfter talking about Brady's looks, Burgundy ended his speech by saying, \"I mean, let's be honest. Your best years are behind you, Tom. The Super Bowls, Gisele, your movie career, it's all done, it's all gone. But you won't be forgotten, you'll always be remembered as Eli Manning's b***h. Don't let that get you down, Tom.\"\n\nAs host, it was up to Hart to kick the evening off, and he did so by poking fun at Brady's breakup with his ex-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\n\"Gisele gave you an ultimatum,\" Hart said. \"She said you have to retire or you're done. But when you got a chance to go eight and nine, and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids, you gotta do what the f*** you gotta do. You know what that's called, Tom? That's called real s***. F*** them kids.\"\n\nHe then turned his attention to B\u00fcndchen's new boyfriend, her karate coach Joaquim Valente.\n\n\"You know who also f***** their coach? Gisele, she f***** her karate coach,\" Hart joked. \"Tom, how did you not see this coming? Eight karate classes a day?\"\n\nAfter Hart set the tone, comedian Nikki Glaser went in for the kill with her focus on Brady's broken marriage.\n\n\"Five-time Super Bowl MVP, most career wins, most career touchdowns. You have seven rings. Well, eight, now that Gisele gave hers back,\" Glaser quipped. \"But sorry, Tom, the only thing dumber than you saying yes to this roast was when you said, 'Hey, babe, you should try jiu jitsu.'\"\n\nShe also referenced actress Bridget Moynahan, whom Brady dated between 2004 and 2006. She gave birth to their child in 2007.\n\n\"But seriously, Tom... you're the best to ever play for too long. I mean, you retired, then you came back, and then you retired again. I mean, I get it. It's hard to walk away from something that's not your pregnant girlfriend. To be fair, he didn't know she was pregnant. He just thought she was getting fat, and Tom hates fat.\"\n\nHere are some more of the best burns.\n\nHart: \"We're here to roast the greatest quarterback of all time. Oh, wait, Joe Montana's here?\"\n\nKardashian referencing how her late father, Robert Kardashian, was part of O.J. Simpson's defense team: \"Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast you. But I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players.\"\n\nBrady: \"Thank you so much for being here. I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this, but because her kids are home with their dad [Kanye West].\"\n\nAndrew Schulz: \"ACL is the only injury Gronk can spell.\"\n\nBurgundy: \"I never liked you Tom in all my years of watching professional football. I never saw a more boring quarterback. He actually made me look forward to all the fun and laughter of a Bill Belichick postgame interview.\"\n\nRoss: \"I really wanted Kevin [Hart] to host because he already looks like a deflated football.\"", "source": {"uri": "tvinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TV Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_holmes@tvinsider.com", "name": "Martin Holmes", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Brady kept his cool and hands to himself, but he was clearly annoyed by a Jeff Ross joke about Patriots' owner Robert Kraft.\n\nRoss, a comedian and actor best known for his involvement in celebrity roasts, threw a jab at Kraft and Brady while at the podium during \"The Roast of Tom Brady.\"\n\nMORE: Live updates, highlights of Netflix's 'The Roast of Tom Brady'\n\n\"[Brady] said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made,'\" Ross said, quoting the quarterback.

Ross then blew a kiss toward Kraft and said, \"I love Robert Kraft.\"\n\nBrady immediately walked up to Ross and told him \"don't say that sh-- again.\" While the confrontation was mostly smooth, it clearly struck a nerve with Brady considering the meaning behind the joke.\n\nHere's what to know about Ross' joke at the Patriots' owner's expense.\n\nKraft was in legal trouble in 2019 after surveillance footage uncovered him paying for sexual favors at a massage parlor in Florida.\n\nThe misdemeanor charges were eventually dropped since the police secretly installed cameras inside the parlors, which violates the law.\n\nNonetheless, it's a touchy subject, as is any crime of that nature. Ross' joke implied that Brady offered a \"massage\" to Kraft as a reward for drafting him.

On Sunday, a few comedians and friends of Brady gathered for a Netflix live Special, The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady. The audience went bonkers during the show as Tom Brady suffered roasts. Most of the jokes and jabs were directed at his failed marriage with Gisele B\u00fcndchen. However, despite being the target of countless jests, Brady remained a good sport, joining in on the comedic banter.\n\nSunday was a fun-filled day for Tom Brady's friends as they gathered at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California. Fans watched as comedians, friends, and former teammates of the 46-year-old fired insults at Brady during a Netflix joke fest. The jokes that drew the most gasps were particularly channeled at the former Quarterback's divorce from B\u00fcndchen. Recall that Brady and the model divorced in 2022, after which she moved on with Brazilian jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente. Beginning the greatest roast of all time, Comedian Nikki Glaser joked:\n\n\"How much it would suck for Tom... Omg, just knowing your ex-wife's new boyfriend could beat your a** while eating hers.\"\n\nGlaser then took things a bit further, adding:\n\n\"Tom, the only thing dumber than you saying 'yes' to this roast was when you said, 'Hey babe, you should try jiu-jitsu.\"\n\nBesides Glaser, Tom Brady also suffered roasts from Kevin Hart, Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, Drew Bledsoe, Randy Moss, and even Kim Kardashian. Speaking of Hart, the comedian mocked Brady for choosing to unretire and play one final unsuccessful season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n\"Gisele gave you an ultimatum. She said you have to retire or you're done. But when you have a chance to go 8-9 you gotta do it,\" he said.\n\nBrady's failed marriage wasn't the only thing the star received jabs about. He also got insulted for his losses to the New York Giants, his failed crypto commercials, and his looks. Kardashian, who was booed as she got on stage, particularly mocked Brady, noting that she couldn't date him because \"he reminded her too much of her step-dad Caitlyn Jenner.\" Well, Brady later got the chance to get back at Kardashian for her comment, and he took it.

Kevin Hart went straight to the quarterback's marital problems on Sunday, joking about how Brady was played by his ex-wife.\n\n\"You know who also f***ed their coach? Gisele, she f***ed her karate coach,\" Hart said. \"What an idiot. Why would you do this? Jesus Christ, Tom. One of the smartest quarterbacks to have ever played the game. Tom, how did you not see this coming? Eight karate classes a day? ... And she's still a white belt!\"\n\nBrady raised his glass, seemingly knowing he was in for a long night. Indeed, he was as comedian Nikki Glaser also made similar, brutal jokes about the end of his relationship with his ex-wife.\n\n\"You have seven rings. Well, eight now that Gisele gave hers back,\" she said in a less vulgar joke than one she made later on. \"The only thing dumber than saying yes to this roast was when you said, 'Hey babe, you should try jiu-jitsu.'\"\n\nHart also made a joke about Brady's decision to come out of retirement in 2022.\n\n\"Gisele gave you an ultimatum,\" Hart started. \"She said you have to retire or you're done. But when you have a chance to go 8-9 you gotta do it.\"\n\nJulian Edelman roasts Bill Belichick's employment status\n\nThe former Patriots receiver didn't hold back when discussing Belichick's search to find his next head coaching job this offseason.\n\n\"Remember when you used to yell at us, 'Look a**holes, the f***ing kids at Foxborough High can make that f***ing play,'\" Edelman said. \"I've been waiting for this for so long: Look a**hole, Foxborough High is the only job offer you f***ing had.\n\n\"Do your job? More like, need a job, coach.\"\n\nEdelman wasn't the only one to make jokes about Belichick's inability to land a coaching gig this offseason. Drew Bledsoe seemingly got his revenge on his former coach 23 years after he benched him for Brady.\n\n\"There were rumors Coach Belichick was gonna be here tonight,\" Bledsoe said. \"Turns out he has some time on his hands. Look, at least when I was fired somebody else wanted me.\"\n\nPeyton Manning roasts Tom Brady's cryptocurrency failure\n\nThe other notable shortcoming Tom Brady had off the field in recent years was his investment in FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. His former rival doesn't have much to stand on over him on the field, but he made sure to roast him about that on Sunday.\n\n\"Tom is making a donation to every one of his former teammates' charities that came here tonight,\" Manning said. \"And I gotta tell you, Tom, that is first class. Hey fellas, don't let him pay you in crypto.\"\n\nNikki Glaser, Tom Brady, Bill Belichick brutally insult Rob Gronkowski's smarts\n\nRob Gronkowski's non-football IQ was roasted throughout the night, with a few burns seeming to hit harder than others. Glaser poked fun at Gronkowski while making a joke about Brady's crypto failure.\n\n\"Even Gronk was like, 'Me know that not real money!'\" Glaser said, mimicking Gronkowski's voice.\n\nBelichick roasted Gronkowski's ability, or inability, to do be a good broadcaster.\n\n\"A lot of people connect me to the saying, 'Do your job,' and telling people to do their job,\" Belichick said. \"Gronk, I've been watching you on FOX NFL Sunday, and I'm begging you: Stop doing your job. Do another job. Do somebody else's job!\"\n\nBrady also joked how low the standards were for Gronkowski to be a good tight end, tying in Aaron Hernandez.\n\n\"Despite everything we've seen here tonight, Gronk was actually useful on the field,\" Brady said. \"Although the bar for Patriots tight ends was pretty low back then: block, catch, don't murder.\"\n\nJulian Edelman mocks Tom Brady's look\n\nOf all the former Patriots players, Edelman might have been the one who landed the most memorable cracks on Sunday. He tossed a joke about Brady's evolved appearance throughout the years, implying he's had some help from doctors.\n\n\"When we played together, Tom, you used to scream, 'Laser focus! Laser focus!' Now that's what he screams at his plastic surgeon,\" Edelman said. \"Who's laughing now Tom? Not you, because your face can't move and you don't have a sense of humor.\"\n\nTom Brady surprisingly went there with Bill Belichick\n\nWhile many mocked Brady's marital struggles on Sunday, he complimented his former coach's game off the field when discussing the number of Super Bowls he's won.\n\n\"Everybody asks me which ring is my favorite, I used to say, The next one,'\" Brady said. \"But now that I am retired, my favorite Ring is the camera that caught Coach Belichick slinking out of that poor girl's house a few months ago.\n\n\"Hey, you still go it. Respect baby.\"\n\nThe video Brady is referring to is one of Belichick appearing to be caught on camera leaving someone's house that was leaked late in 2023. It's unknown when the video was taken.\n\nBrady also threw a jab at his coach for not winning a Super Bowl after he left, something he did with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020.\n\n\"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious, how many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left?\" Brady said. \"Maybe it's not just the guy on the sideline. When I go to the Indy 500, I don't ask the winning driver, 'Hey, who gassed up your car?'\"", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conor_roche@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Conor Roche", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Edelman_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Edelman (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxborough,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazilian jiu-jitsu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence quotient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_NFL_Sunday", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox NFL Sunday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Hernandez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Hernandez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-most-savage-jokes-from-the-Roast-of-Tom-Brady.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Well, the reason why we didn't go there is because we didn't want to remind Tom's fans of how much money he owes them\" -- comedian and celebrity roast staple Jeff Ross kept the hits coming. He talked about how Brady was drafted in the sixth round with the 199th pick of the 2000 NFL draft \"when Bill Belichick's dog stepped on the keyboard by accident.\"\n\n\"So Tom became a Patriot,\" Ross said, \"moved up to New England and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\"\n\nThe joke was a reference to Kraft being arrested in 2019 on charges of soliciting sex from a prostitute during an encounter at a Florida day spa. Kraft pleaded not guilty, and the charges were dropped the following year after his lawyers prevented video and audio footage from being used as evidence in court.\n\nAs the crowd laughed and Ross blew a kiss in Kraft's direction, Brady could be seen shifting in his seat behind and to the right of the comedian. The camera cut to a close shot of Ross, who said \"I love Robert Kraft.\"\n\nRead more: Our 25 must-see shows at Netflix Is a Joke\n\nBrady then approached Ross. The NFL's all-time leader in passing yards and touchdown passes had a bit of a smile on his face, but his tone was dead serious when he leaned in and said to Ross, \"Don't say that s -- again.\"\n\nAs Brady returned to his seat, Ross laughed, put his hands up and said, \"OK, OK!\" He pointed in Kraft's direction and said, \"He's having fun, look at him.\" As Ross added some sincere words of praise for Kraft, the Patriots owner was shown smiling in the crowd.\n\nBrady didn't appear to hold a grudge and could be seen laughing during the rest of Ross' set.

New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial today\n\nRoss blew a kiss to Kraft, who was in attendance. That's when Brady got out of his seat and made his first audible reaction of the night.\n\n\"Don't say that s-t again,\" Brady, who was smiling, told Ross.\n\nKraft was charged with soliciting prostitution in February 2019 after a multi-county investigation into massage parlors in Florida, with police saying they recorded Kraft paying for sex acts at the Orchids of Asia spa in January 2019.\n\nKraft pleaded not guilty, a federal judge in Florida later ruled that the recordings were filmed using unlawful surveillance and must be destroyed.\n\nThe case was dismissed in September 2019.\n\n\"I am truly sorry,\" Kraft said in a March 2019 statement about the case. \"I know I have hurt and disappointed my family, my close friends, my co-workers, our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard.\n\n\"Throughout my life, I have always tried to do the right thing. The last thing I would ever want to do is disrespect another human being.\n\n\"...As I move forward, I hope to continue to use the platform with which I have been blessed to help others and to try to make a difference. I expect to be judged not by my words, but by my actions. And through those actions, I hope to regain your confidence and respect.\"\n\nThough he reacted to Ross' joke about Kraft, Brady notably stayed silent during Ross and host Kevin Hart's expletive-laden digs at his ex-wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen and the couple's divorce.\n\nThe comedian and movie star went right after Brady over his divorce from B\u00fcndchen and the future Hall of Famer's decision to continue his football career and jeopardise his marriage with the former model.\n\n\"When you got a chance to go 8-9 and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids, you gotta do what the f-k you gotta do,\" Hart said. \"You gotta do it.\"\n\nAnd that was just the beginning from Hart, who continued to hit Brady below the belt with jokes over his divorce.\n\nHart proceeded to compliment how well the two co-parent together and that she was there to support Brady on his big night.\n\n\"But just for full transparency, she came as Antonio Brown's plus one,\" Hart said.\n\nThe former Patriots wide receiver had trolled Brady with photoshopped pictures of his face onto Brady's body in photos of the quarterback with his ex-wife.\n\nAnd just when it looked like Hart was going to start moving onto another subject, he hit him again where it hurt.\n\n\"You f-ked him good,\" Hart said about Brady's decision to leave New England and abandon then-head coach Bill Belichick.\n\n\"You did Tom, you f-ked your coach. But let me tell you something, that's what you got to do to maintain your happiness.\n\n\"Sometimes you gotta f-k your coach. You know who else f-ked their coach? Gisele, she f-ked that karate man.\"\n\nB\u00fcndchen reportedly has been dating her jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente since June 2023. \"How did you not see this coming?\" Hart Continued. \"Eight f-king karate classes a day and she's still a white belt!\"\n\nRoss also made a swipe at Brady's divorce when he stepped to the mic after Hart, as did former Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who joked that his recent 28th wedding anniversary is something Brady would never experience.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

He went on to joke that the teleprompter should have included the qualifier \"one of the\" greatest quarterbacks ever in reference to Brady. \"The greatest is Joe Montana,\" he affirmed.\n\nHart also commented on the demographic makeup of the attendees inside the Kia Forum. \"I've never seen Inglewood so white,\" he quipped of the Los Angeles suburb where the venue is located. \"It's so fucking white in here. It looks like a Bruce Springsteen concert just let out. This used to be the home of the Lakers, now it's the home of the Quakers.\"\n\nHart went on to joke about Brady's former gig as an ambassador for failed cryptocurrency giant FTX (Brady also lost $30 million in crypto investments). \"You're saying, 'Guys, why didn't we go to the Crypto.com Arena downtown?'\" Hart said. \"Well, the reason why we didn't go there is because he didn't want to remind Tom's fans of how much money he owes them. He fucked those people. ... Fucked 'em good, didn't he?\"\n\nAfter introducing Brady -- the seven-time Super Bowl champion came onstage with brief remarks (\"Are you guys ready? Because I am\") -- Hart continued his roast.\n\n\"You know, Tom, this is crazy because for more than 20 years, Tom has ruined Sundays for football fans all over the country,\" Hart said. \"But tonight, well, tonight we're gonna ruin yours, Tom. I'm gonna ruin your fucking Sunday.\"\n\nAs might be expected, many of the jokes centered on Brady's divorce from his ex-wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, with whom he shares two kids. The jokes not only took aim at Brady but also B\u00fcndchen.\n\n\"Single life is what you deserve because you had no choice,\" Hart said. \"Gisele gave you an ultimatum. Gisele said, 'You retire or we're done.' ... Let me tell you something: When you got a chance to go eight and nine, and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids, you gotta do what the fuck you gotta do. ... You know what that's called, Tom? That's called real shit. Fuck them kids.\"\n\nHe then added Brady's coach of 18 seasons, former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, into the mix.\n\n\"The world knows that you left Bill Belichick high and dry, man,\" Hart said. \"You left him and then you went to Tampa and you won a championship. You left Bill Belichick with [quarterback] Matt Jones. ... You fucked your coach. But let me tell you something. ... That's what you gotta do to maintain your happiness. You understand, you sometimes gotta fuck your coach. You know who else fucked that coach? Gisele. She fucked that karate man.\" (That's a reference to B\u00fcndchen's reported boyfriend, jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente.)\n\n\"What an idiot,\" Hart continued. \"I mean, Jesus Christ, Tom, one of the smartest quarterbacks ever played a game. How did you not see this coming? Eight fucking karate classes a day. ... The only bruises she had were on her ass. Everybody should have known it.\"\n\nJeff Ross followed Hart, armed with his own jokes about Brady's marriage to B\u00fcndchen.\n\n\"Give it up for the lord of the Super Bowl rings: my friend Tom Brady, a man who has so many rings, he could melt them down and forge a sword to go on a quest to get Gisele back from that jiu-jitsu teacher,\" he joked. \"You're a legend, Tom. You really are. You really put the jizz in Gisele.\"\n\nRoss went on to note that Brady was drafted 199th in the NFL draft. \"You sat there for days waiting and waiting and then you were finally picked in the sixth round when Bill Belichick's dog stepped on the keyboard by accident, son,\" he quipped.\n\nRoss also referenced deflategate, the 2015 scandal in which the NFL disciplined Brady and the Patriots for lowering the inflation of game footballs, which the NFL did not allow, after saying it found evidence of the deflation during the AFC Championship Game.\n\n\"I really wanted you to be our first G.O.A.T. to be roasted because you're an example to future generations that if you work hard eat right, film the other team's practices, deflate the balls and have the NFL make new rules just for you, then you too can be the third most famous guy in a Dunkin Donuts commercial, Tommy,\" Ross joked.\n\nBelichick also appeared, to a standing ovation and loud applause, to serve up his own jokes about many of his former players who were at the event. He also brought up the English soccer team that Brady co-owns, Birmingham City.\n\n\"I see your soccer team, Birmingham City, got knocked down to another tier in the English football league,\" he said. \"So you know, for those not familiar with English football and the intricacies to their obscure regulation system, just let me say -- I'll put it in English for you: They suck. It's not so easy running a team, is it, Tom?\"\n\nHe went on: \"Seriously, Tom and I had had our differences but, you know, it only comes to love and respect about our relationship and we did some special things together, you know. For all of you out there that think about who's responsible for the patriots success during the time when Tom and I were there: Was it Brady? Was it me? Was it Brady? Was it me? In reality, the truth of the matter is it was both of us. Because of me.\"\n\nAfter Belichick exited the stage, Hart noted that he'd had jokes ready aimed at the legendary coach but said he was so touched by Belichick's appearance that he was going to forgo the jabs. (This move was confirmed to be a good one when Hart tried to explain one of the jokes that didn't go over so well, and Belichick playfully threw his handkerchief at Hart. Hart protested the move, which he likened to getting a flag thrown on a play in football.)\n\n\"I really was a little touched just the fact that you came out,\" Hart told Belichick. \"I'm dead serious right now. That was a very gentleman-like move on your behalf, Tom. You better fucking appreciate that and tell him about it later.\"\n\nNikki Glaser noted Brady's accomplishments onstage: \"Five-time Super Bowl MVP, most career wins, most career touchdowns. You have seven rings. Well, eight, now that Gisele gave hers back.\n\n\"But sorry, Tom, the only thing dumber than you saying yes to this roast was when you said, 'Hey, babe, you should try jiu jitsu.'\"\n\nGlaser continued: \"But seriously, Tom .. you're the best to ever play for too long. I mean, you retired, then you came back and then you retired again. I mean, I get it. It's hard to walk away from something that's not your pregnant girlfriend [Bridget Moynahan]. To be fair, he didn't know she was pregnant. He just thought she was getting fat and Tom hates fat.\"\n\nGlaser also had a through-line of how attractive she finds Brady: \"To be honest, Tom, I didn't really know a ton about your career before this and I only really started watching football when Taylor Swift said it was OK. But what I've learned, I'm in a absolute awe of you. You were a sixth-round draft pick that really everyone kind of counted out, no one believed in. And then you became this, you became the greatest of all time. And if I've learned anything, if I've learned anything about this man is that if you tell Tom Brady, he can't do something. Not only will he do it, but he'll do it the best it's ever been done. So I'm here to say tonight, Tom Brady cannot make me come.\"\n\nWill Ferrell appeared in character as Ron Burgundy, his character in the Anchorman films, also remarked on Brady's looks.\n\n\"This man is gorgeous. ... Look at those cheekbones. That's a million-watt smile right there. ... I could get lost in those eyes and right now I am that person. Ron, pull it together. You're a straight man. He's making you question your sexuality. Stop looking at him. You're here to make fun of him. Not fall in love. Concentrate.\n\n\"I never liked you Tom in all my years of watching professional football. I never saw a more boring quarterback,\" he said, later adding: \"He actually made me look forward to all the fun and laughter of a Bill Belichick postgame interview.\"\n\nKim Kardashian also took the stage, noting the rumors that once swirled that the two were dating. \"I know there were some rumors that we were, and I'd never say if we did or not,\" she said. \"I'd just release a tape.\"\n\nShe went on: \"But I do know it would never work out,\" noting that Brady is a former athlete with strong cheekbones and \"silky hair.\"\n\n\"You remind me too much of my stepdad now,\" she quipped of Caitlyn Jenner. \"Oh, part of me thinks you would want to [date] me just to try on my clothes. I know the transition from the NFL must have been really hard. But I think my stepdad is a great example for you. She's one of the best athletes in the world who proved you can do anything in this next chapter of your life. You can become a commentator or a far-right-wing Republican or even a strong confident woman.\"\n\nShe added: \"Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast you. But I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players,\" she joked of her late father, Robert Kardashian, who was on O.J. Simpson's defense team during the latter's murder trial.\n\nBrady's former teammate Julian Edelman -- who referred to the Super Bowl champ as \"Leonardo DiCaprio's ex-girlfriend's ex-husband\" -- joked about what his and Brady's teammates used to call a \"bromance\" between the two.\n\n\"I know there's going to be a lot of jokes about me being gay for Tom,\" Edelman said. \"Well, let me set the record straight. Those balls weren't going to deflate themselves.\"\n\nFor his part, Brady laughed along with the jabs, though he did seem a bit uncomfortable amid some of the harsher B\u00fcndchen jokes. But one joke seemed to irk him more than others. During his turn onstage, Ross quipped: \"So Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the [Patriots] owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\" Brady then approached Ross, who'd blown a kiss Kraft's way, and said in his ear: \"Don't say that shit again.\" Ross replied, \"OK.\"\n\nThe joke was a reference to a 2019 incident in which Kraft was charged with soliciting prostitution after an investigation into massage parlors in Florida. Police said they had recorded Kraft paying for sex acts. He pleaded not guilty, and a federal judge in later ordered that the recordings be destroyed after it was found they were filmed unlawfully. The case was dismissed later that year.\n\nAt the end of the night, Brady took the stage. \"People ask: 'Tom, why would you do this roast?'\" he added. \"It's simple. I can take all the hits. I would have done this earlier, but I've just been too busy winning championships.\"\n\nHe also got back at some of his roasters.\n\nOn Peyton Manning: \"Thank you so much for coming out to L.A. to do this. I know sometimes you live in Denver and sometimes you live in Louisiana, but you'll always live in my shadow.\"\n\nOn Hart: \"I've heard some people talk about me having bad knees. You know, my knees are so fucked up, Kevin, because I spent so many goddamn hours on the floor begging Netflix to get [Dave] Chappelle to host this.\"\n\nOn Kardashian: \"Thank you so much for being here. I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this, but because her kids are home with their dad,\" Kanye West.\n\nOn NFL commissioner Roger Goodell (who was not present): \"Remember deflategate? The NFL spent $20 million and found that it was more probable than not that I was generally aware that someone may have deflated my footballs. You could have just given me the $20 million, and I would just told you I fucking did it.\"\n\nOn Kansas City fans: \"You say your stadium is the loudest. It helps when all your fans are 14-year-old girls. And in honor of Tay-Tay [Taylor Swift], let's take a look at the Chiefs 'eras': terrible for 50 years, good for five. Shake it off.\"\n\nOn Belichick: \"Everybody asked me which ring is my favorite. I used to say the next one, but now that I'm retired, my favorite ring is the camera that caught coach Belichick slinking out of that poor girl's house at 6 a.m. a few months ago. Hey, you still got it. .... You know, we've been through so much and after two decades, I finally had to admit that all along it was you. You're the reason for the Patriots dynasty because you Bill Belichick, you are a true coaching genius. I mean, you had to choose between an aging injured, overpaid Drew Bledsoe and a young healthy minimum-wage superstar. I could have got a fucking coach from Hawks Foxborough fucking high school to make that decision. ... I've been out of the game for a minute. So I'm curious, how many Super Bowl Rings have you won since I left?\"\n\nThe three-hour-plus roast, which was part of the Netflix Is a Joke Fest, was streamed live, which Netflix touted as the first-ever roast to be telecast live, unedited. The festivities, held at L.A.'s Kia Forum in Inglewood, kicked off shortly after 4 p.m., with guests filing into the arena. DJ Trauma spun some beats as stars in the front section took their seats at banquet style tables.\n\nAmong the other bold-faced names in attendance were Ben Affleck, Jim Gaffigan, Amanda Kloots, Richard Kind, Chelsea Handler and Dane Cook, along with NFL pros Rob Gronkowski (who also wound up as the butt of many of the evening's jokes), Randy Moss, Rodney Harrison, Julian, Edelman and Matt Light.\n\nJudging from the scene inside and around the Forum, you would be forgiven for thinking that Sunday's event was a typical big ticket football game. The show, which was a ticketed event for sale to the general public, drew hordes of Brady fans who arrived decked out in football jerseys. The majority were decked out on New England Patriots gear, while others were wearing Tampa Bay Buccaneers jerseys to represent the NFL team where he closed out his iconic career.\n\nThe roast was executive produced by Brady, Casey Patterson, Ross, Hart and Jeff Clanagan for Hartbeat.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors":

The 46-year-old signed up to the show, a star-studded production billed as the 'Greatest Roast of All Time', knowing it would be full of controversy.\n\nTopics all considered fair game for jokes included the legendary quarter-back's much-publicised divorce from Gisele after 13 years of marriage. Plus his former side the New England Patriots' multiple cheating scandals, his sexuality, and even his looks.\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump and Jake Paul among celebs at Miami GP as F1 fans call to 'cancel the race'\n\nREAD MORE: Paige Spiranac wows at Kentucky Derby in busty dress before three-horse photo finish\n\nFormer team-mate at the New England Patriots, Drew Bledsoe, told Brady: \"I've experienced a couple of things that you'll never experience. The feeling of being the No. 1 overall draft pick in the NFL. And a 28th wedding anniversary; it was yesterday.\"\n\nAnd his break-up with Gisele certainly wasn't off limits when Kevin Hart took to the mic, with the US comedian also taking aim at the model's jiu-jitsu trainer boyfriend Joaquim Valente. He joked that Brady left Patriots coach Bill Belichick \"high and dry\" when he ditched the side for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nWhat do you think was the best joke in the roast? Let us know in the comments section below\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Sky Sports is the only way to watch all the action this year.\n\n\u00a322 a month\n\nSky Get it here\n\nTelling Brady that he \"f***ed him good\", Hart added: \"You did, Tom, you f***ed your coach, but let me tell you something people... that's what you've got to do to maintain your happiness.\"\n\nBrady smiled but looked distinctly uncomfortable as Hart then delivered the killer blow. He said: \"You sometimes got to f*** your coach. You know who else f***ed their coach? Gisele. She f***ed that karate man.\n\n\"I mean Jesus Christ, Tom. One of the smartest quarterbacks ever played a game. How did you not see this coming? Eight f***ing karate classes a day,\" the comedian said.\n\n\"Eight karate classes a day and she's still a white belt. F*** Tom. The only bruises she had were on her ass. everybody should have known it,\" he joked. Brady held up this drink and took a few stern sips before shaking his head.\n\nThat joke followed Gisele denying speculation that she began her romance with Valente before splitting up with Brady. \"That's a lie,\" she told the New York Times. \"This is something that happens to a lot of women who get blamed when they have the courage to leave an unhealthy relationship and are labelled as being unfaithful.\"\n\nGisele and Valente first met in December 2021, but reportedly did not start dating until June 2023. They were spotted together in Miami and Costa Rica in 2022, but she insisted at that stage they were just friends.\n\nBrady and Gisele - who share son, Benjamin, 14, and daughter, Vivian, 11, from a 13-year marriage, finalised their divorce in October 2022. Brady also has a son, Jack, 16, with ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan.\n\nHowever, it was another subject that really triggered the NFL icon, as America's 'Roastmaster General' Jeff Ross referred to a scenario when Brady introduced himself to Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\n\"Tom became a Patriot, moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, I'm the greatest decision your organisation has ever made... would you like a massage,\" Ross joked.\n\nThe gag was a reference to when Kraft was charged with soliciting a prostitute back in 2019, which drew gasp and laughs from across the room. But Brady appeared unimpressed and approached Ross mid-set.\n\n\"Don't say that s*** again,\" Brady said with a smile, while his hand poorly covered up the microphone.\n\nKraft was one of 25 people facing a misdemeanour charge for soliciting prostitution at a Florida day spa in February 2019. He pleaded not guilty and the charges were dropped in September of 2019 after a Florida appeals court ruled his constitutional rights were violated.\n\nKraft's attorneys revealed hidden cameras were installed at the spa before he visited under the guise of a response to a bomb threat. In March that year Kraft had told the media he was \"truly sorry,\" adding: \"I know I have hurt and disappointed my family, my close friends, my co-workers, our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_docking@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Neil Docking", "type":

She said you have to retire or you're done. But when you have a chance to go 8-9 you gotta do it,\" Hart said before joking that Brady \"f-ked\" coach Bill Belichick by leaving the New England Patriots for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\"You f-ked him good. You did, Tom, you f-ked your coach, but let me tell you something people ... that's what you've got to do to maintain your happiness. You sometimes got to f-k your coach. You know who else f-ked their coach? Gisele. She f-ked that karate man.\"\n\nHart continued: \"I mean Jesus Christ, Tom. One of the smartest quarterbacks ever played a game. How did you not see this coming? Eight f-king karate classes a day. ... Eight karate classes a day and she's still a white belt. F-k Tom. The only bruises she had were on her ass. everybody should have known it.\"\n\nBrady and B\u00fcndchen, who share two kids, split in 2022 after 13 years of marriage. The supermodel was first spotted with Valente in 2022, but denied having an affair. The twosome went public in early 2024, with a source telling Us that their friendship turned romantic during the summer of 2023.\n\nWhile Jeff Ross struck a nerve when he made a joke about Patriots owner Robert Kraft's massage scandal -- leading Brady to whisper \"don't say that s-t again\" at the mic -- Ross also quipped that Brady could \"melt his Super Bowl rings back together to get Gisele back from that jiu-jitsu teacher.\"\n\nOne-time Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe -- who Brady replaced as the starter on the team in 2001 -- joked how Brady didn't get sacked often throughout his career, quipping he was \"pretty used to not being touched. Just like at the end of the marriage.\"\n\nHe then joked that there's two things he has experienced that Brady never will: being a first round draft pick (Brady was drafted in the sixth round) and a 28th wedding anniversary. \"It was yesterday,\" Bledsoe said of wife Maura.\n\nNikki Glaser -- who was the first to joke about Brady's past split from then-pregnant Bridget Moynahan -- did not hold back with the B\u00fcndchen jokes.\n\n\"You have seven rings. Well, eight now that Gisele gave hers back,\" Glaser said of his seven Super Bowl wins. (Former teammate Randy Moss made a callback to the joke during his set, telling fans to vote on whether Brady should give him a Super Bowl ring or the ring B\u00fcndchen gave back.)\n\nAs Brady appeared slightly uncomfortable with all of the attention of his ex-wife, Glaser noted that the \"only thing dumber\" than Brady agreeing to do this roast was telling Gisele to do jiu-jitsu. She then made an NSFW joke: \"Your ex wife's new boyfriend can kick your ass while eating hers.\"\n\nThings took a dark turn when Tom Segura and Bert Kreischer displayed Photoshopped picture of Hitler with Brady, saying, \"The only difference between Tom Brady and Hitler is that Hitler stuck with his wife until the end.\"\n\nFormer teammate Julian Edelman joked about Brady's many nicknames, including the GOAT, quipping: \"Or as I like to call him, Leonardo DiCaprio's ex-girlfriend's ex-husband.\" (B\u00fcndchen and DiCaprio dated from 2000 to 2005.) The wide receiver then made a joke that played into quips about Brady's looks and sexuality: \"When your wife left, I thought about getting rid my beard too.\"\n\nAndrew Schulz joked about Brady needing a lawyer. \"That's why Dana [White] is here, so you can learn how to f-k a Brazilian out of half their purse,\" he said. \"Tom was once asked which one of his rings was his favorite and he said, 'The next one.' Sorry that was a Gisele quote. My bad.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_hearon@usmagazine.com", "name": "Sarah Hearon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermodel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermodel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Schulz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Schulz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Kreischer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bert Kreischer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Segura", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Segura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Moynahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridget Moynahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randy Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leonardo DiCaprio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2-feature-Tom-Brady-Roast.jpg?crop=0px%2C29px%2C1333px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 102, "textEnd": 107}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

UFC founder Dana White, Patriots' owner Robert Kraft and even Kim Kardashian made appearances as well.\n\nThat last name mentioned may come as a bit of a surprise, but following Brady's divorce from Gisele, there were rampant rumors regarding Brady and Kardashian seeing one another. During her \"toast\" Kim K took advantage of the situation by addressing the dating rumors and taking a shot at Brady along with her stepparent Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nDon't worry though, when it was Brady's turn on the mic he made sure to return the favor to Kim by taking a shot at her former husband and father of her children, Kanye West.\n\nThe speculation regarding the relationship between Brady and Kardashian may have only grown following the live airing of the Netflix special.

It also may have erased a couple of awkward moments that appeared to occur between Kraft and ex-Patriots coach Bill Belichick.\n\nAlthough the assumed rift between Brady and Belichick has been the main storyline following the dismantling of the Patriot dynasty, the gap between Kraft and his former coach may be much larger and grow wider with each passing day. The Dynasty, a Kraft-copyrighted series on Apple TV that highlighted Brady and diminished Belichick, that was released a couple of months ago certainly added to the chasm.\n\nDuring his time at the mic on Sunday night, Belichick addressed the docuseries. \"Seriously, I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix,\" he said. \"Not to be confused with the 10-part Bill Belichick roast during the Apple TV doc.\"\n\nThough Kraft didn't single out Belichick by name, it was fairly obvious who he was referencing during his time with the mic when he compared the Patriot-heavy roast to a family reunion. \"Like many family reunions, there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid,\" Kraft said.\n\nThe jokes were playful, but it was hard not to notice that Kraft and Belichick were seated about as far away from each other as possible on the roasting stage and that the latter clearly appeared uncomfortable when Kevin Hart called for him to take a shot with the former. Regardless of his feelings, a grin-less Belichick did step to center stage and down some tequila with Kraft, but it looked as if the ceremonial gesture may have burned him as much as the alcohol.\n\nOf course, given that Mr. \"Do Your Job\" is now looking for one and can ill afford for Kraft to torpedo his employment search again (allegedly), Belichick will probably place nice, for a time. That time may be up when the Patriots honor Brady in about a month on 6/12/24, a date which may live in infamy.

Before roasting Brady, the 72-year-old took aim at Patriots owner Robert Kraft with a ruthless shot at his former employer:\n\n\"I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix, not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10 Part doc.\"\n\nAlso Read: New England Patriots' Latest Move Makes It Clear They Want Nothing To Do With Bill Belichick And His Legacy Anymore\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Apple TV+ produced a 10-part series on the Patriots' two-decade run of dominance called \"The Dynasty.\" Many fans and former Patriots players were highly critical of the docuseries, believing it was meant to paint Belichick in a bad light.\n\nAfter waiting for several weeks, fans finally got a response from Bill Belichick, who's known for being a man of very few words. Though it's unlikely to happen, it sure would be fun to see Mr. Kraft respond to this roast...\n\nIt's well-known by now that Belichick's relationships with Brady and Kraft did not end on the best of notes.

But Belichick came to play, dropping a one-liner right off the bat by calling out his portrayal in the Apple TV+ docuseries, \"The Dynasty.\"\n\n\"I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix. It's not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10-part Apple TV series,\" Belichick joked.\n\nBelichick didn't hold back on Brady, either, addressing their at-times-strenuous relationship by bringing up a reported sore spot: Brady's personal trainer, Alex Guerrero.\n\n\"People have said it, Tom and I butted heads a lot,\" Belichick said. \"And in a way that was true. But it was hard to butt heads with Tom, because he was so far up Alex Guerrero's ass.\"\n\nBetween Sunday's roast and his appearance on The Pat McAfee Show during the 2024 NFL Draft, Belichick is showing a much more congenial side -- and perhaps making NFL fans forget that he failed to land a head coaching job this offseason.\n\nBelichick kept his burns of former Patriots players mostly off the field, with one notable exception: ex-Patriots wide receiver Danny Amendola.\n\n\"Danny joined us in 2014 and got us 200 yards that year,\" Belichick said. \"And in 2016, he picked up another 250. Or to put it another way, what Randy (Moss) would call a decent first half.\"\n\nAmendola was fairly critical of Belichick in the Apple TV+ docuseries -- \"I could've gotten the kid from Foxborough High School to tell you that you shouldn't have let Tom Brady go,\" Amendola said in one episode -- so was Belichick's chance for a rebuttal. Amendola didn't seem particularly amused by Belichick's dig, so we're chalking this up as a loss.\n\nNot only did Harrison avoid getting roasted Sunday night, he actually got an endorsement from Belichick, who made another case for the ex-Patriots safety to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\n\"One of the greatest players I've ever coached,\" Belichick said of Harrison. \"He was a great, great football player. Great person. Great competitor. He's not in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and to me, that might be the biggest joke of the night.\"\n\nWhether Harrison eventually gets the nod is unclear -- he was one of 28 semifinalists in 2023 -- but there's no doubt Belichick is in his corner.\n\nMoss is a dynamic personality -- he was excellent in \"The Dynasty\" -- but his roast of Brady fell disappointingly flat. The Hall of Fame receiver mostly lamented not winning a ring during his three seasons in New England from 2007 to 2010 and made a passing reference to Deflategate, telling Brady, \"Why the f--- didn't we cheat when I was there?\"\n\nMoss' performance certainly wasn't the worst of the night, but expectations were higher here.\n\nBelichick and his former players had some pretty good material, but most of it paled in comparison to the real comedians in the house -- especially Nikki Glaser.\n\nThe comedian/actress/podcast host came out swinging in her set with some vicious digs about Brady's divorce from Gisele and rumors that Gisele is now dating her jiu-jitsu instructor.\n\n\"The only thing dumber than you saying yes to this roast is when you said, 'Hey babe, you should try jiu-jitsu,\" Glaser quipped.\n\nGlaser also made several more jokes we can't repeat here, but she was undoubtedly one of the stars of the show.\n\nWhy was Kardashian at Brady's roast, you ask? Apparently many in attendance had the same question.\n\nKardashian was the only roaster who was loudly booed when she took the stage -- to the point where host Kevin Hart had to tell the audience to stop -- and didn't really contribute much during her brief set.\n\nThe Patriots' dynasty ended with plenty of drama and reported infighting. But on Sunday night, the key figures finally let their guards down.\n\nBrady and Belichick both declared their mutual respect for one another after trading good-natured barbs. Belichick and Kraft took a shot together on stage (even if Belichick didn't look particularly thrilled to be there). Brady addressed one of the several elephants in the room with a Deflategate joke.\n\nSeveral topics that many Patriots fans thought would never be discussed in public were aired out by the dynasty's main actors, who cut out the \"middle man\" and addressed some of their thornier issues head-on.\n\nIn a way, Sunday night felt like closure for New England fans, who now can focus on celebrating those six Super Bowls in 20 years instead of wondering how the dynasty fell apart.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [],

Meanwhile, Belichick departed the Patriots in January this year, marking an end to his 24 years there.\n\nThere had been plenty of stories regarding the friction between the pair in recent years. No wonder fans were thrilled when they heard they would be reunited for Netflix's hit show.\n\nMeanwhile, Blues fans have also seen the funny side to the NFL legends' banter.\n\n\"Bill Belichick taking the piss out of Birmingham City for being relegated at the Brady Roast,\" one fan wrote on X. \"When we win the Champions League in 2030, this will be the first clip in the winners story montage.\"\n\nAnother said: \"We are massive!!!

Tom Brady addressed \"Deflategate\" at the roast, leading to various interpretations of his comments on the scandal. Some may argue that Brady admitted fault in the scandal, while others will claim that the longtime QB was merely poking fun at the league's vendetta against him.\n\nThe Roast of Tom Brady happened on Netflix last night, and the event didn't fail to live up to the hype.\n\nBill Belichick got in on the roasting action, as did longtime tight end and Brady favorite Rob Gronkowski. All in all, it was a hilarious trip down memory lane for those who fondly (or not so fondly) remember the career of the former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Bucaneers quarterback.\n\nHowever, arguably the most impactful juncture of the night came towards the end of the proceedings, as Brady took the mic to address the disses he had been served throughout the roast. It was then that Brady addressed the infamous \"Deflategate\" scandal.\n\nThe comments got a standing ovation out of the notoriously mundane Belichick, and garnered looks of shock from Gronkowski and Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nThough it's impossible to say exactly what Brady's intentions were with the remarks, it was the most memorable moment from a night full of them.\n\nRelated Bucs GM: Proving Everybody Wrong After Brady Retirement Is 'Part Of Our DNA' The Tampa Bay Buccaneers proved everyone wrong during the 2023 season, winning their division. Their GM claims its 'part of their DNA'. Did Brady Admit Fault in \"Deflategate\"? There have been a few interpretations of the QB's quote making the rounds since last night\n\nFor those that didn't have a chance to watch the roast (or couldn't view the Twitter/X clip above), the most pertinent quote from Brady regarded the league's extensive (and expensive) investigation into the \"Deflategate\" scandal:\n\n\"The NFL spent $20 million and found that it was more probable than not that I was generally aware that someone may have deflated my footballs... you could've just given me the $20M, and I would've just told you I f**king did it.\"\n\nNow, there are a couple of interpretations one could make about Brady's quote, though which side you fall on may have more to do with your feelings towards the greatest quarterback ever rather than an actual attempt at deciphering the meaning of the remark itself.\n\nOne interpretation is that Brady is making fun of Roger Goodell and the league for wasting so much time and so many resources on the investigation, given that he wasn't complicit in the scandal. In that sense, Brady is saying that the league should've just handed him the money they used to look into the scandal, and he would've admitted to guilt to save everyone time.\n\nAnother (less generous) reading of the quote is that Brady, after nearly three hours of getting roasted and downing many drinks, simply slipped up or decided he needed to get an eight-year weight off his chest. It's hard to believe that Brady would ever admit to such a thing given his otherwise impervious standing atop the league's greatest signal caller charts, but it is hilarious to imagine him giving Goodell the proverbial middle finger now that he's retired.\n\nOf course, you could just chalk it up to an inebriated guy playing into the comedic theme of the night. Though not as fun for discussion and tabloid purposes, it's possible that Brady was just engaging in some self-deprecating humor for the sake of the roast.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: Regardless of whether Brady was actually guilty in \"Deflategate\", he quickly proved he didn't need deflated footballs to be the GOAT. After serving a four-game suspension to start the 2016 season due to the scandal, he finished second in regular season MVP voting before leading the greatest comeback in NFL history during the Super Bowl (the 28-3 game versus the Atlanta Falcons), earning an unprecedented fourth Super Bowl MVP.\n\nNo matter how you interpret Brady's jab at the whole situation, the roast itself was an entertaining event that drew a star-studded crowd and team of roasters. Though it sounds like the greatest QB to ever play the game has no intention of making a comeback, spectacles like this can serve as a fun (or traumatic, if you're a Jets fan) reminder of his playing days.\n\nSource: Netflix\n\nRelated Patriots Don't See Brady Returning To Play -- They Have Other Ideas for the GOAT Could Tom Brady return to the NFL sidelines as a coach?", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_finger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The finger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tom-brady-at-netflix-roast.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

But while the guest of honor took most of the jokes in stride -- even about his highly publicized divorce -- the joke that went too far for Brady involved New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nBrady spent 20 seasons with the Patriots, and his relationship with Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick is generally regarded to be one of the most successful sports dynasties of all time. But Brady was hardly a \"get\" during the 2000 NFL draft, being selected 199th overall, as roastmaster Jeff Ross pointed out about five minutes into his set at the podium.\n\n\"He sat there for days, waiting and waiting, and then you were finally picked in the sixth round when Bill Belichick's dog stepped on the keyboard by accident,\" Ross quipped.\n\nHe then recalled the story when Brady, as a wet-behind-the-ears rookie, told Kraft upon being drafted, \"I'm the best decision your organization has ever made.\" The audience went wild with applause until Ross let the other shoe drop, adding: \"Would you like a massage?\"\n\nThe comedian was referring to the scandal in which Kraft was among over two dozen people busted in a prostitution sting at a Boston massage parlor in 2019. The charges were eventually dropped, but suffice to say, Brady was not amused.\n\nThe squeaky clean 46-year-old got up from his seat on the stage and approached Ross, whispering into his ear: \"Don't say that s--t again.\"\n\nA nervous-looking Ross relented. \"OK, OK. He's having fun, look at him,\" he said, gesturing to Kraft, who appeared to be laughing it off. \"I love what you do for the Jews, Robert Kraft. You're incredible.\"\n\nAccording to CBS News, the awkward exchange wasn't heard by those seated in the audience, but millions watching at home caught it. At any rate, after Ross' set, the two appeared to have gotten over it, as the pair hugged onstage and smiled as they chatted before moving on with the show.\n\nBut while it's a possibility that the moment was scripted for the show, John Breech of CBS Sports surmised that Brady did indeed seem prickled by the joke.\n\n\"It's certainly possible this was all part of the act, but it definitely felt like Brady was legitimately upset with the joke,\" Breech wrote. \"On a night where there were plenty of uncomfortable jokes, this seemed to be the only one that truly got under Brady's skin.\"", "source": {"uri": "mensjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Men's Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stacey_ritzen@mensjournal.com", "name": "Stacey Ritzen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Medical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Medical", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.mensjournal.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQzNDcwNTYwNDcwNDI3/tom-brady-jeff-ross.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

But then seconds later got up from his seat, reached the podium and whispered to Ross: \"Don't say that s--- again.\"\n\nRoss kept smiling, thew up his hands and said \"OK, OK, OK\" before the show went on without any Will Smith/Chris Rock-syle drama.\n\nThe whole moment was caught on camera and microphones picked up Brady's admonishment during the live special.\n\nKraft was accused of paying for sex acts at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida, in January 2019. The Patriots owner pleaded not guilty, but issued a public apology for what happened.\n\nBut more than 1 1/2 years later, Florida prosecutors dropped solicitation charges after an appeals court ruled video and audio surveillance of Kraft was inadmissible. The court said Jupiter police violated the rights of Kraft and others when they secretly installed video cameras inside massage rooms.\n\nBrady curiously drew the line at Kraft during a night filled with offensive jokes, which included shots at the QB's family and love life -- and even one-liners about deceased teammate and accused murderer Aaron Hernandez.\n\nBrady used Hernandez in his roast of tight end Rob Gronkowski.\n\n\"The bar for Patriots tight ends was pretty low back then, block, catch, don't murder,\" Brady said to a room of mixed laughs and groans.\n\nComic Nikki Glaser teased former Pats wide receiver Randy Moss also made light of Hernandez's jailhouse suicide.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_k_li@aol.com", "name": "David K.

Let's get into it.\n\nKevin Hart was the emcee and started the show with a string of jokes about the dissolution of Brady's marriage to Gisele B\u00fcndchen.

You left him and then you went to Tampa and you won a championship,\" Hart said. \"That's what you gotta do to maintain your happiness. Sometimes you gotta fuck your coach. You know who else fucked their coach? Gisele. She fucked that karate man.\"\n\nB\u00fcndchen's new man is actually a jiujitsu instructor, but that's neither here nor there. Brady suffered through what felt like hours of Gisele jokes and did it all with a toothy smile plastered across his face. The lack of light in his eyes told a different story, however.\n\nJeff Ross came out dressed as \"Roast J. Simpson,\" wearing a football uniform detailed with flames (he arrived \"from hell\") and a pair of leather gloves. \"If the glove don't fit, you must talk shit,\" he said. The comedian, most famous for his roasting skills, followed through on that promise and produced the most tense moment of the night.\n\nRoss wound up by recounting a moment when Brady, drafted 199th in the NFL, walked into Patriots owner Robert Kraft's office and said, \"I'm the best decision your organization has ever made.\" The audience gave a big round of applause before Ross delivered the punch line: \"Would you like a massage?\"\n\nThe arena erupted with laughter at Ross's reference to Kraft's 2019 arrest for soliciting prostitution at a Florida massage parlor. Brady kept his smile glued to his face but went up to Ross at the podium and audibly told the comedian, \"Don't say that shit again.\" Was he joking? Well, as we learned later in the evening, Brady can be pretty funny, but it's unclear if he's that funny.\n\nOf all the roasters, Nikki Glaser might have gotten the biggest reaction of the night. The stand-up comic and roast regular received a standing ovation for her razor-sharp set, which, of course, included several jokes about B\u00fcndchen.\n\n\"Tom Brady: five-time Super Bowl MVP, most career wins, most career touchdowns,\" Glaser said. \"You have seven rings -- well, eight, now that Gisele gave hers back.\"\n\n\"The only thing dumber than saying 'yes' to this roast was when you said, 'Hey, babe, you should try jiujitsu,'\" Glaser joked. \"How much must that suck to know that your ex-wife's new boyfriend can beat your ass while eating hers?\"\n\nKim Kardashian came onstage and was greeted with boos from the audience. Like a true professional, she brushed it off and dived right into her prepared jokes.\n\nSomeone continued to heckle her from the audience as she began to address the rumor that she and Brady had briefly dated.\n\n\"I do know it would never work out,\" Kardashian said. \"An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair -- you remind me too much of my stepdad now.\" A meme was then put onscreen that had four photos of Brady through the years and then two photos of Caitlyn Jenner. \"The Evolution of Tom Brady\" was written over them in case you really couldn't put it together yourself.\n\nThis got a big laugh from the room and from Brady himself. He actually seemed to be the person who found Kardashian the funniest. Maybe they really did date.\n\nOver two and a half hours into the roast, it was time for Brady to make some jokes. This is the inherent flaw of a celebrity roast. The show's closer is usually the least funny person on the stage. Brady did well enough, but he is not beating the robot allegations anytime soon. He joked about Taylor Swift and the Chiefs. (\"Kansas City, you say your stadium is the loudest? It helps when your fans are 14-year-old girls.\") He took a shot at Kanye West. (\"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight -- not because of this but because her kids are at home with their dad.\") He even made a joke about B\u00fcndchen, though it was fairly meek in comparison to everyone else's:\n\n\"There's been a lot of jokes tonight, but the truth is I miss the love of my life: football,\" he said. Not the best, not the worst -- a fitting cap for the entire evening.", "source": {"uri": "thecut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Cut"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olivia_craighead@thecut.com",

Now HE was hung.\"\n\nHoly...\n\nFor anyone who doesn't get the joke, Edelman is referring to former Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, who was convicted of murder before committing suicide in prison back in 2017.\n\nAnd apparently Gronk wasn't expecting the Hernandez reference, because it looked like he was in shock - as the whole crowd collectively gasped:\n\nIt wasn't the only Aaron Hernandez reference at the roast though: Comedian Nikki Glaser also got in a joke while taking a jab at former Patriots wide receiver Randy Moss for not having a Super Bowl ring.", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Hernandez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Hernandez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Gronk-Brady-Roast.png?fit=1200%2C805&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The old Friars Club roasts in New York City may have gone longer and featured as much raunch back in the day, but none of those events were ever live streamed globally to a potential audience in the mega millions.\n\nKevin Hart set the tone and the bar below the belt from the get-go as the roast's host, saying this about the Forum's previous sports dynasty owners of the 1980s Los Angeles Lakers. \"They called this place Showtime because Jerry Buss used to show everybody his dick in this building,\" Hart joked. \"A lot of nasty shit has happened in this building ... I wish I had a blacklight right now, I'd turn that bitch on now so y'all can see all the cum stains you sitting on in these nasty-ass seats.\" He then cackled, adding: \"Hahaha! That's right. You better get comfortable being uncomfortable, baby!\"\n\nEveryone who followed Hart piled on Brady and each other. Athletes and comedians alike mocked the retired QB over his divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen, insinuated gay jokes about his on-field relationship with receiver Julian Edelman and off-field one with nutritionist Alex Guerrero, made light of the suicide of former teammate and convicted murderer Aaron Hernandez, made fun of Brady for making and losing money off his relationship with cryptocurrency fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried. There also were countless jokes referencing the so-called Spygate and Deflategate scandals that plagued the Patriots during Brady's tenure leading the team -- several of which prompted loud cheers from a live L.A. audience packed with jersey-wearing Pats fans.\n\nBefore Hart even brought up the first roaster, he turned to Brady, cackling: \"What an idiot! Why would you do this? What an idiot!\"\n\nAmong the comedians, roast veteran Nikki Glaser scored the most points from the podium, even earning a standing ovation from the Forum audience. Among the athletes, Edelman brought the most heat in his time to shine, while Brady's favorite target on the field in Rob Gronkowski proved he could be the biggest butt of the jokes throughout the evening.\n\nHere's a rundown of the metaphorical end-zone dances and penalty flags thrown during the three-hour spectacle.\n\nJeff Ross may call himself the \"Roastmaster General,\" but Brady almost served him a dishonorable discharge only 26 minutes into the event, standing up to get in Ross's ear and bark, \"Don't say that shit again!\" after Ross jokingly suggested that Brady introduced himself to Robert Kraft in 2000 by offering him a massage -- a reference to the Pats owner's biggest public scandal.\n\nAt the 40-minute mark, Glaser scored multiple times by slinging zingers at the expense of Brady, Hart, and Gronk. Among the two biggest laugh lines, she first told Brady: \"You have seven rings. Well, eight now that Gisele gave hers back. I'm sorry, Tom. Tom, the only thing dumber than you saying yes to this roast was when you said, hey babe, you should try jiu-jitsu. I think -- that's gotta suck. Dude.\" But then she followed up with this line that had everyone howling: \"Tom also lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that? I mean, even Gronk was like: 'Me know that not real money.'\"\n\nIn a moment the Netflix audience didn't see but everyone in the Forum saw on their own big screens, a joke by comedian Sam Jay took a wildly unexpected turn when she attempted to take down fellow comedian Bert Kreischer, calling him \"a disgrace to the legacy of fat funny superstars\" such as John Belushi and Chris Farley and declaring: \"If you were actually talented, you would have overdosed in a hotel room a long time ago.\" When Jay claimed Kreischer doesn't even do drugs, Kreischer pulled out a small baggie and pointed to his nose, prompting an eruption in the arena. Jay would get a standing ovation from her fellow comedians a few minutes later with a joke at Drew Bledsoe's expense for losing his job to Brady due to an injury in 2001.\n\n\"The only ring you have is the one Tom won for you,\" Jay told Bledsoe. \"So your Super Bowl ring is just like my strap-on. Just because you wear it doesn't make it real.\"\n\nToward the halfway point, Will Ferrell made a surprise appearance as his Anchorman character Ron Burgundy, but he failed to get the mostly Patriots crowd in the arena to join him in chanting \"Eli Manning made Tom Brady his bitch!\" But he shrugged it off, claiming: \"Actually, as disjointed as that was, that felt good.\"\n\nHe then introduced former Patriots coach Bill Belichick, who called Ferrell's Burgundy \"the only member of the media I respect\" and slagged Apple TV+ for its series on them, The Dynasty, referring to it as \"The Roast of Bill Belichick on the 10-part Apple TV series.\" But Belichick's most successful topical joke came by knocking Brady for his part-ownership in the English football squad, Birmingham City, which just got relegated down to the third tier league over the weekend. \"Not so easy running a team, is it Tom?\" Belichick beamed.\n\nDespite Pats owner Robert Kraft getting himself involved in his alma mater Columbia University's response to ongoing campus protests, the only joke even referencing the current situation in the Middle East came from Edelman, who directed this joke at Ross near the 1-hour, 46-minute mark: \"Fun fact: Jeff and I are both Jewish. The difference is I'm the kind of Jew that people look and go, 'Oh, he's Jewish?' And Jeff's the kind of Jew that makes you want to join Hamas.\"\n\nBut it was all of the homosexual innuendos that prompted Hart to pause before moving the show along, admonishing the former NFL players. \"This is live on Netflix! Like millions of people watching!\" Hart declared. \"Two white boys. Your dick, my dick, my balls, your balls, what the fuck is happening? It's live television! No, Julian, no! Tom, you're supposed to tackle him.\"\n\nThings only got more awkward when Hart introduced comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who introduced UFC founder Dana White sitting next to him at one of the tables, who promptly stood and took the mike to say: \"It pisses me off. I flew all the way out here and you guys give me 60 seconds? My name is Dana. Is that not trans enough for you liberal fucks?\" After a lack of response, White replied: \"No?\" then delivered multiple jokes implying Brady was gay.\n\nHinchcliffe got things back on track by walking up to the dais and singling people out as he walked, scoring big laughs. To Jay, Hinchliffe said: \"Sam Jay everybody, killed. An obese African-American lesbian. So by having her, Netflix checked off a lot of boxes. She's a black lesbo, which means she doesn't eat pussy, she aw hell (g)naws on it.\" And to Kreischer, he said: \"Bert Kreischer is a king. He looks like if the Tiger King the Liver King only ate Burger King and had a liver that looked like if Martin Luther King got beat up by Rodney King.\" And then he closed by turning to Kim Kardashian, who earlier almost got booed out of the building, by giving her this advice: \"Close your legs. You've got more public beef than Kendrick and Drake.\"\n\nWhen it was finally Gronkowski's turn at the podium, he had trouble reading the prompter and went off script, patting himself on the back for it after one of his many sexually profane jokes by announcing: \"I'm creative. You guys all think I'm a dumb piece of fucking shit, but...well, I really am. I really am. Fucking, I run into people for a living. Obviously I'm fucking dumb.\"\n\nGronk almost fumbled a planned bit to get Brady and Belichick to drink a shot with him, then made a mess of things by spiking his shot glass on the floor afterward.\n\nHart would get Belichick drinking again a few minutes later, doing shots with his newly-former boss Kraft as a peace offering. But not before Kraft issued a declaration across the globe to try to make up for his decision back in 2005 to give one of his own Super Bowl rings to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. \"In case Vladimir Putin, you're watching, give me my fucking ring back, will ya!?\" Kraft said.\n\nFamous Boston sports fan and movie star Ben Affleck devoted too many minutes to attacking a random online fan who'd once typed disparaging words about Brady, and later wished he could avoid his own bad press conferences much like Belichick by simply saying \"on to Cincinnati.\" But Affleck's time onstage could best be summed up by his initial dismissal of the whole idea of roasting: \"This settles it. You won't find me volunteering for the Ben Affleck Roast. Or as I like to call it, Thursday.\"\n\nAfter a surprise appearance from Peyton Manning, the guest of honor took center stage and was as cocky in his suit as he used to be guiding fourth-quarter comebacks in his Pats uniform.\n\nTo the NFL, Brady bragged that the league spent $20 million investigating whether he had a role in deflating footballs in 2015. \"You coulda just given me the 20 million and I woulda just told you I fucking did it!\" Brady said, prompting a standing O from his former teammates. He also thanked Kardashian for agreeing to participate, although he drew a shady stare from her when he threw her under the bus with a line about Kanye West: \"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this but because her kids are home with their dad.\"\n\nHe also teased Manning for forever living \"in my shadow,\" told Manning's younger brother, Eli, and the New York Giants to eff off, and torched Belichick with this bit: \"Everybody asks me which ring is my favorite. I used to say the next one. But now that I'm retired, my favorite ring is the camera that caught Coach Belichick slinking out of that poor girl's house at 6 a.m. a few months ago... Hey! You still got it! Respect, baby.\"\n\nBut perhaps the biggest collective head-shaker resounded throughout the arena when Brady delivered the most memorable 9/11 joke since the late Gilbert Gottfried tried one during Comedy Central's Friar's Club Roast of Hugh Hefner in 2001. To wit, Brady said of himself and his football legacy: \"The word hero comes to mind. But I struggle with that word, because like the rest of America I'll always remember where I was that fateful day in September of 2001 when tragically, those two Jets slammed into Drew Bledsoe.\"",

It was about Robert Kraft.", "body": "The Netflix roast of Tom Brady was a profane celebration in which nothing was off limits -- except, apparently, for Robert Kraft.\n\nThroughout the duration of Netflix's Tom Brady roast, the former Patriots gunslinger sat back and absorbed dozens of jokes about his divorce, his vanity, his poor business decisions, and his former teammates.\n\nOver the course of the lengthy special, which aired live with no commercial interruptions for more than three hours, Brady only appeared visibly perturbed by one joke -- and it concerned Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nWhen comedian Jeff Ross took the stage after an introduction from Kevin Hart, the roast veteran was firing on all cylinders. Ross, ever the provocateur, came dressed in an O.J. Simpson jersey flanked by women dressed as devils.\n\n\"I just came from Hell,\" Ross said. \"Aaron Hernandez says hello.\"\n\nRoss proceeded to clown on Brady for several minutes, while Brady looked on and laughed.\n\nTensions appeared to rise, however, when Ross referenced Kraft, who was in the audience at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Tom became a Patriot, moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office, and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made,'\" Ross said, pausing for a beat to let the audience applaud before delivering the punchline. \"Would you like a massage?\"\n\nIn February 2019, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office charged Kraft with two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution after police said they videotaped the owner engaging in a sex act at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida.\n\nThe charges were dropped in 2020 after courts blocked usage of the video in a trial. Prior to the charges being dropped, Kraft issued a public apology.\n\nFollowing his joke, Ross pointed out Kraft in the audience, and seemed ready to continue ribbing the Patriots owner.\n\nAt that point, Brady rose from his seat and attempted to whisper to Ross. Because he was standing so close to the dais, the microphones clearly picked up Brady telling Ross, \"Don't say that s*** again.\"\n\n\"All right, all right,\" Ross said, quickly mentioning how much he loved Kraft and \"what you do for the Jews,\" before moving on.\n\nWhile it's possible that Brady's reaction was a scripted bit of theater, Ross did seem to be apologizing to Brady as his roast ended -- which in turn drew a reaction from roast host Kevin Hart.\n\n\"Stop being a b**** Jeff, just sit down,\" Hart said. \"Stop kissing his a**. 'You ok, right Tom? It was just jokes.' Such a b****.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_slane@boston.com", "name": "Kevin Slane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriot (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Hernandez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Hernandez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.

Was it me? Was it Brady? Was it me? In reality, the truth of the matter is, it was both of us because of me.\"\n\nThat wasn't the only zinger Belichick got in at Brady's expense.\n\nEarlier, the former NFL coach referenced the struggles of Birmingham City, the English soccer club that Brady is part owner of and which was relegated to the third tier of England's soccer pyramid.\n\n\"They suck,\" Belichick said about them. \"Not so easy running a team is it Tom?\"\n\nBelichick then made mention of how he and Brady would butt heads at times while taking a jab at Alex Guerrero -- the trainer behind Brady's TB12 method.\n\n\"In a way that was true, but not really. It was hard to butt heads with Tom because he was so far up Alex Guerrero's ass,\" he said.\n\nBelichick also didn't shy away from ribbing his negative portrayal in the 10-part \"The Dynasty: New England Patriots\" docuseries on Apple TV+.\n\n\"It's an honor to be at the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix tonight. It's not to be confused with the 10-part Bill Belichick roast during the Apple TV documentary,\" said Belichick.\n\nHe even had some fun at tight end Rob Gronkowski's expense, taking aim at his work on TV.\n\n\"Gronk, I've been watching on Fox NFL Sunday and I'm begging you, please stop doing your job,\" Belichick said. \"Do another job.

Jeff Ross, Kim Kardashian, Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft were among the notable celebrities who spoke on the stage.\n\nWhen it was Brady's turn to talk, he brought up the infamous \"Deflategate\" scandal, in which the NFL controversially handed him a four-game suspension for alleged involvement in the deflating of footballs ahead of the 2014 AFC Championship Game.\n\nMake sure to keep an eye on Kraft's facial expression once the cameras turn to him: (WARNING: VIDEO CONTAINS LANGUAGE THAT IS NOT NSFW):\n\n\"Remember Deflategate?

He concluded that Brady probably was \"generally aware\" of the scandal. The NFL handed Brady a four-game suspension, fined the Patriots $1 million and stripped them of two draft picks.\n\nBrady appealed the decision in court and had it overturned ahead of the 2015 season. The NFL challenged that ruling in the 2016 offseason and had the suspension restored, and Brady reluctantly accepted the four-game ban.\n\nThe NFL's suspension of Brady led to plenty of outrage across the league, but TB12 himself got the last laugh anyway. Brady won 11 of his 12 regular season starts upon returning and led the Patriots to a Super Bowl 51 championship, defeating the Atlanta Falcons in overtime after trailing 28-3 in the second half.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hoegler@totalprosports.com", "name": "Alex Hoegler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tom-Brady-Robert-Kraft.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Randy Moss, Julian Edelman, Drew Bledsoe and Rob Gronkowski will all be their to roast their former quarterback, according to ESPN.com. Former Patriots coach Bill Belichick is also expected to be roasting Brady, according to NFL.com. That should be fun to watch.\n\nNetflix has also revealed that Kevin Hart will serve as the host.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Jeff Ross is producing -- and he appears in the trailer above -- so it obviously won't be surprising if he takes part in the roast. The special will include \"a surprise team of roasters from the comedy, sports and entertainment world,\" so you can expect a lot of people to be making fun of Brady.\n\n\"I played in the NFL, so I'm not worried about a bunch of comedians, trust me,\" Brady said Monday during an interview with TODAY.\n\nIf you want the full list of names of who will be roasting Brady, you'll have to watch the show because Netflix is keeping most of it under wraps so that it's a surprise for Brady when he takes the stage on May 5.\n\nThe roast is a part of Netflix's annual \"Netflix Is A Joke Fest,\" which will be running from May 2 thru 12 this year. According to the Hollywood Reporter, several huge comedy names are expected to take part in the comedy fest (but not necessarily the Brady roast), including Chris Rock, Ali Wong, John Mulaney, Chelsea Handler, Bert Kreisher, Jon Stewart, David Letterman, Tom Segura and Matt Rife.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_breech@cbssports.com", "name": "John Breech", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Segura", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Segura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Wong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ali Wong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mulaney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Mulaney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Handler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea Handler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Letterman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Letterman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/07/07/6c4f6560-717e-4e60-9597-34085ac252a4/thumbnail/1200x675/768d7aa44d2ba025e401a420f81cf5fb/usatsi-tom-brady-french-open.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 1843, "textEnd": 1848}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 1944, "textEnd": 1949}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The longtime comedian appeared to have another Kraft joke ready to go, but Brady got out of his seat, walked to the podium and told Ross, \"Don't say that (expletive) again.\"\n\nIt's unclear if Brady giving the order to Ross was a planned bit.

Ross has an entire second gig in terms of roasting - the dude even hosted a reality competition series based on the comedic art form. Apparently, Tom Brady didn't truly appreciate just how good Ross is at what he does because he was not happy about a joke from Ross during Netflix's Kevin Hart-hosted The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady. It wasn't too long after Ross took the podium to begin his rant against Brady that the topic shifted to a time in Brady's life that served as a major inspiration to him throughout most of his life. Of course, we're talking about 2000 - when the New England Patriots selected the future seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback during the sixth round of the NFL draft (making him the 199th overall pick).\n\n\"So Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\" Ross joked. The livestream cut to the audience, and we could hear the reaction to the knife-twist, alluding to Patriots owner Robert Kraft's past headline-grabbing off-the-field activities. As Ross was looking to turn his attention towards Kraft (who was in the audience), Brady - who already wasn't looking too happy - got up to make sure he had Ross's attention. In the clip that's been rumbling loud on social media, we see Ross attempt to move on before Brady approaches Ross to whisper (though caught on mic), \"Never say that s**t again.\" While it wasn't exactly Will Smith/Chris Rock, the move was still a surprising one, considering - as the event was advertising and Brady agreed to - it was a roast.", "source": {"uri": "bleedingcool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleeding Cool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ray_flook@bleedingcool.com", "name": "Ray Flook", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriot (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MixCollage-05-May-2024-09-36-PM-7556-2000x1125.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

You have seven rings -- well, eight, now that Gisele gave hers back,\" comedian Nikki Glaser, hailed as one of the funniest comics of the evening at the marquee event for the annual Netflix is a Joke Festival, said in her monologue, referring to Brady's ex-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\nEight of Brady's former New England Patriots teammates joined him onstage -- Drew Bledsoe, Randy Moss, Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman, Rodney Harrison, Willie McGinest, Matt Light and Nate Solder -- as well as his longtime head coach Bill Belichick who made a surprise entrance and reunion with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who delivered rips at Brady's expense.\n\nKevin Hart, who hosted the special event, taunted Brady about his Brazilian model ex-wife, whose reported new boyfriend is a jiujitsu instructor.\n\n\"How do you not see this coming? Eight karate classes a day and she's still a white belt,\" Hart joked.\n\nThe evening included an array of humorous jabs from some of the biggest names in stand-up comedy -- Jeff Ross, Tom Segura, Tony Hinchcliffe, Bert Kreischer and more. Will Ferrell also showed up in character as Ron Burgundy to rile up the crowd. Actor, writer, director and notable Bostonian Ben Affleck, who recently co-starred in a Dunkin' Super Bowl commercial alongside Ferrell, was also in attendance.\n\nKim Kardashian also got in on the action. \"Honestly its hard for me to watch people roast you, but I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players,\" she told Brady, referring to her father Robert Kardashian, who famously defended friend O.J. Simpson in the latter's 1995 murder trial.\n\nAt one point in the evening, as expertly crafted insults were hurled across the stage, Brady's former tight end Gronkowski got tripped up reading the teleprompter and ended his shtick with his trademark celebratory move, spiking a shot glass in lieu of a football, which created a shattered mess for Hart to clean up.\n\nElsewhere in the evening, Belichick reunited onstage with Kraft, and the two did a shot together as Kraft praised the coach and Brady alike, in a rare lighter moment.\n\nFellow NFL great Peyton Manning arrived at the tail end of the night to re-up the two men's friendly rivalry and razzed Brady for losing two Super Bowls to his younger brother Eli Manning, later handing off the podium to the \"three-time Super Bowl loser.\"\n\nIn the end, Brady had the last laugh, delivering blows to each of the aforementioned guests.\n\n\"I know sometimes you live in Denver, and sometimes you live in Louisiana. But you will always live in my shadow,\" he said, speaking to Manning.\n\n\"I know Kim [Kardashian] was terrified to be here tonight, not because of this, but because her kids are home with her dad,\" Brady at another point, making a dig about the reality star's ex-husband Kanye West.\n\nIn an ultimate crescendo, Brady nearly brought down the house when he addressed the 2015 NFL controversy in which he and the Patriots were accused of deliberately using game balls that were improperly inflated.\n\n\"Remember Deflategate? The NFL spent $20 million and found that it was more probable than not that I was generally aware that someone may have deflated my footballs. You could have just given me the $20 million, and I would have just told you I f---- did it.\"", "source": {"uri": "goodmorningamerica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Good Morning America"}, "authors": [{"uri": "good_morning_america@goodmorningamerica.com", "name": "Good Morning America", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Will Ferrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rodney Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_McGinest", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Willie McGinest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Solder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nate Solder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randy Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Light", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Light"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hinchcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Hinchcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_commercials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl commercials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Kreischer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bert Kreischer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Segura", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Segura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.

He said, \"Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\" The comedian then blew a kiss in Robert Kraft's direction.\n\nAt the roast, Tom Brady was visibly upset in his seat, came up and murmured in Ross' ear, \"Don't say that shit again.\"\n\nLater, Ross, who is Jewish, said on stage, \"OK, OK. He's having fun, look at him. I love what you do for the Jews, Robert Kraft. You're incredible.\"\n\nIn 2019, Robert Kraft was charged with two counts of soliciting prostitution, days after police alleged surveillance video had caught Kraft during two visits to the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida. Kraft pleaded not guilty but issued a public apology for his actions. The charges were later dropped due to a lack of evidence, however, the four women involved reached plea deals with prosecutors and had to pay thousands of dollars in fines and fees.\n\nBrady was drafted by the New England Patriots, and played with the team as their star quarterback for 20 seasons from 2000 to early 2020. In March 2020, the day before his contract with the Patriots expired, Brady announced that he would not be resigning his contract with the Boston-based team. Instead, Brady signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with whom he played at the Super Bowl for the first time in February 2021.

There were an extensive collection of celebrities and comedians in attendance to help roast Brady on Sunday night. And Hart didn't take long to dive into the good stuff.\n\nHe decided to take a swing at Brady over his divorce with Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen.\n\nHe mentioned Bundchen and her romance with her jiujitsu instructor, Joaquim Valente. \"Eight karate classes a day?\" Hart laughed.\n\nOne of his best lines was when he joked how the future Hall of Famer's obsession with football jeopardized his marriage with the former supermodel. \"When you got a chance to go 8-9 and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids, you gotta do what the f**k you gotta do,\" Hart said. \"You gotta do it.\"\n\nThere were several other celebrities in attendance for the roast including Julian Edelman, Will Farrell, Dana White, Rob Gronkowski, Bill Belichick, Nikki Glaser, Kim Kardashian, Jeff Ross, Andrew Schulz, and others.\n\nA few of the roasters didn't pass up the opportunity to take some shots at the longtime trainer of Tom Brady, Alex Guerrero. His longtime coach Bill Belichick didn't hesitate to take a swipe at Guerrero, \"It was hard to butt heads with Tom because he was so far up Alex Guerrero's ass.\"\n\nIt seemed like the Patriots in general were itching to get the Guerrero jokes out of their system. Julian Edelman also cracked a joke about Guerrero, calling him a \"snake oil salesman.\"\n\nIt was clear that absolutely nothing was off-limits for the entirety of the roast. They touched on just about every part of Tom Brady's life imaginable. And it was clear for the entire show all of the speakers did not care about \"taking things too far.\" It'll definitely go down as one of the better roasts of a such a high-profile celebrity.\n\nKim Kardashian gets booed at The Roast of Tom Brady\n\nKim Kardashian dealt with a very rough crowd during The Roast of Tom Brady.

Netflix streamed the event live late into Sunday night, and it was just about as entertaining as any NFL game. Between Bill Belichick and Brady bickering about their role in the Patriots' dynasty, Robert Kraft and Belichick ripping a shot, Kim Kardashian getting blasted and booed, and Julian Edelman talking about how hung the late Aaron Hernandez was, the roast had a little bit of everything.\n\nOnce of the better moments from Brady himself was when he addressed the Deflategate saga. You know, the completely overblown BS reason behind his four-game suspension during the 2016 season, after which he returned to scorch the football world with an 11-1 starting record, and orchestrated the greatest comeback in football history against the Atlanta Falcons in the Super Bowl. Maybe we should be thanking Roger Goodell for pissing Brady off so much that he couldn't help but destroy anyone in his path with more prejudice than usual.\n\nPlease behold what Brady had to say about the whole fiasco orchestrated by the league office that turned out to be a total nothing burger.\n\nIt's just awesome to see how candid Brady can be. I hope he carries this over to the FOX broadcast booth when he's calling games this coming season. We're going to see a hell of a lot of Brady in the coming years. Whether it's getting some sort of ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders, providing incisive analysis in real time during the biggest showdowns in the NFL and in the Super Bowl, or contributing in myriad other ways, TB12 ain't going nowhere.\n\n...Will he come back, though? I would really love to see Brady on the field for one last ride. Doesn't really matter where it is, but the Raiders would be a convenient, appealing destination and would give Vegas some serious juice to say the least. Brady even recently floated the idea of coming out of retirement.\n\nRegardless of precisely what he does with his future, Brady has earned even more widespread respect from this Netflix roast by taking the piss out of himself and being super candid. The guy could be stiff as a board at the podium and during his weekly radio segments in New England. Never revealed too much about himself or what he was really thinking. This was a refreshing change-up, and if it's a sign of things to come, please Tom, more of this!", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Hernandez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Hernandez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Tom-Brady-Roast.png?fit=985%2C516&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

The target was New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, the man who signed Brady's paychecks for the first 20 years of his 23-year NFL career.\n\nAfter host Kevin Hart opened the show with a blistering monologue -- \"Why didn't we go to the Crypto.com Arena downtown? Well, the reason why we didn't go there is because we didn't want to remind Tom's fans of how much money he owes them\" -- comedian and celebrity roast staple Jeff Ross kept the hits coming. He talked about how Brady was drafted in the sixth round with the 199th pick of the 2000 NFL draft \"when Bill Belichick's dog stepped on the keyboard by accident.\"\n\n\"So Tom became a Patriot,\" Ross said, \"moved up to New England and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\"\n\nThe joke was a reference to Kraft being arrested in 2019 on charges of soliciting sex from a prostitute during an encounter at a Florida day spa. Kraft pleaded not guilty, and the charges were dropped the following year after his lawyers prevented video and audio footage from being used as evidence in court.\n\nAs the crowd laughed and Ross blew a kiss in Kraft's direction, Brady could be seen shifting in his seat behind and to the right of the comedian. The camera cut to a close shot of Ross, who said \"I love Robert Kraft.\"\n\nBrady then approached Ross. The NFL's all-time leader in passing yards and touchdown passes had a bit of a smile on his face, but his tone was dead serious when he leaned in and said to Ross, \"Don't say that s -- again.\"\n\nAs Brady returned to his seat, Ross laughed, put his hands up and \"OK, OK!\" He pointed in Kraft's direction and said, \"He's having fun, look at him.\" As Ross added some sincere words of praise for Kraft, the Patriots owner was shown smiling in the crowd.\n\nBrady didn't appear to hold a grudge and could be seen laughing during the rest of Ross' set. The two men embraced and spoke after Ross' performance -- a scene Hart mocked by implying Ross was kissing up to the GOAT. \"I heard you over there,\" Hart said. \"'Tom, you all right? Yeah? Your hair's so straight.'\"\n\nBrady absorbed many more barbs throughout the evening without feeling the need to step in again.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crypto.com Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriot (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_spa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Day spa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d6652b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5257x2957+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2F93%2Fd71b1cc441a8ba1c960a7da3093f%2Fthe-greatest-roast-of-all-time-tom-brady-33335.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Comedians such as Jeff Ross and Nikki Glaser also joined in on the fun with digs at Brady's career and personal life.\n\nHowever, Ross' attempt to make a joke about how the conversation between the Patriots owner and Brady when the quarterback was drafted in 2000 didn't go over so well.\n\n\"'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made,'\" Ross said while pretending to be Brady. \"'Would you like a massage?'\"\n\nRoss' joke referenced Kraft being charged in 2019 for soliciting another to commit prostitution. The legal trouble was part of a police investigation that involved massage parlors in Florida. Kraft was ultimately cleared off all charges.\n\nBrady didn't seem thrilled with Ross' humor, walking up to the podium to shut the topic down. \"Don't say that s -- t again,\" Brady told Ross, who replied, \"OK, OK. [Robert is] having fun, look at him.\"\n\nRoss was the second person to take the stage on Sunday, with Kevin Hart kicking off the night with jokes about Brady's marriage to Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\n\"Gisele gave you an ultimatum. She said you have to retire or you're done. But when you have a chance to go 8-9 you gotta do it,\" Hart said.\n\nThe comedian continued by joking that Brady \"f-ked\" coach Belichick, 72, when he left the New England Patriots for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n\"You f-ked him good. You did, Tom, you f-ked your coach, but let me tell you something people ... that's what you've got to do to maintain your happiness. You sometimes got to f-k your coach. You know who else f-ked their coach? Gisele. She f-ked that karate man,\" Hart said in reference to B\u00fcndchen's romance with her jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente.\n\nHart added: \"I mean Jesus Christ, Tom. One of the smartest quarterbacks ever played a game. How did you not see this coming? Eight f-king karate classes a day. ... Eight karate classes a day and she's still a white belt. F-k Tom. The only bruises she had were on her ass. everybody should have known it.\"\n\nBrady and B\u00fcndchen, 43, announced their divorce in October 2022 after more than a decade of marriage.

His seven Super Bowl rings are more than anyone else's, his 89,214 passing yards are more than anyone else's, and his 649 touchdowns are more than anyone else's.\n\nIt's hard to reasonably contend that Brady isn't the greatest NFL player ever, but there are plenty of controversies that surround his legacy. One of which is in the infamous \"Deflategate,\" which stemmed from a huge controversy that occurred in the 2014 AFC Championship Game between the New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nAn investigation was launched after it was reported that the Patriots were using deflated balls in the 2014 AFC Championship Game.\n\nInitially, Bill Belichick and Brady both denied any involvement. However, after a lengthy investigation, Brady was found to have ordered the deliberate deflating of the game-used footballs.\n\nDeflating the ball allows the quarterback to have a tighter grip, thus making passes far easier. The result of the investigation was a four-game suspension for Brady, a $1 million fine to the Patriots, and the team also had to forfeit two draft picks in 2016.\n\nBrady has long stated he was innocent, but the investigation has always led to accusations of him and the Patriots being cheaters. This was a huge part of the jokes that were hurled at Brady during Sunday night's roast of the NFL legend, nicknamed \"The Greatest Roast of All-Time.\" The roast was aired live on Netflix and is now available for streaming.\n\nAfter multiple former players, comedians, and actors all took turns throwing shade at Brady, it was his turn to get up and fire back. During his closing jokes and remarks, the former Patriots quarterback finally fully (jokingly) admitted to cheating during the Deflategate scandal.\n\nBrady states, \"Remember Deflategate? The NFL spent $20 million dollars and found that it was more 'probable' than not that I was 'generally' aware that someone may have deflated my footballs. You could have just given me the $20 million and I would have just told you that I f****** did it.\"\n\nNaturally, the joke and the faux admittance got a standing ovation from the crowd, which included former longtime Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. Brady had already been found \"guilty\" during the investigation, but he never outright stated any wrongdoing. Last night was the first time that he actually stated he was responsible.\n\nMany people have accused Brady and the Patriots of cheating, but last night was the first time that anyone has ever admitted it. Whether or not it was supposed to be taken fully as a joke, the Deflategate scandal can now be put to rest.\n\nIt's not like Brady will be reprimanded any longer for a closed investigation. He is also retired from the NFL, so the league can't go after him for finally admitting his involvement.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_brizuela@newsweek.com", "name": "James Brizuela", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_(ball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football (ball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2388553/tom-brady-his-roast.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=6a524eb757e17699387e0f2703adfa6f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

This is a big night,\" Belichick said to Bledsoe. \"The fans want you. Everyone wants you. But it's not your night. Sorry, Drew. Brady. You're in. Let's go.\"\n\nIt appears that Brady and Belichick put whatever animosity they might have had aside to do this. Brady even called Belichick \"coach\" during the skit.\n\nIt was rumored that Belichick would be among the roasters, which included several of Brady's former teammates like Bledsoe and Randy Moss. Belichick was not seen on stage to begin the event, but came out midway through to roast the greatest quarterback of all-time.\n\nBelichick obviously made the right decision over two decades ago by staying with Brady after Bledsoe.

However, one of the most contentious issues throughout the 3-hour roast was Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bundchen. Everybody from comedians and former teammates took shots at Brady's failed marriage.\n\nThe supermodel used to date actor Leonardo DiCaprio till 2005. In 2006, she and the three-time NFL MVP started dating and tied the knot in 2009. The couple have two children and divorced in 2022, ending their 13 years of marriage.\n\nThis topic was tackled by almost everybody who stepped up to roast Brady, starting from the host of the roast, Kevin Hart. He brought forth Gisele dating her jiu-jitsu coach after separation from Brady.\n\n\"You f*ked him (Belichick) good,\" Hart joked. \"You did, Tom, you f*ked your coach... You sometimes got to f-k your coach. You know who else f-ked their coach? Gisele. She f*ked that karate man.\"\n\nEx-Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe took a couple of shots on this touchy topic. The QB got replaced as the top man within the Patriots roster did not hold back.\n\n\"(Brady is) pretty used to not being touched. Just like at the end of the marriage,\" he joked.\n\nHe also joked about a couple of things that Brady will never experience:\n\n\"Being a first-round draft pick (Brady was drafted in the sixth round) and a 28th wedding anniversary\".\n\nComedian and podcaster Andrew Schulz involved the UFC president Dana White in his joke. Schulz said referring to Gisele's jiu-jitsu coach's involvement:\n\n\"That's why Dana is here, so you can learn how to f*ck a Brazilian out of half their purse.\"\n\nTom Brady doesn't hold back\n\nWith so many jokes at the expense of his failed marriage, Brady was expected to have a comeback. And the seven-time Super Bowl champion shut everyone's mouth when he took to the podium.

As everyone knows, nothing is off the table when it comes to events like this. The more awkward, the better is the mantra of some of the roastmasters, including, of course, comedian Jeff Roast AKA the Roastmaster General.\n\nRoss certainly lived up that nickname when he took a shot at Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who was lucky to score a major steal in the 2000 NFL Draft.\n\n\"So Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made,\" Ross said.\n\nThen came the punch line: Would you like a massage?'\"\n\nRight after that joke, Tom Brady got up from his seat and went over to Ross. Brady was heard whispering a NSFW message to the comedian,saying \"Don't say that s**t again.\" Ross agreed while also acknowledging Kraft's appreciation of the joke and praising him for his work for the Jews.\n\n\"He's having fun, look at him. I love what you do for the Jews, Robert Kraft. You're incredible.\"\n\nIf you're wondering what Ross was referencing, it's the scandalous incident back in 2019 when Kraft was alleged to have solicited prostitution at a massage parlor. Kraft was later cleared of the charge after it was later found that a video that was supposed to be used as evidence against him was illegally obtained.\n\nThe moment between Brady and Ross garnered all sorts of reactions from people online, especially over at X (the social media platform formerly known as Twitter).\n\n\"Tom Brady doesn't get to decide how jokes go in a roast. That's one audible he can't call,\" said @DannyPhantom24.\n\n\"Respect to Brady for manning up for his dude,\" chimed in @JetsAGNB.\n\nFrom @BootheBets: \"How is he going to get mad about a joke at a roast??\"\n\nVia @AndyHHSports: \"Tom is so soft you know what you signed up for\"\n\nA lot of people also couldn't bear the awkwardness of the moment. Then again, it's one of the feelings such roasts want to provoke.\n\n\"Damn that was awkward. Jeff Ross is funny as hell but that was real awkward,\" observed @Cory_Hays407.\n\n\"Awkward very awkward,\" added @13isLucky13.\n\n\"I gotta be honest watching this I never got close to the opinion that he was going to hit him lmao, which is what a Will Smith moment would be,\" shared @PatsBuzz.\n\n\"Tom Brady glazing Robert Kraft isn't something I had on my 2024 bingo card,\" said @770locks.\n\n\"Wow -- What a pitiful SOFT moment from @TomBrady -- I guess the \"System GOAT\" has to protect his Cheating, Criminal team and its owner!!! WOW!!!! If you can't take the \"Roast\" stay out of the Kitchen folks!!!!\" said a fired-up @MiamiCanes1971, who certainly can't let go of his hate for the seven-time Super Bowl winner.\n\n\"He deflated Jeff Ross like he deflated that ball,\" commented @mjarbo.\n\nAnother different take from @theinternetgm: \"He's defending someone that didn't sign up to get roasted.

In honor of the fact that comedy is so back, we're counting down the top 11 most savage moments of the night for your enjoyment.\n\n11. The R Word Is Back\n\nNetflix was once a main driver of woke ideology's strong foothold in the cultural discourse. Their platforming of wildly woke, unfunny \"comedians\" like Hannah Gadsby, coupled with their temporary disinterest in the funniest names in comedy like Shane Gillis forced comedy into the darker corners of the internet and off the streaming platforms. It was only when intrepid young comedians like Gillis and the likes of Mark Normand and Andrew Schulz self-released their comedy on YouTube that Netflix righted the ship and started standing by comedians like Dave Chappelle in the face of woke cancel mobs.\n\nNow, it appears, Netflix has done a full 180, allowing both Schulz and comedian Nikki Glaser to drop the \"retard\" slur which would once have made you persona-non-grata in Hollywood circles. Glaser said Gronk \"puts the tard in retarted,\" which is just top notch hilarity if you ask me. Schultz also called him a \"hunky retard,\" which is not the most creative insult, but still surprising to see it sanctioned on a mainstream platform like Netflix.\n\n10. Consistent Gay Jokes\n\nSpeaking of dropping the PC shtick, the roast was rife with gay jokes. I don't have enough time to include all of them it was so jam packed with them. From Drew Bledsoe, the QB Brady replaced in New England, saying \"I am not standing here right now saying Tom Brady is gay ... but he sure did fuck me,\" to Rob Gronkowski's entire 12 minute set, which almost exclusively consisted of him finding different ways to call Brady and Julian Edelman gay, the three hour event was jam-packed with borderline homophobic quips and even an instance of a slur. Again, I was pleasantly surprised by how much Netflix let fly.\n\n9. Jeff Ross Burns Robert Kraft So Bad Brady Has To Step In\n\nJeff Ross, a venerable veteran of the roasting game, came out firing, and packed a punch so hard that even Brady himself had to step in.\n\nRoss was joking about Patriots owner Robert Kraft when Brady appeared to take offense. Prosecutors infamously charged Kraft with soliciting prostitution in 2020 after he allegedly visited a Florida massage parlor in 2020, though they ultimately dropped those charges.\n\n\"On the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made,'\" Ross recounted to much fanfare. \" ... would you like a massage?\" Ross then joked.\n\nThe crowd erupted with laughter as Brady stood up and whispered, though audible enough for Ross' mic to pick it up, \"don't say that shit again.\"\n\nBut given the lighthearted nature of the evening, I'm skeptical Brady was actually pissed off and I'm guessing he was just joking. After all, he did tell Ross \"no fear, this is what we do.\"\n\n8. Jeff Ross Burns OJ\n\nSpeaking of Jeff Ross, the Roastmaster General came out wearing a \"Roast J Simpson\" jersey in honor of the recently passed Buffalo Bills legend/alleged murderer because, and I quote, \"I'm about to kill this white bitch right here,\" Ross said while pointing to Brady. Absolutely savage.\n\nThe juice was indeed loose as Ross said he \"just came straight from hell\" and that \"Aaron Hernandez says hello.\"\n\n7. Dana White: \"I'm Not Trans Enough For You Liberal Fucks?\"\n\nThe UFC's Dana White had a brief but impactful appearance, getting only one minute to tear into Brady and co. But he started his set with a shot at Netflix.\n\n\"It pisses me off, I flew all the way out here and you guys give me 60 seconds?\" White questioned. \"My name is Dana, is that not trans enough for you liberal fucks?\"\n\n6. Julian Edelman Makes Light Of Israel v. Hamas\n\nLegendary Patriots wide receiver and long time Tom Brady teammate Julian Edelman got in on the fun and he, too, did not remotely hold back. Lobbing shots at Gronk's intelligence and, like many others, making fun of the deceased former Patriot tight end Aaron Hernandez, Edelman followed suit with everyone else who was dropping truly nuclear material on the world. But one joke in particular stood out to me.\n\n\"Fun fact, Jeff and I are both Jewish. The difference is I'm the type of Jew that people look at and go 'oh he's Jewish?' and Jeff's the kind of Jew that makes you want to join Hamas.\"\n\nHo-leeeee shit. The audience audibly groaned at the insanely ballsy nature of that joke in the current political climate. But I love it. First of all, as a Jew, Edelman is allowed to joke about his own people. But second, as horrible as the situation in the middle east is, making fun of it should be squarely on the table.\n\nAs the saying in my family goes, \"if you don't laugh, you'll cry.\"\n\n5. Ron Burgundy Gets The Entire LA Forum To Call Tom Brady A Bitch\n\nA surprise appearance by Ron Burgundy, Will Ferrell's amazing lead character in the smash-hit 2004 comedy \"Anchorman\" may have just stolen the show. Coming out to the Los Angeles Forum by saying how excited he was to be at Madison Square Garden in New York was hilarious, but he then topped it by saying Brady is Eli Manning's bitch and getting the entire crowd to chant that in unison.\n\nManning famously defeated Brady in the Super Bowl, twice, including ending Brady and the Patriots' perfect season in 2008.\n\nAs a Giants fan, this moment warmed my heart in ways I can't describe.\n\n4. Comedians Roast Ben Affleck's Weird Angry Rant\n\nThe low point of the night came when famed Bostonian Ben Affleck crashed in and completely killed the vibe, following a hilarious set from Andrew Schulz and a touching toast between Belichick and Kraft, with a weird, angry, way too serious rant on internet commenters and Belichick. I'm not going to comment on the material other than to say, it was an absolute cringefest. Half of the people on the deus were visibly uncomfortable.\n\nKevin Hart, the event's host, had to address the awkwardness after Affleck left, quipping \"another piece of white boy humor.\" Jeff Ross than chimed in, adding \"this was the first time I ever wished Netflix had commercials.\"\n\n3. Brady's entire set\n\nThe only reason Brady doesn't get top billing from me here is because of just how savage the number one and two jokes were. But the GOAT damn sure made me think twice about putting him in third. The golden boy, at serious risk to his image and personal brand, pulled no punches and went absolutely scorched earth on everything from O.J. Simpson, to 9/11, even throwing shots at his deceased teammate Aaron Hernandez.\n\nBrady sent a ricochet shot at OJ while roasting Peyton Manning, who also made a surprise appearance.\n\n\"When I heard there was a slow White Bronco heading down the 405 to come here tonight, I thought we might actually see a real football legend,\" Brady opened. (RELATED: O.J. Simpson Dead At 76, Family Announces)\n\nHe then made a joke about 9/11, poking fun at the fact that Bledsoe's injury which led to Brady getting his job, came against the New York Jets. \"Like the rest of America, I'll always remember where I was that fateful day in September of 2001, when tragically, those two Jets slammed into Drew Bledsoe.\"\n\nBut if that wasn't shocking enough for the golden pony, his Aaron Hernandez joke truly floored me in terms of shock factor.\n\nWhile complimenting Gronk, Brady added the caveat \"although, the bar for Patriots tight ends was pretty low back then: block, catch ... don't murder.\"\n\nGoodness. Gracious. For the uninitiated, Gronk and Brady once played with a tight end named Aaron Hernandez, who was extremely talented and had a bright future in the NFL until he went to jail for murder and ended up allegedly hanging himself.\n\n2. Tony Hinchcliffe Invokes George Floyd\n\nTony Hinchliffe, the host of the massively popular live podcast \"Kill Tony,\" appeared briefly to eviscerate everybody and anybody. While his short set was jampacked with racy but hilarious jokes (like saying Kevin Hart's ancestors were so short that when they picked cotton they called it deadlifting) I'm giving him both the number one AND two spots on the list for the two most insensitive and yet downright hilarious jokes of the night.\n\nHinchcliffe was tearing into Rob Gronkowski when he said \"Gronk you look like the final boss in the George Floyd video game.\" Again, the audience audibly groaned as they recognized the potentially cancellable nature of this barb. But Hinchcliffe, who went through his own attempted cancellation in 2021, truly gave no fucks Sunday night, which leads us to our number one moment.\n\nHinchcliffe's extremely tight set was fantastic top to bottom, but his Bert Kreischer joke takes the cake.\n\nKreischer, a fellow comedian famous for drinking heavily, was on the receiving end of a masterfully crafted Hinchliffe zinger about his liver.\n\n\"Bert Kreischer is a king, he looks like if the Tiger King and the Liver King only ate Burger King and had a liver that looked like Martin Luther King got beat up by Rodney King.\"\n\nAll in all, the event was a huge win for stand-up comedy and free speech in general. The fact that it was live cannot be understated. If that was a scripted show, 75 percent of that material gets left on the cutting room floor. There are just too many middle managers at companies like Netflix who have to justify their jobs by pretending to get offended and cutting otherwise solid jokes. But live, anything can happen. Gronk can go on a 12 minute tirade where he just calls Tom Brady gay the whole time.

Speaking on Monday's edition of Pro Football Talk, NFL analyst Mike Florio claimed he turned The Roast of Tom Brady off long before the program had ended.\n\n\"There were about four or five moments in the three hours that actually hit. It was a lot of swings. It was a lot of misses. It was a lot of low-hanging fruit, obvious stuff. For a lot of the people who spoke clearly, someone else wrote it for them. There were some professional comedians there, but it was too long. I had to tap out,\" he said. [00:00:21]\n\nHe went on, specifically calling out Kim Kardashian's boo-laden appearance on stage, Randy Moss' roast delivery and comedian Bert Kreischer.\n\n\"There were moments where it was like, 'What is going on here?' Kim Kardashian? ... Randy Moss, great player, shouldn't be presenting a roast, can't deliver it. ... It doesn't work, Gronk. ... The one guy who always takes his shirt off and smiles like all toothy. That wasn't funny. ... That was the moment I said, 'What is this s**t? Bye bye.'\" [00:01:44][41.6] PFT\n\nWhat was said at The Roast of Tom Brady?\n\nFor three hours, fans watched a turn-by-turn slew of jokes directed at Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski, Robert Kraft, Randy Moss, and other big names of the last two decades. Bill Belichick, Will Ferrell, Kim Kardashian, Nikki Glaser, Ben Affleck, and numerous other celebrities took turns on stage delivering jokes at the former Patriots player's expense.\n\nTopics covered in the roast were Brady's recent divorce, Spygate, Deflategate, Rob Gronkowski's intelligence, Brady's looks, and Robert Kraft's alleged massage parlor controversy. At one moment, even Vladimir Putin was called out.\n\nAt multiple points, Brady took shots of alcohol with Bill Belichick and Rob Gronkowski. Belichick and Kraft took a shot together on stage just months after the two went their separate ways.\n\nBrady also responded to some jabs throughout the night and gave his defense at the end. His biggest defense was to point to his Super Bowl rings and claim that Peyton Manning \"lived in his shadow.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_van_roy@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Ian Van Roy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Randy Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Florio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Florio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bye (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spygate_(NFL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spygate (NFL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Ferrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Affleck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Beverages", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Beverages", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/93dbc-17150121665656-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Gisele is here supporting you tonight, but, just for transparency, she came as Antonio Brown's plus one.\"\n\nKevin Hart didn't hold back as he delved into the more personal aspects, poking fun at Gisele Bundchen's connection with jiujitsu instructor Joaquim Valente, whom she was reportedly seeing for lessons while still married to Brady.\n\nHart then turned his attention to Brady's departure from Belichick and the Patriots in favour of Mac Jones, exclaiming: \"Brady '------ him good'\", and followed up with: \"Let me tell you something, that's what you've got to do to maintain your happiness, you understand? \".\n\nTaking another jab, Hart said: \"You know who else ------ their coach?

Neither was Brandon Graham, who got the game-winning sack, or any other Eagle from that Super Bowl team.

Hart focused on Brady's ex-wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, and Brady's relationship with former coach Bill Belichick, who also attended the roast. A long line of guests came in to take their shots at Brady, including Drew Bledsoe, Belichick, comedian Nikki Glaser, Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman, and even Ben Affleck.\n\nWill Ferrell made an appearance as Ron Burgundy, and led the entire crowd to chant that Brady was \"Eli Manning's (expletive),\" referencing Brady's two Super Bowl losses to Manning's Giants.

You've gotten under Brady's skin so successfully over the years since the Super Bowl win that he included you in the roast unprompted.\n\n_____", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LII", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Foles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Foles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Ferrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eli Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Affleck"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28823/2882337.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Ross, introduced as the roastmaster by host Kevin Hart, sported a blood-stained No. 32 football jersey that read, \"Roast J Simpson\" on the back. He kicked off with a quip, \"If the gloves don't fit, you must talk shit.\"\n\nFive minutes into his set, Ross talked about Brady's professional life after being the 199th pick in the NFL draft. \"He sat there for days, waiting and waiting, and then you were finally picked in the sixth round when Bill Belichick's dog stepped on the keyboard by accident,\" Ross said.\n\nRoss also recalled a moment when Brady told owner Robert Kraft, \"I'm the best decision your organization has ever made,\" after joining the Patriots. The audience laughed and applauded before Ross said, \"Would you like a massage?\"\n\nThe suggestion was to Kraft's earlier controversy around his 2019 arrest soliciting prostitution at a Florida massage parlor, despite the charges being dropped the subsequent year\n\nBrady was clearly uncomfortable, and he shifted in his seat. He also turned towards Ross after the massage joke. After blowing a kiss towards Kraft, who was present, Ross found himself confronted by Brady at the lectern. Brady leaned in, his words amplified by Ross's hot microphone, and sternly remarked, \"Don't say that shit again.\"\n\n\"OK, OK,\" Ross replied. \"He's having fun, look at him. I love what you do for the Jews, Robert Kraft. You're incredible.\" The camera then focused on Kraft laughing. After the set finished, Ross and Brady shared a warm hug, and chatted.\n\nAs Hart returned to the microphone, he told Ross, \"Wow, wow. Stop being a bitch, Jeff, and sit down. Stop kissing his ass. 'Are you OK? It was just jokes?'\"\n\nHart then moved to the next roaster, saying, \"Make sure to check out Jeff's one-man show. It's playing at the Hollywood Cemetery. His career is literally dying.

When he stepped up to the mic, Belichick didn't hold back.\n\n\"People have said that Tom and I butted heads a lot, and in a way that was true, but not really. It was hard to butt heads with Tom because it was so far up Alex Guerrero's (butt),\" Belichick cracked as the audience erupted in laughter.\n\nBelichick and the trainer had well-documented friction towards the end of Brady's run in Foxborough.\n\nBelichick also took aim at Brady's recently relegated soccer team Birmingham City, and all of the times he let Julian Edelman throw touchdown passes instead of the quarterback. The coach ended his portion of the show but poking some fun at who was most responsible for New England's dynasty.\n\n\"Seriously, Tom and I had our differences, but you know it only comes with love and respect about our relationship and we did some special things together,\" Belichick said. \"For all of you out there that think about who's responsible for the Patriots' success during the time when Tom and I were there, was it Brady? Was it me? Was it Brady? Was it me? In reality, the truth of the matter is, it was both of us -- because of me.\"\n\nBrady weighed in on the same topic at the very end of the special when it was his turn to take aim at Belichick.\n\n\"You know we've been through so much and after two decades I've finally had to admit that all along it was you,\" Brady said. \"You're the reason for the Patriots dynasty because you, Bill Belichick, you are a true coaching genius. I mean, you had to choose between an aging, injured, overpaid Drew Bledsoe and a young, healthy, minimum wage superstar. I could have gotten a (expletive) coach from Foxboro (expletive) high school to make that decision.\n\n\"I've been out of the game for a minute so I'm curious, how many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left?

He's still mad about 'Firefly' getting canceled.\n\nThere's always a risk when you bring in a non-comedian for a roast. Comedians have to develop a thick skin in order to survive hecklers and haters, but star athletes are more accustomed to being cheered on and worshipped. So when a legendary NFL quarterback sat down for Netflix's The Roast of Tom Brady, there were definitely some awkward moments amidst all the jokes.\n\nA shot glass is not a ball: In the final decade of his time leading the New England Patriots, Brady had no better partner than Rob Gronkowski. So naturally, the retired tight end was in attendance at Brady's roast. But when the two took shots together, it seemed like Gronkowski may have forgotten he wasn't on a football field anymore, and spiked the shot glass after he finished. Unlike a ball, those things are made out of glass, and could potentially hurt someone.\n\n\"Don't say that s--- again\": Even outside the NFL, Brady is still protective of his old boss. When roast master Jeff Ross took the stage, he had not just Brady but also Patriots owner Robert Kraft in his sights. Reenacting the first conversation the two had, when 199th draft pick Brady confidently told Kraft \"I'm the best decision your organization has ever made,\" Ross added, \"Would you like a massage?\" The dig at Kraft's 2019 arrest for soliciting prostitution in a Florida massage parlor clearly made Brady uncomfortable enough to take the stage and whisper \"don't say that s--- again\" in Ross' ear. The expert roaster was rattled by that experience, made even worse by host Kevin Hart's subsequent dismissal: \"Make sure to check out Jeff's one-man show. It's playing at the Hollywood Cemetery. His career is literally dying. If we stop doing these roasts, you will not see Jeff Ross ever again.\"\n\nGhosts of girlfriends past: Before he married supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Brady was in a relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan -- and the timing of their breakup came up for ridicule during the roast. \"Tom, you're the best to ever play for too long, you retired then came back then retired,\" comedian Nikki Glaser joked. \"I get it, it's hard to walk away from something that isn't your pregnant girlfriend.\" Brady reportedly left Moynahan for B\u00fcndchen before he knew of the pregnancy, which Glaser also joked about: \"To be fair, he didn't know. He just thought she was getting fat.\"\n\nKim Kardashian can take it: When Kim Kardashian took the stage to join in the roasting, the audience initially greeted her with some cheers, but those were quickly drowned out by a massive wave of boos -- so much so that the reality TV star couldn't even get through her first joke and needed Hart's help to calm down the crowd.\n\nDon't mention the dad: Those boos weren't the end of Kardashian's grief, though. When Brady had his chance to fire back, he targeted her ex: \"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this but because her kids are home with their dad.\" Even after a week with a high-profile hip-hop feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West's recent antics still make him the most controversial rapper around.", "source": {"uri": "ew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady",

It's unclear if Brady's response was scripted into the set.\n\nThe massage joke referenced the 2019 controversy involving the Patriots CEO when he was charged as part a human trafficking investigation surrounding a massage parlor in Jupiter, Florida. Kraft pleaded not guilty to two counts of soliciting a prostitute and released a statement at the time.\n\n\"I am truly sorry. I know I have hurt and disappointed my family, my close friends, my co-workers, our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard,\" he said in March 2019, as NBC News reported.\n\nHe added, \"As I move forward, I hope to continue to use the platform with which I have been blessed to help others and to try to make a difference. I expect to be judged not by my words, but by my actions. And through those actions, I hope to regain your confidence and respect.\"\n\nIn September 2020, Florida prosecutors dropped the solicitation charges, NBC News reported.\n\nStill, Ross's innuendo made Brady briefly stop laughing so he could confront the comic on stage. Viewers reacted to the uncomfortable interaction on X.\n\nNFL reporter Ari Meirov wrote that it \"Felt like a near Will Smith moment.\"\n\nOne X user complimented Ross for his response.\n\n\"Jeff handled it like a pro. Tom, come on,\" he said.\n\nAnother asked, \"Out of all of the jokes about his kids, Gisele etc.. this is where the line is crossed for Tom?\"\n\nOther comedians, like host Kevin Hart and comic Nikki Glaser, repeatedly poked fun at Brady's 2022 divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen throughout the evening. The former athlete simply chuckled or took a sip of his drink.\n\nThis article was originally published on TODAY.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors":

Netflix's The Greatest Roast Of All Time: Tom Brady, at least, was full of sanctioned and consensual dissing. Nevertheless, the event -- advertised as the first-ever live and unedited roast -- had its share of eyebrow-raising moments, including one joke that had Brady out of his seat and warning the roaster \"don't say that shit again.\" Hey, you might consider that a sign of a good roast.\n\nKevin Hart served as the host for the evening, with roasters including Jeff Ross, Bert Kreischer, Tom Segura, Nikki Glaser, Andrew Schulz, Tony Hinchcliffe, Sam Jay, Ben Affleck, Kim Kardashian, Will Ferrell as Ron Burgundy, Peyton Manning, Patriots coach Bill Belichick, former wide receivers Randy Moss and Julian Edelman, quarterback Drew Bledsoe, and tight end Rob Gronkowski. The jokes were along the lines you'd expect, given Brady's public life. There were jabs about his un-retirement and subsequent divorce from supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen; leaving his ex, Bridget Moynahan, while she was pregnant; Deflategate; finishing his career in Tampa instead of Boston; and losing a whole lot of money in cryptocurrency investments.\n\nTypically, some of the jokes got quite edgy, including a few references to the suicide of former Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez (who died in prison after being convicted of murder). Kardashian -- after being loudly booed when she took the podium -- jokingly compared Brady's looks to her ex-stepparent, Caitlyn Jenner. \"I think my stepdad is a great example for you. She's one of the best athletes in the world who proved you can do anything in this next chapter of your life,\" Kardashian quipped. \"You can become a commentator or a far-right-wing Republican or even a strong confident woman.\"\n\nKardashian, in turn, was subjected to some of the night's most vicious barbs, including a joke from Brady that \"Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this but because her kids are at home with their dad,\" in reference to the erratic Kanye West. Comic Tony Hinchcliffe, meanwhile, went for old-school early 2000s misogyny, joking that the reality star \"had a lot of Black men celebrating her end zone.\" He said, \"Kim, word of advice, close your legs. You have more public beef than Kendrick [Lamar] and Drake.\"\n\nBut the one joke that seemed to cross the line was Jeff Ross' anecdote that Brady approached Patriots owner Robert Kraft after he was hired and told him, \"'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made,'\" adding, \"'Would you like a massage?'\" Kraft, who was in attendance at the roast, was infamously charged as part of a human trafficking investigation surrounding a Florida massage parlor in 2019. The joke spurred Brady to get up from his seat and warn Ross not to \"say that shit again.\"\n\nBrady had claimed, before the event, that he was completely prepared to be roasted: \"It's like a football game. You run with a game plan, and then you get to see kind of how the strategy goes, and then you adjust on the fly,\" he said (via CBS News). \"This is what a locker room has been like for me for all these years. So it's not like I'm used to people not making fun of me.\" He dished some out himself to close out the evening, taking aim at Kardashian, Manning, Belichick, and Taylor Swift and the Kansas City Chiefs: \"You say your stadium is the loudest. It helps when all your fans are 14-year-old girls. And in honor of Tay-Tay, let's take a look at the Chiefs 'eras': terrible for 50 years, good for five. Shake it off.\"", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

The target was New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, the man who signed Brady's paychecks for the first 20 years of his 23-year NFL career.\n\nAfter host Kevin Hart opened the show with a blistering monologue -- \"Why didn't we go to the Crypto.com Arena downtown? Well, the reason why we didn't go there is because we didn't want to remind Tom's fans of how much money he owes them\" -- comedian and celebrity roast staple Jeff Ross kept the hits coming. He talked about how Brady was drafted in the sixth round with the 199th pick of the 2000 NFL draft \"when Bill Belichick's dog stepped on the keyboard by accident.\"\n\n\"So Tom became a Patriot,\" Ross said, \"moved up to New England and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\"\n\nThe joke was a reference to Kraft being arrested in 2019 on charges of soliciting sex from a prostitute during an encounter at a Florida day spa. Kraft pleaded not guilty, and the charges were dropped the following year after his lawyers prevented video and audio footage from being used as evidence in court.\n\nAs the crowd laughed and Ross blew a kiss in Kraft's direction, Brady could be seen shifting in his seat behind and to the right of the comedian. The camera cut to a close shot of Ross, who said \"I love Robert Kraft.\"\n\nBrady then approached Ross. The NFL's all-time leader in passing yards and touchdown passes had a bit of a smile on his face, but his tone was dead serious when he leaned in and said to Ross, \"Don't say that s -- again.\"\n\nAs Brady returned to his seat, Ross laughed, put his hands up and said, \"OK, OK!\" He pointed in Kraft's direction and said, \"He's having fun, look at him.\" As Ross added some sincere words of praise for Kraft, the Patriots owner was shown smiling in the crowd.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crypto.com Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriot (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_spa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Day spa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28823/2882336.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

'It p***es me off - I flew all the way out here and you guys only give me 60 seconds? My name is Dana. Is that not trans enough for you liberal f***s?'\n\nUFC chief Dana White tore into Netflix at the Roast of Tom Brady, calling them 'liberal f***s'\n\nWhite had flown out to attend the roast of the NFL legend, but was given just 60 seconds\n\nWhite then turned his attention to Brady as he goaded the 46-year-old before unsurprisingly making reference to his UFC organisation and joking the ex-NFL star could have been a 'great fighter'.\n\n'Tom, you played for the Patriots for so long that I was actually starting to feel like you were from Boston. Then I saw you running and I was like, \"no he's definitely from San Francisco\".\n\n'I got two of the baddest dudes in the world right now - Sugar Sean O'Malley and Max Holloway. Tom, you would have been a great fighter, you're already the master of the ground and pound. That's what you call coffee dates with your boy Alex Guerrero.'\n\nBrady is recognised as one of the greatest NFL players of all time after finishing his career with seven Super Bowl championships and being named Super Bowl MVP five times - the most in NFL history.\n\nHe laughed throughout White's segment, but not all jokes landed after he appeared to fume at Jeff Ross over one line that referenced when Brady introduced himself to Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nWhite quickly turned his attentions to Brady and joked he could have been a 'great fighter'\n\nBrady enjoyed White's roast but slammed a joke made by Jeff Ross in an awkward moment\n\n'Tom became a Patriot, moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, I'm the greatest decision your organization has ever made... would you like a massage,' Ross joked.\n\nAfter the onslaught of jokes about ex-wife Gisele and Spygate, Brady also had the chance of his own at a few quips.\n\nAnd the seven-time Super Bowl winner seized the opportunity to take aim at the reigning champions, the Chiefs.\n\nThe 46-year-old blasted Patrick Mahomes and co. about their newfound fanbase, suggesting Arrowhead Stadium is mainly filled with Swifties - the fans of Travis Kelce's girlfriend, Taylor Swift.\n\n'Kansas City, you say your stadium is the loudest. It helps when your fans are 14 year old girls...,' he said, referencing the Swifties increased interest in the franchise amid their idol's romance with the star tight end.\n\n'And in honor of TayTay, let's take a look at the Chiefs Eras; Terrible for 50 years, good for five. SHAKE IT OFF,' Brady added, with nods to Swift's Eras Tour and hit song.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On Sunday night, the former NFL quarterback was the center of a Netflix celebrity roast special, but he got cursingly upset with comedian Jeff Ross after the \"Roastmaster General\" crossed a line Brady wasn't happy about.\n\nThings began to go sideways when Ross began to reference Brady being selected by the New England Patriots in the sixth round of the NFL draft in 2000, becoming the 199th overall pick. \"So Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England,\" Ross said, \"and on the first day of training camp that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\"\n\nRoss was referring to a 2019 police anti-sex trafficking operation in Florida, which resulted in Kraft and many others being charged with solicitation for their patronage of local massage parlors. While the audience laughed, and winced, at Ross' joke, Brady appeared to be uncomfortable over it.\n\nAs Ross turned to Kraft, who was in the audience, to acknowledge him and blow him kisses, Brady began approaching the podium. \"I love Robert Kraft, I....,\" Ross said before being interrupted by the ex-Tampa Bay Buccaneer. \"Never say that s -- again,\" Brady could be heard whispering. Ross laughingly agreed and then pointed out that Kraft was \"having fun.\"\n\nFollowing his 2019 arrest, prosecutors dropped a misdemeanor charge against Kraft, after courts blocked the use of video from hidden cameras that investigators had installed inside the businesses. A Florida appeals court later ruled that Kraft's constitutional rights were violated, and all the charges were dropped. A U.S. District Judge eventually ordered the videos to be destroyed.\n\n0comments", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriot (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patronage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage_parlor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massage parlor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2023/01/09/d9f663d1-adce-43df-8f5f-0bbe95e2629a/tom-brady-focus-football-admist-gisele-bundchen-divorce.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

The three-hour roast saw the likes of Kevin Hart, Drew Bledsoe, Julian Edelman, Bill Belichick, Rob Gronkowski, and Kim Kardashian among others make an appearance and roast the GOAT (pun intended). Despite the stellar lineup of celebrities and athletes, it was Dana White who arguably had the best lines of the night.\n\nWhite, who was part of the crowd was pissed that he was allotted only a minute to roast Brady. Hence he called out Netflix and its alleged woke agenda and said he will keep his roast 'short like Gronk's bus'. \"It pisses me off that I flew all the way out here and you guys give me 60 seconds?\" asked Dana. \"My name is Dana. Is that not trans enough for you liberal f*cks?\"\n\nAfter a banging intro, Dana soon shifted his attention to the man of the hour, Tom Brady. The UFC honcho gave a backhanded compliment to Brady for his longevity with the Patriots. White admitted that Brady's stint with the Patriots tricked him into believing he was from Boston. However, Dana immediately hit Brady with the punchline about his running capabilities:\n\n\"Tom, you played for the Patriots for so long, that I was actually starting to feel like you were from Boston.

That's what you call coffee dates with your boyfriend, Alex Guerrero,\" said Dana.\n\nThe roast was an incredible display of dank humor, laced with raw facts.

With an all-star lineup of comedians, sports figures, and more, Tom Brady voluntarily stepped in front of a comedic firing squad that didn't hold back. It would be impossible to post every highlight from the night - but we've picked out some examples that pretty much set the tone. In fact, let's start off with a brief clip that we're sure Patriots fans will appreciate on a whole number of levels:\n\nHere's an awkward mic moment where Patriots owner Robert Kraft offering a whole lot of public love to ex-Patriots coach Bill Belichick - with Hart in the middle. Let that one sink in before you check out some more highlights:\n\nAaron Hernandez\n\nJEFF ROSS: \"The Juice is loose tonight! If the gloves don't fit, you must talk shit! What's up, Patriots? I just came from Hell. Aaron Hernandez says hello. Yeah, muthafuckers - it's a Roast. And I had to dress like O.J. because I'm about to kill this white bitch right here! [points to Tom Brady]\"\n\nNIKKI GLASER: \"Now, please give it up for zero-time Super Bowl champion Randy Moss! I'm sorry, Randy, why don't you have a ring? What the hell, man? You're one of the best ever. Drew Bledsoe has a ring. Aaron Hernandez had a ring... around his neck.\"\n\nJULIAN EDELMAN: \"Now, everyone always asks me how big Gronk's dick is. Now don't get me wrong, it gets the job done. But there was this other Patriots tight end, now he was hung.\"\n\nRob Gronkowski\n\nTONY HINCHCLIFFE: \"Gronk, I'm happy you could take a break from writing letters to Santa to be here today. I knew you were here when we were all out of chocolate milk backstage. By the way, Gronk, that's Kevin Hart sitting next to you - that's not your shadow. Gronk, you look like the Nazi that kept burning himself in the ovens. You look like the final boss on 'George Floyd: The Video Game.'\"\n\nNIKKI GLASER: \"Tom also lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that? I mean, even Gronk was like, 'Me know that not real money.' Gronk actually does bitcoin, which is where he just chews on a handful of nickels.\"\n\nGisele B\u00fcndchen\n\nKEVIN HART: \"Single life is what you deserve because you had no choice. Gisele gave you an ultimatum. Gisele said, 'You retire, or we're done.' That's what she said to you, Tom. 'You retire, or we're done.' Let me tell you something. When you've got a chance to go 8-9... and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids? You gotta do what the fuck you gotta do, do you understand me? Yeah, you gotta do it... Yeah, Tom! Fuck them kids!\"\n\nNIKKI GLASER: \"The only thing dumber than you saying yes to this roast was when you said, 'Hey babe, you should try jiu-jitsu.' That's gotta suck. How much would it suck for Tom just knowing your ex-wife's new boyfriend can beat your ass while eating hers?\"\n\nSpeaking of Tony Hinchcliffe, the comic was considered by many to be the highlight of the night - a high honor considering how the night ended up. Check out the clip above for another killer joke: \"Bert Kreischer is a king. He looks like if the Tiger King and the Liver King only ate Burger King and had a liver that looked like Martin Luther King got beat up by Rodney King.\"\n\nAfter exactly the kind of introduction that you would expect from Payton Manning, Brady was given a chance to respond. How did he do? After the beating that he took up to that point, he was pretty impressive. As a full-time gig? It should rank after retiring, becoming a football announcer, and returning to football - no rush. But he did get some nice knife twists in on Manning (\"Peyton, thank you so much for coming out to L.A. to do this. I know sometimes you live in Denver, and sometimes you live in Louisiana, but you'll always live in my shadow\"), Kim Kardashian - and Kanye West (\"Kim Kardashian, thank you so much for being here. I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this but because her kids are at home with their dad\"), and even the NFL's \"Deflategate\" investigation (\"Where's Roger Goodell? Remember 'Deflategate'? The NFL spent $20 million and found that it was more 'probable' than not that I was 'generally aware' that someone may have deflated my footballs. You could have just given me the $20 million, and I would have just told you I fucking did it.\"\n\nBut not every joke was a winner with Brady, who apparently took issue with one joke Ross made regarding Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Ross turned his rant to 2000 - when the New England Patriots selected the future seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback during the sixth round of the NFL draft (making him the 199th overall pick). \"So Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\" Ross joked.\n\nThe livestream cut to the audience, and we could hear the reaction to the knife-twist, alluding to Patriots owner Robert Kraft's past headline-grabbing off-the-field activities. As Ross was looking to turn his attention towards Kraft (who was in the audience), Brady - who already wasn't looking too happy - got up to make sure he had Ross's attention. In the clip that's been rumbling loud on social media, we see Ross attempt to move on before Brady approaches Ross to whisper (though caught on mic), \"Never say that s**t again.\"", "source": {"uri":

Manning came out to a nice applause during the Netflix special The Greatest Roast of All-Time: Tom Brady.\n\nBrady sat and listened to jokes from all sorts of comedians as well as fellow New England Patriots Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski as well as former head coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft.\n\nHe did, at one point, seem to take offense to a joke from roast master Jeff Ross directed at Kraft. But he took everything in stride before getting up and closing the show himself with a great set.\n\nDuring his routine, Manning also talked about Belichick doing some work this coming season with him and his brother Eli Manning on the Manningcast.\n\nIt was a night of laughs and many dark, tasteless jokes, but the highlight was arguably the appearance of Manning. However, Brady got in a great shot during his rebuttal as well.\n\nIt's always fun to see these two together.

Hart started out with one of the best jokes of the night, addressing Brady's split with Gisele Bundchen. Riffing off Bundchen's rumored ultimatum to Brady to retire from football, or they'd split.\n\n\"When you got a chance to go 8-9 and all it will cost you is your wife and your kids, you gotta do what the f-k you gotta do,\" Hart said. \"You gotta do it.\"\n\nHe went after the Gisele relationship again, comparing Brady's decision to leave Patriots head coach Bill Belichick to Gisele's alleged decision to leave him for her coach.\n\n\"You f-ked him good,\" Hart said. \"You did Tom, you f-ked your coach. But let me tell you something, that's what you got to do to maintain your happiness.\n\n\"Sometimes you gotta f-k your coach. You know who else f-ked their coach? Gisele, she f-ked that karate man.\"\n\nBert Kreischer and Tom Segura also put up an old, extremely embarrassing photo of a shirtless young Brady holding a football.\n\nKriescher and Segura also compared Brady to Hitler, saying he has psychopathic tendencies and putting together a fantastic photoshop.\n\nJeff Ross also came out in a bloody O.J. Simpson jersey, saying \"What's up Patriots, I just came from hell, Aaron Hernandez says hello.\"\n\nWill Ferrell came out for the roast in character as Ron Burgundy, before encouraging the entire crowd to chant that \"Eli Manning made Tom Brady his b****.\"\n\nBill Belichick also made an appearance, making jokes about the former New England Patriots players on stage, before quipping: \"I've got a lot of nice things to say about Tom, but I'm running out of time here.\"\n\nDana White was given one minute to go after Brady too, dropping a line about not being liberal enough for the audience. \"You guys gave me 60 seconds,\" White said. \"My name is Dana! Is that not trans enough for you liberal f****.\"\n\nBrady though, might have had the best line of the night. When talking about Kim Kardashian, he said \"I know Kim was so nervous to be here tonight, not because of this, but because the kids are home with their Dad.\"\n\nHe even subtly mentioned the Gisele relationship, saying he misses the \"love of his life:", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_miller@outkick.com", "name": "Ian Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Kreischer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bert Kreischer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Segura", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Segura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Ferrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Hernandez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Hernandez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dana White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eli Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.

Aaron Hernandez says hello.\"\n\nThe back of Ross' jersey read \"Roast J Simpson\" and along with Simpson's No. 32, sported what looked to be fake blood stains. So yeah, he went all out for this skit.\n\nBut Brady knew what was coming, and even indicated as much in his opening monologue.\n\n\"It's like a football game. You run with a game plan, and then you get to see kind of how the strategy goes, and then you adjust on the fly,\" Brady said. \"This is what a locker room has been like for me for all these years. So it's not like I'm used to people not making fun of me.\"\n\nThen again, not all the jokes were funny to Brady, it seems.\n\nAs the Guardian reports:\n\n\"The only time Brady objected to a joke was when Jeff Ross made a reference to Patriots owner Robert Kraft and massages. In 2019, Kraft originally received a misdemeanor charge that he paid for sex at a Florida massage parlor. Prosecutors later dropped the charge after courts blocked the use of video from cameras installed by police inside the massage parlors.\n\n\"In the sketch, Ross joked about Kraft offering Brady a massage when he first joined the Patriots. On Sunday, Brady walked up to Ross and said in his ear 'don't say that s -- t again,' but it was clearly caught on the microphone and heard by those watching the roast at home.\"\n\nSo, massage jokes?

The audience erupted into applause before Ross delivered the punchline, \"Would you like a massage?\"\n\nThe reference was to Kraft's previous controversy involving accusations of soliciting prostitution in a Florida massage parlor, though he was never charged in the case.\n\nBrady, seated front-and-center on stage, appeared visibly uncomfortable, shifting in his seat and turning towards Ross after the massage joke. While Ross blew a kiss to Kraft in attendance, he was then approached by Brady at the podium, who whispered into Ross' hot microphone, \"Don't say that shit again.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" Ross responded nervously. \"He's having fun, look at him. I love what you do for the Jews, Robert Kraft. You're incredible.\"\n\nThe camera then captured Kraft laughing in the audience.\n\nAfter completing his set, Ross and Brady hugged on stage, exchanging words with smiles on their faces.\n\nAs Hart returned to the microphone, he teased Ross, \"Wow, wow.

Who are absolute savages. The football guys held up their end of the bargain.\"\n\nThe Tom Brady roast was a star-studded event\n\nThe Netflix special \"Roast of Tom Brady\" on Sunday was a star-studded affair and saw some of the biggest names in sports and entertainment throw verbal jabs at the GOAT. The roasters included comedians Kevin Hart, Nikki Glaser, Tony Hinchcliffe, Sam Jay, Bert Kreischer, Jeff Ross, Tom Segura and Andrew Schulz.\n\nThey were joined by past NFL superstars Drew Bledsoe, Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski and Randy Moss. Some special guests, namely Ben Affleck, Bill Belichick, Robert Kraft, Will Ferrell, Kim Kardashian and Peyton Manning, also got in on the fun.\n\nBill Belichick stole the show\n\nOf all the roasters and guests at the Tom Brady roast, Brady's former coach, Bill Belichick, arguably stole the show. The six-time Super Bowl-winning coach began the night by taking a couple of strays but ended it by dishing out a fair share to his former players.\n\nBelichick roasted former tight end Rob Gronkowski, giving him some job advice in the process. The legendary coach said:\n\n\"A lot of people connected me with a saying called, 'Do your job,' and telling people to do their job. Gronk, I've been watching you on 'Fox NFL Sunday,' and I'm begging you, please, stop doing your job.\n\n\"I loved coaching Gronk. A great teammate, great, great player. A Hall of Fame player. ... Rob landed endorsement deals for some of his favorite foods, Campbell's Soup, Dunkin' Donuts, and don't forget... Tide Pods.\"\n\nNext up for Belichick was Hall of Fame pass-catcher Randy Moss.\n\n\"A lot of you don't know, but I really have a big heart,\" Belichick said. \"I rescued a dog from the shelter, and I rescued Randy from the Raiders. Listen, Randy, I'm really sorry you didn't get a ring. Not enough to give you one of mine, but I'm really sorry.\"\n\nOf course, Belichick had to go in on the man of the hour, Tom Brady. He reserved some choice words for the most outstanding player that he coached. Belichick said,\n\n\"Believe it or not, I've got a lot of nice things to say about Tom, but I'm running out of time here, Belichick said. \"I see your soccer team, Birmingham City, got knocked down another tier in the English Football League. Not so easy running a team is it, Tom? Little coaching advice, stick to American football. You're really good at that.\"\n\nHosted by Kevin Hart, the show was shot live from the Kia Forum in Los Angeles.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"},

Bill Belichick, Robert Kraft Rip Shot At Tom Brady Roast", "body": "Patriots fans probably felt some kind of way Sunday night watching \"The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady\" on Netflix.\n\nIt's been four years since Brady left New England in free agency, kicking off a three-year stint with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And it's been roughly four months since the Patriots parted ways with Bill Belichick, the head coach for New England's dynastic run that included six Super Bowl titles.\n\nYet, it took a live, unfiltered roast hosted in Los Angeles by Kevin Hart to finally bring some semblance of closure to a franchise that spent more than two decades as the NFL's lightning rod.\n\nSome jokes were uncomfortable. And that was the point. Whether it was Brady's divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen (and her reported relationship with jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente) or Aaron Hernandez's murder conviction and subsequent prison suicide, nothing was off-limits as former teammates, celebrities and comedians tore into the greatest quarterback of all time -- for the whole world to see.\n\nOne moment that undoubtedly struck a chord with Pats fans, though, came when Hart brought Belichick and Kraft together on-stage for a shot.\n\nSure, it was awkward. And yes, Kraft already sung Belichick's praises during a January press conference to announce the longtime coach's departure.

But the two shared the stage together on Sunday during the Netflix comedy special The Roast of Tom Brady, where Kraft had some very complimentary words for Belichick.\n\nWith the thanks of roast host Kevin Hart, Belichick and Kraft were brought to the stage together to share a shot. But before they had their celebratory drinks, Kraft called Belichick the \"greatest coach in the history of the game\".\n\n\"I want to say, this is the greatest coach in the history of the game,\" said Kraft. \"That did what no one else has done. Having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor that the good lord gave me.\"\n\nIt's a hard statement to argue from Kraft considering all Belichick was able to accomplish for Kraft in New England. Belichick's six Super Bowl championships of course mark the most of any coach in NFL history.\n\nYou can obviously argue whether Belichick or Brady had the most impact on those championship-winning teams. But the general consensus is that neither likely would have experienced as much success as they did without the other.\n\nStill, it is interesting to see these two sharing this kind of moment only months after Kraft let Belichick go.

Many jokes during the star-studded show, titled The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, poked fun of the former NFL star's, 46, divorce from model Gisele Bundchen , 43, and her moving on with Brazilian jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente, 35.\n\nNikki Glaser, 39, was one of the comedians who roasted the athlete about his split during the special. The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, which was part of the Netflix Is a Joke Fest, was streamed live, which Netflix touted as the first-ever roast to be telecast live, unedited. The festivities were held at L.A.'s Kia Forum in Inglewood. 'How much would it suck for Tom... omg, just knowing your ex-wife's new boyfriend could beat your [expletive] while eating hers,' she told the crowd. 'Tom, the only thing dumber than you saying \"yes\" to this roast was when you said, \"Hey babe, you should try jiu-jitsu,\"' she went on.\n\nIn another pointed jab Nikki added, 'You have seven rings... well, eight now that Gisele gave hers back.' However, Tom was a good sport about it all, and chuckled as Nikki continued to make fun of him. Tom and Gisele -- who share two kids together, son Benjamin, 13, and daughter Vivian, 10 -- finalized their divorce on October 28, 2022, after 13 years of marriage. Gisele started training jiu-jitsu in 2021, which is when it's believed she met Joaquim, her instructor. News of them dating was confirmed publicly in February of 2024. Among those who roasted the retired quarterback on Sunday were host Kevin Hart, Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, Drew Bledsoe, Randy Moss and Kim Kardashian.\n\nLater on in the evening, Tom had a chance to hit back at the unrelenting jokes as he fired back at Kim with a low blow regarding her ex-husband Kanye West. Brady, 46, referenced West, 46, when delivering his response at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles to the many celebs who roasted him at the event Sunday, with Kim, 43, being one of them. 'I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight...not because of this but because her kids are at home with their dad,' the NFL legend said, leaving the crowd roaring. The reality star - who shares daughters North, 10, and Chicago, six, and sons Saint, eight, and Psalm, four, with West - shook her head at the comment and held a restrained smile as she looked at the former New England Patriots quarterback, who she was romantically linked to about a year ago.\n\nA number of social media users predicted that West wouldn't have a sense of humor in regards to Brady's joke, and that it was only a matter of time before the outspoken artist responded to the pointed punchline aimed at his parenting. The seven-time Super Bowl winner did not stop there as he also ripped the Chiefs over Taylor Swift and her fans amid Travis Kelce romance during his rebuttal. Tom Brady ripped the Kansas City Chiefs over the team's new fanbase of Taylor Swift fans on Sunday night. The NFL icon suffered a fair roasting of his own at the hands of Kevin Hart, former teammates Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowsk, Bill Belichick and even Kim Kardashian during his Netflix live roast. However, after the onslaught of jokes about ex-wife Gisele and Spygate, the former quarterback had the chance of his own at a few quips.\n\nAnd the seven-time Super Bowl winner seized the opportunity to take aim at the reigning champions, the Chiefs. The 46-year-old blasted Patrick Mahomes and co. about their newfound fanbase, suggesting Arrowhead Stadium is mainly filled with Swifties - the fans of Travis Kelce 's girlfriend, Taylor Swift. 'Kansas City, you say your stadium is the loudest. It helps when your fans are 14 year old girls...,' he said, referencing the Swifties increased interest in the franchise amid their idol's romance with the star tight end. 'And in honor of TayTay, let's take a look at the Chiefs Eras; Terrible for 50 years, good for five. SHAKE IT OFF,' Brady added, with nods to Swift's Eras Tour and hit song. The Chiefs won their third Super Bowl in five years in February with many fans claiming it put Mahomes and co. on track for the claim to a dynasty like the New England Patriots of Brady's era. And Kansas City's latest victory came in front of Swift as the popstar cheered on her tight end boyfriend from a VIP suite in Allegiant Stadium as the Chiefs took down the San Francisco 49ers in overtime.\n\nElsewhere during the live show, Hart also chose to go for Brady's divorce. He first mocked him for choosing to 'unretire' and play a final, unsuccessful season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 'Gisele gave you an ultimatum. She said you have to retire or you're done. But when you have a chance to go 8-9 you gotta do it.' Like Nikki, he also brought up Bundchen's new boyfriend. 'You know who also [expletive] their coach? Gisele, she [expletive] her karate coach. Tom, how did you not see this coming? Eight karate classes a day?' Brady appeared uncomfortable as he raised his glass to the crowd in response. Brady's other former teammate Bledsoe also mentioned his marriage, while discussing how rarely the athlete would get sacked on the field, as he joked that he's 'pretty used to not being touched. Just like at the end of the marriage.'\n\nBledsoe also joked that he got to experience two things Brady never will: going number one in the NFL Draft and celebrating a 28th wedding anniversary. At one point in the show Edelman made a grim joke about his late former teammate Aaron Hernandez, who killed himself in prison by hanging, in 2017. 'Everyone always asks me how big Gronk's [expletive] is. Now don't get me wrong, it gets the job done. But there was this other Patriots tight end. Now he was hung,' he said, making a pun at Hernandez's death. Hernandez had committed [expletive] in his jail cell at the age of 27, as he was serving life in prison without parole for the shooting death of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd in 2013.\n\nHowever, there was one joke that appeared to get under Brady's skin. It happened when legendary comedian Jeff Ross took his turn to roast the athlete. Ross talked about Brady joining the Patriots after being drafted 199th overall in 2000. 'Tom became a Patriot, moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft 's office and said \"I'm the best decision your organization has ever made,\"' Ross said, adding, 'Would you like a massage?' Ross then blew a kiss to Kraft, who was in attendance. At that point Brady got out of his seat, walked up to Ross and said in his ear but loud enough for the microphone to pick up, 'Don't say that [expletive] again.' Kraft was charged with soliciting prostitution in February 2019 in Florida, with police saying they recorded Kraft paying for sexual acts at the Orchids of Asia spa in January 2019. He pleaded not guilty, and later a federal judge ruled that the recordings were filmed using unlawful surveillance. The case was dismissed in September 2019.\n\nMeanwhile Kim Kardashian was booed by the crowd in her hometown of Los Angeles when she took the podium at the roast. The reality star, 43, appeared caught off-guard by the chilly reception at the event. She was immediately jeered as she made her way onstage, pausing for a moment after thanking host Kevin. She appeared to be launching into a joke, telling Hart, 'I know a lot of people make fun of your height,' before appearing to do a double take at the outburst from her less than-adoring public. Kardashian, who sported blonde locks as she held a Champagne glass at the event in Southern California, sought to get the show back on track, saying, 'Alright, alright, alright, Kevin,' who himself appeared to jump in to do damage control as he said, 'Whoa, whoa.' A number of people on Sunday took to social media with real-time reactions to the chilly reception Kardashian received at the comedy event. 'Kim Kardashian getting booed at the Tom Brady Roast is incredible,' one user wrote, while another said, THEY JUST BOOED KIM KARDASHIAN BEFORE SHE EVEN SAID A WORD LMFAO.' Said one user: 'Bill Belichick gets a standing ovation and Kim Kardashian gets booed. The Tom Brady roast is the best thing Netflix has ever produced.'\n\nIn her set, Kardashian alluded to past rumors of a romance with Brady after they crossed paths last summer at a July 4 party in the Hamptons. 'I'm really here tonight for Tom,' said Kardashian, who past dated NFL players including Reggie Bush and Miles Austin. 'I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might.' Kardashian's set also included a reference to Caitlyn Jenner , who was formerly married to her mother Kris Jenner . 'I do know it would've never worked out,' Kardashian said. 'An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair ... you remind me too much of my stepdad now.' She added: 'Part of me thinks you would want to entrust me just to try on my clothes. I know the transition from the NFL must've been really hard, but I think my stepdad is a great example for you. 'She's one of the best athletes in the world, who proved you could do anything in this next chapter in your life. You can become a commentator, a far-right Republican or even a strong, confident woman.'\n\nKardashian made a reference to her late father Robert Kardashian's work on the late O.J. Simpson's 'Dream Team' of attorneys, to wrap up her set. 'Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast you,' Kim said. 'But I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players.' She concluded in saying, 'So I'm just here tonight to support you and celebrate you - I'll give you the same advice I give all of my exes, good luck knowing the best is behind you.' Brady was also roasted for his failed crypto commercials as well as his losses to the New York Giants. The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady can be seen on Netflix.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

He won seven Super Bowl championships (appearing in 10), five Super Bowl MVPs, and three NFL MVPs over his two decades in the NFL with the Patriots and Buccaneers. He made an outrageous amount of money and is set to make even more over the course of a monstrous deal with Fox to be their new lead broadcaster -- if he doesn't try to make another NFL comeback this fall.\n\nAll of this is to say, Brady should not be in a position where he's desperate to say yes to things like a celebrity roast. And yet, there he was on Sunday night sitting on stage as comedians (and Drew Bledsoe) tore into him on stage live on Netflix, looking like he was not exactly enjoying himself.\n\nWhile Brady's football career is unassailable, his personal life is not, and if he thought certain things would be off limits then he was very mistaken. There were plenty of divorce jokes, which he probably expected, but the line he seemingly drew in the sand was when Jeff Ross made a massage joke about Robert Kraft. Brady stood up from his seat, walked over, and very much not jokingly said \"don't say that shit again\" to Ross.\n\nKraft, of course, was charged with solicitation in 2019 after a sting at a Florida massage parlor, but pled not guilty. Ross, who showed up for the roast in a \"Roast J Simpson\" jersey, has never met a line he wouldn't dance over, and Brady was clearly not pleased with that -- and it briefly looked like we might have a Will Smith-Chris Rock moment.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "steven_hyden@uproxx.com", "name": "Steven Hyden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "megan_armstrong@uproxx.com", "name": "Megan Armstrong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/brady-ross.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

From Kevin Hart's Gisele joke to Nicki Glaser putting him on blast for the whole crypto debacle, no one was interested in going easy on the former quarterback. And as he did their entire career together, Bill Belichick also let TB12 have it. This time, very publically.\n\nAddressing all the chatter around the iconic QB-Coach duo \"butting heads a lot,\" Belichick went straight for the jugular as he said,\n\n\"Actually, it was very hard to butt heads with Tom, because he was so far up Alex Guerreros's a*s.\"\n\nAlex Guerrero is Brady's former business partner and someone whom Brady referred to as his \"body trainer.\" Guerrero was by Brady's side for much of his football career and even launched the brand TB-12 once he retired. Fans were equally tickled by this side of Belichick as he landed punches after punches:\n\nAccording to Patriots lore, things also began to sour beyond redemption between Brady and Belichick when Guerrero entered the picture. As per ESPN reports, Guerrero had a presence within the Patriots building despite not being employed by the franchise. He worked closely with Brady, and Brady even got his other teammates to work with Guerrero allegedly.\n\nHowever, Belichick sought to minimize Guerrero's presence in 2017 as he deemed him a problematic presence, which apparently became a contributing factor to his fraying relationship with Brady. Belichick seems to have taken this head-on in the roast of his former pupil, delivering not only a great joke but also insight for all the fans looking for an explanation.

And he continued several times in the show telling the others, \"please explain that joke to Gronk.\"\n\nKevin Hart as host said, \"We wanted to roast you in Florida but because of your governor we wouldn't be able to call you gay.\"\n\nMost of the jokes were about Brady's time with the New England Patriots and his marriage to super model Gisele B\u00fcndche, with teammate Julian Edelman calling him \"Leonardo DiCaprio's ex-girlfriend's ex-husband.\" And comedian Andrew Schulz told him, \"No matter how big you get, you end up as a twice-divorced supplement salesman in Tampa, Florida.\"\n\nKim Kardashian took the stage to squash rumors she is dating Brady. \"An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair, you remind me too much of my stepdad now,\" Kardashian continued, referencing her mom Kris Jenner's former spouse, Caitlyn Jenner, previously known as Bruce Jenner. \"Part of me thinks you would want to undress me, just to try on my clothes.\"\n\nThis roast, held during the Netflix is a Joke comedy festival in California, was the first time in history that a roast has aired live and unedited on television or streaming, according to Netflix. Clocking in at just over three hours, the roast was filled with jokes about Brady, his divorce, his ex-wife's new romance, his vanity, his awful business decisions and his complex relationship with former coach Bill Belichick.\n\nSome of the top burns:\n\n\"Tom, I wanted you to be our first G.O.A.T. to be roasted, because you're an example to future generations. If you work hard, eat right, film the other team's practices, deflate the balls and have the NFL make new rules just for you, you too can be the third-most famous guy in a Dunkin Donuts commercial.\" -- Jeff Ross\n\n\"Tom Brady. Five-time Super Bowl MVP, most career wins, most career touchdowns. You have seven rings -- well, eight, now that Gisele gave hers back. The only thing dumber than saying yes to this roast was when you said, 'Hey babe, you should try jiu-jitsu.'\" -- Nikki Glaser\n\n\"When we played together, Tom, you used to scream, 'Laser focus! Laser focus!' Now that's what he screams at his plastic surgeon. Who's laughing now Tom? Not you, because your face can't move and you don't have a sense of humor.\" -- Julian Edelman\n\n\"Tom is making a donation to every one of his former teammates' charities that came here tonight. And I gotta tell you, Tom, that is first class. Hey fellas, don't let him pay you in crypto.\" -- Peyton Manning\n\n\"Despite everything we've seen here tonight, Gronk was actually useful on the field.

But only one event could exist in just a single iteration: The Roast of Tom Brady, the live and 100% NSFW special aimed at the so-called GOAT of NFL-dom, with plenty of extra targets hit along the way.\n\nAnd wow to the wow, right from the kickoff, host Kevin Hart got right to it, setting the bar lower than low before Roast Master Jeff Ross took everything down to Hell and back again. Unsurprisingly, a whole lot of downright awful jokes were made at not only Tom Brady's expense -- \"Fuck you, Tom!\" came close to catchphrase territory -- but at the expense of everyone whose name came up during the event, which is already destined to be one of Netflix's best stand-up specials, especially with a run-time that pushed three hours.\n\nLet's loosen the gloves and dive into some of the harshest jokes that were made during the night, from gags covering the timeline of Tom and Gisele B\u00fcndchen's relationship to jokes about Rob Gronkowski's intelligence to a comparison between Brady and some of history's most notorious killers.\n\nAs soon as it was announced that Tom Brady would be the subject of a new celebrity Roast, the lineup of subject matter ripe for the pickin' was pretty clear, and his soured relationship with ex-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen, as well as co-parenting their children, would be on the table. But holy shit, that table was actually a butcher's block the side of a small neighborhood.\n\nNobody pulled any punches when talking about Tom Brady leaving the New England Patriots for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, or his failed cryptocurrency efforts, but none of those barbs were nearly as razor-edged as the CONSTANT barrage of divorce jokes that Brady suffered throughout the night. While the kids themselves were mostly off-limits, the jiu-jitsu instructor B\u00fcndchen was seen with, so to speak, was very much on-limits. Check out some of the zingers below.\n\nNo stone left unturned, as they say, even if \"they\" definitely weren't talking about Tom Brady's relationship woes at the time. There were 100% moments where the Super Bowl GOAT looked ready to crawl under just such a rock, but thankfully kept his game face on and laughed throughout the majority of the vicious punchlines.\n\nKevin Hart proved himself to be quite the energetic Roast host, as he gleefully took on every imaginable kind of joke about his height and his movie choices, and also gave lots of props while also dishing out a multitude of clever jabs. (That got a bit more slurred as the night went on.) And he let audiences know exactly what kind of night we were in for just by him talking about the very building the event was being held in, the Kia Forum, and its history tied to not Tom Brady's sport of choice, but basketball. In Hart's words:\n\nAnd before The Roast of Tom Brady could even hit the 20-minute mark, out came RoastMaster General Jeff Ross, wearing a flaming O.J. Simpson jersey and black gloves, even if he took both off after making this his blistering opening:\n\nThat was followed by Kevin Hart joking about Jeff Ross only being angered by the O.J. Simpson scandal because a waiter was killed. Even Tom Brady had an O.J. joke late in the Roast when he ripped on Peyton Manning with a line about a white Bronco speeding down the 405. I can't say I expected those in particular, but that was just naivety on my part.\n\nIt's always a delightful surprise whenever Will Ferrell brings Anchorman's Ron Burgundy out for a sports-adjacent appearance. The character is where some of Ferrell's most quotable lines came from, and he was certainly on-point after taking the stage at The Roast of Tom Brady, with the gag being that he kept complimenting Brady in spite of his innate hatred. But his big moment wasn't a traditional insult, but rather the fact that he set up a nightmare scenario for the NFL vet and his fans, in which seemingly the entire crowd chanted out:\n\nThe chant refers to the two Super Bowls where Tom Brady and the Patriots lost to Eli Manning and the New York Giants, and the bonkers plays that went into those victories. As a longtime NFL fan, especially one who recalls both of those Super Bowls quite fondly, this was one of the wildest things I've ever seen with my eyeballs and heard with my eyes. Props to everyone who took part.\n\nNothing is ever sacred when it comes to Roasts, and while past TV airings often cut out some of the most malicious comments, the live aspect of Netflix's special made that a no-go. And while I can't say for sure that jokes about NFL superstar-turned-murderer Aaron Hernandez and his in-prison suicide would have been cut from a Comedy Central telecast, for example, the number of them possibly would have been cut back.\n\nBut since we're already, we might as well point out a couple of pitch-black jabs that caused some of the biggest cringes of the night.\n\nI mean, when even the dude's former buddy and quarterback is bringing those jokes to the special, with a healthy dose of tequila involved, then I guess all bets are off. But yeesh while giggling behind my hands all the same.\n\nIt was generally a highlight to see Ben Affleck taking the stage to get all Boston about shit, although I can't say I expected his presence to be an extended rant against social media trolls. That said, it was still kind of fun to watch it play out, as weird and 2014 as it was.\n\nAnd if nothing else, the Oscar winner's presence gave Tom Brady a chance to invoke Kevin Smith by poking fun at Jersey Girl, Phantoms (yo), and Bat-fleck. What's the Venn diagram of Brady fanatics and Snyder-verse fanatics?\n\nIf someone only turned The Roast of Tom Brady on during certain moments of the special, one might easily be swayed into thinking Rob Gronkowski's intelligence was actually the target of everyone's prickly comments. Just about everyone took a swing at that broad side of the barn, and plenty of them were hilarious. (No props for some of the slurs used in those insults, nor during any of the gay jokes in this \"locker room\" though.) A few of the jabs that rose to the top:\n\nNearly as funny as the jokes made at Gronkowski's expense were the number of times the camera would turn to catch his and Kevin Hart's reactions, and the former tight end would look directly down the barrel of the lens. It happened so many times, I couldn't tell if it was him doing a bit, Office-style, or if he was only looking up because his name was said, and just happened to look into the camera 4 out of 5 times.\n\nSeemingly any online debate will eventually arrive at the point where one side compares the other to Adolf Hitler, but longtime envelope-pushers Bert Kreischer and Tom Segura didn't even wait for an argument to ensue. They came to The Roast of Tom Brady with a visual-assisted presentation that, in part, compared the former quarterback to some of history's most notorious serial killers, such as that other good-looking T.B., Ted Bundy.\n\nThe apex was reached when, while standing in front of the image seen above, the two comedians dropped this double-dose of gobsmackers:\n\nUnderstandably, this was one of a couple of points during the night when those on stage made sure to point out that the things being said were only jokes, and that they did not want to be harmed by others.\n\nFor a comedian whose entire career and persona are based in part on insult comedy, the onus was obviously on Tony Hinchcliffe to deliver the goods for his return to Netflix, which hosted his 2016 stand-up special One Shot. The comedian and podcaster absolutely slayed with every energetic pop that he delivered, with winning lines like those below (and others scattered elsewhere):\n\nAnd of all the jokes about Jeff Ross' Jewishness that were voiced throughout the three hours, I was possibly most tickled by Hinchcliffe saying that Ross only watches football for the coin tosses. Not everything he says has to necessarily be vile in some way, although when it does...watch out.\n\nSome wild AF jokes were made about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, specifically his alleged past dealings involving massage parlors and other topics, and former Patriots coach Bill Belichick also took on his fair share of shit-talk. But at no point did I think the twain should or would meet, but Kevin Hart made that happen by voicing into existence the former colleagues taking the stage to share a shot of booze.\n\nGranted, Belichick did not look like he was super-pumped to be doing so, and left the stage as soon as humanly possible, but good on him for being cordial about it without throwing his shot glass down like Gronk did.\n\nEven though the special featured all manner of A+ zingers about football, not even the world of professional wrestling went without a reference or two. Or at least one of its most successful superstars, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, whose history of joking with Kevin Hart and being the actor's BFF came up for a pair of hilariously NSFW jokes, as seen below:\n\nTo be expected, Kevin Hart lost his mind laughing at both of those, with Nikki Glaser taking a moment to extend her showmanship after making that comment, as one should after comparing another to a larger person's sex toy.\n\nHaving heard a near-unending line of hellacious opinions and insults thrown his way for the better part of three hours, Tom Brady was armed and dangerous whenever he finally took the stage again to close out the stellar special. Obviously a lot of his lines were prepared by others, but that's not important, since he was the one tipsily reading all those F-bombs for live audiences both in-arena and streaming from home.\n\nAnd he did indeed get some of the night's big whoppers, which were aimed at Peyton Manning, Kanye West (who went unnamed), Drew Bledsoe and more, as evidenced by the below:\n\nWhile I'm not sure if Tom Brady should ever take the stage for a televised stand-up special all on his own, this Netflix roast proves that he'd be a damned fine entrant in the line-up of roasters for whatever the next special is. Nothing has been announced during the rest of Netflix's 2024 schedule, but one can imagine if The Roast of Tom Brady is a big hit, then there will be more on the way sooner rather than later.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.

The pair were married from 2009 to 2022 and share two children, Benjamin and Vivian.\n\nJust before the roast began, host Kevin Hart spoke with ET from outside of the event and said that he was approaching the roast with a take-no-prisoners attitude and that nothing was off limits, including B\u00fcndchen, the dissolution of their marriage and B\u00fcndchen's new relationship with her jiu-jitsu trainer, Joaquim Valente.\n\n\"I'm being mean today,\" Hart, 44, quipped. \"I'm not nice Kevin today... I'm expecting to lose the relationship with Tom after today. I've already come in with that.\"\n\nThe actor and comedian added, \"Tom knows I love him. He knows all my stuff is coming from a place of fun and good heart, but I do have a job to do. I have a job to do.\"\n\nWhile Brady said in a promo for the event that it was \"no f**king problem\" that the comedians and friends alike would be coming at him hard and fast, the football star looked uncomfortable as the punchlines about his ex-wife added up throughout the night.\n\nThe roast also brought out famous faces and friends close to the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers star, including Kim Kardashian, Patriots CEO Robert Kraft, former coach Bill Belichick and Ben Affleck -- who recently starred in a Dunkin' commercial with Brady -- all of whom steered clear of jokes referencing the Brazilian supermodel.", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermodel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermodel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Affleck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2024-03/GettyImages-1131300356.jpg?h=e20c375f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The last thing I would ever want to do is disrespect another human being.\n\n\"...As I move forward, I hope to continue to use the platform with which I have been blessed to help others and to try to make a difference.\n\n\"I expect to be judged not by my words, but by my actions. And through those actions, I hope to regain your confidence and respect.\"\n\nThough he reacted to Ross' joke about Kraft, Brady notably stayed silent during Ross and host Kevin Hart's expletive-laden digs at his ex-wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, and the couple's divorce.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time in Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriot (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage_parlor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massage parlor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Massage_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Massage Equipment", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Massage_Therapy_and_Bodywork", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Massage Therapy and Bodywork", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b8e93b57341a266352a71b94c968c8e3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-02-", "textStart": 1103, "textEnd": 1116}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-01-", "textStart": 1269, "textEnd": 1281}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-09-", "textStart": 1462, "textEnd": 1476}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textStart": 1515, "textEnd": 1525}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

It was a rare chance for famous people to publicly acknowledge their most bizarre controversies, announce that they were in on the joke, and awkwardly laugh at themselves in the safety of a room of their peers. Joining a group of Charlie Sheen, Donald Trump, Justin Bieber, Joan Rivers, Alec Baldwin, Bob Saget, and countless more, football legend Tom Brady threw his name into the fire this past weekend for Netflix's The Roast of Tom Brady. Needless to say... it got weird.\n\nFor three hours, the night's roasters -- including Jeff Ross, Nikki Glaser, Kevin Hart, Kim Kardashian, and Will Ferrell (reprising his Anchorman character, Ron Burgundy!) -- roasted the seven-time Super Bowl champion alongside former football pro's Randy Moss, Julian Edelman, Drew Bledsoe, Bill Belichick, and Rob Gronkowski.\n\nThough everything from Deflategate, to his recent divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen, to his FTX investment scandal was on the table, one topic appeared off-limits for Brady. When Ross joked about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft's 2019 arrest for soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor, the football pro told Ross, \"Don't say that shit again.\" Aside from the one tense moment, Brady took more cordial hits regarding his lengthy football career.\n\nComedian Nikki Glaser dished out some of the best lines of the night, including calling Brady: \"The best to ever play for too long.\" She called the night the \"comedians' Super Bowl.\" Addressing their past dating rumors, Kim Kardashian joked, \"I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might.\" Randy Moss, a former Patriot alongside Brady, asked the football legend, \"Why the fuck didn't we cheat when I was there?\"\n\nAfter taking what felt like countless blitzes, Brady finally hit back. \"I can take all the hits,\" he told the audience. \"I would have done this earlier but I've been too busy winning championships.\" The former football pro also poked fun at Kansas City's recent Super Bowl win. He made reference to the team's frequent Taylor Swift appearances, joking, \"You say your stadium is the loudest?

So these jokes can be really, really mean.\n\nRoss is no stranger to this, and at one point, he brought New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft into the insult parade. Here was Ross's Kraft bit:\n\nSo, Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, \"I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?\"\n\nKraft was accused of soliciting sex from a woman at a Florida massage parlor in 2019. He publicly apologized, and the charges were dropped.\n\nImmediately after the joke, Brady fidgeted in his seat as Ross started blowing kisses to Kraft in the audience.

And he continued several times in the show, telling the others, \"please explain that joke to Gronk.\"\n\nKevin Hart as host said: \"We wanted to roast you in Florida but because of your governor we wouldn't be able to call you gay.\"\n\nMost of the very filthy jokes were about Brady's time with the New England Patriots and his marriage to super model Gisele B\u00fcndchen, with teammate Julian Edelman calling him \"Leonardo DiCaprio's ex-girlfriend's ex-husband.\" And comedian Andrew Schulz told him, \"No matter how big you get, you end up as a twice-divorced supplement salesman in Tampa, Florida.\"\n\nKim Kardashian took the stage to squash rumors she is dating Brady. \"An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair, you remind me too much of my stepdad now,\" Kardashian continued, referencing her mom Kris Jenner's former spouse, Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nThis roast, held during the Netflix is a Joke comedy festival, was the first time in history that a roast has aired live and unedited on television or streaming, according to Netflix. Clocking in at just over three hours, the roast was filled with jokes about Brady's divorce, his ex-wife's new romance, his vanity, his awful business decisions and his complex relationship with former coach Bill Belichick.\n\nHere are five of the top burns:\n\n* \"Tom, I wanted you to be our first G.O.A.T. to be roasted, because you're an example to future generations. If you work hard, eat right, film the other team's practices, deflate the balls and have the NFL make new rules just for you, you too can be the third-most famous guy in a Dunkin' Donuts commercial.\" -- Jeff Ross\n\n* \"Tom Brady. Five-time Super Bowl MVP, most career wins, most career touchdowns. You have seven rings -- well, eight, now that Gisele gave hers back. The only thing dumber than saying yes to this roast was when you said, 'Hey babe, you should try jiu-jitsu.'\" -- Nikki Glaser\n\n* \"When we played together, Tom, you used to scream, 'Laser focus! Laser focus!' Now that's what he screams at his plastic surgeon. Who's laughing now Tom? Not you, because your face can't move and you don't have a sense of humor.\" -- Julian Edelman\n\n* \"Tom is making a donation to every one of his former teammates' charities that came here tonight. And I gotta tell you, Tom, that is first class. Hey fellas, don't let him pay you in crypto.\" -- Peyton Manning\n\n* \"Despite everything we've seen here tonight, Gronk was actually useful on the field.

And after years of pushing back against the scandal, the legendary quarterback pointed the finger at himself for his role in the deflating-football scheme.\n\nBrady began by asking where NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was -- he was not one of the many guests in attendance at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles for \"The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady\" -- and that segued into a joke over the league's handling of the situation and an admission about Deflategate.\n\n\"Remember Deflategate? The NFL spent $20 million and found that it was more 'probable' than not, that I was 'generally' aware that someone may have deflated my footballs,\" Brady said, as seen on Netflix. \"You could've just given me the 20 million and I would've just told you I (expletive) did it.\"\n\nWhile Brady was telling a joke, it also felt like a confession from the 46-year-old. The future Hall of Famer has never outright admitted to any wrongdoing when it came to the scandal. Former Patriots cornerback Darrelle Revis even shared in \"The Dynasty\" documentary that Brady told the team the \"allegations are false.\"\n\nBut now Brady has laid credence that he was involved in the deflation of footballs. Brady did get severely punished by the NFL for his role in it all as the league suspended him for the first four games for the 2016 season. The Patriots were also fined $1 million and forfeited two draft picks.\n\nDeflategate will always be a black mark on Brady's illustrious career.

I could have got a coach from (expletive) Foxboro High School to make that decision. Run it again, Belichick.\n\n\"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious.

Brady got some jokes of his own, calling out Bills fans, Kanye West, and the NFL's investigation into \"Deflategate.\"\n\nBrady smiled and took most jokes of the night, but he made it clear that he didn't like one in particular. Comedian Jeff Ross told the story of Brady as a rookie telling Patriots owner Robert Kraft that he was the \"best decision\" his organization had ever made, followed by, \"Would you like a massage?\"\n\nBrady initially smiled, and Ross blew a kiss to Kraft, saying, \"I love Robert Kraft, I love -- \" before he was cut off by the former quarterback.\n\n\"Don't say that s**t again,\" Brady told the comedian.\n\nBrady's sore spot, his most obvious one of the night, came from allegations that Kraft solicited prostitution at a Jupiter, Florida spa in 2019. His charges were dropped the following year.\n\nKraft had been arrested along with at least 25 others as part of a human trafficking investigation. Kraft himself was not charged with human trafficking, but two counts of solicitation, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nIt was initially reported that Florida prosecutors had offered Kraft and others a standard pretrial deal for first-time offenders, where if they admitted they would be proven guilty at trial, they could swap time behind bars with community service, education courses, payments, and STD screenings.

I've already come in with that.\"\n\nThe Lift actor said that he and Brady have had a \"good run\" but that he is focused on being the best roast master possible.\n\n\"I don't think he has a real idea of, you know, what the world of roasting is, so it's going to get a little ugly but it's in fun!\" he said. \"And I think the world needs this. The world needs to see some, you know, some -- some cross-the-line humor that's done with a tasteful approach where people are having a good time on both sides.\"\n\nIn a trailer for the highly anticipated roast, Hart promoted the event by promising, \"No helmets, no mercy, no Brady rule.\" In the promo, Brady himself responded to the take-no-prisoners approach, saying, \"No f**kin' problem.\"\n\nAs for what kind of jokes he has prepared, Hart said that when he sat down to write them, he considered nothing off limits, including the end of Brady's marriage to Brazilian supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen. The couple announced the \"amicable\" end of their 13-year marriage in October 2022. At the time, B\u00fcndchen wrote in a statement, \"The decision to end a marriage is never easy, but we have grown apart.\"\n\nHart told ET that the panel of roasters -- including Jeff Ross and other surprise roasters -- could say or do anything in order to poke fun at Brady and get the laugh.\n\n\"I mean, I can't speak for what other people are doing or what I'm doing, it's a live event,\" Hart continued. \"It's a live event, man, you know? I think in the idea of funny, you have to be able to grab -- you got to -- you got to go and make the uncomfortable comfortable.\"\n\nHe added, \"Tom knows I love him.

He's having fun, look at him. I love what you do for the Jews, Robert Kraft. You're incredible.\"\n\nThe joke referenced a 2019 scandal when Kraft was charged with two counts of soliciting prostitution during a human trafficking and prostitution investigation involving several day spas in Florida.\n\nThe sports executive was accused of engaging in sex acts with one of the spa's employees, along with 24 other men and four women. Kraft pleaded not guilty, and the charges were later dropped due to a lack of evidence.\n\nWith the charges hanging over his head, Kraft, 82, appeared to conduct business as usual: in the summer after he was accused, he attended an institutional dinner alongside President Donald Trump in Qatar, and was later spotted partying with Jon Bon Jovi and Jamie Foxx in the Hamptons.\n\nWhile the charges were eventually dropped against the men involved in the scandal, the women still had to agree to a plea deal and pay hefty fines amounting to thousands of dollars.\n\n\"The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady\" aired as part of the Netflix Is A Joke, the streamer's 12-day-long live comedy festival taking place in LA.\n\nHosted by Kevin Hart, Brady wasn't only roasted by Jeff Ross, but also Bert

After saying, \"It gets the job done,\" Edelman mentioned another tight end who \"was hung.\"\n\nThe joke was a reference to Aaron Hernandez, who played for the Patriots before being convicted of murder. In 2017, he was found dead in his cell with his bed sheets tied around his neck.\n\nEdelman also managed to make the notoriously grumpy Bill Belichick laugh when he joked about the coach not being able to find a job after leaving the Patriots.\n\nNot everything was fair game, however. When comedian Jeff Ross -- a regular sight at celebrity roasts with seemingly no filter -- joked about Patriots owner Robert Kraft being charged for paying for sex at a massage parlor in 2019, Brady sat in his seat with a grin before approaching him.

I mean, specifically, the kind of \"Comedy Central\" Roasts that have been festering on television screens for over two decades. A room full of celebrities, some who know each other and some who don't, trade pre-written (by someone else) barbs aimed at being the most shocking, offensive, or cruel. A \"guest of honor\" takes most of the heat while the guests catch strays. They're gross, and often go too far, and for some reason, Tom Brady thought he could handle that.\n\nFull disclosure: I didn't even know this was happening. This kind of roast isn't affiliated with Comedy Central anymore. Netflix took the idea and \"Roastmaster\" Jeff Ross and added Tom Brady. The result is The Greatest Roast of All Time, which aired live on Netflix last night. The Roastmaster arrived to do his thing and quickly got on Brady's bad side.\n\nRoss told a brief story about Brady meeting New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. \"So Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\" Ross told the sizeable crowd. Kraft faced misdemeanor charges for soliciting prostitutes at a day spa in 2019.\n\nThe crowd winced and laughed. Brady is smiling his big, $100 million smile at first. Then he gets out of his seat and \"whispers\" in Ross's ear. \"Don't say that s*** again,\" Brady says, pretty much into the mic. He also tries to cover his mouth with his hand for a moment, like he doesn't want people to know what he says, then speaks at almost full volume. I put whisper in quotes because I do think that's what he was trying to do. It just didn't work out.\n\nI'm not surprised he couldn't take it. In the past, these roasts were done in front of, at most, 4000 people.

The future Hall of Famer, for whatever reason, signed up to get lit up for a few hours by various comedians and former teammates and coaches live on the streaming giant.\n\nIt was a pretty wild event, reminiscent of the golden age of Comedy Central roasts as the comedians and athletes that hit the stage all let it absolutely rip. Brady's divorce was frequently brought up, as was Deflategate, and Julian Edelman and Bill Belichick both seemed to use this as an excuse to get some things off their chest about Brady's longtime trainer, Alex Guerrero.\n\nHowever, the wildest joke of the night might've belonged to Brady himself, as he took to the stage and gave it right back to everyone. Among them was Drew Bledsoe, who Brady famously replaced after an injury to Bledsoe and never gave that job back. Few probably expected Brady to come at Bledsoe by way of a 9/11 joke, but he certainly did just that.\n\n\"Like the rest of America, I'll always remember where I was that fateful day in September of 2001, when tragically, those two Jets...slammed into Drew Bledsoe.\"\n\nI think this is made even crazier by the fact that Brady got up and told Jeff Ross \"don't say that sh*t again\" when he made a joke about Robert Kraft getting busted for solicitation at a Florida massage parlor, meaning Brady's line of joke tolerance has 9/11 coming in before his old boss' indiscretions.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "steven_hyden@uproxx.com", "name": "Steven Hyden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "megan_armstrong@uproxx.com", "name": "Megan Armstrong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_Central", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athletic trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/brady-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

It's unclear if Brady's response was scripted into the set.\n\nThe massage joke referenced the 2019 controversy involving the Patriots CEO when he was charged as part a human trafficking investigation surrounding a massage parlor in Jupiter, Florida. Kraft pleaded not guilty to two counts of soliciting a prostitute and released a statement at the time.\n\n\"I am truly sorry. I know I have hurt and disappointed my family, my close friends, my co-workers, our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard,\" he said in March 2019, as NBC News reported.\n\nHe added, \"As I move forward, I hope to continue to use the platform with which I have been blessed to help others and to try to make a difference. I expect to be judged not by my words, but by my actions. And through those actions, I hope to regain your confidence and respect.\"\n\nIn September 2020, Florida prosecutors dropped the solicitation charges, NBC News reported.\n\nStill, Ross's innuendo made Brady briefly stop laughing so he could confront the comic on stage.

I'm talking about The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, which streamed live and was, of course, unedited. The likes of Jeff Ross, Kim Kardashian and Peyton Manning were present to deliver some jabs at the expense of the former New England Patriot. Said event was hosted by a friend of Brady's, Kevin Hart but, despite their closeness, the comedian went hard when it came to making jokes. And we probably should've known that'd be the case, as Hart previously quipped that he was expecting to \"lose the relationship\" he has with Brady.\n\nKevin Hart has forged a public persona as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood, despite having an occasionally sharp tongue he puts to use when doing stand-up comedy. However, the A-lister spoke with ET before the show and stated that he wasn't going to be so kind during the big roast. That's when he jokingly made the assertion about what might happen between him and the seven-time Super Bowl winner after the show ended:\n\nThe Lift star, who's been making major moves at Netflix as of late, certainly made his stance clear while on the red carpet. What seemed to excite him the most is the fact that the roast's honoree wasn't too familiar with the ins and outs of a typical roast. Of course, the comic viewed the event as more than just an opportunity to take shots at his pal. He believed the streaming event could hold greater significance:\n\nOne could argue that the TV production was ultimately successful in that regard, as plenty of people were buzzing about it on social media over the weekend. And that's partially because of what the Jumanji star said while on stage.\n\nAs a whole, there are plenty of highlights from Tom Brady's roast, and I'd wager that some of the best (and harshest) jokes are going to be discussed for some time. Kevin Hart definitely dropped his fair share of zingers. For example, he was one of the many to joke about Brady's relationship with Gisele B\u00fcndchen, his ex-wife. Brady and B\u00fcndchen divorced in 2022 amid a flurry of rumors, including the assumption that Brady's unretirement led to the split. Hart used that as the basis of the following barb:\n\nHe didn't stop there, either, as he quipped that the former footballer was an \"idiot\" for not seeing any romantic sparks between Gisele B\u00fcndchen and her jiu-jitsu trainer-turned boyfriend Joaquim Valente. He also said:\n\nAdditionally, the Me Time star said that his friend left former Patriots coach Bill Belichick \"high and dry\" when departing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. So yeah, he certainly got in his share of jabs. Tom Brady, however, also took a sharp shot at the comedian during his big rebuttal:\n\nAll in all, I'd say that the friendship between these two is surely still intact. I mean, can you truly be friends with someone without being able to occasionally hit each other with playfully rude jokes?

Then again, should we be surprised? Anything Brady sets his mind to, he tends to be great at. As long as he was willing to be game for anything and everything -- save for a Robert Kraft massage joke -- this was bound to be a hit.\n\nPerhaps the most momentous union of the evening came when Kraft and his longtime New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick came together for a good ol' fashioned shooter.\n\nThat stunt was orchestrated by none other than comedy mogul Kevin Hart, a notorious Eagles fan.\n\nKraft waxed poetic about how great of a coach Belichick is/was, and well, he did coach the Pats to six Super Bowl victories. When addressing the topic of who deserved more credit between himself and TB12, Belichick was \"diplomatic\" in saying, \"It was both of us...because of me.\"\n\nWhile that was a great moment, I most definitely did not have a Kraft-Belichick shotski on my Brady roast bingo card. It'd have been awkward if they were apart the whole night, and let's just say Belichick was a little less than enthused about the whole situation.\n\nI mean, not like Belichick emotes very often anyway, but still. Everyone's skulls were positively blown open by this particular incident, including perhaps the most famous New England fan of them all and my sportswriting idol, Bill Simmons.\n\nThe closing press conference that Belichick and Kraft had at the end of this last season, when The Hoodie was making his grand exit from Foxborough, was awkward. It was way too brief and fleeting. Felt like an anticlimactic footnote wherein Belichick deserved better given all that he'd done for the organization. It was nice to see the two gents be somewhat cordial toward each other in a much looser atmosphere and show a bit of love. Nothing like a little booze on the brain to make your former brother in football arms lighten up a little.\n\nIt'll be fascinating to see how the Patriots fare in the post-Belichick era. He managed to overcome numerous blunders as a personnel executive with his incredible coaching ability and the fact that Brady was his quarterback for many, many years. once Brady left for Tampa and won another Lombardi Trophy there, Belichick was left with Mac Jones and a bare cupboard of talent on offense. Time will tell if Drake Maye is a worthy Brady successor, but ex-Pats linebacker Jerod Mayo has his work cut out as Belichick's uncontested replacement.\n\nAt least for one night, New England stans across the globe could forget about the somewhat cloudy, ominous future ahead and reminisce about the good old days.

Their union, spanning from 2009 to 2022, produced two children, Benjamin and Vivian.\n\nPrior to the roast, host Kevin Hart signaled his intention to pull no punches, indicating that topics like B\u00fcndchen, the dissolution of their marriage, and her subsequent relationship with jiu-jitsu trainer Joaquim Valente were all fair game. \"I'm not holding back today,\" Hart declared. \"I'm in full roast mode... I might lose my friendship with Tom after this. I've made my peace with that.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging his affection for Brady, Hart emphasized his professional duty to deliver humor without reservation.\n\nDespite Brady's assertion in promotional material that he was unfazed by the comedic barrage awaiting him, the evening saw him squirm as jokes about his ex-wife mounted.\n\nThe star-studded event also attracted luminaries from Brady's inner circle, including Kim Kardashian, Patriots CEO Robert Kraft, former coach Bill Belichick, and Ben Affleck, who notably refrained from jokes concerning B\u00fcndchen.\n\nAmong Hart's quips were lines like, \"Congratulations, Tom, on embracing the single life. It's been a while. Two years, to be exact... and in that time, Tom's been... well, let's just say he's been active.\"\n\nAnother zinger from Hart referenced the ultimatum B\u00fcndchen reportedly gave Brady, saying, \"'Retire or we're done.'

Others who appeared and spoke at the show included Bill Belichick (Brady's former head coach in New England), Jeff Ross, Kim Kardashian, and ex-teammates Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski.\n\nWhen it was Brady's turn to speak, he made a ruthless joke about OJ Simpson that caused a reaction from the audience. Simpson passed away at the age of 76 on Apr. 10 from a battle with prostate cancer.:\n\n\"When I heard there was a slow white Bronco heading down the 405 to come here tonight, I thought we might actually see a real football legend.\"\n\nAlso Read: NFL Fans All Noticed The Same Thing About Tom Brady During His Roast On Netflix\n\nBrady is referencing the infamous \"Bronco chase\" involving Simpson and his friend Al Cowlings on June 17, 1994. Simpson was charged with the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, and he drove off with Cowlings despite agreeing to turn himself over to police.\n\nAbout 95 million Americans watched the low-speed chase unfold on TV. Simpson arrived at his home and spoke to his mother over the phone before surrendering to police.\n\nSimpson was ultimately acquitted of both murders, but he was later found liable for the deaths of Brown and Goldman in a civil trial. Simpson was ordered to pay $33.5 million to the victims of both families.\n\nFrom jokes about his relationship with Bill Belichick to teases about his lost money in Crypto, Tom Brady was certainly handed a handful of awfully harsh jokes.\n\nBut the future Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee handled the entire event with class and sportsmanship.

The roast was a huge success and there were a lot of shots going around. The ex-Patriots quarterback took a lot of jibes from his friends, teammates, and popular comedians. There were shots taken at various controversies like Deflategate, his divorces, and different dating rumors about him. However, Brady did not take the roasts lying down. He made sure that he got some good shots back at other teams and their fanbases. One of his targets was the Kansas City Chiefs fanbase.\n\nAfter being roasted by everyone, Brady took to the dias to take some shots at people. He wasn't gentle with any of the people who roasted him, not even his own favorite ex-teammates. Furthermore, he also roasted the organization people are dubbing as greater than Brady's legacy: The Chiefs. Brady spoke about how the Chiefs have had 5 good years in the past 50 years of their franchise. He also took shots at the Chiefs, claiming the only reason they're famous is because of Taylor Swift's relationship with Kelce.\n\nBrady even made Swift references and said, \"Kansas City, you say your stadium is the loudest. It helps when your fans are 14-year-old girls... in honor of TAY TAY... Let's take a look at the Chiefs Eras; Terrible for 50 years, good for 5. SHAKE IT OFF.\" And that's not the only fanbase Brady insulted. He had some out-of-pocket insults for the Eagles as well.\n\nBrady did not hold back as he roasted fanbases throughout his part of the roast. After enduring more than 2 hours of roasting, Brady went a little unhinged with his roasts. He roasted the entire Eagles fanbase with some over-the-top roasts. Brady claimed that Philadelphia is filled with fans who have sad hopes of winning the championship.\n\nHe also made some wild allegations against them and said, \"Philly fans are a bunch of racist a**holes... But Kevin Hart is from there, so I understand. Philly has to grease their poles when they win a Championship, and how do they do it? By rubbing someone from Philadelphia on them.\" There was no love lost between Brady and the city of Philly. And even in a room full of comedians, Brady was holding his own well. Moreover, Brady handled the roast in a very likable fashion, making sure that he was a great sport about the jokes. It just remains to be seen what the implication of Brady's words from the roast will bring.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aditya_rajput@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Aditya Rajput", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagles_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eagles (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/86092e41-untitled-design-22.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Not only did Kevin Hart MC the event with comedians including Bert Kreischer, Tom Segura, Jeff Ross, and Nikki Glaser, plus NFL legends including Coach Bill Belichick, and former teammates of Brady's including Rob Gronkowski and Randy Moss, but there were other notable celebrities including Ben Affleck. The biggest pop of the night however came when none other than Will Ferrell took to the stage for The Roast of Tom Brady, reprising his Anchorman role of Ron Burgundy.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage, a living legend, a world class lover and the number one news anchor and all of San Diego, Ron Burgundy,\" the actor said in his own introduction before appearing on stage. Ferrell donned the iconic mustache for his appearance, taking to the podium to roast not only Tom Brady but Kevin Hart and also Bill Belichick.\n\n\"Hello my name is Ron Burgundy. I am a very big deal but tonight is not about me,\" the character said. \"We are here to honor a champion of the gridiron. A great American. A father and a sexy man. A true patriot until he was not of course, Mr. Tom Brady. Holy sh-t, this man is gorgeous. I've seen him on TV before but in person each year. Wow. Look at those cheekbones... All right. Back to the roast everyone. I never liked you Tom. In all my years of watching professional football, I never saw a more boring quarterback. The master of the six yards slant.\"\n\nBurgundy continued, some highlights include:\n\nOn Tom Brady's love life: \"The guys on SportsCenter, some personal friends of mine, used to praise Tom for his quick release. Not women by the way. Women were not impressed by his quick release...The last time this guy went truly deep, he ended up paying child support to Bridget Moynahan.\" On his former head coach Bill Belichick: \"Tom ruined football for all of us. Watching the Patriots play actually made me look forward to all the fun and laughter of a Bill Belichick postgame interview. By the way, Bill, wherever you are, I hope you know hope you know now, it was Tom, it was never you. Remember that period when people thought it was you? Well, it wasn't, it was Tom. I understand Bill you're currently unemployed, good luck on ZipRecruiter, a lot of jobs in the healthcare field. I hear male nurses are in great demand and with your bedside manner no one would wake up rather after gallbladder surgery and look into the loving kind face of Bill Belichick as he gives you a sponge bath. On his losing record to Eli Manning in the playoffs: \"Underneath that dead robot of a quarterback. There's a scared little boy. How do I know this? You don't see Eli Manning here tonight. Do you know that's because he's afraid of Eli Manning? Eli Manning made Tom Brady his b-tch. He made him his b-tch. On Tom Brady's post-football career choices: \"Don't worry. The nightmare is over. You can just sit back relax and talk about football and invest in cryptocurrency scams.\" On Tom Brady's protein shakes: \"I don't know if you know this. Tom has a whole line of plant based nutrition called TB12 Look it up. Yeah. It's good. I lost 15 pounds from the stuff. Those shakes work. I only had to drink one glass and for the next two weeks I was on the can with the worst case of diarrhea I've ever had. I recommend the cookies and cream shake. There's nothing like shooting out cookies and cream as your race to the toilet.\" On Tom Brady's upcoming job as a sports commentator: \"I can't wait for you to be up there on Fox sports commentating on when the game you loved or playing for the Raiders in the playoffs? Or coaching the Patriots or whatever the f-ck you're gonna do. I mean, let's be honest. Your best years are behind you Tom, the Super Bowls, Gisele, your movie career, it's all done. It's all gone. But you won't be forgotten. You will always be remembered as Eli Manning's bitch.\"\n\nFerrell has previously appeared as Ron Burgundy in a number of places beyond the two Anchorman feature films. He appeared on an episode of Conan to officially announce Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues, plus an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! the following year. Ferrell also appeared in character at a book signing for Ron Burgundy's \"autobiography.\"", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Kevin Hart hosted the special and was 'roasted' by host Kevin Hart, Ben Affleck, Kim Kardashian, Nikki Glaser, Robert Kraft and Rob Gronkowski on Sunday night.\n\nWhen Tom Brady took the stage, though, he used some of his time to rip on the Buffalo Bills and specifically, The Mafia. Of course, Tom Brady is one of the most notorious villains of Western New York. Brady had a record for 33-3 when playing against the Buffalo Bills during his career.\n\nI don't want to get the NFL too upset, I'm trying to buy a piece of the Raiders, I'm tired of owning just the Colts and the Bills. Buffalo fans call themselves the Bills Mafia? How are you the f****** mafia? At least the Mafia has a ring you can kiss.\n\nEven though Tom Brady rips on the Buffalo Bills, it does seem he has a budding friendship with quarterback Josh Allen. They have golfed together a few times and in addition, when asked about who will win the Super Bowl next, Brady has mentioned Josh Allen.\n\nHow did Kim Kardashian do during the Tom Brady roast?

(Getty)\n\nFormer American football wide receiver Julian Edelman has confused the internet by joking that he is \"gay\" for his old NFL teammate Tom Brady.\n\nDuring last night's live Netflix comedy special The Roast of Tom Brady, comedians including Jeff Ross and Nikki Glaser poked fun at legendary former football quarterback Tom Brady, touching on subjects including his marriage to model Gisele B\u00fcndchen, and his ambassadorship for cryptocurrency brand FTX.\n\nYet one of the oddest quips of the night came from Edelman, who decided to lean into an ongoing joke among NFL fans that he and Brady are \"gay\" for each other.\n\nAddressing fans' flippant remarks about his sexuality, Edelman said: \"I know there's going to be a lot of jokes about me being gay for Tom. Well, let me set the record straight. Those balls weren't going to deflate themselves.\"\n\nHis punchline referenced a 2015 NFL controversy in which it was discovered that Brady was aware that employees of his team, the New England Patriots, had been deflating footballs in order to give the team an advantage.\n\nBrady was suspended for four games, and the team was fined around one million dollars.\n\nWhile some fans declared Edelman's remark as the \"joke of the special\", others were left a little more confused by the pun.\n\n\"What is going on,\" demanded one fan on social media, as another simply wrote: \"What the f**k.\"\n\n\"The LGBTQ+ community aren't going to like that one,\" a third added.\n\nBrady and Edelman's relationship has sparked interest for several years, with some people even writing fan fiction about the pair online. In 2022, after Brady announced his retirement from the game, Edelman shared a photo of him on social media alongside the caption, \"Thanks for the memories, babe\" - further sparking fan theories and jokes.\n\nIn addition to quipping about his non-existent romance with Tom Brady, Julian Edelman also made a questionable remark seemingly directed at former NFL player Aaron Hernandez, who died by suicide in 2017.\n\n\"Everyone always asks me how big Gronk's [former NFL tight end Rob Gronkowski] d**k is,\" Edelman began.\n\n\"Now don't get me wrong, it gets the job done. But there was this other Patriot's tight end. Now he was hung.\"\n\nAudible gasps were heard from the crowd following the joke referencing Hernandez, who was convicted of the murder of semi-professional footballer Odin Lloyd in 2015. He took his own life in April 2017, five days after being acquitted of the double homicide of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtad in 2012.\n\nDespite joking about being \"gay for\" Tom Brady, Julian Edelman is publicly straight and has never come out as a member of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nHe has previously dated Brazilian model Adriana Lima, and has a daughter with Swedish model Ella Rose, who was born in 2016.", "source": {"uri": "thepinknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PinkNews | Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news | LGBTQ+ news"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Bill Belichick skewers Tom Brady's TB12 collaborator at Brady roast", "body": "Many NFL fans were curious to see how Bill Belichick would fare at Netflix's Tom Brady roast Sunday, and the long-time Patriots coach didn't disappoint with his performance.\n\nBelichick showed off his comedic side, delivering several barbs to his former star quarterback and eliciting big-time laughs from those on hand for the event.\n\nNone drew a bigger reaction than the shot Belichick took at Alex Guerrero, Brady's \"TB12\" collaborator.\n\n\"People say that Tom and I butted heads a lot, and in a way, that was true, but not really,\" Belichick said. \"It was hard to butt heads with Tom because he was so far up Alex Guerrero's ass.\"\n\nNaturally, that joke was well-received, as Guerrero was a central figure in Brady's final days with the Patriots. Tensions boiled over between Brady and Belichick, in part, because of Guerrero's presence with the team, so hearing the coach take a good-natured dig at him delighted those aware of the drama.\n\nHere's what to know about Guerrero and his relationship with Brady after the alternative-medicine man caught a stray from Belichick during Brady's roast.\n\nMORE: Breaking down the best highlights, biggest moments from Tom Brady roast\n\nAlex Guerrero was referred to as Brady's \"spiritual guide, counselor, pal, nutrition advisor, trainer, massage therapist and family member\" in a story by The New York Times. He is the godfather of Brady's son Ben.\n\nGuerrero trained several notable NFL players during his career and worked closely with Brady. Together, they created \"The TB12 Method\" and TB12 businesses while Guerrero trained Brady and several other Patriots at his Foxborough facility.\n\nMany members of New England's Super Bowl 51-winning team worked with Guerrero, including:\n\nGuerrero also worked with players like LaDainian Tomlinson and T.J. Houshmandzadeh early in his career before his association with Brady and the Patriots grew.\n\nOf course, Guerrero's career has not been without controversy. He was barred from being called a doctor by the Federal Trade Commission after claiming a supplement called \"Supreme Greens\" could serve as an \"effective treatment, cure and preventative for cancer, heart disease, arthritis and diabetes, and as a means of achieving substantial weight loss of up to 80 pounds in eight months,\" per Boston Magazine. Supreme Greens is a blend of vegetables, herbs, vitamin-rich grasses and MSM.\n\nGuerrero received a degree in traditional Chinese medicine from Samra University in Los Angeles. The school closed in 2010.\n\nMORE: Explaining the TB12 method, how Brady used eating restrictions during lengthy career\n\nBelichick and Guerrero didn't have the best relationship, which led to tension between Brady and the legendary coach during the end of their time together in New England.\n\nIn 2017, Belichick stripped Guerrero of team privileges the Patriots had previously granted him. This included the following, according to The Boston Globe:\n\nGuerrero was never an employee of the Patriots, but he had served as a team consultant and was given \"free rein\" around the building, per ESPN. But Belichick wanted to \"permanently clarify Guerrero's role\" and \"draw sharp boundaries\" around him with players feeling like they had to work with Guerrero to earn Brady's trust.\n\nMORE: Inside Bill Belichick's feud with Tom Brady trainer Alex Guerrero\n\nIn essence, Guerrero became a pawn in the power struggle between Brady and Belichick.

The only thing that was somewhat of a close call was when \"Roastmaster\" Jeff Ross made a massage joke directed towards New England Patriots owner Rober Kraft. Tom even stood up to intervene on that one.\n\nBut the highlight of the night was when Brady's former head coach (and partner for six Super Bowls) Bill Belichick came out on stage. He didn't appear with the rest of the roasters initially, so many were concerned that the head coach had ended up bowing out of the roast.\n\nHowever, the Kia Forum in Los Angeles, California went crazy when none other than Will Ferrell in character as Ron Burgundy introduced Bill Belichick. The often stone-faced Belichick came out to the Darth Vader theme song, and opened up his set with a great line:\n\nAfter starting out hot right out of the gates, the former Patriots coach made sure to clear the air on what streaming platform he was appearing on.\n\nWhile doing so, he made sure to take a dig at a documentary that wasn't so kind to the now jobless former NFL coach:\n\nBelichick then set his sights on the legendary tight end Rob Gronkowski. Bill brought up that he used to tell all of his teams that winning was as simple as doing their respective jobs.\n\n\"Do your job\" was a mantra that Bill shared often, but this time around, he made sure to tell Gronk that he should consider... well not doing his job:\n\nBOOM ROASTED.\n\nBill was shockingly comfortable up at the roast podium, and really stuck the landing when he got around to roasting Tom Brady. The entire arena gasped with laughter when Belichick dropped this roast-bomb right on the GOAT:\n\nAnd because Bill had no choice but to address the conversation about who mattered more to the success of the Patriots dynasty (Bill or Tom), Belichick finished off his hilarious set by setting the record straight:", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Ferrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theme music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darth Vader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady\u2013Belichick_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brady\u2013Belichick era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Bill-Brady.png?fit=1200%2C667&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

It was mostly a throwaway line, but it might get the attention of fans still holding out hope Brady, 46, decides to return to the field for the team he is trying to purchase a share of.\n\nActor Will Ferrell, in full character as Ron Burgundy from the comedic classic \"Anchorman,\" indicated Brady still has plenty of options even if he is past his prime.\n\n\"I can't wait for you to be on Fox Sports commentating on the game you loved or playing for the Raiders in the playoffs or coaching the Patriots or whatever you are going to do,\" Ferrell said. \"But let's be honest, your best years are behind you.\"\n\nThere were clearly Raiders fans in the crowd, as Ferrell had to briefly pause for applause after the mention of the Raiders in the playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Garoppolo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Garoppolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randy Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Ferrell"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/19146647_web1__The-Greatest-Roast-of-All-Time_-Tom-Brady_-8-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Apart from the fact that the short video showed the former New England Patriots head coach leaving someone's house without a shirt, there's no other context available.\n\nThe tweet with the video was posted on Nov. 9 but the footage had no timestamp or date. It's unclear when the incident happened, but it's clear that Belichick was still employed by the Patriots when the video surfaced online.\n\nSpeculation ensued after the video was posted, but additional info hasn't been found until now. The video is also not of the highest resolution, but it does appear to be Belichick or at least someone who looks similar to the legendary coach.\n\nThat didn't stop Tom Brady from bringing it up at the roast he was involved in on Netflix, which aired on Sunday. Via Mass Live, the former quarterback said:\n\n\"Everybody asks me which ring is my favorite. I used to say 'the next one.' But now that I'm retired, my favorite Ring is the camera that caught Coach Belichick slinking out of that poor girl's house at 6 a.m. a few months ago... hey, you've still got it! Respect, baby.\"\n\nThe roasting did not stop there as Tom Brady kept going in on the former New England Patriots head coach. Brady said that the decision to go with him and not Drew Bledsoe over two decades ago was one any coach could've made.\n\nHe jokingly admitted that the dynasty was all down to Bill Belichick's coaching:\n\n\"I mean, you had to choose between an aging, injured, overpaid Drew Bledsoe and a young, healthy, minimum-wage superstar. I could have gotten a (expletive) coach from Foxboro (expletive) high school to make that decision.\"\n\nHe doubled down, asking his former coach if he'd been able to win even a single Super Bowl without Brady after he left for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers:\n\n\"I've been out of the game for a minute so I'm curious, how many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left? Maybe it's not just the guy on the sideline. When I go to the Indy 500 I don't ask the winning driver, 'Hey, who gassed up your car?'\"\n\nBrady was referring to the never-ending debate over who was more responsible for the Patriots dynasty.

The NFL star split with the Brazilian model in October 2022 after 13 years and two kids.\n\nComedian Kevin Hart, the host of the Netflix comedy special, roasted his guest of honor, Brady, who proved to be a 'good sport' on and off the field. \"Gisele gave you an ultimatum,\" the 44-year-old took a jibe at the retired quarterback, adding, \"She said you have to retire or you're done. But when you have a chance to go 8-9 you gotta do it,\" as per OK! Magazine.\n\nHart then poked fun at Bundchen, who moved on with her new boyfriend and karate coach, Joaquim Valente. \"You know who also f---ed their coach? Gisele, she f---ed her karate coach,\" making fun of Brady for being in oblivion about the blossoming romance between the two, \"Tom, how did you not see this coming? Eight karate classes a day?\"\n\nThe former footballer laughed through the joke, raising a toast with his glass, but seemingly appeared uncomfortable. Other than Hart, Brady's friends and teammates like Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, Nikki Glaser, Drew Bledsoe, Randy Moss, and Kim Kardashian, pulled no punches roasting him over everything from Deflategate to his failed marriage.\n\nThe actor/comedian spoke to an Entertainment Tonight correspondent before the event and revealed he's approaching the comedy special without any limits. \"I'm being mean today,\" he quipped. \"I'm not nice Kevin today... I'm expecting to lose the relationship with Tom after today. I've already come in with that,\" referring to his mockery at Brady's marriage dissolution. However, Hart noted that the former footballer is not thin-skinned and is aware that his jokes are part of fun and games in alignment with the show's spirit. \"Tom knows I love him. He knows all my stuff is coming from a place of fun and good heart, but I do have a job to do. I have a job to do,\" Hart clarified.\n\nBrady and Bundchen share two kids: a 13-year-old son, Benjamin, and a 10-year-old daughter, Vivian. The fashion model announced their separation in a social media post, \"With much gratitude for our time together, Tom and I have amicably finalized our divorce. My priority has always been and will continue to be our children whom I love with all my heart.\" She continued, \"We will continue co-parenting to give them the love, care, and attention they greatly deserve. The decision to end a marriage is never easy but we have grown apart and while it is, of course, difficult to go through something like this, I feel blessed for the time we had together and only wish for the best for Tom always.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Model (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/691759/uploads/e87f11f0-0b6c-11ef-a557-2b55ee56ebd8_800_420.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 217, "textEnd": 222}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Would you like a massage?'\" Ross joked, referring to the start of Brady's career. Afterward, the former NFL star approached the podium and told him not to \"say that sh*t again.\"\n\nKraft was among 25 people facing first-degree misdemeanor charges for soliciting prostitution at a day spa called Orchids of Asia in 2019. The case was dropped after Palm Beach County Judge Leonard Hanser ruled the warrant that allowed the installation of hidden cameras inside the spa was unconstitutional.\n\nAfter Brady's incident with Ross, fans on social media quickly compared it to Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars for joking about Jada Pinkett Smith. \"TOM BRADY ALMOST PULLED A WILL SMITH????,\" one user on Twitter wrote. Another remarked: \"Tom Brady standing on business for Robert Kraft is sick.\" Check out the awkward moment between Ross and Brady below.\n\nAs for the rest of the roast, several of Brady's former teammates were in attendance including Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, and Drew Bledsoe.

Former players and fans felt the 10-part series portrayed Belichick in a negative light.\n\nThere was also ESPN's bombshell article, which explained how Kraft potentially played a \"big part\" in the Atlanta Falcons deciding not to hire Belichick as their new head coach, after he mutually parted ways with New England.\n\nFor Patriots fans, the hope is that the owner and former coach can bury the hatchet, if there is one, and celebrate what they created together -- a six-time Super Bowl-winning franchise with a dynasty that spanned nearly two decades.\n\nHere's hoping the gentlemen's shot was a step in the right direction.", "source": {"uri": "patriotswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Patriots Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordy_mcelroy@patriotswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Jordy McElroy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty_(1981_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dynasty (1981 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://patriotswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2024/05/2151631547.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

No subject seemed off-limits-not even the delicate topic of Brady's recent split from Gisele B\u00fcndchen, but clearly it wasn't the case.\n\nThe tension reached a boiling point when Ross, serving as the \"roast master,\" veered into sensitive territory. Recounting the story of Brady's legendary start with the Patriots, Ross highlighted Brady's draft position and his bold first interaction with Kraft. Mimicking Brady, Ross joked, \"I'm the best decision your organization has ever made.\" But Ross pushed further with a risky punchline, asking mockingly, \"Would you like a massage?\"-a direct jab at Kraft's past legal troubles.\n\nThe joke referred to the charges Kraft faced back in February 2019, linked to a multicounty investigation into massage parlors that involved secret recordings and allegations of soliciting sex, from which Kraft was eventually cleared in 2020. The gag elicited a mixed reaction from the audience at the Los Angeles Forum, blending laughter with audible groans.\n\nBrady's response was swift and stern. As Ross turned to acknowledge Kraft in the crowd, Brady confronted the comedian. Caught by a hot mic, Brady's warning to Ross was clear: \"Don't say that s--- again.\" The remark, though delivered quickly, underscored Brady's displeasure and his protective stance towards Kraft, hinting that while he was prepared for personal roasts, he expected the jabs at others, especially those close to him, to remain off-limits.\n\nThe incident, captured live, added an unexpected layer of intensity to the event, as Brady showcased his loyalty and perhaps, a line that even a roast should not cross. Ross, for his part, acknowledged the rebuke with a laugh, a moment of levity in an otherwise tense exchange. This incident, a stark departure from the usual roast antics, highlighted the complex dynamics of friendships and loyalties within the high-profile circles of sports and entertainment.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage_parlor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massage parlor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/24d066dda2c405f376ac6a56309819b5/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/05/06/17149694462338.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-02-", "textStart": 891, "textEnd": 904}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Naturally, the event drew some of the most annoying elites (they are all Brady's friends, after all). Robert Kraft, Kim Kardashian, and Chelsea Handler were all on hand to say mean things. Unfortunately, most of them were...not that funny. Kevin Hart called him stupid, Jeff Ross called him gay, and Nikki Glaser called more attention to his wife's hot jiu-jitsu instructor boyfriend.\n\nWhile most of the jabs at Brady were about as flaccid as all those footballs the Patriots deflated (thank you! thank you! I'll be here all week!), those in the audience got dragged to absolute hell and back. For instance, Kardashian (who also attempted to get some shots in at Brady despite some apparent issues with the teleprompter) was one of them.\n\n\"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight,\" Brady told the audience at one point. \"Not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad.\" Ope! A Ye meltdown post is imminent, I fear. But that -- or the onslaught of boos directed at Kardashian when she took the stage for a toast to Brady -- wasn't even the most gasp-inducing moment.\n\nJeff Ross, known as the \"Roastmaster General\" at the event, made a joke about massages aimed at Brady's former boss, Robert Kraft. Watch it here. You might remember that in 2019, the team's CEO was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors in which authorities confirmed that Kraft and other men were recorded soliciting sex workers. Kraft never pleaded guilty to the solicitation charges and was ultimately cleared in 2020.\n\nThe moment could've passed with a giggle or a shift in one's seat but Brady didn't see it that way. Instead, he exacerbated the situation and pulled a Will Smith. No, he didn't give Ross a shiner (imagine if he did though!). But he did get up from his seat and deliver this warning on Kraft's behalf in Ross' ear...that was caught on mic: \"Don't say that shit again.\"\n\nOf all the things to get your jockstrap in a twist over it's...your zionist sex pest former boss's past indiscretions that does it?

Their task was to condense the content into a concise, entertaining 60-minute presentation. Nonetheless, the \"joke of the night\" came from the GOAT himself when addressing Kim Kardashian and referencing her ex-husband Kanye West: \"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad.\"\n\nPart of Netflix Is a Joke Fest, \"Greatest Roasts of All Time: Tom Brady\" featured the former quarterback, known for his 20 seasons with the New England Patriots and three with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, taking humorous jabs from some of the biggest names in comedy. Hosted by Kevin Hart and Roastmaster Jeff Ross, the event included former teammates Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, and Drew Bledsoe, as well as stand-up comics Tom Segura, Nikki Glaser, Andrew Schulz, Bert Kreischer, Tony Hinchcliffe, Sam Jay, and more.\n\n\"We're here to roast the greatest quarterback of all time,\" Hart quipped. \"Oh, wait, Joe Montana's here?\"\n\nA montage of Brady's achievements, starting from his days at the University of Michigan and highlighting his journey to becoming a three-time NFL MVP, set the stage for the evening.\n\nBrady made a grand entrance onto a stage surrounded by his former teammates, exclaiming to the crowd, \"Are you guys ready? It's game time. Let's go!\"\n\nVIP tables, occupied by Chelsea Handler, Jim Gaffigan, Shane Gillis, and Netflix executives Ted Sarandos and Bela Bajaria, encircled the stage, adding to the star-studded atmosphere of the event.\n\nFormer teammate \"Gronk\" took the spotlight with the most peculiar moments of the night, delivering a sometimes incoherent barrage of jokes that culminated in smashing a glass on the stage, causing it to shatter and send shards flying onto nearby tables.\n\nHere are some of the best jokes and craziest moments from the special:", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.

After moderator Whoopi Goldberg noted that Brady was a \"good sport\" throughout the program, Navarro took issue with that assessment.\n\n\"If I was getting paid what he was probably getting paid -- he was an executive producer -- I'd laugh at all sorts of things. But I think the person who wasn't getting paid and ended up being part of this roast was Gisele,\" Navarro said before noting a recent incident in which B\u00fcndchen was in tears during a traffic stop because she was trying to flee the paparazzi. \"Leave Gisele the hell alone. Go make your money elsewhere!\" she added.\n\nAlyssa Farah Griffin then raised her own issue with the event, particularly when Kim Kardashian was treated to boos from the crowd as soon as she took the stage: \"This was before she said anything. Just when she went up. I was like, 'Is it a crowd of Swifties? What is going on?' It's a little verging on mean-spirited.\"\n\nGriffin went on to note, \"I don't know that Tom Brady would've known there were Gisele jokes because I think they were made at his expense. But I see the point that she was the butt of a lot of jokes.\"\n\nNavarro then argued that Brady's silence amid the slights against B\u00fcndchen made the matter even worse since he spoke up when New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was the subject of a joke about his penchant for massages -- which was a reference to the solicitation charges brought against Kraft in 2019. (When Roastmaster General Jeff Ross joked, \"So Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?\" Brady then took to the stage and warned Ross, \"Don't say that s*** again.\")\n\n\"So he wanted it to be knocked off when it came to Robert Kraft, but not for Gisele?

Fans are going crazy", "body": "Tom Brady is grabbing headlines on a Sunday, just like he used to during his time in the NFL with the New England Patriots and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This time, though, he's back in the limelight because of something entirely different from what he became famous for. During Sunday's The Roast of Tom Brady, the former NFL quarterback's tolerance for jokes was put to an absolute test. However, he also got to take shots at others, including the NFL itself.\n\nDuring a moment in the event, Brady touched on the subject of \"Deflategate\" and roasted the NFL for it.\n\n\"Remember deflategate? The NFL spent $20 million and found that it was more probable than not that I was generally aware that someone may have deflated my footballs. You could have just given me the $20 million, and I would just told you I f**king did it.\"\n\nUnfortunately for everyone who watched the event, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was not in attendance. It would have been so much fun if people got to see his constant reaction to that hilarious jab from the seven-time Super Bowl champion.\n\nTo set the record straight, Tom Brady did not admit to anything. Deflategate, to him, is perhaps nothing more than just a topic worthy as material for events like, well, live roasting. At the height of the controversy, Brady had to seek legal help to fight the suspension the NFL slapped him. He was successful in that regard in 2015 because he was able to play that year's NFL campaign. However, he ultimately accepted the league's penalty and spent the first four games of the 2016 NFL campaign off the field to serve his suspension. On that of Brady's suspension, the Patriots were also stripped of two draft picks in the 2016 NFL Draft and fined a total of $1 million.\n\nFor what it's worth, the Patriots managed to win three of four games during his time away from the team. Once he returned, Brady used his burning desire to have the last laugh amid the controversy to fuel the Patriots into winning 11 of 12 games. And oh, the Patriots also won the Super Bowl that season in epic fashion, defeating the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl 51 despite being down by as many as 25 points (28-3) in the contest.\n\nFans react to Tom Brady's Deflategate shot at NFL\n\nMany took it upon themselves to point out to everyone, who may be thinking they just heard Brady confess, that it was all a joke. Suprise!\n\n\"No, he's saying instead of wasting the 20 million to find out if he did it, give him the $20 million and he would just say he did it whether true or not,\" said @uncletyler_eth.\n\n\"He was saying that he would say it for $20 mil like he was saying he would do anything for $20 mil he wasn't admitting to it he was saying he would say he did it if it meant he got $20 million\"\n\n\"Brady got up there drunk asf and started to yap \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d,\" commented @Davethe_King1.\n\n\"Took some balls. Deflated ones. But took them nonetheless,\" joked @CincyHub.\n\n\"Pretty sure he was more making a joke that he'd admit to anything for $20 mil,\" said @Stark_AJ199.\n\n\"Still beat the garbage colts by like 40 points.

The feeling of being the No. 1 overall draft pick in the NFL... and a 28th wedding anniversary, it was yesterday.\n\nNikki Glaser made the room gasp with:\n\nTom, the only thing dumber than you saying yes to this roast was when you said, 'Hey babe, you should try jiu-jitsu.'

With comedic performances by Bill Belichick, Robert Kraft, Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski and a host of actual comedians, Patriots fans were given a rather unique evening of shock and laughter.\n\nAnd for some people in the world who hoped for some Deflategate content, Brady himself delivered on that one.\n\nDuring Brady's time at the dais, the quarterback spoke about one person who was not in attendance for the festivities: NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.\n\n\"But where's Roger Goodell?\" Brady said with some mischief in his voice. \"Remember Deflategate? The NFL spent 20 million dollars and found that it was 'more probable than not' that I was 'generally aware' that someone may have deflated my footballs. You could've just given me the 20 million and I would've just told you I [bleeping] did it.\"\n\nThat comment generated a standing ovation on the stage for Brady, though it left Gronkowski looking a bit puzzled.\n\n(With the warning that a naughty word pops up, video is here.)\n\nBrady never has spoken too much about that farcical saga that spanned from January 2014 through October of 2016, a period which featured Goodell going to great lengths to try to tear down Brady's entire legacy, only to see the quarterback author a third Hall of Fame career from ages 39 to 45. The recent episode of \"The Dynasty\" docuseries included Darrelle Revis saying that Brady was \"bawling his eyes out\" when addressing the team as the controversy began, and considering the greatest player of all time suddenly found himself being accused of being a cheater, it clearly is something that he's taken personally.\n\nYet Brady's taken the high road whenever crossing paths with Goodell -- meetings that typically happened under confetti showers following Super Bowl wins, or at the Super Bowl MVP press conference the day after a championship.

Credit - USA TODAY Sports\n\nTom Brady finally became the butt of the joke, which used to be Bill Belichick's gig ever since the 'Dynasty' docu-series dropped. Everyone took digs at the old man, even his former players. The ex-Patriots head honcho, however, finally got his payback at the 'The Tom Brady Roast' last Sunday. Yet, his subtle jabs weren't just directed at Brady but at another former Patriot, Danny Amendola.\n\nTwo-time Super Bowl-winning wide receiver, Danny Amendola, hasn't shied away from giving his former head coach the business when it came to cricizing him. From claiming that the 'Patriot Way' revolved around Tom Brady, not Bill, to asserting on the infamous docu-series that even a young Boston fan knew TB12 was meant to stay -- Amendola has been busy.\n\nBill Belichick surely got the wind of this too, and at the first-ever live-taping of the roast show, he didn't shy away from a ruthless clapback. The eight-time Super Bowl-winning coach made sure everyone knew about Amandola's performance on the field, which wasn't quite as explosive as his off-field banter.\n\n\"Danny joined us in 2014 and had 200 yards. In 2016 he had 250. Or what Randy [Moss] would call a decent first half,\" Belichick quipped, as per Alex Berth on X.\n\nEveryone had their eyes set on Roastmaster General Jeff Ross and host Kevin Hart, but it's safe to say Bill Belichick turned out to be the one to steal the show. However, the Amendola dig wasn't the only moment that left the audience and football fans gasping for air.\n\nWhile Belichick's cheeky dig at Amendola went somewhat unnoticed, his other witty comebacks were much appreciated by the fans. For instance, he labeled the 'Dynasty' docu-series as his version of the roast, saying,\n\n\"I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix. That's not to be confused with The Roast of Bill Belichick, the ten-part Apple TV series,\" as per Boston.com.\n\nBill then hilariously recounted if he and Brady ever \"butted heads,\" and the answer must have been no, as he quipped, \"It was hard to butt heads with Tom because he was so far up Alex Guerrero's ass.\"\n\nNext up was Rob Gronkowski, Belichick's prodigal son and arguably the best tight end to grace the gridiron. The head coach, who is currently without a job himself and is looking to make a broadcasting debut, wasn't at all impressed by Gronk's time on FOX NFL Sunday. In fact, Bill even pleaded with him to call it quits.\n\n\"Gronk, I've been watching you on FOX NFL Sunday, and I'm begging you: Stop doing your job. Do another job. Do somebody else's job!,\" he said.\n\nThe shenanigans didn't end there, as when Brady and Gronk got their turn at the podium, the duo highlighted two separate incidents, all pointing in one direction: Belichick dating young college girls.\n\nThis roast will go down in history as one of the grandest off-field events football has ever indirectly helped bring about. Only the live-taping of the event has taken the internet by storm; thus, it can be said with certainty that it will remain the talk of the town for a while.

Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIn the latest Netflix special 'The Roast of Tom Brady', former Patriots HC Bill Belichick was the casualty of one of the sickest roasts of the night. The format of the show is such that everyone who roasts gets roasted back. But Belichick might have gotten a lot more in return than what he gave.\n\nFormer Patriots WR Julian Edelman took on the responsibility of roasting his former HC Bill Belichick with much interest. The charming Edelman revealed that back when he was a player for the Patriots, the HC would always compare the players with Foxboro high school students and how they could make better plays than the Patriots players.\n\nEdelman however now sees Belichick's current condition as the perfect opportunity for a rebuttal as he brutally reminds his former HC that his only offer currently might be from Foxboro High.\n\n\"You remember when you used to yell at us? Look, assholes, the fucking kids down at Foxboro High can make that fucking play. I've been waiting for this for so long. Look, asshole, Foxboro High is the only job offer you fucking had.\"\n\n\"Do your job? More like need a job, coach!\" said Edelman ending his roast with a venomous payback. The crowd, including Tom Brady, was left stunned by Edelman's scathing roast. Bill Belichick however didn't take it to his heart as he broke his stoic character and laughed hard at the joke.\n\nWhile Belichick didn't have a roast with such extensive buildup and punchline, the HC did take a job at Patriots owner Robert Kraft which has left the internet melting!\n\nThe last time Bill Belichick appeared on a streaming platform, he wasn't portrayed in a positive light. Yes, we are talking about 'The Dynasty', the 10-part Apple TV series tracking down the intricacies behind the New England Patriots' dominant era. HC Bill Belichick in the Robert Kraft-led documentary was shown as a stubborn cold hearted man with a short temper.\n\nHis portrayal of the way he treated Brady with tough love and Belichick's handling of the Aaron Hernandez situation put him in a bad light. Hence addressing this skewed portrayal, Belichick started his roast with a cheeky dig. He expressed his gratitude to be part of Brady's roast and urged people not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick - 'The Dynasty'.\n\n\"Seriously I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix,\" Belichick said. \"It's not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10-part Apple TV series.\"\n\nBelichick being shown in negative light was condemned by many of his former players. From Rodney Harrison to Ty Law, many came in support of their former HC and spoke against the documentary.

There is a key reason. On September 23, 2001, Bledsoe suffered a life-threatening injury after a brutal hit by Jets' Mo Lewis. It necessitated the need for a new quarterback. Hence, Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick introduced Brady to his team. And the rest is history.\n\nUnfortunately, things were never the same for Bledsoe. He lost his spot forever. Months later, Bledsoe moved to the Bills and later switched to the Cowboys. But by then, he lost five years in his career and sadly lost his spotlight. Cut to 2024, the 52-year-old QB got a perfect opportunity to exact revenge on Tom Brady. And he utilized it to the utmost.\n\nBledsoe, appearing in Netflix's Greatest Roast of All Time took a shot at his former foe Tom Brady with a striking statement. The former QB compared Brady's supremacy in the field and his failed marriage with supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen. And the result was hilarious. A vocal Bledsoe shared these words.\n\n\"You got so used to not being touched on the field, just like the end of your marriage,\" he said. It surprised the audience as they expected Bledso to talk about losing the spot to Brady.\n\nReacting to Bledsoe, Brady took a drink and appeared candid. He also made a toast gesture which signaled all was well with his former foe. However, the roast went viral because of its striking on-field and off-field comparison. Later his ex-teammates Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski also shared savage moments and made the event unforgettable for the fans.\n\n22 years after losing the Patriots' job, Bledsoe could probably sleep well today. The reason? He could give it back to Brady for the first time.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bledsoe_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bledsoe County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bledsoe County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mo Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drew Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/2d415020-tom-brady-and-drew-bledsoe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2001-09-23", "textStart": 142, "textEnd": 160}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Ignited by Kendrick Lamar and Drake, dank jokes, offensive lines and full-contact comedy have reached the NFL world, thanks to Tom Brady and his Netflix special - The Roast of Tom Brady.\n\nWhile many expected the best roasts to come from Brady's ex-teammates and close ones, Kevin Hart surprisingly came with some of the most brutal lines. The popular actor and comedian hit TB12 where it hurts by focusing on the GOAT's divorce with Bundchen. \"Gisele gave you an ultimatum,\" Hart started. \"She said you have to retire or you're done. But when you have a chance to go 8-9 you gotta do it.\"\n\nThe biggest shocker of the night from Hart however came when he brought Antonio Brown into the conversation. \"She (Gisele Bundchen) came as Antonio Brown's plus 1 for the night. How is that?\" the comedian stated. It's no secret that Brown has not been a fan of Brady, alleging the QB to have befriended him for winning a ring. Moreover, things got weird when AB posted photos and videos of him with Gisele amidst rumors of TB12's divorce. Hence, a dig like this from Hart was pure evil.\n\nAntonio Brown also didn't waste time in reacting as he loved the joke and posted the video with the caption, In the crowd as Gisele's +1 [laughing emoji].\n\nUnfortunately for Tom Brady, Kevin Hart's dank offensive lines were just the beginning.\n\nA few more brutal lines from Hart came when he joked about the cheating rumors of Gisele and Joaquim Valente. Kevin asked Tom how despite seeing Gisele take eight classes a day, he couldn't connect the dots that things were fishy. \"I mean Jesus Christ, Tom. One of the smartest quarterbacks ever played a game. How did you not see this coming? Eight f-king karate classes a day,\" the comedian said with no remorse.\n\nThe punchline came when Hart pointed out that despite the eight classes, Gisele being a white belt should have been the giveaway. \"Eight karate classes a day and she's still a white belt. F-k Tom. The only bruises she had were on her a*s. everybody should have known it,\" joked Hart.\n\nFormer Patriots QB Joe Bledsoe also joined the fun as he drew a parallel between Brady's ability to evade sacks with him evading Gisele's touch at the end of his marriage. \"...Pretty used to not being touched. Just like at the end of the marriage,\" said Bledsoe. Comedian Nikki Glaser also chimed in joking about how Brady now has eight rings thanks to Gisele. \"You have seven rings.

Mandatory Credit: Winslow Townson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTom Brady got roasted last night, and it was glorious to see him sit there and take it like a tough cookie. During the live-taping of the event, everyone took a jab at his appearance, being picked in the 6th round, his TB12 method, his divorce, and several other topics. However, another recurring theme that emerged was Brady's association with his diet coach, Alex Guerrero.\n\nEven though the former NFL star has made it abundantly clear that he prefers to keep his relationship with his long-time diet guru, Alex Guerrero, out of the limelight, the roast didn't go easy on anyone, not even this touchy topic. Despite Brady's discomfort with discussing Guerrero, the jokes continued.\n\nYet, like a true competitor, Brady remained a good sport, sitting through the entire session with a subtle unease evident on his face. It must have been challenging for the 3-time MVP, given his aversion to discussing Guerrero openly. There's even that memorable incident when he abruptly ended an interview because the interviewer refused to respect his wish to steer clear of the topic.\n\nDuring a 2019 radio appearance with WEEI in Boston, Tom Brady was inquired about his controversial trainer and, even though he was willing to answer a question about him in brief -- TB12 didn't like the repeated follow-up questions posed to him by the interviewer.\n\nThey asked Brady about Alex being present with him on the plane that season when he missed the 2nd half of the previous season, to which the seven-time Super Bowl champ gave an affirmative answer. When the interviewer pressed further for clarification for Guerrero not being alongside Tom during the 2017-18 season, the season in which the Patriots lost to the Eagles in the Super Bowl; Brady clammed up, refusing to get into the incident.\n\nHowever, the dogged interviewer tried his luck yet again to force an answer out of the three-time MVP, and while Brady' asserted that he didn't want to get into it, he gave a brief reply, stating the importance of his relationship with Guerrero. Frustrated with repeated ignorance of his request, Brady said his goodbyes and left the call in a hurry.\n\nBrady and Belichick's relationship had soared beyond repair even before he left New England for Tampa. During the 2017 season, this friction led to Bill banning Alex from flying with the team and even taking his sideline privileges during game days. The team's medical staff didn't quite agree with or like Guerrero's alternative medicine and treatments, which led to the latter's ban.\n\nThough it was Brady's roast, everyone got their fair share of banter. However, some were grilled more than others, like Giselle and her Jiu-Jitsu instructor and Aaron Hernandez. However, as per Bill Simmons of the Ringer, Guerrero got the worst of it and was one of the losers in the Roast.\n\nThere were plenty of one-liners aimed at the Brady-Guerrero relationship. TB12's former head coach, Bill Belichick, while taking a dig at Guerrero, quipped, \"People said Tom and I butted heads a lot. In a way, it was true, but not really because it was hard to butt heads with Tom because it was so far up Guerrero's a**.\"\n\nMoreover, Julian Edelman, taking a mickey at Alex's weird practices and things he made Tom do, said, \"In case you didn't know, Alex Guerro is the snake oil salesman who turned Tom into a f*cking weirdo.\"\n\nAnother one of the roasters called Alex, Brady's wife, and playfully said, \"I don't want to talk about your wife. He's here actually! Alex Guerrero everyone!!\"\n\nWhile Guerrero turned out to be a loser and would have wished his invite had gotten lost in the mail, the winner was clearly Brady, who got to occupy center stage once again. He took it like a true champion and dished it out perfectly too. His jokes about Peyton Manning being in his shadow, him owning the Colts and Bills, and football being the love of his life.\n\nEveryone got to see the side of Brady and Belichick that the duo didn't show during those 20 years in Foxborough. Surely, this resounding success will give Netflix another opportunity to host a similar event in the future, preferably with another NFL star like Aaron Rodgers or Peyton Manning.", "source": {"uri":

Although the supermodel denied that Brady's laser-sharp focus on his career was the only factor for their split, Brady himself admitted to Howard Stern in 2020 that he sometimes falls short in his paternal duties \"[Gisele] didn't feel like I was doing my part for the family,\" he said at the time (via E!

You f-ked him good,\" Hart said during \"The Roast of Tom Brady.\" \"You did, Tom, you f-ked your coach, but let me tell you something people ... that's what you've got to do to maintain your happiness.\"\n\nHe continued, \"You sometimes got to f-k your couch.

One of the smartest quarterbacks ever played a game. How did you not see this coming? Eight f-king karate classes a day,\" the comedian said.\n\n\"Eight karate classes a day and she's still a white belt. F-k Tom. The only bruises she had were on her ass. everybody should have known it,\" he joked.\n\nThe camera went back to Brady who held up his drink in a cheers and took several sips before looking down and shaking his head.\n\n\"You gotta get uncomfortable,\" Hart kept on. \"The scariest part about this guy is if you have any problems I'm worried for you. Jesus Christ, you can't lose any fight to the bonus dad. Kids gonna change their name. The guy knows karate, Tom. I can't help you with this, Tom.\"\n\nThe jabs come two months after B\u00fcndchen slammed speculation that she began her romance with Valente before her split from Brady.\n\n\"That's a lie,\" she told the New York Times when asked about the rumors.\n\n\"This is something that happens to a lot of women who get blamed when they have the courage to leave an unhealthy relationship and are labeled as being unfaithful,\" she continued.\n\nShe added, \"No one really knows what happens between two people, only the two people in the relationship.\"\n\nB\u00fcndchen and her Valente first met in December 2021, but they reportedly did not start dating until June 2023.\n\nThe pair were spotted together in Miami and Costa Rica in 2022 though she repeatedly denied they were anything more than friends. Brady and B\u00fcndchen -- who share son, Benjamin, 14, and daughter, Vivian, 11 -- finalized their divorce in October 2022 after 13 years of marriage.\n\n\"This is the first time I am seeing someone that was a friend of mine first,\" she insisted to NYT.\n\nHowever, sources close to Brady -- who also has a 16-year-old son with ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan -- claim the former NFL star \"accepted\" that her relationship with Valente began \"years ago.\"\n\n\"If she wants to have people think she has been dating Joaquim only since June, so be it, but they have been together longer and they aren't taking it slow.

Is that not trans enough for you liberal f*cks?\"\n\nObviously White is open about his support and friendship with former President Donald Trump, and hosts Trump often during UFC fights.\n\nWhite then turned to the subject at hand and laid into Brady:\n\n\"You played for the Patriots for so long that I was actually starting to feel like you were from Boston.\n\nThen I saw you run and I was like, 'No he's definitely from San Francisco.'\n\nYou led the league for 20 years in passing...as a straight guy.\"\n\nSafe to say we probably know why Netflix only gave him 60 seconds...but he made the most of them.", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roast (comedy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dana White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Dana-White-7.png?fit=1200%2C812&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

The Tom Brady Roast, hosted by Kevin Hart, was hilarious from start to finish. Here are some of the funniest moments from last night's roast of the GOAT Quarterback.\n\nTony Hinchcliffe stole the show with his two-minute rant, roasting everybody from Kevin Hart to Kim Kardashian who did not enjoy Tony's joke as much. Right after the comedian mentioned a whale's vagina, he said he remembered that Kim Kardashian was there.\n\nFormer New England Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick also appeared and was one of the funniest guests of the night. Bill took some time to poke fun at former tight end Rob Gronkowski.\n\nThe former Patriots players continued to steal the show. Even Julian Edelman got in on the fun of roasting Bill about being unemployed for the first time in 45 years, and he made a crazy Aaron Hernandez joke that Gronk couldn't believe he said.\n\nJulian mentioned that when they could not run a play in practice, Bill would say that the local high school football team could run it.\n\n\"You remember when you used to yell at us? 'look assholes the f*cking kids down at Foxboro High can make that f*cking play.'\" Julian patted his chest in excitement for anticipating the second half of his joke. \"Look asshole Foxboro High is the only f*cking job offer you had!\"\n\nTom Brady was hilarious in his own right.

His joke-writing ability (or eye for ghostwriters), however, could use a bit of work.\n\nNetflix streamed The Greatest Roast of All Time on Sunday evening, a several-hour comedic pile-on of three-time NFL MVP Tom Brady. The former Michigan man needs no introduction -- he's arguably the greatest quarterback in NFL history, his 20-year stint at the helm of the New England Patriots resulting in a dynasty the likes of which the league may never see again. The Patriots appeared in nine Super Bowls throughout Brady's tenure with the team, winning six of them as Brady earned four Super Bowl MVP nods.\n\nThough wins are very much not a quarterback stat, Brady's career record of 286-97 is impressive...depending on who you ask. You may be hard-pressed to find anybody too moved by the statistic in Western New York, as over 30 of Brady's near-300 career wins came against the same team: the Buffalo Bills.\n\nRelated: 5 Bills in great situations to succeed following 2024 NFL Draft\n\nBrady simply dominated the Bills throughout his career, his 33-3 record against the team serving as a tangible marker of the intangible turmoil, heartache, and frustration he put Buffalo fans through throughout his two decades with the Patriots. It was largely the Bills' own organizational ineptitude that kept the team in purgatory -- and out of the playoffs -- throughout the first 17 years of the century, but Brady and New England serving as an ever-present hurdle in the division certainly didn't help matters.\n\nBrady was public enemy No. 1 in Western New York throughout his time with the Patriots, and the disdain, though not necessarily fully reciprocated, was partially shared. The quarterback even took a playful shot at the team and its fans during his Netflix roast, making note of the team's championship shortcomings.\n\n\"I'm trying to buy a piece of the Raiders, [because] I'm tired of owning just the Colts and the Bills,\" Brady said. \"Buffalo fans call themselves the 'Bills Mafia.' How are you the f****** mafia? At least the mafia has a ring you can kiss.\"\n\nTo prevent potential embarrassment, we'll let sleeping dogs lie -- Brady won seven Super Bowls throughout his career, so if ever there were a person qualified to joke about a team's lack of championship success, it's him. All of his Super Bowl victories, of course, were without any sort of controversy, and not a single one was unscrupulous in any way.\n\nThis also isn't the first time that Brady has taken a shot at Buffalo. While doing press for Super Bowl XLVI, the future Hall of Famer took a strange (and largely unprompted) jab at Western New York hotels, stating that \"they're not the nicest places in the world.\"\n\nSomeone apparently hasn't stayed at the world-renowned Motel 6 by the Buffalo Niagara International Airport. There's even a Cracker Barrel next door.\n\nJokes aside, Buffalo does appear to be on the road to its first Super Bowl championship; it's appeared in the postseason in each of the past six seasons, with most pundits agreeing that it's only a matter of time before otherworldly quarterback Josh Allen is able to get his team over the hump and deliver a Super Bowl to Western New York. If and when Allen is able to do so, perhaps Brady will be there to kiss his ring.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_silagyi@si.com", "name": "Kyle Silagyi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mafia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Mafia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Niagara_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Niagara International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLVI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl XLVI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4612,h_2594,x_0,y_113/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx6v4h6ytcrx5r4rna", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

But that's exactly what made \"Greatest Roast of All-Time: Tom Brady\" one of the best American comedy events in the past five years.\n\nWas the show clunky at times? It was. Were there some terrible performances? There were. Would it have been more enjoyable without slogging along for three-plus hours? Maybe.\n\nYes, it was long. But the results of doing the show live made the grind worth it. Why? Because perpetually-offended producers in Hollywood or at Netflix didn't have a chance to edit out the \"offensive jokes\" that no-doubt riled up the \"I have a great sense of humor, but that kind of humor just isn't funny\" crowd.\n\nTo be fair to that group, I didn't see all that much backlash from the event. Granted, it's a Netflix special and should pick up steam as it sits on the platform. Live events aren't what they used to be, so there's still time.\n\nPerhaps, though, this is a signal that American society is returning to its best form. The one where people understand jokes for what they are: jokes. At its very comedy, comedy is meant to be offensive.\n\nEven the played-out \"my mother-in-law is a monster\" bits are rooted in making someone the butt of the joke.\n\nBut the \"Roast of Tom Brady\" went far deeper than that. There were jokes about murder, suicide, gay people, transgender people, black people, white people, democrats, republicans, mentally-challenged people ... no one was spared. And we all laughed. That's a good thing. We need more of it.\n\nOne of the most important acts of the night came from a comedian named Tony Hinchcliffe. I must admit, I was not familiar with him prior to the roast. But he went on that stage on Sunday night with zero fear and the results speak for themselves.\n\nSome of his one-liners were legendary - even if you can't tell them at your corporate job this week. If you do, you probably have to whisper, and you must really, really trust your co-worker.\n\nHe came out of the gate firing, starting with one of the most common themes of the night: Kevin Hart is short. Another played-out bit, but you have to play the hits at these things. But Hinchcliffe managed to weave in Aaron Hernandez' suicide into a Kevin Hart height joke.\n\n\"All night, [Kevin Hart] has been using the stool that Aaron Hernandez kicked out from under himself.\"\n\nAgain, I had no predispositions about Hinchcliffe. But I immediately realized this guy wasn't here to mess around or worry about people's feelings.\n\n\"Tom Brady is a Patriot, which is surprising since he looks like a Confederate Fag.\"\n\nTurns out, he was just warming up.\n\n\"Jeff [Ross] is so Jewish, he only watches football for the coin toss.\"\n\nThen, he took aim at DEI with a joke directed at a relatively-unknown comedienne named Sam Jay.\n\n\"Sam Jay is here, an obese, African-American, lesbian ... by having her here, Netflix checked a lot of boxes.\"\n\nThere are too many good jokes to write them all out, but here's a supercut of his set:\n\nOf course, the comedians brought the comedy and brought the offensive material. Jeff Ross came out in an O.J. Simpson jersey and said he had just visited Aaron Hernandez in hell.\n\nNikki Glaser said that Rob Gronkowski puts \"the 'Downs' in touchdowns ... the 'special' in special teams ... [and] the 'tard' in Rob Gronkowski is retarded.\"\n\nThey were both great, but they also did their jobs as comedians. The real surprise came when Brady's former teammate, Edelman, hit the stage. I was not prepared for where he was going to go with his roast.\n\n\"Everyone always asks me how big Gronk's dick is,\" Edelman began one of his jokes. \"Don't get me wrong, it gets the job done. But there was this other Patriots tight end...\" he continued before taking a long pause.\n\n\"Now, he was HUNG,\" Edelman concluded to gasps from the crowd, a reference to Aaron Hernandez hanging himself in prison. Dark! But, admittedly, a very funny joke.\n\nThen, there was his joke about Jeff Ross that really struck me. It was one of those \"can he really say that?!\" moments. That's when I realized that comedy was back, baby.\n\n\"Fun fact, Jeff and I are both Jewish. The difference is I'm the kind of Jew that makes people say 'oh, you're Jewish?'\" Edelman began, again before taking a long pause.\n\n\"Jeff Ross is the kind of Jew that makes people want to join Hamas.\"\n\nAs all roasts do, the event concluded with Tom Brady getting a chance to defend himself from taking the heat for three hours. He had some good zingers in there, but the one that really showed that no one on this panel cared about getting canceled was his brilliant 9/11 joke.\n\nI can't believe I just wrote that Tom Brady had a \"brilliant 9/11 joke.\" If that doesn't tell you that comedy is back, I don't know what does.\n\n\"Like the rest of America, I'll always remember where I was that fateful day in September 2001, when tragically...\" Brady started, as the entire crowd sat tensely wondering where he was going.\n\n\"Those two Jets slammed into Drew Bledsoe.\"\n\nFate in humanity and American society restored! There were too many great jokes to list all of them, and some of them were extremely \"offensive.\" Of course, I don't mean that I was offended, rather that those who make a living by being offended probably were offended.\n\nBut, screw them. A funny joke is a funny joke. They're not going to take that away from us.

Belichick implored Rob Gronkowski to stop doing his job on FOX, took credit for saving Randy Moss from the Raiders, and dubbed \"The Dynasty\" a 10-part roast of himself. It was one of the most memorable performances of the special.\n\nHere's everything Belichick said on Sunday night:\n\nTo comedian Kevin Hart:\n\n\"Kev, you think you can get me a cheer like that in Philly? Yeah, I didn't think so.\"\n\nTo comedian Will Ferrell, who appeared in character:\n\n\"Ron Burgandy, the only member of the media I respect.\"\n\nOn being a roaster:\n\n\"You know the fellas invited me up here to lighten up the mood a little bit tonight. But seriously I'm so honored to be for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix. That's not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10-part Apple TV series.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of mean things being said about Tom tonight. I wonder why they invited me. Really, Tom, why are all these people so hard on you? Do you miss me?\"\n\nTo Hart:\n\n\"Whenever Kevin talks I go into a Cover 2 defense: Cover both ears.\"\n\nTo the panel of comedians:\n\n\"First time some of these comedians tonight. Andrew Schulz, Nikki Glazer, Tom Segura. This is the comedy version of the no name defense. Who are these people?\"\n\nTo comedian Jeff Ross:\n\n\"For 49 years I've been a football coach but now I'm going to be a life coach and Jeff: Punt. When I get rid of my two sleeves it's from my sweatshirts. When Jeff Ross gets rid of his two sleeves it's from a box of cookies.\"\n\nTo Rob Gronkowski:\n\n\"A lot of people connected me with a saying called 'do your job' and telling people to do their job. Gronk, I've been watching you on Fox NFL Sunday and I'm begging you, please, stop doing your job. Do another job. Do somebody else's job. I loved coaching Gronk. He was the best. Great teammate. Great, great player. Hall of Fame player. Give it up for Gronk, man. Gronk's taken a lot of heat. He's been roasted the third most between Brady then me, and Gronk tonight. But sorry Rob, I've gotta keep going. Rob landed some endorsement deals with some of his favorite foods. Campbell's soup, Dunkin Donuts, and don't forget Tide Pods. One-hundred percent true story: I used Rob's Tide Pod commercial to teach our team that this is when you say no. Just because somebody asks you to do something stupid, you don't have to do it. Say no! That advice was never given by Kevin (Hart's) manager.\"\n\nTo Randy Moss:\n\n\"A lot of you don't know, but I have a big heart. I really do. Seriously. Come on, man. I rescued a dog from the shelter, and I rescued Randy from the Raiders. Listen Randy, I'm really sorry you didn't get a ring. Not sorry enough to give you one of mine, but I'm still really sorry.\"\n\nTo a panel of Patriots players:\n\n\"It's great to have all the Patriots here. You guys were all awesome, really. You meant so much. And Tom's the greatest of all time. There's no question about that. It's why we're all here. Tom's fantastic, but he played on some great teams, and these great players that played with him, they were great teams. We accomplished a lot. So proud to be here.\"\n\nTo Danny Amendola:\n\n\"Danny Amendola up here on the stage, he came with us. Danny joined us in 2014 and got us 200 yards that year. Then in 2016 he picked up another 250. Or to put it another way, what Randy would call a decent first half.\"\n\nTo Matt Light:\n\n\"Matt, I love where you are. Matt Light protected Tom's blind side along with Nate Solder. Two great left tackles blocking Dwight Freeny and all those other guys in the Hall of Fame. Maybe they'll get there someday too. But Matt, I love where you are: Far away from the microphone. In all my years with the Patriots, there's no player I had to say more often to shut the (expletive) up than Matt Light. You know Matt came into the league and I've known about his struggles with Crohn's disease, and that certainly explains (over) all the years why he gave me so much (expletive).\"\n\nTo Rodney Harrison:\n\n\"One man that it's always great to see, Rodney Harrison. One of the greatest players I've ever coached. He was a great, great football player. Great person. Great competitor. He's not in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and to me, that might be the biggest joke of the night... invite me to your induction.\"\n\nTo Tom Brady:\n\n\"Believe it or not, I've got a lot of nice things to say about Tom but I'm running out of time here. Do I have a couple extra minutes? OK. We've already talked about the cryptocurrency, I'll stay away from that one. But I see your soccer team Birmingham City got knocked down to another tier in the English football league. So for those not familiar with English football and the intricacies to their obscure (relegation) system, just let me put it in English for you: They suck! Not so easy running a team, is it Tom? So, little coaching advice, stick to American football. You're really good at that.\n\n\"People have said that Tom and I butted heads a lot, and in a way that was true, but not really. It was hard to butt heads with Tom because it was so far up Alex Guerrero's (butt).\n\n\"You know, Tom, you had so many clutch moments, so many big plays, so many just unbelievable plays that will live on forever. I remember the pass that you threw to Amendola when we beat Baltimore in the playoffs in '14 -- no, that was Julian that threw that pass to Amendola. There was the pass you threw to (Phillip) Dorsett when we beat the Eagles -- (Philly fan Kevin Hart) you remember that one -- in 2019. No, Julian, you threw that one too. Oh. Tom threw a lot of touchdown passes. I can't remember them, but he threw a bunch of them.\n\n\"Seriously, Tom and I had our differences, but you know it only comes with love and respect about our relationship and we did some special things together. For all of you out there that think about who's responsible for the Patriots' success during the time when Tom and I were there, was it Brady? Was it me? Was it Brady? Was it me? In reality, the truth of the matter is, it was both of us because of me. Great event. Netflix, great night to be here. Thank you very much. Love you. Tom, (inaudible), love you guys.

One of his targets was Taylor Swift.\n\nThe 46-year-old started his roast by addressing Peyton Manning and Brett Favre, among others. The seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback then took a dig at the different NFL fan bases, starting with the Bills mafia, before targeting Taylor Swift and the Kansas City Chiefs fans.\n\nBrady mocked their fan base by claiming that they were \"14-year-old girls,\" who attended the game due to Taylor Swift, who is dating Chiefs TE Travis Kelce. He also threw shade at their success in recent years after being \"terrible\" for five decades.\n\nHere's what Brady said:\n\n\"Kansas City, you say your stadium is the loudest. It helps when your fans are 14-year-old girls... in honor of TAY TAY [Taylor Swift]... Let's take a look at the Chiefs Eras; Terrible for 50 years, good for 5.

Along the course of his illustrious career, he dominated a lot of teams and showed no mercy. The Buffalo Bills, being in AFC East and the Peyton Manning-led Indianapolis Colts were notable franchises Brady went up against constantly.\n\nDuring his Netflix special, he decied to take jabs. Addressing his bid to buy the Las Vegas Raiders, Brady started to take shots at the Bills, Colts and the Eagles, along with the Chiefs.\n\n\"I'm trying to buy the Raiders. I'm tired of owning the Colts and the Bills.\"\n\nTom Brady has a record of 16-4 win-loss record against the Indianapolis Colts and a staggering 33-3 record against the Buffalo Bills.\n\n\"How can you call yourselves the Mafia? At least the mafia has a ring you can kiss.\"\n\n\"Screw Colts fans!

The joke, in full: \"So Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made... Would you like a massage?'\"\n\nWhile Brady maintained a grin, he seemed to hesitate for a moment before getting up and walking over to Ross and telling him, \"Don't say that shit again.\" While he may have intended it as a whisper, the mic picked it up and the comment was very audible.\n\nRoss, who'd already blown a kiss to Kraft and said, \"I love Robert Kraft,\" responded to Brady's remark with a laugh and another gesture to Kraft, \"OK, OK. He's having fun, look at him\"\n\nWhile the incident certainly didn't look planned, Rolling Stone has reached out to reps for Brady and Ross for any further comment or info.\n\nRoss' joke stemmed from Kraft's 2019 arrest on charges of soliciting prostitution. He was arrested as part of an investigation into a string of massage parlors in Florida and faced two charges of soliciting sex from an employee of one parlor in Jupiter. Kraft rejected a plea deal and entered a not-guilty plea, but the charges were ultimately dropped in the fall of 2020 on the grounds that the surveillance footage used to prosecute him was illegally obtained.\n\nA few weeks after his arrest, Kraft issued a statement saying: \"I am truly sorry. I know I have hurt and disappointed my family, my close friends, my co-workers, our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard. Throughout my life, I have always tried to do the right thing. The last thing I would ever want to do is disrespect another human being... As I move forward, I hope to continue to use the platform with which I have been blessed to help others and to try to make a difference. I expect to be judged not by my words, but by my actions. And through those actions, I hope to regain your confidence and respect.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_blistein@rollingstone.com", "name": "Jon Blistein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patriot (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage_parlor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massage parlor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151653527.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Antonio Brown, though, seems to have decided that he will try to blame everyone else for his struggle for relevance right now.\n\nIt is indeed true that he should have been included in the lineup based on his playing relationship with Tom Brady and his achievements on the football field.

Garoppolo, meanwhile, had an up-and-down six-year run with the 49ers before spending the 2023 season with the Raiders.\n\nLas Vegas released Garoppolo after only one year, with him appearing in just seven games for the Silver and Black.

He was also among the most handsome, with model Gisele Bundchen, in particular, being enamored enough to become his wife.\n\nTheir ensuing marriage would last more than a decade, but it all came crashing down in 2022 amid a turbulent period. And comedians Kevin Hart and Nikki Glaser made sure to reference it in their jokes on Sunday's Netflix roast of the seven-time Super Bowl champion.\n\nThe former even alluded to Bundchen's current partner, karate/jiu-jitsu coach Joaquim Valente, saying:\n\n\"You sometimes got to f-k your coach. You know who else f-ked their coach? Gisele. She f-ked that karate man. I mean Jesus Christ, Tom. One of the smartest quarterbacks ever played a game. How did you not see this coming?\"\n\nThe latter, meanwhile, joked about Tom Brady's rings (his seven Super Bowl rings -- six with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers -- and his marriage ring):\n\n\"Five-time Super Bowl MVP, most career wins, most career touchdowns. You have seven rings. Well, eight, now that Gisele gave hers back.\"\n\nShe even alluded to Brady's prior relationship with Bridget Moynahan (that produced a son):\n\n\"It's hard to walk away from something that's not your pregnant girlfriend [Bridget Moynahan]. To be fair, he didn't know she was pregnant. He just thought she was getting fat and Tom hates fat.\"\n\nTom Brady's responses to his roasters: Some highlights\n\nOf course, every roast requires a reaction/response/retort. And with so many guests, it would be hard for Tom Brady to respond to them all.\n\nBut he did have some good ones to share, with one highlight being for Kim Kardashian that referenced their parenthood:\n\n\"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this, but because her kids are home with (her ex-husband Kanye West).\"\n\nAnd this one for Taylor Swift and the Kansas City Chiefs:\n\n\"You say your stadium is the loudest. It helps when all your fans are 14-year-old girls. And in honor of [Taylor Swift, boyfriend of Travis Kelce], let's take a look at the Chiefs 'eras': terrible for 50 years, good for five. Shake it off.\"\n\nTom Brady even referenced Deflategate, sarcastically remarking that he would have admitted to illegally modifying the footballs used in the 2014-15 AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts for $20 million.\n\nFormer head coach Bill Belichick and rival Peyton Manning also got counter-roasted in the episode.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andre_castillo@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Andre Castillo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Moynahan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridget Moynahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/73c44-17149683754447-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Ross joked that Brady walked into the Patriots owner's office and said, \"I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?\" Before Ross could finish another punchline, though, Brady menacingly whispered in his ear, \"Never say that shit again.\"\n\nLuckily, the rest of the special went off without a hitch and featured devastating burns from former teammates Drew Bledsoe and Rob Gronkowski, comedians Tony Hinchcliffe, Andrew Schulz and Nikki Glaser, and special appearances by Ron Burgundy and Ben Affleck.\n\nShifting from superstar athletes to satirical superheroes, production on Season Two of Gen V is set for this month, and the creative forces behind The Boys spin-off took to social media to reveal how they'll be handling the Andre Anderson character after the tragic loss of actor Chance Perdomo last March.

In fact, they said just about anything, and as celebrity roasts can be, it was sometimes ruthless.\n\nOne such example came from Brady himself, as he took center stage and talked about his early days as quarterback of the New England Patriots. More specifically, Brady mentioned the tight end position, once manned by standout Aaron Hernandez, now deceased. Before that, Hernandez was jailed for the murder of Odin Lloyd.\n\n\"The bar for a Patriots tight end was pretty low back then. Block. Catch. Don't murder,\" Brady said during the roast.\n\nThe dynamics between Hernandez and his teammates, particularly Brady, was well-documented. For instance, ex-Patriots receiver Brandon Lloyd once said (via the Daily Mail) that Hernandez's behavior generally annoyed Brady.\n\nApparently, Hernandez often showed up to practice wearing flip-flops and referred to legendary Patriots coach Bill Belichick as \"Daddy.\" Per Lloyd, Brady got hot during one particular practice.\n\n\"(Hernandez) was out at the walk-through in flip-flops trying to run around,\" Lloyd said. \"He was laughing -- he was loud. And Tom keeps it serious in the walk-through. And Tom says, 'Shut the f*** up. Get the f*** out of here.\"'\n\nBraady also supposedly once told Tim Tebow that Hernandez was a lot to deal with.\n\nIn other words, there some pretty high tensions within the Patriots at that time -- and it just goes to show interpersonal dynamics can play a role in such high-stakes sports environments.\n\nPer Wide Open Country:\n\n\"That kicked off a lengthy trial that resulted in both being kicked from the Patriots as well as a life sentence in prison. Courts found Hernandez guilty of first-degree murder.

But more often than not, it works.\n\nThings that don't normally happen at such functions are moments of genuine kindness and appreciation. Yet Robert Kraft felt compelled to try to have one of those with Bill Belichick.\n\nKraft -- who was seated in the audience -- was called up to the stage by host Kevin Hart to share a shot with Belichick, with whom the Patriots \"mutually parted ways\" after last year's 4-13 season. It was an unceremonious end to arguably the best coaching tenure in NFL history, and considering a Kraft-backed docuseries airing in February and March didn't shed the kindest light on Belichick, the Patriots' owner may have felt a need to be overly nice to Belichick when given the opportunity to speak about his former coach.\n\nAnd that he did.\n\n\"I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done,\" Kraft said after clinking shot glasses with Belichick. \"And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me. So cheers.\"\n\nFor his part, Belichick kept a mostly stoic face, as he also appeared unsure of what he was supposed to do up there. But he eventually gave a little smile.\n\nBelichick did joke a little bit about that aforementioned Apple TV series, saying it was a 10-part roast of himself.\n\nThe Belichick-Kraft relationship may need some mending, and Kraft probably tried to work on that with his heartfelt toast at the roast.

His murder(s) and his suicide were fodder for various cracks throughout the night. Even Brady made one.\n\nAgain, that's how roasts are. Also, and again, comedy is subjective. But, man, the Hernandez stuff felt like it went a little too far.\n\nHe killed at least one person, possibly two more (he was acquitted, but still). He killed himself in prison. It was a tragedy for the victims. It was a sad chapter for the NFL and the Patriots.\n\nFor most of the off-color and/or below-the-belt jokes at a roast, the butt of the joke has a voice in the process.

The former star quarterback subjected himself to dozens of brutal jokes during The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, a comedy special aired live on Netflix.\n\nHosted by Kevin Hart at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, Calf., the 46-year-old was the target of roasters including Kim Kardashian, Randy Moss, Sam Jay, Rob Gronkowski, Bill Belichick, and more, who offered commentary on his divorce, alleged plastic surgery, financial decisions, football legacy, and more.\n\n\"I've never seen Inglewood so white,\" joked Hart as the jokes began.\n\n\"You know, Tom, this is crazy because, for more than 20 years, Tom has ruined Sundays for football fans all over the country,\" the 44-year-old joked, referring to Brady's NFL career which includes several unpredictable comebacks, hail Mary passes, and 7 Super Bowl wins.\n\n\"But tonight, well, tonight we're gonna ruin yours, Tom. I'm gonna ruin your fu**ing Sunday.\"\n\nStandout jokes came from comedians and former athletes, alike.\n\n\"I know there's going to be a lot of jokes about me being gay for Tom,\" detailed Brady's former teammate Julian Edelman. \"Well, let me set the record straight. Those balls weren't going to deflate themselves.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what you deflated, my legacy. I want my ring,\" quipped Randy Moss. \"Drew Bledsoe was in the freakin' hospital, and he has a Super Bowl ring. Nate Ebner... who the f**k is Nate Ebner? He has three Super Bowl rings.\"\n\nAs with any roast, the jokesters were also the victims of comedic outbursts with jokes throughout the affair on Hart's height and movie catalog, Gronkowski's intelligence level, and Belichick's scandals.\n\n\"You really gotta hand it to Kevin Hart -- because he can't reach,\" teased comedian Nikki Glaser.\n\n\"No one works harder than this man. Do you know that every morning, Kevin wakes up at 4 a.m. to make a shi**y movie?\" she continued. \"No, I love your movies. Or, as I call them, short films. I'm kidding, I hate them.\"\n\nAs a good sport, Brady was able to dish out jokes to his stage mates, as well as himself.\n\n\"Remember deflategate?

Bill Belichick had multiple interviews with franchises like the Atlanta Falcons before officially exiting Robert Kraft's New England Patriots system. Unfortunately, none of them wanted him enough to even offer him a coaching position. Now, he is still around the game as an invited speaker to programs like Nebraska and an analyst. But, his former players like Julian Edelman can't help but make fun of the situation.\n\nNetflix's newly produced special, The Roast of Tom Brady, looked like a reunion of the Patriots dynasty. It was all about laughs and reminiscing about moments before their team collapsed. One of the best jokes thrown at this event was about Bill Belichick. Julian Edelman hurled it out and it got the crowd laughing, Ari Meirov of The 33rd Team.\n\n\"You remember when you used to yell at us? Look, a**holes, the fucking kids down at Foxboro High can make that f***ing play. I've been waiting for this for so long. Look, a**hole, Foxboro High is the only job offer you f***ing had,\" the former Patriots receiver said.\n\nThe joke made everyone erupt including Bill Belichick. This was especially surprising because of how much the architect of the Patriots dynasty has managed to keep a laugh in and have a straight face throughout his coaching tenure. Truly, Julian Edelman has gotten more close with his head honcho as they both explored their own paths outside of the Patriots.\n\nIt was not always jokes, sunshine, and butterflies inside the Patriots system that Robert Kraft built. They had one of the most rigorous training schedules out of anyone in league history. That paid off for guys like Julian Edelman who were able to help Belichick and Tom Brady win ring after ring.\n\nThroughout his NFL career, Edelman has only stuck with the Patriots from 2009 all the way to 2020. He started in 85 out of his 137 appearances and always had the sticky hands to make the play. When it was all said and done, his career finished with 620 receptions which led to 6,822 receiving yards. Edelman's lethality in the end zone was also unquestioned. He closed out the Patriots' attempts for six points 36 times which is very impressive.\n\nThe average gain that he gave Coach Belichick per play was 11 yards. It was a guaranteed first down every time that they attempted to throw the ball to him. All of those added up to three Super Bowl wins for the Patriots with Edelman's help. Moreover, the star out of Redwood City even bagged the Super Bowl MVP award back in its 53rd iteration. While Belichick might not have an NFL coaching job, he surely changed the lives of guys like Edelman due to his insane wits and schemes inside Robert Kraft's system.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady\u2013Belichick_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brady\u2013Belichick era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska Cornhuskers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxborough,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwood_City,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redwood City, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redwood City, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Patriots-news-Julian-Edelman-takes-hilarious-NSFW-shot-at-Bill-Belichicks-failed-job-hunt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

The former Patriots and Buccaneers quarterback featured in \"The Roast of Tom Brady\" broadcasted live on Netflix.\n\nFor over three hours, stars from the quarterback's past, comedians and celebrities from Nikki Glaser to Julian Edelman and Bill Belichick took turns roasting the quarterback. Edelman had one of the dozens of memorable quotes from the event, taking aim at the quarterback's physical appearance and mental capacity for humor:\n\n\"When we played together, Tom, you used to scream 'Laser focus! Laser focus!' Now that's what he screams at his plastic surgeon. Who's laughing now, Tom? Not you because your face can't move and you don't have a sense of humor.\"\n\nOf course, it isn't known whether the most accomplished quarterback of all time has gone under the knife. However, for several years, fans have accused the former quarterback of receiving plastic surgery in an effort to maintain a youthful appearance.\n\nSome even claimed that he has received hair transplants, Botox, and work on his teeth. Nothing has ever been confirmed by the former quarterback.\n\nRoast of Tom Brady becomes the Roast of Rob Gronkowski\n\nWhile the quarterback's name was plastered on the event's title, many jokes were made at the cost of the quarterback's associates. From Randy Moss to Robert Kraft, seemingly every big name from the quarterback's time with the Patriots took flak.\n\nAlso, almost every guest launched jokes about Rob Gronkowski's intelligence after Nikki Glaser did a bit in which she impersonated the tight end. She slammed the former tight end with NSFW jokes, accusing him of being affected by CTE and lacking any form of intelligence.\n\n\"You are not really as dumb as you look and sound and act and are\" may have been her least offensive joke directed at the tight end.\n\nGronkowski appeared to take the harsh jokes in stride, later delivering his own response.\n\nDuring his time on stage, Rob Gronkowski and Brady took a shot of alcohol together, and in typical Gronk fashion, he spiked the shot glass on the ground, eliciting a large response from the crowd.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_van_roy@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Ian Van Roy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gronkowski_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gronkowski (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randy Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chronic traumatic encephalopathy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Medical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Medical", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/aa969-17150106232168-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541551", "eventUri": "eng-9541551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

In that time, Bill Belichick adopted the persona of an unfriendly, off-putting, perhaps even contemptible, grouch.\n\nBelichick as an unsympathetic figure, even with some of his players, became what practically everyone outside New England saw and believed was true.\n\nAnd there was some truth to the coach's unkind reputation after allegations about cheating on the field through the use of video or deflated footballs, and cheating off the field with some other man's wife.\n\nBelichick's sometimes disagreeable attitude toward fans, game officials, and the league is well documented. His apparent disdain for some reporters, trademarked by his grunted answers to the most benign questions, became a caricature in a segment on Scott Van Pelt's Sunday evening ESPN show.\n\nLook, any football coach who thinks so much of himself he hires a consigliere and tries to diminish the team's public relations professionals, is evidence of too much self-importance.\n\nSo, yeah, Bill Belichick has been championship level objectionable at times.\n\nBut Belichick is unemployed now. And that status, either as a coincidence or strategy, has begun to show us a different guy.\n\nAn almost likable guy.\n\nWe're moving along the NFL's calendar that takes us from the Super Bowl to the scouting combine to the draft and suddenly Belichick is on television as a thoughtful, interesting analyst.\n\nHe's on the Pat McAfee show yukking it up with the former punter or engaging the other guys with serious football insight -- even though a couple of months ago he wouldn't have given them the time of day.\n\nHe's on the Netflix roast of Tom Brady Sunday evening and, even if the jokes were scripted, he embraced them like he's a witty, fun dude. Consider:\n\n\"People said Tom and I butted heads a lot. And in a way it was true, but not really,\" Belichick said during the show. \"It was hard to butt heads with Tom because it was so far up [Brady trainer] Alex Guerrero's [butt].\"\n\nBelichick, who is chasing Don Shula as the winningest coach in NFL history, showed a self-deprecating side few knew existed.\n\n\"Seriously, I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix,\" he said. \"It's not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10-part Apple TV series.\"\n\nBelichick is obviously connected to some Patriots sayings that have become descriptive of the dynasty's glory days - adages such as \"The Patriot Way\" or \"Do your job.\"\n\n\"Gronk, I've been watching you on FOX NFL Sundays,\" the coach said. \"And I'm begging you, please, stop doing your job.\"\n\nBelichick, in power for years as New England's unquestioned authority figure, is now even accepting good-natured ribbing about his current unemployment status.\n\n\"Do your job?\" former receiver Julian Edelman said to Belichick on the roast. \"More like need a job, coach.\"\n\nAnd of course, great-guy Belichick guffawed.\n\n\"You remember when you used to yell at us, 'Look [a--holes], the [expletive] kids at at Foxboro High could make that [expletive] play,\" Edelman said. \"I've been waiting for this for so long: Look, [a--hole], Foxboro High is the only job offer you [expletive] had.\"\n\nBut one has to wonder how much of it is Belichick showing us his humanity, and how much is strategic? You must know Belichick will be paid to be part of the McAfee show moving forward. And if he joins the Manning alternate telecast of Monday Night Football on ESPN, he'd be paid for that.\n\nAnd all that paid fun, insight, and attentiveness might be a way to get paid next season.\n\nYou must know that Belichick last season encountered a little bit of a surprise when the Patriots began to lose. And lose. And lose.\n\nIt was the third time in four seasons the team was under .500 but Belichick was apparently sideswiped by reporters asking pointed questions about his failures and columnists refusing to defend his abilities.\n\nAs one Patriots source put it, he didn't understand how people he'd been mistreating for years wouldn't come to his defense when he was fighting for his job.\n\nBelichick's reputation as something of an acquired taste bled over into his job search. Only the Atlanta Falcons showed significant interest in the six-time Super Bowl winning head coach for their head coach vacancy. Hmmm.\n\nEven when the Falcons' brain trust reportedly voted on who should be their next coach, Belichick obviously didn't win. He didn't even make the top three, which said a lot about everyone involved in the saga, none of it praiseworthy.\n\nNone of what happened with Belichick during the job search had anything to do with his ability to coach. It all had to do with his reputation away from the sideline.\n\nSo what we're seeing now is possibly (probably) an intentional rehabilitation of the way he's acted away from those sidelines for decades.\n\nOh, you don't believe it's intentional?\n\nThe guy has reached 2,030,348 Super Bowls concocting schemes on the field. Off the field, last year he leaked information of a one-year contract extension and his intentions to keep coaching as a way to keep his job.

Deflated footballs are known to be easier for quarterbacks to handle.\n\nThe scandal resulted in a four-game suspension for Brady to start the 2015 season. The Patriots were also fined $1 million and had to forfeit two picks in the 2016 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Patriots, however, did end up winning the Super Bowl during the year of the \"Deflategate\" controversy -- something Moss was never able to do throughout his career.\n\nMoss was a 4-time All-Pro and led the NFL in receiving touchdowns five different times throughout his 14-year career.

Now, here's Mike Sykes.\n\nGoooood morning, folks. Welcome back to the Morning Win. Thank you so much for rocking with us today. We appreciate you.\n\nDid anyone get a chance to check out Tom Brady's roast? Who knew that he could actually be legitimately funny?\n\nSure, we've heard him pop the occasional joke in the locker room before. But that's a completely different thing than standing up and delivering jokes about himself and others in front of an audience of thousands. That roast was actually good.\n\nREAD MORE: The best of the Tom Brady roast\n\nFor once, Tom Brady seemed like an actual person. We know the book on him. He spent so many years in the NFL playing under Bill Belichick's New England Patriots. The team was quite literally not allowed to be fun. Personality was something that was frowned upon with very few exceptions.\n\nSo, for most of us who didn't live in New England, Brady has usually been nothing but a boogeyman. He was hump you either don't want your team to come across or hope that it can get over. This roast made the boogeyman seem pretty human for once!\n\nIt was funny! Brady was in his bag. His best joke may have been this dig at Kanye West at the expense of Kim Kardashian. There was also this hilarious Deflategate confession that I am absolutely taking as a confession.\n\nPlus, he took some pretty bad ones on the chin. There were lots of Gisele B\u00fcnchden jokes (probably too many for my taste). This Crypto joke really hit home for me. That's good stuff, man. That's really good stuff.\n\nWhatever, though. This isn't really about the jokes as much as it's about as human as I've ever seen Brady be. Let me be clear, I am not a fan of this man. At all. But for one night, he was cool. And that's something I'd never thought I'd say.\n\nGood on you, Brady. Good on you. Still don't like you tho.\n\nThe champs are out\n\nThere will be a new Stanley Cup champion this year, folks. The Las Vegas Golden Knights are officially eliminated from the NHL playoffs.\n\nThat's not really that shocking considering that the Dallas Stars were the better team coming into the series. But after the Golden Knights grabbed a 2-0 series lead on Dallas? It definitely felt like the cards were in Vegas' favor (yes, that's a pun).\n\nThe rest of the NHL is probably thrilled. Everyone hated the way Vegas went about getting Mark Stone back from long-term injured reserve. They'd snagged big targets at the trade deadline because they were able to temporarily remove his salary from their books while he was on LTIR.\n\nOur Mary Clarke wrote about that here:\n\n\"Why is that significant? Because the Golden Knights were able to put Stone on Long-Term Injured Reserve, meaning they could clear his $9.5 million cap hit off the books so they could go after big trade targets at the March 8 deadline, with Vegas netting Tomas Hertl, Anthony Mantha, and Noah Hanifin when all was said and done.\"\n\nThat definitely didn't feel right. Maybe it wasn't. But none of it matters now. Vegas is out. And with that, I leave you this tweet from the Stanley Cup trophy.\n\nThat's the good stuff.\n\nLet's never do that again, NBA.\n\nIs it just me or is a 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time tipoff for a Game 7 kind of wild? The Cavaliers and Magic should feel disrespected.\n\nI mean, look. One in the afternoon isn't necessarily the worst time on a Sunday. But wouldn't, say, 3 p.m. be better? Especially for a nationally televised game with one of its teams playing on ABC for the first time since 2012. That's ridiculous.\n\nNot only did this series have to fight through the attention being hogged online by Kendrick Lamar and Drake, but it also had to fight through afternoon pancake naps on a non-NFL Sunday.\n\nThat didn't feel right. At all. The game was good and exciting. Donovan Mitchell went off to save the Cavaliers' season. But it just felt...weird to be watching such a crucial game at such a weird time.\n\nCan we not do that again, NBA? Thanks.\n\nQuick hits: Nikola Jokic's biggest test yet ... Ranking the 8 NBA playoff teams left ... and more\n\n-- Here's Robert Zeglinksi with Nikola Jokic's take on what is the biggest test of his reign yet.\n\n-- Prince Grimes ranks the eight playoff teams left and the Celtics are not No. 1\n\n-- Tom Brady didn't seem happy about this joke at his roast. Sheesh. Here's Charles Curtis with more.\n\n-- Could J.J. Watt come back to the Texans? It's possible. Here's Robert again with more.\n\n-- The Kentucky Derby set a record for money wagered this year. Here's Ben Fawkes with more.\n\n-- Anthony Edwards completely shifted the odds on the Wolves-Nuggets series with one game. Prince has more on that.\n\nThat's a wrap, folks! Thanks so much for reading. We appreciate you. Tap in again tomorrow! See you then. Peace.\n\n-Sykes \u270c\ufe0f", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_d_sykes@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Mike D.

'Clearly a...", "body": "Bill Belichick appears to be back on the dating scene.\n\nThe former Patriots coach, who mutually parted ways with the team in January after 24 seasons together, was seen having dinner with an unnamed brunette at Contessa Italian restaurant in Boston, according to a photo obtained by Deuxmoi, a pseudonymous Instagram gossip account.\n\nIt came after his split from his longtime girlfriend, Linda Holliday -- who is the president of Belichick's foundation -- in September 2023.\n\n\"Clearly a date,\" a tipster, who submitted the photo to the woman-run account, wrote. \"Check his smile and her shoes.\"\n\nThe brunette, whose face was not featured in the photo, wore gold stilettos, while the eight-time Super Bowl winner looked dapper in a navy suit jacket, beige pants and brown dress shoes.\n\nThe Major Food Group restaurant features an elegant rooftop with stunning views of the Back Bay neighborhood and the Boston Public Garden.\n\nBelichick has a home in Hingham, which is near Boston on the South Shore of the Massachusetts Bay, worth an estimated $1.9 million, according to Pro Football Network.\n\nHe also reportedly owns a compound of six houses in Nantucket worth over $10 million.\n\nBelichick, 71, and Holliday, 61, who were first linked in 2007, have yet to publicly address their split.\n\nAlthough they were fairly private about their personal lives, Holliday shared rare glimpses into her relationship with Belichick on Instagram -- having posted photos of them dancing together, dining in the Hamptons and mingling with NFL greats.\n\nThe posts are still featured on her Instagram page.\n\nIt's unclear why exactly the ex-couple called it quits, but a previous report by People said the two \"have issues to clear up that come from a long relationship as well as her role in his professional life.\"\n\nBelichick and the Patriots mutually parted ways four days after New England's Week 18 loss to the Jets on Jan. 7, ending a historic 24-year run.\n\nIt followed a season of dysfunction for New England, which finished at the bottom of the AFC East with a 4-13 record, the franchise's worst since 1992.\n\nThe Patriots named Jerod Mayo the franchise's 15th head coach after he served as the linebackers coach under Belichick for the past five seasons.\n\nMayo played eight seasons for the Patriots and won a Super Bowl with Belichick in 2015.\n\nBelichick had two rounds of interviews with the Falcons before they announced Raheem Morris as their head coach in January.\n\nThe future Hall of Fame coach has said he still wants to coach -- it's just a matter of where.\n\nBelichick clearly has more time on his hands after becoming a free agent coach.\n\nHe was seen taking in the 2024 Coastal At The Capitol cheer and dance event in National Harbor, Md earlier this month, which took place at the same time as the 2014 NFL Combine.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [],

The target was New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, the man who signed Brady's paychecks for the first 20 years of his 23-year NFL career.\n\nAfter host Kevin Hart opened the show with a blistering monologue -- \"Why didn't we go to the Crypto.com Arena downtown? Well, the reason why we didn't go there is because we didn't want to remind Tom's fans of how much money he owes them \" -- comedian and celebrity roast staple Jeff Ross kept the hits coming. He talked about how Brady was drafted in the sixth round with the 199th pick of the 2000 NFL draft \"when Bill Belichick 's dog stepped on the keyboard by accident.\"\n\n\"So Tom became a Patriot,\" Ross said, \"moved up to New England and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said, 'I'm the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?'\"\n\nThe joke was a reference to Kraft being arrested in 2019 on charges of soliciting sex from a prostitute during an encounter at a Florida day spa. Kraft pleaded not guilty, and the charges were dropped the following year after his lawyers prevented video and audio footage from being used as evidence in court.\n\nAs the crowd laughed and Ross blew a kiss in Kraft's direction, Brady could be seen shifting in his seat behind and to the right of the comedian. The camera cut to a close shot of Ross, who said \"I love Robert Kraft.\"\n\nBrady then approached Ross. The NFL's all-time leader in passing yards and touchdown passes had a bit of a smile on his face, but his tone was dead serious when he leaned in and said to Ross, \" Don't say that s -- again.\"\n\nAs Brady returned to his seat, Ross laughed, put his hands up and said, \"OK, OK!\" He pointed in Kraft's direction and said, \"He's having fun, look at him.\" As Ross added some sincere words of praise for Kraft, the Patriots owner was shown smiling in the crowd.\n\nBrady didn't appear to hold a grudge and could be seen laughing during the rest of Ross' set. The two men embraced and spoke after Ross' performance -- a scene Hart mocked by implying Ross was kissing up to the GOAT. \"I heard you over there,\" Hart said. \"'Tom, you all right? Yeah? Your hair's so straight.'\"\n\nBrady absorbed many more barbs throughout the evening without feeling the need to step in again.\n\nMany others came out to take their best shots at Brady and often one another.\n\nKim Kardashian recovered from being booed for about 15 seconds upon taking the podium to receiving big laughs and applause for some of her quips.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast you, but I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players,\" said the daughter of Robert Kardashian, who was a member of O.J. Simpson's legal team during the former USC and NFL star's murder trial in the 1990s.\n\nShe also got a big laugh from Brady when she told him, \"I think it's so great the way you're showing everyone that even after winning seven Super Bowls, you can still have a midlife crisis.\"\n\nBelichick and several of Brady's former teammates -- including Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman, Randy Moss and Drew Bledsoe, whom Brady famously replaced at the Patriots' starting quarterback in 2001 -- all had their turns at the podium, as did his former on-field rival Peyton Manning.\n\n\"Honestly, it is great to be here with a bunch of people sitting around talking smack about Tom Brady,\" Manning said. \"Or as we call that in the Manning family: Thanksgiving.\"\n\nPeyton's brother Eli Manning, who led the New York Giants to two Super Bowl wins over Brady and the Patriots, was not present for the show but offered a jab of his own on X the next morning.\n\n\"I thought about attending the Roast of Tom Brady last night,\" Manning wrote, \"but I did not want to Roast him for a 3rd time!!\"\n\nOthers who joined in the roast Sunday included stand-up comic Nikki Glaser, UFC president Dana White and actor Will Ferrell in character as Ron Burgundy from the \" Anchorman \" movies.\n\nAs is custom at these events, Brady got his chance at the podium -- and he didn't hold back. He said to Belichick, \"I've been out of the game for a minute, so I'm curious, how many Super Bowl rings have you won since I left? Maybe it's not just the guy on the sideline. When I go to the Indy 500, I don't ask the winning driver, 'Hey, who gassed up your car?'\"\n\nHe even (jokingly) admitted to Deflategate. \"The NFL spent $20 million and found that it was 'more probable than not' that I was 'generally aware' that someone may have deflated my footballs. You should've just given me the 20 million and I would've told you I f -- did it.\"\n\nBrady was also one of several speakers who made jokes at the expense of Aaron Hernandez, the former Patriots tight end who hanged himself in a prison cell in 2017 while serving a life sentence for first-degree murder. Hernandez, whose death was ruled a suicide, was later determined to have had CTE and early brain atrophy.\n\nTMZ reports that Hernandez's former fiance, Shayanna Jenkins Hernandez, the mother of their now 11-year-old daughter, thinks those jokes went too far.\n\n\"It's sad that I'm trying to raise my children in such a cruel world,\" she told the website.\n\n\u00a92024 Los Angeles Times.

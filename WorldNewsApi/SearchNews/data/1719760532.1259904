Anglo American last week rejected a third all-share takeover proposal from BHP Group but agreed to a one-week extension for a formal offer to be submitted. The deadline is part of Britain's binding takeover rules and expires at 5 p.m. London time on Wednesday. BHP must make a formal offer by then or walk away for at least six months.", "url": "https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-deals/Anglo-American-rejects-BHP-request-to-extend-talks-on-takeover", "image": "https://cms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/3/4/9/5/47755943-1-eng-GB/2024-05-15T010621Z_805388903_RC2OQ7AO5JZ7_RTRMADP_3_AUSTRALIA-UNION-ANGLO-AMERICAN.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:03:08", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "jp", "sentiment": -0.678}

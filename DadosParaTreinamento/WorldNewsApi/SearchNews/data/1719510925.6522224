Toronto police responded Saturday morning to reports of gunfire on the property of Bais Chaya Mushka Elementary School, located at Dufferin Street and Finch Avenue West. No injuries were reported, but there was some damage done to the front of the building. At a press conference Saturday afternoon, Insp. Paul Krawczyk of the Guns and Gangs Task Force said preliminary findings indicated two suspects had gotten out of a dark-coloured vehicle and opened fire in the early morning hours. Krawczyk also said while the police are \u201cnot going to ignore the obvious\u201d, the incident was not yet being labelled a hate crime. Since this initial statement, York police have stepped in and are providing added security at other Jewish establishments to enforce community safety. \u201cI completely understand that this can cause concern, fear and anxiety in the community, especially when it happens at a school like this,\u201d Krawczyk said, \u201cespecially with the students, the parents and the staff.\u201d The incident has seen responses from local, provincial and federal politicians. In a post on X, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the shooting a \u201cbrazen act of antisemitism,\u201d and stated the perpetrators needed to be brought to justice. Ontario Premier Doug Ford echoed the sentiment, saying in his own social media post \u201cthese cowards need to be found.\u201d Officials are investigating the shooting and continue to ask the public to come forward with any video footage or relevant information they might have.", "summary": "Toronto and York police are telling the public they can expect increased presence at Jewish establishments after two suspects fired gunshots at an elementary school Saturday.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10525520/police-presence-jewish-establishments-toronto-york/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/school-shooting.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:53:07", "author": "Tessa Bennett", "authors": ["Tessa Bennett"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.32}

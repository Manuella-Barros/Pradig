A spokesperson for the Filipino Embassy in Madrid confirmed the injuries.\n\nEmmanuel Fernandez, the Consul General of the Philippines Embassy in Madrid, told Spanish radio that two of the family had been injured.\n\nThe father, he said, was injured \"but okay\". The five-year-old son is more seriously hurt, however, and may need an operation.\n\nHe described the mother and daughter's condition as being \"okay\".

A white van mounted the pavement in the busy tourist neighborhood killing 13 pedestrians. Isis claimed responsibility for the massacre.\n\nA couple, born in the Philippines and naturalized Irish citizens and their two Irish children were among the holiday makers on the historic boulevard when the attack took play. Their son, who was celebrating his fifth-birthday suffered a broken leg and his father also sustained leg injuries and suspected internal injuries.\n\nDetails of those murdered are now being released. The 13 dead include a three-year-old baby girl, her mother and 65-year-old great uncle, who lived in the region. The first name released among the dead is that Bruno Gulotta. Authorities have confirmed that there are victims from at least 18 countries: Argentina, Australia, China, Belgium, Cuba, France, Spain, Holland, Hungary, Peru, Romania, Ireland, Greece, Macedonia, Italy and Venezuela, without specifying whether they were wounded or dead.\n\nSpanish police have arrested three people, in the wake of the attack, and continue to hunt to the driver of the vehicle, who is said to have fled the scene of the crime on foot.\n\nHours after the van attack in Barcelona, police said they shot and killed five suspects in response to another terrorist attack in the seaside resort town of Cambrilas, 74 miles south of Barcelona.\n\nSecurity forces also found second van connected to the Barcelona attack in the town of Vic, 40 miles from Barcelona and 18 miles south of Ripoll.\n\nIn a separate incident, a driver of a Ford Focus ran into two police officers at a checkpoint in Sant Just Desvern, just five miles from Las Ramblas. The driver was shot and killed by police. It is not known if this was related to the attack.\n\nSpeaking about the Irish injured in the Barcelona attack Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, said the Irish man's injuries were \"not life-threatening, I'm relieved to say.\"\n\nHe added \"But in a way, it's a miracle that more Irish people weren't involved, given that there are so many Irish people in Spain, Barcelona and Cambrils at this time of year.\"\n\nA member of IrishCentral's staff, based in Barcelona, reported that the area of Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya continues to be closed and guarded by armed police vehicles on Friday morning. While local business and the population of the busy city attempt to resolutely go about their day there's an eerie quietness to the usually busy popular touristic area.\n\nAuthorities have reported that the death toll of this attack is expected to grow as those injured continue to be treated.\n\nDr Emmanuel Fernandez, Consul General of the Philippines embassy in Madrid spoke to RT\u00c9's Morning Ireland about the Irish family injured in the attack. He said, \"the father was hit on his side, he was not seriously injured but there's talk that he may need an operation.\"\n\n\"They are tourists who had come from Ireland to celebrate their son's birthday, but obviously that didn't happen\".\n\nThe family have been named as Norman and Pederlita Putot, and the son and daughter are Nathaniel (5) and Pearl Putot (9).\n\nSpanish police continue to hunt for the man responsible, the driver of the white van. He was identified by Spanish news agency EFE as Moussa Oukabir. Moussa is the younger brother of Driss Oukabir, whose identification was used to rent the van and whose photo police released in the aftermath of the attack. Driss is a Moroccan national who, according to his Facebook account, lives in Ripoll, Catalonia, about 50 miles north of Barcelona. Driss, who reportedly handed himself into the police, claims his brother stole his identity card and that he was in Ripoll when the attack was taking place.\n\nCatalonia's interior ministry have reported that there is no evidence the driver, who fled, was armed. Initially police said they were hunting a man of 5ft 5ins (1.7m) in height, wearing a white shirt with blue stripes. Two men, one Spanish and one from Morocco, were arrested in Ripoll and Alcanar, 135 miles south of Barcelona.\n\nIreland's President Michael D Higgins led condemnation of the attacks. He said \"Barcelona has a long history of hospitality and has over the years received so many people from around the world.\n\n\"As President of Ireland, I want to send the people of this great and welcoming city not only our sympathy but also the solidarity of the people of Ireland.\"\n\nTaoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said \"An attack of this nature, targeting the people of Barcelona and visitors enjoying that wonderful city in the height of the tourist season, is both wanton and cowardly and has no place in our society.\n\n\"At this time of immense grief, I want to offer our solidarity and support to the people of Spain, with whom we have such close relations.\"\n\nThe Govt & people of Ireland stand with the people of Barcelona at this time of immense grief. We offer our sympathy, solidarity & support. -- Leo Varadkar (@campaignforleo)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nOn behalf of Irish government, I wish to convey sincere condolences and solidarity with people of Barcelona and Spain this evening -- Simon Coveney (@simoncoveney)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nIreland's Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said \"It is clear that the intention of those who carried out this appalling, evil act was to kill, wound and terrorize innocent people enjoying the freedoms we share and cherish,\" he said.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with the victims and their families.\"", "id":

We've seen it now in London, in Paris, in Berlin, in Stockholm, in Nice, in Manchester and many other great European cities.\n\n\"And I think the response has to be to ensure that this type of cowardly, horrible terrorism doesn't change our way of life - and that we continue to travel and move around Europe in the way that we always have.\n\n\"But of course people need to be more vigilant now: they need to be aware of their surroundings, they need to take the advice of local authorities and local police in a way that perhaps in the past they didn't need to do.\n\n\"So our advice to people is of course you should continue to travel and to move ahead with your holiday plans - but be vigilant and be careful\".\n\nAsked about Ireland's preparedness for any such attack, Mr Coveney said: \"I think we're better prepared than we've ever been.\n\n\"Of course we need to be vigilant - I think it's important to say that though that the risk assessment in Ireland... hasn't changed and hasn't changed today.\n\n\"There's a possibility of an attack like this, but it's not likely\".\n\n\"If you look at how, on the face if it anyway, Spanish security forces responded yesterday they seem to have responded very, very quickly.\n\n\"But of course when you have a mad man willing to drive a van into a crowded street, it is very difficult to prepare and to respond to that.\n\n\"But they're

Since 2015 the Spanish Government's national anti-terror alert level is at four (high) on a scale of 1 to 5; this has not changed following the attacks of August 2017.\n\n\"Irish citizens should increase their security awareness and exercise heightened caution in popular tourist locations and crowded places. In case of any security incident, you should follow the instructions and advice of the local police and your tour operator.\"\n\nForeign Minister Simon Coveney acknowledged the huge numbers of people who travel to Spain each year but said people should try not to change their behaviour because of terrorists.\n\nSpeaking on Morning Ireland the Minister said: \"Nearly two million Irish people this year will travel to Spain on their holidays.\n\n\"So at the moment, you can safely say that probably over 300,000 Irish people are in Spain, today as we speak.\n\n\"We should not let this change our way of life. But people should be vigilant.\n\n\"The reality is that we should be aware of international terrorism in a way that we didn't have to in the past.\n\n\"But the thought that the great European cities are places we wouldn't travel is something we can't countenance.\"\n\nRead More Today's top stories", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 100, "id": 237, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Celtic", "wgt": 100, "id": 827, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Celtic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 100, "id": 930, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "wgt": 100, "id": 931, "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc", "id": "67"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc", "id": "151106"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302532", "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302678", "label": {"eng": "Government of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302694", "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303322", "label": {"eng": "Counter-terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303659", "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309111", "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310794", "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_operator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315102", "label": {"eng": "Tour operator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "315156", "label": {"eng": "Travel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "320228", "label": {"eng": "Travel agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_nationality_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "336632", "label": {"eng": "Irish nationality law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Coveney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "350915", "label": {"eng": "Simon Coveney"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roussillon", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roussillon"}, "type": "loc", "id": "444174"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "445019", "label": {"eng": "Morning Ireland"}}]}], "totalResults": 24, "pages": 24}}}

We want police to use the curfew powers when it's needed, and that time is right now.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the minister referred to comments by Police Minister Brent Potter vast majority of people in Alice Springs \"do the right thing every single day,\" such as small businesses trying to make a living and tourism services trying to operate in the town.\n\n\"And then we have a small number of people that bring that town down by doing some, you know, disgraceful acts that we've seen,\" she said.\n\nThis is the second curfew in Alice Springs this year.\n\nThe first public disorder declaration took place in April. It was extended by six days after being originally implemented in late March in response to a string of violent incidents and unrest in the city.\n\nYoung people under the age of 18 were unable to enter the town centre between the hours of 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. without a valid reason.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alice Springs"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alice Springs"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Australia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Leichhardt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Division of Leichhardt"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Highway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Highway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_and_New_Zealand_Army_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian and New Zealand Army Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motor vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brent Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/01/25/20160728001276722877-original-min-700x420.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712742", "eventUri": "eng-9712742", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 325, "textEnd": 331}], "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

"body": "Residents in an outback town have woken after a second night under a curfew imposed by police after a spike in alcohol-fueled violence.\n\nNorthern Territory Police issued the three-night public social disorder declaration on Monday for all residents and visitors for parts of Alice Springs from 10pm to 6am.\n\nIt's the second time the city has been subjected to curfew restrictions this year.\n\nIn March, a three-week curfew for people aged under 18 was imposed on the Alice Springs town centre from 6pm to 6am following a series of wild brawls.\n\nThe current curfew followed a weekend of violence in the town of about 25,000 that included a brawl involving 80 people, a knife attack on a 42-year-old woman, the robbery of a service station and the assault of four off-duty police officers.\n\nThe current lockdown is due to end at 6am on Thursday.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday night local bottleshops will reopen after being closed since Monday, when the curfew began.\n\nAuthorities are yet to decide whether to extend the curfew until later this week or into the weekend.\n\nOn Tuesday night, police reported one incident after 10pm in Alice Springs.\n\nA car business in Ciccone, three kilometres from the town centre, was broken into after a group of people rammed the front gate and stole keys to vehicles on site before stealing three cars.\n\nThe cars were tracked and later found abandoned at different locations across Alice Springs.\n\nThe offenders, who could be charged with breaking the curfew as well as aggravated burglary, are yet to be found.\n\nBut police said overall it was a relatively quiet night and compliance with the curfew was high.\n\nMeanwhile, the peak body for Indigenous children and families says a curfew isn't a sustainable solution for the social issues found in Alice Springs.\n\nAuthorities should instead focus on improving the lives of Aboriginal families and children, the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care said following a second night of a curfew in the red centre town.\n\n\"Experience from the April curfew showed many families crying out for support,\" chief executive Catherine Liddle said on Wednesday.\n\n\"A focus on investing in family and children during the early years is an approach that works and can turn the tide for communities like Alice Springs.\"\n\nIndigenous Australians Minister Linda Burney has said long-term solutions were needed to address the problems plaguing the town.\n\nShe noted that last year the federal government had provided a four-year package of $250 million for central Australia.\n\nNT Country Liberal Party senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, who was previously an Alice Springs deputy mayor, said curfews are temporary measures and don't solve underlying issues.\n\nShe said more needed to be done to improve the town camps, where families live in poverty.\n\nThe national secretariat wants community-run child and family hubs to deliver early education and care and links to services and support.\n\n\"This would be a game-changer for struggling families,\" Ms Liddle said.\n\n\"Long-term solutions must include building a truly comprehensive and supportive early childhood education and care system, one that is accessible by all.\"\n\nTo extend the curfew, NT Police Commissioner Michael Murphy will have to seek approval from Police Minister Brett Potter.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type":

applied to people under the age of 18.\n\nChief Minister Eva Lawler said the curfew would act as a \"pressure-relief valve\" and improve community safety.\n\n\"I love Alice Springs but the offending and behaviour we have seen over the last 96 hours will not be tolerated,\" she told reporters.\n\n\"The curfew will provide police extra powers to get on top of the situation.\"\n\nCommissioner Michael Murphy said a series of crimes across the weekend had led to the decision to impose the curfew.\n\nThese included a brawl involving about 80 people in which police were assaulted, a knife attack on a 42-year-old woman, the robbery of a service station and the assault of four off-duty police officers on a street.\n\n\"The intent of this declaration is to disrupt the behaviours associated with the harm we're seeing in Alice Spring,\" he said.\n\n\"It applies to all classes of people - it will apply to adults and it will apply to youths.\"\n\nThe curfew will be imposed on the town centre between Anzac Hill, the Alice Springs Hospital, the Stuart Highway and Leichhardt Terrace, which runs along the Todd River.\n\n\"Anyone coming into the zone can be engaged by police and they can be asked to leave or alternatively they can be asked to stay, if there is another disturbance, for their own safety,\" Mr Murphy said.\n\n\"A failure to abide in a request by police can lead to an offence and it can lead to an infringement notice or an arrest.\"\n\nPeople with legitimate business in the area, such as work or attending an event, and those seeking safety or medical treatment will be permitted to enter the zone.\n\nIt comes as NAIDOC week celebrations kick off in the town of about 25,000, attracting about 5000 visitors from the NT, Western Australia and South Australia.\n\nMr Murphy said police would not disturb the annual event and the curfew would help keep those celebrating safe.\n\n\"I'm very aware it's a really important week for the territory and Australia,\" he said.\n\nThe emergency declaration has been made using laws passed by the territory parliament in May that let the police commissioner impose a three-day curfew that can be extended to seven days if the police minister approves.\n\nDuring the curfew, police can order groups of people to disperse or hold them in an area to prevent maintain public safety.\n\nSwinburne criminology expert Joel McGregor said the NT's crime issues required long-term behaviour change, not-short interventions.\n\n\"While the NT curfew may be stopping crimes being perpetuated during the evening, it should not be thought of as a solution to the problems the (territory) is facing,\" he said.\n\nThe lock down follows a three-week curfew banning anyone under 18 from the town's centre between 6pm and

You can never tell,' Mr Clark told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday night.\n\nHe said since the previous three-week curfew over the Easter period things had been 'great' up until recently but added that 'it's always quieter in winter'.\n\nBut the Action for Alice page in recent days has posted reports of numerous break-ins, a ram raid, smashed vehicles and street fights.\n\nIn footage posed on the Action for Alice Facebook page a motorist filmed a tyre iron being flung at his vehicle from a hatchback car blocking an Alice Springs street\n\nIn one shocking incident, dashcam video captured a tyre iron being hurled from a grey hatchback vehicle blocking a road and hitting the front of the car taking the footage.\n\nA youth is seen leaning out the passenger window of the hatchback and threatening the motorist taking the dashcam footage with a stick while the tire iron is thrown from the far side passenger window.\n\nThe motorist has reported the incident to police.\n\nAs the town descends into chaos once again, critics have zeroed in on Ms Burney and the Northern Territory authorities for not addressing the problem.\n\nIndigenous advocate Warren Mundine accused Ms Burney of remaining silent on the issues plaguing Alice Springs even as the curfew began because she had no policies to offer.\n\n'We need to get some leadership from the (federal) government and we need to get better leadership from the states and territories, because in regards to law and order and a number of other areas, it's the states and territories who are in charge of this stuff,' Mr Mundine told Sky News on Monday.\n\nAction for Alice has also documented numerous other acts of damage and theft over the past few days such as this car with smashed windows in the Alice Springs CBD\n\n'I've got to say, they've been a dismal failure over the years.'\n\nMr Mundine said the curfew was a 'band-aid solution'.\n\n.On Tuesday morning Ms Burney told ABC News Breakfast that although the curfew 'was important' it's not the 'be-all and end-all'.\n\n'The Police Commissioner has made that very clear in saying that the curfew is about calming things down into intervening making the place safe, but it is the underlying issues that are particularly important,' she said.\n\n'Particularly, as the Police Commissioner said, that you can't arrest your way out of this. The judicial system is not the answer.\n\n'But the community working with government is the answer. And that's very much the way in which I'm pursuing the issues.'\n\nUnder laws introduced in May, the NT's Police Commissioner has the power to declare 72-hour lockdowns to respond to 'public disorder'.\n\nCritics have been demanding Indigenous Minister Linda Burney show more leadership over the troubles plaguing Alice Springs or step down\n\nThe current curfew will runs from Monday to Wednesday and applies from 10pm to 6am over the main part of Alice Springs.\n\nUnlike the previous curfew, which was targeted on Indigenous youth, the latest one applies to all local children and adults.\n\nIt was enforced after four off duty officers were allegedly assaulted while walking along a walkway on their way to a hotel on Barrett Drive.\n\nThey were allegedly attacked from behind by 20 male youths.\n\nOne of the female officers was pulled to the ground and allegedly had her bag stolen.\n\nAlice Springs is experiencing its second curfew of the year with locals ordered off the streets in the main part of town from 10pm to 6pm over the next three nights\n\nAnother woman was punched in the face and kicked multiple times before her mobile phone was taken.\n\nThe male officer was also punched and kicked multiple times.\n\nThe four officers returned to their accommodation where they contacted police.\n\nTwo of the female officers later received treatment for their injuries in hospital.\n\nNo charges have yet been laid.\n\nPolice have urged anyone who witnessed the incident or has information to come forward.\n\nRead More Snap curfew imposed on troubled outback town

They more run away from the problem than deal with the problem and that comes from the political leadership around this country.\"\n\nThe recent curfew announcement came as just another let down for Mr Mundine who felt lacklustre leadership was leaving communities like Alice Springs behind.\n\n\"I'm not really happy because I'm sick and tired of going into communities and going across Australia and seeing the crap that is happening because of the failure of leadership,\" he said.\n\nThe town's snap curfew was confirmed by Police Commissioner Michael Murphy on Monday.\n\n\"This afternoon I've signed off on a Public Social Disorder Declaration that will be effective now, but will only come into operation between 10pm and 6am over the next three nights,\" he told media in Alice Springs.\n\n\"From 10pm tonight till 6am the confines between ANZAC Hill, Schwartz Crescent, down to the hospital from the Stuart Highway across to Leichhardt and Stott Terrace will be in the declared area.\n\n\"Anyone coming into the zone can be engaged by police and they can be asked to leave, or alternatively, they can be asked to stay if there's another disturbance and they need to be contained for their own safety.\"\n\nCommissioner Murphy added NAIDOC week celebrations and other community concerns meant he had to \"carefully consider\" the impact of any restrictions before making the announcement, saying he did not want to \"disrupt\" important events.\n\nIt was \"more important than ever\" that police had community support in addressing underlying causes of unrest, he continued, explaining the solutions lied \"in the community and the leadership\", rather than the criminal justice system.\n\nFailure to abide with Monday's curfew could lead to authorities issuing an infringement notice, or even an immediate arrest, although there are a handful of exceptions which permit locals to enter the declared area.", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News Australia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Burney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linda Burney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous Australians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alice Springs"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alice Springs"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory_Government", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Mundine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren Mundine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and territories of Australia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Leichhardt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Division of Leichhardt"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Highway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Highway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIDOC_Week", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NAIDOC Week"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/8c7d8d7b848cc4030c4dd3b7a32e5ad2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712742", "eventUri": "eng-9712742", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

long-term plans to reduce crime amid snap curfew", "body": "Federal Minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney says the Commonwealth is investing in more police and liquor inspectors, as well as better domestic violence and youth services.\n\nAlice Springs community leaders are pushing for more accountability from the government and other organisations tasked with combating the drivers of crime, after a series of violent incidents triggered another curfew.\n\nUnder the 72-hour curfew, declared by the Northern Territory's police commissioner on Monday, adults and children are barred from entering the town centre from 10pm to 6am each night.\n\nExemptions apply for people fleeing domestic violence, visiting family, caregiving, working or purchasing food from a fast food restaurant.\n\nThe latest curfew was triggered by a series of violent incidents, including an alleged attack on four off-duty police officers by a group of about 20 young people on Sunday morning.\n\nA police officer was also run over outside a bottle shop on Friday and a woman was allegedly stabbed with a knife on Sunday.\n\nCatherine Liddle, chief executive of SNAICC -- the peak body for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children -- said she was disappointed another curfew had been imposed just months after a three-week youth curfew ended in Alice Springs.\n\n\"What we don't want to see is an environment where it's OK for police just to call a snap curfew, as opposed to bringing in the interventions that are required to keep the community safe,\" Ms Liddle said.\n\nThe Arrernte-Luritja woman said she was yet to feel the impact of $250 million of federal funding promised for programs targeting social dysfunction in Alice Springs.\n\n\"We haven't had any update around the solutions that the Northern Territory government called for when they got community in the room,\" she said.\n\n\"What I'd like to know is: what has happened since then?\"\n\nArmani Francois, a Central Eastern Arrernte woman and youth support worker, said she was also waiting to see benefits of the federal funding package on the ground.\n\n\"[Prime Minister Anthony] Albanese came last year and promised us $250 million to help the disadvantages of Aboriginal people and youth crime and I just don't know where that money is,\" she said.\n\nThe four-year support package includes $40 million for on-country learning and $23.5 million to improve First Nations health outcomes.\n\nFederal member for Lingiari Marion Scrymgour said now was the time for organisations to show they were using the funding effectively.\n\n\"It's not just a policing issue,\" she said.\n\n\"There are agencies that should be taking some responsibility here, and it's time for everyone to step up and actually be accountable for what's happening in Alice Springs.\"\n\nIn a statement, federal Minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney said the causes of social issues in Alice Springs were \"complex and have been developing for years\".\n\n\"We're investing in more police and liquor inspectors, and better domestic violence and youth services, along with properly funding remote schools and creating jobs in remote communities,\" she said.\n\nJared Sharp, principal legal officer at the North Australia Aboriginal Justice Agency (NAAJA), said he was concerned the police commissioner had been too quick to take advantage of the NT's new curfew laws.\n\n\"We just haven't seen the evidence that what has occurred constitutes an emergency that requires this sort of intervention,\" he said.\n\nMr Sharp said he also feared the curfew would inadvertently target vulnerable people.\n\n\"We are talking about some of the most marginalised and disadvantaged people in Australia, who will be sleeping rough,\" he said.\n\n\"We're talking about a lot of young people who don't have safe places to go at night, we're talking about people with mental health issues.\"\n\nCentral Land Council (CLC) chief executive Les Turner said he believed access to alcohol, combined with ongoing government neglect of remote communities, was exacerbating the social issues in Alice Springs.\n\n\"A lot of people are moving into Alice Springs because that's where the services are,\" he said.\n\n\"They want a better life for some of their people and their kids, [and] an education system and a health system, which is broken in our communities.\"\n\nMr Turner, who supports the curfew as a short-term measure, said he wanted tighter controls limiting the sale of alcohol that go beyond the town's current bottle shop trading restrictions.\n\n\"There's got to be tighter controls in terms of the number of alcohol outlets [and] the sale of alcohol.\"\n\nMs Scrymgour agreed the availability of alcohol was contributing to violence and crime in Alice Springs.\n\n\"We've got to deal with grog,\" she said.\n\n\"Let's stop pussyfooting around this issue that grog isn't impacting on that community.\"\n\nOn Monday night, NT Police served a notice of suspension on two licensed premises on Todd Street in Alice Springs in response to violent behaviour by patrons.\n\nChief Minister Eva Lawler said the government was monitoring the Alice Springs curfew, with any extensions requiring approval from the police minister.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian

People can still enter the designated area if they are fleeing domestic violence, caring for a sick person, employment reasons or dining at restaurants, ABC News reported.\n\nCurfew will cover areas between Anzac Hill, Schwarz Crescent, down to the hospital, from the Stuart Highway across to Leichhardt and Stott Terrace.\n\n\"Anybody into the zone can be engaged by police, and they can be asked to leave,\" Murphy said. \"Or alternatively, they can be asked to stay if there's another disturbance and they need to be contained for their own safety. A failure to abide to a request by police can lead to an offence, and it can lead to an infringement notice or an arrest.\"\n\nNT Police Minister Brent Potter described the violence in Alice Springs as a \"horror 72 hours,\" after 20 persons allegedly assaulted four police officers. Three women and a male officer were attacked near the Stott Terrace bridge, early Sunday morning. In a separate incident on Sunday, a 42-year-old woman was stabbed with a knife.\n\nA 26-year-old man was arrested after he ran over a police officer outside a liquor shop on Friday.\n\nChief Minister Eva Lawler stated that the situation will be monitored and further extension of the curfew will be decided accordingly.\n\n\"We will monitor the situation closely for the next 72 hours, and any extension will need to be signed off by the minister for police,\" she said.\n\nMurphy stated that night curfew will be imposed considering the National Aboriginal and Islander Day Observance Committee (NAIDOC) week so that people can attend the events till 10pm.\n\n\"I'm very mindful about the decision to support NAIDOC Week and not disrupt events associated with NAIDOC Week,\" he said.\n\nAlice Springs, a remote town in Australia, is the gateway to major tourist attractions, including the giant red sandstone monolith of Uluru, Reuters reported.\n\nIn March and April this year, a three-week week curfew was imposed on minors after violent clashes were reported. As there was widespread criticism against the youth curfew that applied to those below 18 years, new emergency laws were introduced in May.\n\nUnder the new laws, NT's police commissioner has the power to declare a 72-hour lockdown if public disorder is affected and may even recommend an extension.\n\nAlcoholism is the main reason that locals say is causing the sporadic violence in the region.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vidhya_ck@ibtimes.com.au", "name": "Vidhya Ck", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alice Springs"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alice Springs"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Leichhardt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Division of Leichhardt"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Highway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Highway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_and_New_Zealand_Army_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian and New Zealand Army Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brent Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Lawler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eva Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIDOC_Week", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NAIDOC Week"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister_of_the_Northern_Territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief Minister of the Northern Territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandstone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sandstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluru", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uluru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1853031/police.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712742", "eventUri": "eng-9712742", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The declaration includes a restricted movement provision that creates a curfew for all residents and visitors to the town from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM local time. This curfew will last for three days from 10:00 PM local time on Monday.\n\nThe declaration was issued after a series of violent acts occurred in Alice Springs. On Friday afternoon, a police officer was run over by a vehicle driven by an intoxicated man, which resulted in fractures to the officer's arm and leg. On Saturday evening, around 80 people exited two licensed premises earlier in the night and began to engage in violent conduct in a large-scale disturbance on Alice Springs council lawns. Police officers were assaulted as they used force to disperse the crowd. The members of the group wandered into the Todd River. Following this, the group assaulted and robbed four off-duty police officers who were walking home in the early hours of the morning. The violent disturbances continued into Sunday, during which a 40-year-old woman was stabbed with a knife and hospitalised. Later in the night, three youths in a stolen motor vehicle conducted a robbery at a service station.\n\nThe powers of the police commissioner to issue declarations came into force on June 1, 2024, following amendments to the Police Administration Act 1978 and the Police Administration Regulations 1994. The declaration was issued under sections 135B and 135C of the Police Administration Act 1978. Section 135D gives police officers the power to control the movement of people to prevent, stop or reduce public disorder in the declared area. These powers may only be exercised while the declaration is in effect. Failure to comply with a direction without a reasonable excuse is an offence under section 135E.\n\nThis is the second curfew imposed on Alice Springs this year. Following a spike in crime rates and violence, particularly involving young people, an emergency declaration was made for Alice Springs and a three-week youth curfew was imposed from March 27 to April 16 this year.\n\nThe legality of the Public Order Declaration legislation and the imposition of the curfews were widely criticised by Indigenous legal services and justice organisations. Amnesty International expressed serious concerns over the three-week youth curfew, calling it \"a misguided attempt [that] not only targets Aboriginal youth but also fails to address the underlying issues fuelling crime in communities.\" In particular, there are concerns that the curfews disproportionately impact Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who are severely over-represented in the NT's criminal justice system.\n\nRelatedly, on April 16, 2023, several Australian MPs accused Federal Opposition Leader Peter Dutton of misrepresenting the prevalence of sexual abuse in Alice Springs. Dutton claimed that sexual abuse remained \"rampant\" in the town following the federal government's response to rising crime rates in the NT.", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "JURIST"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tayla_mitchell@jurist.org", "name": "Tayla Mitchell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alice Springs"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alice Springs"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Order of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opposition (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Dutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous Australians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/01/Alice_Springs_panorama.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712742", "eventUri": "eng-9712742", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-27", "dateEnd": "-04-16", "textStart": 2261, "textEnd": 2281}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-04-", "textStart": 2909, "textEnd": 2917}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

lives of Aboriginal families and children, Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care said following a second night of a curfew in the red centre town.\n\n\"Experience from the April curfew showed many families crying out for support,\" chief executive Catherine Liddle said on Wednesday.\n\n\"A focus on investing in family and children during the early years is an approach that works and can turn the tide for communities like Alice Springs.\"\n\nNorthern Territory Police issued a three-night public social disorder declaration on Monday for all residents and visitors for parts of Alice Springs from 10pm to 6am.\n\nAuthorities said the lockdown could be extended.\n\nThe emergency order was prompted by a weekend of violence in the town of about 25,000 that included a brawl involving 80 people, a knife attack on a 42-year-old woman, the robbery of a service station and the assault of four off-duty police officers.\n\nIndigenous Australians Minister Linda Burney has said long-term solutions were the only way to address problems plaguing the town.\n\nShe said politics should be kept out of the debate and there had been positive signs since the federal government had provided a four-year package of $250 million for Central Australia in early 2023.\n\nNT coalition senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, who was previously an Alice Springs deputy mayor, said curfews were only temporary measures and would not solve underlying issues.\n\nShe said more needed to be done to improve the town camps, where some families live in poverty.\n\nMs Liddle said SNAICC had raised the need for community run child and family hubs to deliver early education and care and links to services and support.\n\n\"This would be a game-changer for struggling families,\" she said.\n\n\"Long-term solutions must include building a truly comprehensive and supportive early childhood education and care system, one that is accessible by all.\"\n\nA three-week curfew for anyone

Upon walking to a location only a short distance from the restaurant they were set-up by these filthy cowards who reportedly were part of an all-in brawl on the front lawn of the Council office,\" Chris told SkyNews.com.au\n\nThe four officers were approached from behind by a group of about 20 male youths who proceeded to assault the off-duty police, punching and kicking them multiple times before leaving.\n\nThe father and husband - who served as a Police officer in Queensland between 1999 and 2011 - said they are a police family and had recently lived in Alice Springs for two and a half years when his wife was a constable there, so they \"knew what to expect\".\n\nBut he said the central Australian city was currently \"too dangerous\" for junior constables and he would be pulling his daughter out of the community.\n\n\"Alice Springs is out of control, this situation now is too dangerous and dire for us to consider having our daughter - a brand new Constable, serve in this horrid war zone,\" he said.\n\nThe father and husband said that his daughter was committed to remaining in the NT Police, but that he knew from experience that Alice Springs was not the place for officers to start their careers.\n\n\"Charlie is very, very intelligent. She's bright-eyed, bushy-tailed. She was so proud - as we were - last Friday at her graduation. Charlie is the epitome of a fresh recruit coming straight out of the academy ready to put boots on the ground... She's ready to go,\" he said\n\n\"But... as a former police sergeant and field training officer - with very extensive experience training new recruits and also living and working in remote Indigenous communities - Alice Springs at the moment is not an ideal situation for a brand new constable to go and experience policing.\n\n\"Alice Springs is the deep, deep, deep end for junior constables.

The police commissioner has flown down yesterday afternoon, was meant to make some announcements this morning, but they've gone to ground; there's been radio silence.\"\n\nMr Clark also hit out at the failure to address underlying causes of unrest in the community, describing solutions like curfews as \"band-aids\" and calling for long-term solutions to \"turn around\" the troubled town.\n\nThe Action for Alice founder argued more work was needed to \"give kids in remote communities a future\" and provide a stable environment through better housing and education.\n\nHe also expressed sympathy for emergency services, saying \"you wouldn't want to do that job up here\" given the rates of violence, domestic abuse and drug and alcohol fuelled crime.\n\nHowever, he argued authorities had little choice but to continue with crackdowns on youth offending, given the threat posed to the wider community.", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News Australia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory_Police_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory Police Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alice Springs"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alice Springs"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brent Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Leichhardt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Division of Leichhardt"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Highway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Highway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Shorten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helen Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/4500822ce42053ab2ef31346d5fd3b96", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712742", "eventUri": "eng-9712742", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

It's just not good.\"\n\nHe claimed recent violence in the town was largely due to unresolved payback between families from surrounding communities, inflamed by alcohol.\n\nHe feared this was leaving many children in a vulnerable position.\n\n\"The mother and father, they drink and fight and that's why the kids run away, and they look for other troubles,\" he said.\n\nDomestic violence researcher, Chay Brown, said Alice Springs needed a coordinated approach for managing the rollout of the Commonwealth's $250 million rescue package, which includes funding for domestic violence and youth services.\n\n\"My understanding is a lot has not been allocated and a lot has not hit the ground,\" Dr Brown said.\n\n\"We really needed a community-led co-designed approach to where that money should go, and that never happened.\n\n\"We've had communities left behind and as a result, none of us know what's going on.\"\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson from the NT's Department of Territory Families, Housing and Communities said there were \"no reports of increased homelessness in Alice Springs\" and said people sleeping rough could continue to access services during the curfew.\n\n\"Alice Springs typically sees a higher number of people from remote communities at this time of year, many of whom choose to camp while visiting the Alice Springs Show, taking part in NAIDOC events and enjoying school holidays,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson also said Territory Families had provided funding for additional beds at a visitor park in Alice Springs, where people sleeping rough can access essential services.\n\n\"Although intended for short stays, the visitor parks address situational homelessness, filling the gap created by the scarcity of appropriate housing options,\" they said.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alice Springs"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alice Springs"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory_Police_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory Police Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitjantjatjara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitjantjatjara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Todd River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aboriginal Australians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrernte_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arrernte people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Australia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIDOC_Week", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NAIDOC Week"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_business_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central business district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/83454645e7aae1800c61baa942bbaa0d?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=135&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712742", "eventUri": "eng-9712742", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

We will continue to take action against people who engage in this type of reprehensible behaviour.'\n\nLocal business owner Darren Clark, who runs the Action for Alice social media accounts that documents criminal and anti-social behaviour in the town, said there had been no word on whether the curfew would be extended past Thursday.\n\nHowever, he told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday night he believed it would be extended.\n\nNT Police Commissioner Michael Murphy declared a three-night curfew on Monday, which is the second time this year the troubled town has been under such draconian measures.\n\nA three-week curfew was put in place over the Easter period after a rampaging mob took over the streets.\n\nRead More 'Safety division' cops brought in to Alice Springs to tackle crime

officer, were going back to their accommodation on Barrett Drive just after 2am when they were allegedly set upon by a group of 20 males, some of whom were youths.\n\n\"One female was pulled to the ground and had her bag stolen, another female was punched in the face and kicked multiple times and had her mobile phone taken while the male was also punched and kicked multiple times,\" a police statement said.\n\nTwo female victims were later taken to Alice Springs Hospital for treatment.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News Australia on Tuesday, Mr Paterson said he recently called the Northern Territory Police Commissioner to see how the group was faring.\n\n\"I spoke to the Police Commissioner yesterday and two of the police officers are doing well and two aren't doing as well so I think it is just a waiting game,\" he revealed.\n\n\"I take my hat off to the police I think they do an incredible job, I certainly couldn't do it, it is just one thing after another for those poor men and women.\"\n\nHe went on to say he understood two of the injured officers were still in hospital.\n\nAnother police officer was allegedly run over in a separate attack outside a takeaway liquor outlet in the town on Friday, with the man rushed to hospital with a suspected broken foot and finger.\n\nAccording to NT News, the officer had to undergo surgery.\n\n\"I think it is just wait and see how the three of them are going,\" Mr Paterson said.\n\nThe mayor later said it was too early to tell what impact the new curfew, which was imposed on Sunday night to run for the next 72 hours, has had.\n\nThe Public Disorder Declaration was issued by commissioner Michael Murphy in response to a series of \"serious incidents\" which occurred over the weekend, including the alleged assault of the off-duty officers.\n\n\"This curfew affects everyone from 10pm to 6am, you can be in a restricted area for a reason but police can certainly move you on or they can also keep you there,\" Mr Paterson said.\n\n\"Still getting reports... now but I think we will see some incidents, usually out in the suburbs.\n\n\"But hopefully with the influx of the extra police we can lower the anxiety levels of

But where's the evidence it...", "body": "Source: The Conversation (Au and NZ) - By Thalia Anthony, Professor of Law, University of Technology Sydney\n\nSince early 2023, the Northern Territory and federal governments have been trialling a range of social control measures in Alice Springs (Mparntwe) to address moral panics in relation to youth crime.\n\nThe initial focus was on reinstating restrictive alcohol laws in Aboriginal communities, then more police and funding for prisons, and now curfews.\n\nYesterday, the NT Police Commissioner announced a snap three-day curfew following violent incidents, including off-duty police officers being assaulted.\n\nBut there's little evidence to suggest it will work, either to drive down violent behaviour or to protect the public.\n\nIn January 2023, trailblazing Arrernte midwife Cherisse Buzzacott saw the writing on the wall. She said, \"We fear curfews\". Cherisse grew up during the NT Intervention years and knows what it is like to be an Aboriginal young person surveilled by police and subject to racially discriminatory laws.\n\nBarely a year on from her comments, these fears were realised. In March 2024, the NT government announced a two-week curfew to ban young people from the Alice Springs CBD between 6pm and 6am. This was then extended by a further week.\n\nFollowing advice from the NT Police, the territory government granted powers under the Police Administration Act to declare 72-hour curfews when the police commissioner reasonably believes there is public disorder or a significant risk of it. The commissioner can also request an extension of up to seven days.\n\nUnlike the previous curfew, the new legislation allows for criminal penalties. Non-compliance with curfew orders is a \"strict liability\" criminal offence, which means even if the person honestly believes they are complying, they will be criminalised. The maximum penalty is a fine of A$1,480.\n\nThe NT government suspended the Anti-Discriminatory Act 1992 to enable the enforcement of curfews. This raises a red flag about its potential discriminatory impacts, even though the laws are ostensibly neutral.\n\nThe North Australian Aboriginal Justice Association (NAAJA) has raised concerns about police targeting Aboriginal young people in the enforcement of curfews, and described the curfews as \"racist lockdown laws\".\n\nCurfews are not a new government strategy. They have been deployed for decades to restrict the movement and liberties of Aboriginal people in Australia. Curfews were enabled by the Aboriginal Protection Acts - a legislative regime that controlled and segregated Aboriginal people.\n\nIn the NT, Aboriginal people were barred from entering Alice Springs between sunset and sunrise from 1928 to 1964. In Western Australia, curfew laws were passed in 1905 that barred Noongar people from central Perth after 6pm. There were also 9pm curfews on Aboriginal reserves in Queensland.\n\nMore recently in Redfern and surrounding areas in Sydney in the 1960s and '70s, police enforced nightly 10pm curfews on Aboriginal people. The same strategy had been used for slaves across the colonies, including in the United States.\n\nThe most rigorous studies in relation to curfews have been undertaken in relation to youth curfews in the US. One study in 1994 showed 77% of large US cities having a curfew policy, and another in 1997 indicated it was as high as 80%.\n\nStudies of these curfews have repeatedly found that they do not reduce crime. US curfews have been imposed on the assumption that restricting young peoples' hours in public will \"limit their opportunities to commit crimes or become victims\", but this objective has not been realised.\n\nA 2016 review of ten studies on the impact of youth curfews in the US since 1960 found they were ineffective in reducing criminal behaviour and victimisation among youth.\n\nIn fact, young people were slightly more likely to commit crime during the curfew hours, compared to the hours when the curfew was not imposed.\n\nSimilarly, victimisation rates were not affected by the curfew. A contemporaneous study of the tightening of Baltimore's youth curfew laws found it \"did not have the desired effect of reducing juvenile crime during curfew hours\", but did have the effect of increasing arrests of young people. Another review in 2018 found the basis for curfews lacked \"empirical\" evidence.\n\nStudies in relation to particular offences, such as knife crimes, also found curfews did not have a significant impact.\n\nThere do not appear to be similar studies on whole-of-population curfews, which is occurring in relation to the Alice Springs curfew. This type of curfew appears unprecedented in its extension to adults.\n\nHowever, it is likely to manifest in a similar way to the curfews that sought to control Aboriginal people. From the experience in Redfern, the overwhelming consequence was an increase in police charges, arrests and violence.\n\nIn Alice Springs, there are risks for particular groups that are unable to comply with curfew orders. The NT has the highest homeless population in the country, and people who are unable to find shelter outside of the town are likely to be subject to law enforcement.\n\nYoung people who are in the child protection system are also likely to walk the streets at night due to neglect by state agencies, as exposed in the Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory. In addition, people with mental health and trauma needs may be unable to comply with the curfew requirements.\n\nThe curfew approach has high risks for little proven gain. After almost 20 years of top-down punitive interventions in NT Aboriginal communities, since the NT Emergency Response was rolled out in 2007, it is time to critically reflect on this track record.\n\nThe response to the colonial curfews in Alice Springs in the early 20th century was to build Alice Springs town camps that would restrict Aboriginal movement into the CBD after hours. This new curfew policy is repeating a process that has not changed.\n\nAt a time when the NT police is facing intense scrutiny and accusations of a culture of racism, handing executive powers to the NT Police Commissioner to declare curfews is unlikely to improve community safety and may likely increase community tensions.\n\nThalia Anthony receives funding from the Australian Research

She said, \"We fear curfews\". Cherisse grew up during the NT Intervention years and knows what it is like to be an Aboriginal young person surveilled by police and subject to racially discriminatory laws.\n\nBarely a year on from her comments, these fears were realised. In March 2024, the NT government announced a two-week curfew to ban young people from the Alice Springs CBD between 6pm and 6am. This was then extended by a further week.\n\nFollowing advice from the NT Police, the territory government granted powers under the Police Administration Act to declare 72-hour curfews when the police commissioner reasonably believes there is public disorder or a significant risk of it. The commissioner can also request an extension of up to seven days.\n\nUnlike the previous curfew, the new legislation allows for criminal penalties. Non-compliance with curfew orders is a \"strict liability\" criminal offence, which means even if the person honestly believes they are complying, they will be criminalised. The maximum penalty is a fine of A$1,480.\n\nThe NT government suspended the Anti-Discriminatory Act 1992 to enable the enforcement of curfews. This raises a red flag about its potential discriminatory impacts, even though the laws are ostensibly neutral.\n\nThe North Australian Aboriginal Justice Association (NAAJA) has raised concerns about police targeting Aboriginal young people in the enforcement of curfews, and described the curfews as \"racist lockdown laws\".\n\nHistory of curfews, here and abroad\n\nCurfews are not a new government strategy. They have been deployed for decades to restrict the movement and liberties of Aboriginal people in Australia. Curfews were enabled by the Aboriginal Protection Acts - a legislative regime that controlled and segregated Aboriginal people.\n\nIn the NT, Aboriginal people were barred from entering Alice Springs between sunset and sunrise from 1928 to 1964. In Western Australia, curfew laws were passed in 1905 that barred Noongar people from central Perth after 6pm. There were also 9pm curfews on Aboriginal reserves in Queensland.\n\nMore recently in Redfern and surrounding areas in Sydney in the 1960s and '70s, police enforced nightly 10pm curfews on Aboriginal people. The same strategy had been used for slaves across the colonies, including in the United States.\n\nDo curfews increase safety?\n\nThe most rigorous studies in relation to curfews have been undertaken in relation to youth curfews in the US. One study in 1994 showed 77% of large US cities having a curfew policy, and another in 1997 indicated it was as high as 80%.\n\nStudies of these curfews have repeatedly found that they do not reduce crime. US curfews have been imposed on the assumption that restricting young peoples' hours in public will \"limit their opportunities to commit crimes or become victims\", but this objective has not been realised.\n\nA 2016 review of ten studies on the impact of youth curfews in the US since 1960 found they were ineffective in reducing criminal behaviour and victimisation among youth.\n\nIn fact, young people were slightly more likely to commit crime during the curfew hours, compared to the hours when the curfew was not imposed.\n\nSimilarly, victimisation rates were not affected by the curfew. A contemporaneous study of the tightening of Baltimore's youth curfew laws found it \"did not have the desired effect of reducing juvenile crime during curfew hours\", but did have the effect of increasing arrests of young people. Another review in 2018 found the basis for curfews lacked \"empirical\" evidence.\n\nStudies in relation to particular offences, such as knife crimes, also found curfews did not have a significant impact.\n\nThere do not appear to be similar studies on whole-of-population curfews, which is occurring in relation to the Alice Springs curfew. This type of curfew appears unprecedented in its extension to adults.\n\nHowever, it is likely to manifest in a similar way to the curfews that sought to control Aboriginal people. From the experience in Redfern, the overwhelming consequence was an increase in police charges, arrests and violence.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nIn Alice Springs, there are risks for particular groups that are unable to comply with curfew orders. The NT has the highest homeless population in the country, and people who are unable to find shelter outside of the town are likely to be subject to law enforcement.\n\nYoung people who are in the child protection system are also likely to walk the streets at night due to neglect by state agencies, as exposed in the Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory. In addition, people with mental health and trauma needs may be unable to comply with the curfew requirements.\n\nThe curfew approach has high risks for little proven gain. After almost 20 years of top-down punitive interventions in NT Aboriginal communities, since the NT Emergency Response was rolled out in 2007, it is time to critically reflect on this track record.\n\nThe response to the colonial curfews in Alice Springs in the early 20th century was to build Alice Springs town camps that would restrict Aboriginal movement into the CBD after hours. This new curfew policy is repeating a process that has not changed.\n\nAt a time when the NT police is facing intense scrutiny and accusations of a culture of racism, handing executive powers to the NT Police Commissioner to declare curfews is unlikely to improve community safety and may likely increase community tensions.\n\nThalia Anthony receives funding from the Australian Research Council.\n\nJuanita Sherwood does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n\n/Courtesy of The Conversation.

The issues in Alice Springs have been a long time in the making,\" Ms Burney said.\n\nBut Mr Mundine claimed the government was intent on infusing ideology, through the Voice and treaty proposals, into the debate rather than focusing on improving economic development and education.\n\n\"We'd all love to have politics stay out of it,\" he told SkyNews.com.au.\n\n\"We also would love to have people who just have a driven ideological approach to these things also stay out of it as well.\"\n\nMr Mundine's point was echoed by Liberal Senator Kerrynne Liddle who urged the Indigenous Affairs Minister to \"actually focus on the issues that are facing her right now\".\n\nMs Liddle called on Ms Burney to focus on issues plaguing many Indigenous Australians in lower socio-economic areas over those mentioned in the Uluru Statement from the Heart.\n\n\"She needs to stop talking about things like treaty (and) about truth telling while places like Alice Springs, while places like Ceduna and other places ... are dealing with really serious day to day issues,\" she told SkyNews.com.au.\n\n\"They're not talking treaty (and) truth telling. They're talking about dealing with the very issues they deal with on a day-to-day basis. That's what this minister should be focused on.\"\n\nMs Burney also claimed on Tuesday the issues in Alice Springs will \"only be addressed\" by a long-term funding commitment and pointed to the government's four-year $250m pledge to bolster safety in central Australia.\n\n\"The issues in Alice Springs will only be addressed over a long-term funding commitment which we've made from the Federal Government,\" she said.\n\nPressed on if this investment will have substantive impact, Mr Mundine said he was hopeful but did not feel it was likely.\n\n\"I pray to God that it does, but I have my serious doubts about it,\" he said.\n\n\"When we toss lots of money out there what we end up with is a huge bureaucracy, (the) disempowerment of people on the ground and nothing changes.\n\n\"The issue isn't money, the issue is, is it measured, does it have outcomes?\"\n\n\"And I'm sick of tired of hearing about money, just get the job done.\"\n\nThe massive investments into the region needed a microscope put on them, Ms Liddle argued, as she remained concerned about how effective government funds going to these disadvantaged areas were.\n\n\"There needs to be greater transparency,\" the Liberal Senator said.\n\n\"When she holds the purse strings, she makes the decisions about who's funding what. She's accountable. She is the Minister.\"\n\nThe Indigenous Affairs Minister also attacked the 2007 Howard Intervention, arguing it took \"all agency\" away from people and had a knock-on effect on younger generations in Alice Springs.\n\nWhile Ms Burney blamed the intervention, which ended in 2012, Ms Liddle claimed the focus should be on fostering childrens' upbringings to bolster the community rather than the legislation.\n\n\"I'd like the minister and others to stop talking about intervention, treaty and truth telling and start talking about parental responsibility, getting kids into school, actually start making decisions to spend your money on food for children and activities for children rather than other things,\" she said.\n\nClaims of former prime minister John Howard's legislation having a lingering impact on modern youth was reviled by Mr Mundine who criticised Ms Burney's pointing of the finger at the Intervention after calling for politics to stay out of the issue.\n\n\"We had problems before that - talk about getting politics out she's putting politics back in,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not the Howard government's fault, this has been going on in the 1990s, the 1980s, the 1970s and it's been going on ever since.\n\n\"Instead of coming out and pointing at stupid things, why don't we hear exactly how that ($250m) is going to be spent?\"\n\nThe implementation of the curfew itself has been dismissed as a band-aid approach which does not entrench a long-term solution for the embattled town.\n\nCatherine Liddle, the CEO of the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care, called for the curfews to go entirely and claimed they should not be \"part of the policing tool kit\".\n\n\"These sorts of punitive approaches are not sustainable solutions for community or child safety,\" she said in a statement to SkyNews.com.au.\n\n\"The April Alice Springs curfew was a circuit breaker, not a solution. It was enacted in response to escalating issues involving young people, who were not safe and were being exposed to concerning levels of violence.\"\n\nThe political row comes after several police officers were hospitalised in Alice Springs when they were surrounded by a group of youths.\n\n\"One female was pulled to the ground and had her bag stolen, another female was punched in the face and kicked multiple times and had her mobile phone taken while the male was also punched and kicked multiple times,\" a police statement said.\n\nNT Police Minister Brent Potter said it had been a \"horror 72 hours\" in the troubled town, after another officer was run over outside a bottle shop two nights earlier and an alleged stabbing occurred near the main centre in addition to the \"predatory\" attack.\n\nThe curfew began on Monday night and will run until Thursday between the hours 10pm and 6am each day.", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky

But where's the evidence it will actually work to reduce violence?", "body": "University of Technology Sydney provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation AU.\n\nSince early 2023, the Northern Territory and federal governments have been trialling a range of social control measures in Alice Springs (Mparntwe) to address moral panics in relation to youth crime.\n\nThe initial focus was on reinstating restrictive alcohol laws in Aboriginal communities, then more police and funding for prisons, and now curfews.\n\nYesterday, the NT Police Commissioner announced a snap three-day curfew following violent incidents, including off-duty police officers being assaulted.\n\nBut there's little evidence to suggest it will work, either to drive down violent behaviour or to protect the public.\n\nCurfew fears realised\n\nIn January 2023, trailblazing Arrernte midwife Cherisse Buzzacott saw the writing on the wall. She said, \"We fear curfews\". Cherisse grew up during the NT Intervention years and knows what it is like to be an Aboriginal young person surveilled by police and subject to racially discriminatory laws.\n\nBarely a year on from her comments, these fears were realised. In March 2024, the NT government announced a two-week curfew to ban young people from the Alice Springs CBD between 6pm and 6am. This was then extended by a further week.\n\nFollowing advice from the NT Police, the territory government granted powers under the Police Administration Act to declare 72-hour curfews when the police commissioner reasonably believes there is public disorder or a significant risk of it. The commissioner can also request an extension of up to seven days.\n\nUnlike the previous curfew, the new legislation allows for criminal penalties. Non-compliance with curfew orders is a \"strict liability\" criminal offence, which means even if the person honestly believes they are complying, they will be criminalised. The maximum penalty is a fine of A$1,480.\n\nThe NT government suspended the Anti-Discriminatory Act 1992 to enable the enforcement of curfews. This raises a red flag about its potential discriminatory impacts, even though the laws are ostensibly neutral.\n\nThe North Australian Aboriginal Justice Association (NAAJA) has raised concerns about police targeting Aboriginal young people in the enforcement of curfews, and described the curfews as \"racist lockdown laws\".\n\nHistory of curfews, here and abroad\n\nCurfews are not a new government strategy. They have been deployed for decades to restrict the movement and liberties of Aboriginal people in Australia. Curfews were enabled by the Aboriginal Protection Acts - a legislative regime that controlled and segregated Aboriginal people.\n\nIn the NT, Aboriginal people were barred from entering Alice Springs between sunset and sunrise from 1928 to 1964. In Western Australia, curfew laws were passed in 1905 that barred Noongar people from central Perth after 6pm. There were also 9pm curfews on Aboriginal reserves in Queensland.\n\nMore recently in Redfern and surrounding areas in Sydney in the 1960s and '70s, police enforced nightly 10pm curfews on Aboriginal people. The same strategy had been used for slaves across the colonies, including in the United States.\n\nDo curfews increase safety?\n\nThe most rigorous studies in relation to curfews have been undertaken in relation to youth curfews in the US. One study in 1994 showed 77% of large US cities having a curfew policy, and another in 1997 indicated it was as high as 80%.\n\nStudies of these curfews have repeatedly found that they do not reduce crime. US curfews have been imposed on the assumption that restricting young peoples' hours in public will \"limit their opportunities to commit crimes or become victims\", but this objective has not been realised.\n\nA 2016 review of ten studies on the impact of youth curfews in the US since 1960 found they were ineffective in reducing criminal behaviour and victimisation among youth.\n\nIn fact, young people were slightly more likely to commit crime during the curfew hours, compared to the hours when the curfew was not imposed.\n\nSimilarly, victimisation rates were not affected by the curfew. A contemporaneous study of the tightening of Baltimore's youth curfew laws found it \"did not have the desired effect of reducing juvenile crime during curfew hours\", but did have the effect of increasing arrests of young people. Another review in 2018 found the basis for curfews lacked \"empirical\" evidence.\n\nStudies in relation to particular offences, such as knife crimes, also found curfews did not have a significant impact.\n\nThere do not appear to be similar studies on whole-of-population curfews, which is occurring in relation to the Alice Springs curfew. This type of curfew appears unprecedented in its extension to adults.\n\nHowever, it is likely to manifest in a similar way to the curfews that sought to control Aboriginal people. From the experience in Redfern, the overwhelming consequence was an increase in police charges, arrests and violence.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nIn Alice Springs, there are risks for particular groups that are unable to comply with curfew orders. The NT has the highest homeless population in the country, and people who are unable to find shelter outside of the town are likely to be subject to law enforcement.\n\nYoung people who are in the child protection system are also likely to walk the streets at night due to neglect by state agencies, as exposed in the Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory. In addition, people with mental health and trauma needs may be unable to comply with the curfew requirements.\n\nThe curfew approach has high risks for little proven gain. After almost 20 years of top-down punitive interventions in NT Aboriginal communities, since the NT Emergency Response was rolled out in 2007, it is time to critically reflect on this track record.\n\nThe response to the colonial curfews in Alice Springs in the early 20th century was to build Alice Springs town camps that would restrict Aboriginal movement into the CBD after hours. This new curfew policy is repeating a process that has not changed.\n\nAt a time when the NT police is facing intense scrutiny and accusations of a culture of racism, handing executive powers to the NT Police Commissioner to declare curfews is unlikely to improve community safety and may likely increase community tensions.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

If the powers that be believe a curfew is a good way to go then at least that's a good start,\" he said\n\n\"(But) those who choose to disobey the law are going to whether there is a curfew or not.\"\n\nChris - who served 11 years as a police officer in Queensland - said the only way the NT government would be able to get on top of the crime crisis \"crippling Alice Springs\" was by empowering authorities to deal with youth offenders.\n\n\"It really is time that we take the handcuffs off the police and put them on the offenders,\" he said.\n\nThe former Queensland Police sergeant and field training officer said NT officers were \"hamstrung\" and not properly trained to deal with juveniles.\n\n\"They're hamstrung by legislation; they're hamstrung with the results in court; (and) there's not enough facilities to house offenders,\" Chris said.\n\n\"And the other thing is that for whatever reason they choose not to train their police on how to deal with juveniles.\n\n\"I've spoken to police prosecutors, I've spoken to operational police in Alice Springs ad nauseam to gauge their understanding of juvenile offenders, and I really can't get a straight answer on why they're not able to deal with the offenders. I know that they are certainly not trained in that.\"\n\nThe ex-police officer said the Territory government needed to hold a \"serious review\" into the juvenile justice system, covering the powers police have, and the number of correctional facilities.\n\n\"It's very, very lacking in the Northern Territory... in the area of juvenile justice. The Police are just not empowered to appropriately deal with juveniles,\" Chris said.\n\nChris said at the core of the problem was the way the principle of Doli Incapax has been applied in the NT - a legal principle that translates to \"incapable of evil\", which governs whether juvenile offenders can be held criminally responsible.\n\nHe said in Queensland there was a \"robust juvenile justice act\" which allowed police to rebut Doli Incapax by showing the offender knew what they were doing was wrong.\n\n\"If police believe a juvenile has the requisite capacity to know that they have committed an offence then there are very clear guidelines allowing police and empowering police to deal with those juvenile offenders,\" the ex police officer said.\n\n\"We do that in Queensland by simply asking some very simple questions... to determine if they knew what they were doing wrong.\n\n\"(Such as) if a police officer was standing right next to you, would you have done that? If the answer is 'No' then you know that you're on your way to determine that the child has the requisite capacity to know that what they were doing is wrong.\"\n\nHowever, Chris said in the NT, the principle of Doli Incapax was \"basically a blanket law\" in practice.\n\n\"What it has created is a catch-and-release policy with the Police and Juvenile offenders. They literally catch them, determine their age, and drop them home,\" he said.\n\n\"There's no punishment at all. And unfortunately, those offences go unaccounted for.\n\nThe ex-police officer said he knew of situations in the NT where older teens would bring younger kids to help rob houses, getting them to crawl through dog doors or bathroom windows and let the older offenders in.\n\n\"When police turn up - which they often do, because they have an excellent response in Alice... the older kids bolt, leaving the younger kids. and the younger kids get taken home. It's a really, really sad and ineffective cycle,\" he said.\n\nThe father and husband of the two attacked officers said the only way to end this cycle was for the NT government to reform the Youth Justice Act in a way which empowered police. But he said this was unlikely to occur.\n\n\"The NT government needs to empower police to rebut the Doli incapax exculpation under the criminal and allow the police to actually use a robust juvenile Justice Act to deal with juvenile offenders,\" the ex-police officer said.\n\n\"There's a couple of reasons why I personally believe this isn't happening. One is because the Northern Territory government does not have the facilities to deal with juvenile offenders.\n\n\"The second is it's political suicide for any government to start introducing juvenile offenders into their stats because crime stats will go through the roof - we're talking about the majority of offences in Alice Springs being committed by juveniles, next to domestic violence.\n\n\"So there's no political party that's going to want a significant increase in crime on their record.\"", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News Australia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alice Springs"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alice Springs"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory_Police_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory Police Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_delinquency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juvenile delinquency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juvenile court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queensland Police Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory_Government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/6efc4b0b56cfdac1c1f6f9682764434c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712742", "eventUri": "eng-9712742", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

How are they working together? How are they spending the money she's allocated to them?\"\n\nMs Liddle said there had been a lot of announcements of \"big numbers\", but there needed to be some responsibility to ensure the outcomes delivered from the expenditure.\n\n\"We see the minister talking about all sorts of other things, rather than what's happening in Alice Springs or the CDC valuation report,\" she said.\n\nA three-day curfew was triggered for Alice Springs after a group of off duty officers were walking back to their accommodation on Barrett Drive just after 2am when they were allegedly ambushed by a group of 20 males, some of whom were youths.\n\nThe Liberal Senator said the Labor Party had made an \"absolute mess\" of taking away the cashless debit card (CDC) in rural communities, which barred people from accessing cash, alcohol and gambling products.\n\nMore than 17,000 people were on the card across selected areas nationwide including Ceduna, East Kimberley, Goldfields and the Northern Territory in an effort by the Coalition in 2016 to combat crime and antisocial behaviour.\n\nShadow Indigenous Australians minister Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has recently accused the Prime Minister of neglecting Indigenous affairs after the town of Ceduna had to adopt alcohol restrictions following the axing of the CDC trial.\n\nThe Liberal Senator said she had been talking with Senator Price for a \"very long time\" about funding in Indigenous communities and the importance of ensuring the organisations carrying out the services are actually delivering them to a \"very high level\".\n\n\"Because we are talking about very vulnerable people here who are relying on those services, they don't tend to complain very much, so you have to do that little bit of extra work to make sure that those services are doing what they should be doing and more importantly that they are actually working together,\" she said.\n\n\"If they don't work together, understanding how they're going to transition client to a better life, to a better outcome, you just can't keep throwing money at it.\"\n\nMs Liddle said there was a \"very small number of people\" who were likely recidivists and keep committing crimes in Alice Springs while most people wanted to just \"go about their business\" and \"get on with their lives\".\n\nThe shadow child protection minister said she was \"surprised\" law enforcement had made no arrests, days after four off duty police officers were seriously assaulted and hospitalised in Alice Springs when they were surrounded by a group of youths.\n\nMs Liddle, who is from Alice Springs and intended to visit family there later in the week, recalled how in 2022, before she was in parliament, alcohol restrictions were lifted in the Northern Territory.\n\n\"The big issue here is when the alcohol restrictions were lifted in 2022, and there was a very, very slow response from the Australian government to the territory government to demand that those restrictions be put back in,\" she said.\n\n\"I remember, before I came into parliament, watching Northern Territory politicians standing up and saying 'Actually, allowing the rivers of grog to run free were going to be a response to human rights', and I remember thinking to myself 'Wow, what about the human rights to the most vulnerable and those children, where are their voices in all of this?'\"\n\nMs Liddle said the government had to stop treating criminals with \"kid gloves\" and start dealing with them as human beings by addressing their needs and treating any addictions appropriately.\n\n\"The fish rots at the top of the head, and if you're organisation is not governing well, then you then have to ask, what's happening with staffing? What's happening with the service delivery?\" she said.\n\n\"There are some pretty damn good organisations in Alice Springs that do some pretty good work, there's some terrible ones too.\"\n\nOn Tuesday in an ABC Radio interview, Ms Burney said it was \"important\" to \"keep politics out of this\" ad the issues in Alice Springs had been a \"long time in the making\".\n\n\"The issues in Alice Springs will only be addressed over a long-term funding commitment which we've made from the Federal Government,\" she said.\n\nIndigenous advocate Warren Mundine accused Mr Burney of being \"ideological\" and said he was \"sick and tired\" of discussing funding and investment.\n\n\"Just get the job done,\" Mr Mundine told SkyNews.com.au.", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType":

Police said the families were known to each other.\n\nThere are reports they are the same families at the centre of a feud that sparked a three-week curfew in March and April following the death of an 18-year-old man, who had been left trapped under a stolen vehicle.\n\nWhile no-one was injured in the latest clash, weapons including nulla-nullas, spears, a baseball bat and a machete were seized by police.\n\nActing Southern Commander Drew Slape said the \"reprehensible behaviour\" had no place in the community.\n\n\"Our dedicated officers have responded to calls to assist and we will have extra members working tonight, giving up their time off in order to keep Alice Springs residents safe,\" he said.\n\nIt is unknown if the disturbance will extend the curfew.\n\nPolice Minister Brent Potter said the decision to extend the curfew would be made on Thursday morning after he and NT Police Commissioner Michael Murphy had reviewed the \"most up-to-date\" information.\n\nFirefighters have worked through the night battling a blaze at a chemical factory that sent toxic smoke billowing over Melbourne.\n\nThe fire was sparked by a large explosion at the Derrimut factory in the city's west on Wednesday morning.\n\nChemical drums were sent flying into the air at the height of the blaze, making the emergency response more dangerous for firefighters.\n\nNo one was injured and it was declared under control in about four hours, but the fire is expected to burn for days.\n\nFire Rescue Victoria deputy commissioner Michelle Cowling said it was the most significant blaze in Melbourne in recent years and required an aggressive attack.\n\nThe nearby Western Freeway was shut for several hours and thousands of residents were urged to stay indoors because of health risks.\n\n\"Smoke is toxic and will cause damage,\" deputy commissioner Cowling told reporters at the scene.\n\nOne worker died and two were injured in a fire at the same building in October 2023, which was also sparked by an explosion.\n\nAAP\n\nWelcome to our live national news blog. My name is Josefine Ganko, and I'll be at the wheel through the morning.\n\nIt's Thursday, July 11.\n\nBefore we get into it, here's what's making news this morning.\n\nAustralia is the land of the

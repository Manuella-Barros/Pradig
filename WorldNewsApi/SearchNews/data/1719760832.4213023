Credit: Riot Games Riot Games has released the patch notes for Valorant 8.10 and the big focus is on new players coming to the game for the first time, with a new event that is designed for them. For veteran Valorant players there is basically nothing of note in these patch notes, with the only changes to the core of the game coming in the form of two bug fixes. First the issue where shots fired after exiting Cypher\u2019s Spycams wouldn\u2019t do damage has been fixed and then the issue where Clove could restart her ability timer has also been solved. If you\u2019ve already completed the Welcome Contract then there isn\u2019t much else for you in this patch, with a larger one expected in the coming weeks. However, for anyone new to Valorant this set of patch notes is about to make your life a little easier. A new event is being launched, known as the Basic Training event. This is an update to the Welcome Contract that all players are given to complete when they first boot up the game that is designed to help them learn the basics and get some of their first cosmetic unlocks. The updated contract includes clearer missions and milestones for players to complete, as well as improved guidance on all things Valorant. However, the rewards remain the same, so you won\u2019t miss out on anything if you have already completed the Welcome Contract when you first started. While Valorant is not a difficult game to get into compared to Riot\u2019s other major title; League of Legends, getting some extra guidance for new players is never a bad thing and should hopefully lead to fewer players dropping out in their first few hours with Valorant.

While Valorant is still in a good place generally right now, it would be nice to have a bit more being changed to keep things fresh. With League of Legends getting significant patches every two weeks without fail, it\u2019s a little disappointing to see Valorant go much longer without significant changes or additions. With less than a month to go until the current act is due to end we should start to see some larger updates in the next few weeks, but until then we will likely have to keep playing the same version of Valorant that we have been for the past month or so.

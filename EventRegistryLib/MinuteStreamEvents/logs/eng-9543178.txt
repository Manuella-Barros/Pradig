The Urus SE offers 789 hp, a speed up to 194 MPH, and 37.28 miles in all-electric mode, maintaining its reputation as the fastest production SUV in the world. The sleek Urus SE features exterior and interior updates, a redesigned steering wheel, and a larger 12.3-inch infotainment screen.\n\nThe automotive industry is clearly still hot in its initiatives towards electrification, particularly in the mainstream and premium markets. Supercar and hypercar manufacturers, however, such as Ferrari and Lamborghini, have both been putting off electrification efforts as both companies are still trying to figure out their next steps, mainly because going electric on a Ferrari or a Lamborghini means doing away with their signature and sonorous internal combustion powerplants. When it comes to these Italian thoroughbreds, taking away their iconic gas engines is like taking away the sun on a summer beach holiday -- in which case, what's the point?\n\nRelated Lamborghini Urus SE Unveiled As The World's First Plug-In Hybrid Super SUV More potent than the Urus, the new 788-hp Lamborghini Urus SE plug-in hybrid super SUV features exterior and interior elements found in the Revuelto\n\nWith demand for pure electric vehicles cooling for the time being, however, automakers recently shifted their focus to gas-electric hybrid and plug-in alternatives as the next viable step towards full electrification. Because Lamborghinis are all about the theater and pantomime produced from their outrageously powerful and symphonically rambunctious internal combustion engines, they chose to pursue the gas-electric hybrid route route. The result: the world's first-ever plug-in electric hybrid Lamborghini SUV, the 2025 Urus SE.\n\nIt originally debuted at the 2024 Beijing Auto Show last week in China. But for the first time, the Urus SE made its first appearance on North American shores at an exclusive premiere event at the Lamborghini Lounge in New York City.\n\nPart Deux of Lamborghini's Direzione Cor Tauri 2.0 Strategy\n\nClose\n\nTo give us a better close-up look at all the changes with the 2025 Lamborghini Urus SE, we scored a chance to connect with Chief Marketing and Sales Officer, Federico Doschini, who gave us a personal walkaround of the new Urus SE and what it means for the Sant'Agata Bolognese-based automaker. Foschini, spoke of the importance of Urus to Lamborghini's portfolio, particularly when it came to boosting overall sales, and he's confident that the new Urus SE will continue that success.\n\nIt's also the second step in its new electrification strategy as it continues being implemented into production. The first step was the introduction of the Aventador-replacing Revuetlo and its plug-in hybridized V-12.\n\n\"The Urus SE is a continuation of the legacy of the Urus, this car is the second step of our Direzione Cor Tauri 2.0 strategy, we are aiming to transform all the portfolio to hybrids. We started first with the Revuelto last year and here, we have the first Urus hybrid,\" Foschini, explained as he walked us around the Urus SE.\n\nAt first looks wthout casually hunting for the differences, it seems like much hasn't changed with the new Urus and well, hasn't. Apart from some subtle interior and exterior revisions that constitute a midcycle refresh, the biggest party piece for the Urus SE is its all-new plug-in hybrid powertrain. It's the first-ever ultra-high-performance plug-in-hybrid SUV and Lamborghini's second hybrid model, behind the Aventador-replacing Revuelto.\n\nThe hybridization of the Urus is part of Lamborghini's latest Direzione Cor Tauri 2.0 strategy, which is profile name for the automaker's latest intiatives towards electrification. While not after a fully-electrified propulsion system, Lamborghini is still sticking to good 'ol classic internal combustion because doing away with the happy and fun noises that their engines are most known for takes away more than half of what makes a Lamborghini, a Lamborghini.\n\n\"Urus was a game changer for Lamborghini since its market introduction in 2018. The Urus was not only something that was increasing sales for the company, up to 10,212 units last year, it was also a way to interpret the brand in a different product. It's conquesting a lot of new customers, to the brand Lamborghini,\" Foschini continued.\n\nNew Looks, New Electrically Boosted Heart\n\nIn the new Urus SE's case, it retains its gas-powered thundering ocho, an Audi-sourced twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter EA825 V-8. Minor revisions to account for the addition of an electric motor inside the transmission bellhousing means its output is adjusted to produce 608 horsepower. With a new permanent-magnet synchronous electric motor integrated inside the ZF-sourced eight-speed automatic, the Urus SE can gain up to 181 additional horses under full load. The extra electricity juice from an on-board 25-kilowatt/hour lithium-ion battery, total output now registers at 789 hp. In comparison, the standard Urus S churns out 620 horsepower.\n\nThe result is a manufacturer claimed 0-60 time of just 3.4 seconds and onto a top speed of 194 MPH, just a tick under the Urus S's 3.5 seconds and a hair faster than the S's 190 MPH top speed. Which means, the Urus is still retains its title as the world's fastest production SUV. On top of the extra power, the electric motor can also propel the Urus SE for up to 37.28 miles in all-electric mode. Lamborghini didn't have any specifics in terms of charging rates.\n\nThe changes are more than skin deep as the 2025 Urus SE also debuts some visual updates to the exterior and interior, mainly with the front and rear bumpers, headlights, taillights, as well as a relocation of the rear license plate area to just above the redesigned lower rear diffuser. As such, Urus SE's trunk section appears cleaner and less busy than the original Urus' rear-end.\n\nThe revised rear diffuser, complemented by a more pronounced trunk-mounted rear-spoiler, is said to produce 35% more rear downforce at higher speeds, particularly when compared to the Urus S. From behind the wheel, that translates to better high-speed stability. Up front, the newer bumper features larger air intake ducts that reportedly increase cooling airflow into the engine bay by over 15% in the previous Urus, according to Lamborghini.\n\nThe headlights are thinner and sleeker, featuring new daytime-running LED lights shaped to supposedly resemble the tail of the Lamborghini's raging bull on its insignia. The Urus SE's headlights take inspiration from the design elements on the Revuelto supercar that came before it.\n\nRelated Here's Why A Lamborghini Urus Plug-In Hybrid Makes Sense Lamborgini's best-selling car could outlive all of its rivals with the help of electric power.\n\nMore Power and More Screen\n\nClose\n\nInterior revisions are also equally subtle, with a redesigned steering wheel and a larger, 12.3-inch infotainment screen for the Lamborghini Infotainment System on the center console. Dubbed the Human Machine Interface or HMI, the new, larger screen benefits from revised graphics and fonts and updates to the graphical user interfaces as well.\n\nBecause of the added weight of the battery pack, which sits in the trunk floor area just above the rear axle, engineers had to significantly rework the suspension to keep ride and handling up to spec. While there are no electric motors on the axles, the motor itself is integrated into the transmission internally between the flywheel and main input shaft. While the additional motor plus the added battery pack do add a considerable amount of weight, Lamborghini also says that the Urus SE's weight-to-power ratio remains greater than the Urus S's, a superlative likely attributed to the SE's extra power.\n\n\"Unveiling the latest iteration of the Urus Super SUV, our top-selling model, in New York, has been a profound moment for us and we are honored to celebrate this milestone with customers and friends at the Lamborghini Lounge,\" Lamborghini CEO, Stephan Winkelmann, said in a press statement. \"The Urus SE epitomizes our brand's DNA and philosophy, excelling in both driving enjoyment and dynamic performance. SUVs are in high demand in the U.S. market, so as we continue down the path to electrification, it is vital that we provide our customers with a fun-to-drive hybrid that can also meet their everyday needs.\"", "source": {"uri": "hotcars.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotCars"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

Yes, we know it's not the Urus that is on everyone's lips these days. That would be the SE, if you missed it, which is a plug-in hybrid version and the punchiest member of the family. However, you shouldn't confuse punchy with fast, as the Performante is still the most agile variant.\n\nThe renowned tuner has done a great job with this Lamborghini Urus S. The vehicle features the usual add-ons on the outside and a few other bits and bobs, and it looks quite good, especially with a gold touch and several blacked-out elements, doesn't it?\n\nIf you look at the front bumper, you will see a few inserts, including that fresh chin spoiler attached to it. Novitec has also made the exotic crossover look more muscular by giving it fender flares and a pair of new side skirts linking the front and rear wheel arches together.\n\nFor a more menacing appearance, the stock hood was replaced with a new one that has a vented design. The front fender trim carries over, and from what we can tell, the mirror caps were replaced. This Urus S sports additional upgrades at the rear, like the more pronounced tailgate spoiler, a roof wing, and a different diffuser.\n\nPhoto: Instagram | novitecgroup New tailpipes with a rectangular shape are also visible out back, and the new Y-spoke alloys contribute to the aftermarket makeover. The fresh wheels have a center-locking design, and the Raging Bull logo is on them. They sport Pirelli P Zero tires, just like the OEM wheels, and have a black finish, which works perfectly with the vehicle's golden exterior and black accents.\n\nSeveral aftermarket components have a naked carbon fiber look, and a single image of the interior the tuner released on social media shows what appears to be new trim on the dashboard. Elsewhere, this vehicle appears to carry over with the same stuff as the stock one, and that likely includes the power, too, as there is no reference to the V8 motor.\n\nAlbeit two-tenths of a second slower than the Performante, the Lamborghini Urus S utilizes the same engine in the same configuration. The 4.0L twin-turbo V8 develops 657 hp (666 ps/490 kW). The thrust is rated at 627 pound-foot (850 Nm) of torque, and from 0 to 62 mph (0 to 100 kph), it needs 3.5 seconds. That's one-tenth slower than the new Urus SE (PHEV). Keep the right pedal pinned to the floor, and the model will keep pushing up to 190 mph (305 kph).\n\nThe Urus S starts at the equivalent of $245,000 in the United States and just under \u20ac200,000 (~$213,500) in Europe.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Novitec Group (@novitecgroup)", "source": {"uri": "autoevolution.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "autoevolution"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cristian_gnaticov@autoevolution.com", "name": "Cristian Gnaticov", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Urus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamborghini Urus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spoiler (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in hybrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_(vehicle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fender (vehicle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_tuning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car tuning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novitec_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novitec Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumper_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bumper (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trunk (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alloy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhaust system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuser_(automotive)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diffuser (automotive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centerlock_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centerlock wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound-foot_(torque)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound-foot (torque)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirelli", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pirelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-turbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twin-turbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/widebody-novitec-esteso-hopes-you-ll-forget-about-the-lamborghini-urus-se-233325_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543178", "eventUri": "eng-9543178", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

However, while most fat copies are part of the pre-facelifted iteration, this one is a Performante, and according to the Italian car marque, it is the most agile version of the series. Don't mistake agile for powerful, as the latter role goes to the recently unveiled Urus SE. The plug-in hybrid enjoys a combined 701 pound-foot (950 Nm) of torque and 789 horsepower (800 ps/588 kW) produced by its 4.0L twin-turbo V8 and electric motor. It needs 3.4 seconds to 62 mph (100 kph) and has a maximum speed of 194 mph (312 kph).\n\nBy comparison, the Urus Performante's non-electrified 4.0L V8 develops 657 hp (666 ps/490 kW) and 627 lb-ft (850 Nm). The Raging Bull says the track-focused version is one-tenth quicker to 62 mph compared to the SE, and while it may be more agile, it has a lower top speed of 190 mph (306 kph). The Urus S is as powerful as the Performante and two-tenths of a second slower.\n\nNow that we've reminded ourselves about the oily bits let's see what this Lamborghini Urus Performante is all about. First and foremost, it is a widebody proposal with fender extensions at the front and rear. It has a chunkier apron attached to the bumper, new side skirts, a four-fin diffuser, and a few other attachments here and there. The tailgate spoiler and roof-mounted wing appear to be the stock components, and so do the side mirror casings.\n\nPhoto: Instagram | 1016industries A set of 24-inch alloys feel the arches perfectly. The new wheels have a lot of concavity, and they sport a Y-spoke pattern that suits any Lamborghini. The Raging Bull's emblem is visible on the center caps, and this Urus Performante has red brake calipers. In fact, the Lambo logos and these red touches are the only parts contrasting the satin-black look of the exotic crossover, with the add-ons sporting a naked carbon fiber design for a sportier stance.\n\nSpeaking of the stance, we should also tell you that this modified high-rider sits a bit closer to the ground. This move, alongside the large alloys wrapped in rubber band tires, has likely made it stiffer and, therefore, less comfortable compared to a stock Urus Performante. On the plus side, it should be able to tackle corners faster, so if its owner had this on their bucket list, then they could tick it.\n\nNow, not everyone is a Lamborghini Urus fan (I am not), but we've got to admit that there is something very fighter jet-ish about this tuned copy that makes it more appealing in our eyes. We're confident that you feel the same way, don't you?

This event took place in New York at the Lamborghini Lounge NYC, nestled within the Chelsea Arts District, on 30 April 2024. The occasion was graced by Stephan Winkelmann, Chairman and CEO, alongside Rouven Mohr, Chief Technical Officer, and Federico Foschini, Chief Marketing and Sales Officer. The trio welcomed esteemed guests including long-time customers, VIPs, and members of the media to celebrate this landmark moment.\n\nWinkelmann expressed his enthusiasm about the Urus SE's debut in the United States, emphasizing its alignment with Lamborghini's brand ethos and its appeal in the SUV-centric U.S. market. The Urus SE not only encapsulates driving pleasure but also showcases dynamic performance, meeting the everyday needs of customers with its hybrid functionality.\n\nThe Urus SE was first introduced at the Beijing Auto Show on 24 April 2024 as the most potent version of Lamborghini's best-selling model. It is equipped with a twin-turbo 4.0 V8 engine paired with a 25-kWh lithium-ion battery, delivering an impressive total output of 800 CV (789 horsepower). This power enables the Urus SE to accelerate from 0 to 62 mph in just 3.4 seconds and reach a top speed of 194 mph. Additionally, it features a permanent-magnet synchronous electric motor integrated into the 8-speed automatic transmission, allowing for a purely electric 4WD capability over distances exceeding 37.28 miles in EV mode.\n\nThis launch is part of Lamborghini's Direzione Cor Tauri 2.0 strategy, which aims at electrifying its range as a step towards decarbonization -- a journey that began with the introduction of the Revuelto2 in March 2023. By the end of 2024, this electrification initiative will expand with the introduction of another High Performance Electrified Vehicle (HPEV), set to replace the Hurac\u00e1n.\n\nIn terms of sales performance, Lamborghini continues to break records in North America, its largest market. The company delivered 3,465 cars across the Americas in 2023, with global sales of the Urus increasing from 5,367 units in 2022 to 6,087 units in 2023. The Hurac\u00e1n also saw a significant sales increase, with 3,962 cars delivered compared to 3,113 in the previous year. Customers are expected to start receiving their Urus SE vehicles by the end of 2024.\n\nThe Urus SE represents a significant step forward in Lamborghini's commitment to innovation and sustainability. As it moves towards electrification and decarbonization, Lamborghini continues to redefine performance and luxury in the automotive industry.", "source": {"uri": "drivespark.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "drivespark.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "irwin_mills@drivespark.com", "name": "Irwin Mills", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Urus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamborghini Urus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamborghini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephan_Winkelmann", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stephan Winkelmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in hybrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Synchronous motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auto China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automatic transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-turbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twin-turbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lithium-ion battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-depleting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charge-depleting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Salesmanship", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Salesmanship", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.drivespark.com/img/2024/05/lamborghini-urus-se-1714504715529-1200x675_temp.jpg?03052024190154", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543178", "eventUri": "eng-9543178", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Under the Direzione Cor Tauri product strategy plan, the Italian company also confirmed the debut of a successor to the Huracan sometime in 2024. Not even four months later, the Volkswagen Group-controlled marque has clarified what's in the offing for the Huracan's replacement. As per the Q1 2024 release attached below, \"the presentation of the hybrid heir to the Huracan\" will be \"in the second half of the year.\" In other words, the yet-unnamed supercar will join the Urus SE as a 2025 model.\n\nBefore going over the finer details, let us talk about Q1 2024 results for a moment. Automobili Lamborghini delivered 2,630 vehicles in the first quarter, which represents the best-ever sales quarter in Lamborghini's history. Of said new vehicle sales, the US market accounted for 856 and EMEA (i.e., Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) for 1,278 vehicles.\n\nThe automaker from Sant'Agata Bolognese has also reported that Revuelto is - no surprises here - sold out well into 2026. The lineup will certainly include a spider variant by then. Lastly, the Raging Bull says that order banks for the Huracan and Urus S/Urus Performante are full till end of production.\n\nTurning our attention back to the sub-Revuelto supercar with hybrid assistance, Lamborghini claims that \"a new hybrid powertrain\" is on the menu. Rather than a free-breathing V12 aided by a selection of electric drive units, the newcomer has been spied on video making twin-turbo V8 sounds.\n\nPhoto: Baldauf There is a wild rumor according to which the V8 in question spins to 10,000 revolutions per minute. Said rumor also suggests a pair of turbos do not reach full boost until 7,000 revolutions per minute. Wishful thinking best describes the aforementioned numbers, more so if you remember that Revuelto's naturally aspirated V12 revs to 9,500 revolutions per minute. Coincidentally, the 812 Superfast-replacing Ferrari 12Cilindri also takes 9,500 rpm.\n\nAs for turbos coming alive so late, that defeats the purpose of turbocharging an engine. A relatively narrow peak torque is detrimental to acceleration, be it from a standstill or at speed. There's also talk about said engine being unrelated to the Porsche-Audi V8 of the Urus, although that's harder to disprove. On the one hand, Lamborghini has developed a Revuelto-specific V12 engine. But on the other hand, pouring millions over millions of euros into a different V8 from the Porsche-Audi unit would be a waste of money on the Volkswagen Group's behalf.\n\nA derivative of said engine, however, seems to be most plausible. Codenamed LB63x and potentially dubbed Temerario, the Huracan-replacing model has no direct rivals to be worried about. Both Ferrari and McLaren offer plug-in hybrid twin-turbo V6 supercars in the form of the 296 and the Artura, with the former packing 819 electrified ponies. The Urus SE makes 789 horsepower, meaning that Lamborghini could easily push the LB63x/Temerario beyond 800 mechanical ponies.\n\nBuilt around a carbon-fiber tub derived from that of the Revuelto, the heavily anticipated supercar could further differentiate itself from the 296 and the Artura by means of all-wheel drive. But rather than the Huracan's electronically controlled AWD coupling, an electric motor - or two - will power the front wheels. Out back, one can make a case for a third motor positioned above the dual-clutch tranny. In the Revuelto, said box is an eight-speed unit mounted transversely behind the powerplant.", "source": {"uri": "autoevolution.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "autoevolution"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mircea_panait@autoevolution.com", "name": "Mircea Panait", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Urus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamborghini Urus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamborghini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_per_minute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Revolutions per minute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sant'Agata_Bolognese", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sant'Agata Bolognese"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sant'Agata Bolognese"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raging_Bull_(roller_coaster)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Raging Bull (roller coaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in hybrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Model year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V12_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "V12 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naturally aspirated engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-turbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twin-turbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/lamborghini-confirms-hybrid-assistance-for-the-huracan-s-heir-will-debut-later-this-year-233508_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543178", "eventUri": "eng-9543178", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

As I slipped into the driver's seat of this roaring V12 SUV, I anticipated an adventure that transcended mere transportation - and boy, was I right.\n\nFrom the first purr of its engine, the Urus Performante set the streets ablaze with its presence. Its sleek curves and commanding posture turned heads at every corner, drawing admiring glances from onlookers. But it wasn't just about the aesthetics; this machine was about to ignite a firestorm of excitement.\n\nAs we ventured into the labyrinthine streets of the city, the Urus Performante effortlessly fused performance with comfort. Amidst the urban chaos, the cabin became a sanctuary of opulence, enveloping us in luxury while the city buzzed outside. It was a testament to Lamborghini's mastery of blending high-octane power with everyday practicality.\n\nBut it wasn't until we hit the open road that the Urus Performante truly revealed its magic. With a flick of a switch, I unleashed the full fury of its V12 engine, sending us hurtling forward with electrifying velocity. The acceleration was intoxicating, igniting a rush of adrenaline that left us breathless.\n\nYet, what truly distinguished the Urus Performante was its ability to spread joy like wildfire. As we roared down the avenues, bystanders couldn't help but stop and stare, their faces lighting up with awe and envy. It was as if the Urus Performante possessed a gravitational pull, drawing smiles from all who beheld its magnificence.\n\nAnd then there were the children - innocent souls whose eyes sparkled with wonder as we passed by. With the windows rolled down, they leaned out of passing cars, their faces beaming with unbridled delight. It was a moment of pure, unadulterated joy - a reminder that the Urus Performante wasn't just a car; it was a catalyst for happiness.\n\nIn Corsa mode, the Urus Performante transformed into a symphony of speed, dancing through the streets with grace and precision. It hugged the curves like a seasoned dancer, leaving a trail of awe in its wake. Yet, in Strada mode, it morphed into a gentle giant, gliding through traffic with the poise of a luxury sedan.\n\nBut perhaps the most remarkable feat of all was the Urus Performante's ability to conquer any terrain with ease. With its advanced all-wheel-drive system and adaptive suspension, it tackled everything from snow-covered streets to rocky terrain with unparalleled confidence. It was a testament to Lamborghini's unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of automotive excellence.\n\nAll in all, I couldn't help but marvel at the joy that the Urus Performante had brought to everyone it touched.

It'd be even wilder if it were alone in the market, but it was actually one of the last luxury performance brands to introduce such a model.\n\nFerrari did the SUV thing right, with a big V-12 and sleek sheet metal. But is that enough to claim the crown as the quickest SUV in a quarter-mile drag race? A new video from Carwow begins the quest to find out by pitting it against the Lamborghini Urus.\n\nThe Ferrari's naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V-12 engine makes 725 horsepower and 527 pound-feet of torque. The Urus has a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V-8 engine that produces 666 horsepower, less than the Ferrari, but it has more torque -- 626 lb ft. The Lamborghini has all-wheel drive, just like the Ferrari, and it's a bit heavier than the Ferrari: 4,740 pounds vs 4,482 lbs.\n\nQuarter-mile drag races revealed the two SUVs were quite evenly matched despite their differences. The Urus often got the better start, but the Purosangue would reel it in by the finish line, making for some close finishes. The Ferrari won two out of the three races, but each completed the quarter-mile in the same 11.9 seconds.\n\nThe Ferrari struggled in the first rolling race with the gearboxes in automatic mode. The Purosangue came to life in the remaining races when the driver could manually shift the gears, taking easy victories in the remaining runs down the track.\n\nFerrari isn't eager to bolster its sales with an SUV. It's deliberately limiting Purosangue production to just 20 percent of its annual output, keeping the model exclusive and expensive without letting it dominate sales or dilute its identity. Lamborghini achieved a record sales year in 2023, led by the Urus, which accounted for the majority of the car's sales.\n\nWhich would you rather have?

The first quarter of the year saw the company achieving its highest-ever quarterly deliveries, with a total of 2,630 cars delivered to customers. This performance underscores the brand's robust financial health and strategic prowess, with a turnover of \u20ac691 million and an operating profit of \u20ac187 million, resulting in a profitability rate of 27.0%.\n\nStephan Winkelmann, Chairman and CEO of Automobili Lamborghini, expressed optimism about the company's direction and its alignment with the positive forecasts for 2024. Winkelmann highlighted the significance of the recent launch of the Urus SE and the anticipation surrounding the hybrid successor to the Hurac\u00e1n, set for unveiling in the latter half of the year. These milestones are pivotal in Lamborghini's ongoing growth trajectory and its commitment to product innovation.\n\nThe United States continues to be Lamborghini's largest market, despite a slight decrease in deliveries during the first quarter. However, the company's performance across different regions remains strong, with deliveries in EMEA (1,278 cars), Americas (856 cars), and APAC (496 cars) showcasing Lamborghini's global appeal.\n\nPaolo Poma, Managing Director and CFO of Automobili Lamborghini, remarked on the stability shown in the first quarter's figures and the solid order book that positions the company well for meeting its 2024 targets. The sustained order intake not only reflects confidence in Lamborghini's future projects but also promises further growth throughout the year.\n\nThe resilience of Lamborghini's brand is evident in its strategic decisions for 2024, including efforts to rebalance deliveries across all quarters for a more uniform distribution throughout the year. The strong demand for models such as Revuelto and Hurac\u00e1n -- both boasting extensive lead times -- and full coverage of orders for the Urus S and Performante until their production ends, highlights Lamborghini's enduring appeal.\n\nWith the introduction of the Urus SE, Lamborghini's first hybrid super SUV, at the onset of Q2 2024, the company is poised for continued success. This launch not only marks a significant step towards achieving Lamborghini's ambitious goals but also reflects its commitment to innovation and sustainability within the luxury automotive sector.", "source": {"uri": "drivespark.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "drivespark.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "irwin_mills@drivespark.com", "name": "Irwin Mills", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamborghini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephan_Winkelmann", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stephan Winkelmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sant'Agata_Bolognese", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sant'Agata Bolognese"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sant'Agata Bolognese"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Urus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lamborghini Urus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Atl\u00e9tico_Hurac\u00e1n", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Couriers_and_Messengers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Couriers and Messengers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit_Cars_and_Replicas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit Cars and Replicas", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic Management", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.drivespark.com/img/2024/05/lamborghini-1715009458873-1200x675_temp.jpg?06052024210544", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543178", "eventUri": "eng-9543178", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

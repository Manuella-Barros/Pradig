Pararescuemen with the US Air Force's 920th Rescue Wing lifted a passenger, who was in 'critical' condition, from the deck of the 1,000ft Carnival Venezia on May 4.\n\nDramatic footage shows how two helicopters approached the ship to execute the extraction before the rescuers were hoisted down and immediately began preparing the cruise traveler. The unnamed patient and his mother were then hauled up into the helicopter, where he received treatment while en route to a hospital in the US. His current condition remains unknown.\n\nThe Carnival Venezia had set sail from New York on April 26 on a 10-day cruise to the Bahamas and Caribbean. The rescue team underwent three helicopter air-to-air refuelings before it reached the vessel's remote location in the Atlantic Ocean. The operation saw the 920th Rescue Wing dispatch a rescue force consisting of two HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters, two HC-130J Combat King II aircraft and two teams of combat rescue officers and pararescuemen to the cruiseliner.\n\n'Everyone in the wing mobilized with exceptional speed,' Capt. Dylan Gann, 301st Rescue Squadron pilot, recalled of the mission. 'By uniting our efforts, we saved crucial time, delivering life-saving assistance six hours ahead of other response teams.'\n\nWhen the mission commander arrived on location, the two HC-130J search and rescue planes circled the airspace to assess the situation and assumed on-scene command. The two HH-60s approached the ship, the pararescuemen were hoisted down and began preparing the passenger and his mother for the rescue. The duo were then lifted up into the helicopter.\n\nMeanwhile, a team at the home station coordinated with flight doctors to find the right treatment facility for the patient. The information was relayed to the rescue force who then made sure the patient was 'successfully transferred' to the hospital.\n\n'This is what ready now looks like,' Lt. Col. John Lowe, 920th Operations Group commander, said. 'These real-world missions are what our countless hours of training have prepared us for.

Go ahead and Subscribe here.\n\nShowing what the US Air Force is capable of, the 920th Rescue Wing (RQW) of the Air Force successfully executed a high-stakes medical evacuation from a cruise ship over 350 nautical miles off the eastern coast of the United States.\n\nOn May 4, 2024, the 920th Rescue Wing, Air Force Reserve Command's only combat search and rescue wing, received an urgent request for assistance. A medical emergency onboard the cruise ship Carnival Venezia necessitated the patient to be taken off the ship and brought to shore to receive the type of care not available onboard.\n\nCarnival Venezia had set sail from New York on April 26 for a 10-day cruise to the Bahamas and the Caribbean. After calls to Nassau, Half Moon Cay, Grand Turk, and Amber Cove, the ship was underway to homeport New York when an emergency happened onboard, forcing the Captain to make a call for help.\n\nThe Air Force 920th Rescue Wing answered the call. The wing is trained and equipped to locate and recover U.S. Armed Forces personnel during both peacetime and wartime, while this is not necessarily what you would associate with a guest onboard a cruise ship, the service men and women stepped up anyway.\n\nBased at Patrick Space Force Base in Florida, Air Force personnel quickly assembled a comprehensive rescue force comprising two HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters, two HC-130J Combat King II aircraft, and expert teams of combat rescue officers and pararescuemen.\n\nCaptain Dylan Gann of the 301st Rescue Squadron, who piloted one of the rescue helicopters: \"Everyone in the wing mobilized with exceptional speed. By uniting our efforts, we saved crucial time, delivering life-saving assistance six hours ahead of other response teams. Our collective determination and efficiency ensured the successful rescue and transport of the individual in need.\"\n\nThe entire rescue mission became a combined effort by pilots of the two helicopters and airplanes, weather experts back at the base to plot the best possible route, and flight doctors to find the right treatment facility for the patient\n\nAccording to the 920th Rescue Wing, one of the most challenging aspects of the mission was the need for multiple helicopter air-to-air refuelings due to the distance between the vessel and the Air Force Base. At 350 nautical miles or 403 land miles, Carnival Venezia was out of reach of the safe flying distance that an HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopter can do.\n\nA Helicopter Air-to-Air Refueling (HAAR) involves a probe from the helicopter connecting to a drogue on the HC-130J aircraft, allowing the transfer of fuel mid-flight. This technique is important to ensure the helicopters can operate for extended periods over open water.\n\nUpon reaching the Carnival Venezia, the mission commander assessed the situation while two HC-130Js circled overhead. The HH-60s approached the ship and lowered pararescuemen to prepare the patient and his mother for evacuation. The patient received immediate medical attention in the helicopter and while underway to the hospital.\n\nLieutenant Colonel John Lowe, commander of the 920th Operations Group: \"This is what ready now looks like. These real-world missions are what our countless hours of training have prepared us for. Rescue was able to plan and execute this mission without hesitation.\"\n\n\"This combined arms team is highly trained in their field while understanding what role they play in the bigger picture and led to the successful completion of the mission.\"\n\nThe two helicopters and the two support aircraft flew over 1200 nautical miles to ensure the Carnival Venezia guest reached safety and received the medical care needed.\n\nThe fact that the guest was saved, is a feat in itself. While the US Coast Guard is known to perform medivacs from cruise ships regularly, this is typically done much closer to land. With the distance from land, the 920th Rescue Wing proved to be more than capable of fulfilling the role.\n\nCarnival Venezia returned to New York City on May 6 and has since set sail on her next voyage, an 11-night cruise to St. Thomas, San Juan, Grand Turk, Amber Cove, and Half Moon Cay.", "source": {"uri": "cruisehive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cruise Hive"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The rescue from a cruise ship sailing off the Atlantic coast involved a child with a medical emergency.\n\nThe 920th Rescue Wing said it successfully conducted the civilian medical airlift operation of a patient aboard the Carnival Venezia while the cruise ship was more than 350 nautical miles off the East Coast on Saturday.\n\nThe rescue involved a child with a medical condition and the child's mother. Details about the patient were not disclosed.\n\nIn a statement from the 920th Rescue Wing at Patrick Space Force Base, officials said that, within hours of receiving the call for assistance, the 920th Rescue Wing prepared and launched a rescue force consisting of two HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters, two HC-130J Combat King II aircraft and two teams of combat rescue officers and pararescuemen to fly to the cruise ship. The personnel safely removed the patient from the ship for transport to a medical center.\n\nWhen the mission commander arrived on location, two HC-130J aircraft circled the airspace to assess the situation and assumed on-scene command. Then, HH-60 helicopters approached the ship to execute the rescue.\n\nOfficials said pararescue personnel were hoisted down, and immediately began preparing the patient. Then the patient and his mother were hoisted up into the helicopter, where the boy received medical attention while on route to a hospital.\n\n\"Everyone in the wing mobilized with exceptional speed,\" said Capt.

Those refuelings involve connecting a probe from the helicopter to a drogue on the HC-130J aircraft, allowing fuel transfer mid-flight.\n\nOfficials said, as part of this mission, the wing assembled an operations center battle staff to coordinate all aspects of the rescue. This included everything from personnel to monitor weather in the rescue zone to flight doctors used to find the right treatment facility for the patient. The information was transmitted to the rescue force while they were on the way to the scene.\n\nThey said the mission encompassed more than eight hours, with the patient successfully transferred to a hospital in the United States.\n\nIn commenting on the rescue, Lt. Col. John Lowe, 920th Operations Group commander, said: \"This is what ready now looks like. These real-world missions are what our countless hours of training have prepared us for.

The operation involved two HC-130J Combat King II aircraft and two HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters along with combat rescue officers and pararescuemen. The successful mission required complex mid-flight helicopter refuelings, hoist operations, and swift teamwork to transport the patient to the nearest medical center. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe United States Air Force once again demonstrated that fighting is not the only role of the organization. On Saturday, two HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters and two HC-130J Combat King 11 aircraft conducted a rescue mission to airlift a mother and her child by helicopter from a Carnival Cruise Line ship. The United States Air Force has a particular billet called pararescue specializing in rescuing both military and civilians in need.\n\nA dramatic Air Force rescue\n\nThe Air Force 920th Rescue Wing (RQW) released a statement stating it had successfully conducted a civilian medical airlift operation more than 350 nautical miles off the East Coast. The operation took place on May 4 and successfully extracted a critical patient aboard a cruise ship (the Carnival Venezia).\n\nPhoto: 920th RQW\n\nThe 920th RQW stated it responded to the emergency call within hours and launched a rescue force comprising two HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters, two HC-130J Combat King II aircraft, and two teams of combat rescue officers and pararescuemen. They took the patient to the nearest capable medical center.\n\nIt was a complicated operation that required three helicopter-air-to-air refuelings. The HC-130J provided the helicopters with mid-flight refueling. The 920th RQW states as the helicopters approached the cruise liner, the pararescuemen were hoisted down and then hoisted up the patient and his mother into the helicopter. The child received medical attention en-route to the hospital in the United States.\n\nRelated Australia Lands Airbus A319 In Antarctica For Rescue Mission\n\nA successful rescue\n\n\"Everyone in the wing mobilized with exceptional speed. By uniting our efforts, we saved crucial time, delivering life-saving assistance six hours ahead of other response teams. Our collective determination and efficiency ensured the successful rescue and transport of the individual in need,\" said Capt. Dylan Gann, 301st Rescue Squadron pilot.\n\nAfter eight hours and over 1,000 miles flown, the 920th concluded the mission and the aircraft returned to Patrick Space Force Base in Florida. While the mission was deemed a success, it is unclear what manner of medical emergency the child suffered. The child's present condition is also unclear.\n\nThe 920th Rescue Wing\n\nThe 920th Rescue Wing is the only combat search and rescue wing of the Air Force Reserve Command. Its main mission is to plan, lead, and conduct military rescue operations as well as to deny competitors and adversaries exploitation of isolated personnel. The 920th provides rescue for civilians in distress at sea, in the desert, or in mountains. It also provides worldwide humanitarian reliefs in the aftermath of disasters like floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes.\n\nPhoto: 920th RQW\n\nThis may have been one of the last hurrays of the HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters as they are in the process of being replaced by the new HH-60W Jolly Green II.

By uniting our efforts, we saved crucial time, delivering life-saving assistance six hours ahead of other response teams. Our collective determination and efficiency ensured the successful rescue and transport of the individual in need,\" said Capt. Dylan Gann, 301st Rescue Squadron pilot.\n\nThe wing assembled a wing operations center battle staff to coordinate all aspects of the rescue across the wing. Air Force Specialty codes from maintenance to weather directed information to the on-scene team. Flight doctors were used to find the right treatment facility for the patient from home station and relayed information via over the horizon communication and data links to the rescue force.\n\nReaching the ship's remote location required three helicopter air-to-air refuelings. A HAAR involves connecting a probe from the helicopter to a drogue on the HC-130J aircraft, allowing fuel transfer mid-flight. This ensures extended mission duration and combat readiness in austere environments and dynamic situations.\n\nWhen the mission commander arrived on location two HC-130J's circled the airspace to assess the situation and assumed on-scene command while ready to conduct HAAR as needed. Then HH-60s approached the ship to execute the extraction of the patient. Pararescuemen were hoisted down and immediately began preparing the patient and then the patient and his mother were then hoisted up into the helicopter, where he was received medical attention enroute to a hospital.\n\n\"This is what ready now looks like. These real-world missions are what our countless hours of training have prepared us for. Rescue was able to plan and execute this mission without hesitation. This combined arms team is highly trained in their field while understanding what role they play in the bigger picture and led to the successful completion of the mission,\" said Lt. Col. John Lowe, 920th Operations Group commander.\n\nThe patient was successfully transferred to a hospital in the United States. After 8-hours, and more than 1,000 miles flown, the mission was complete when all of the aircraft returned to Patrick SFB.\n\nBased at Patrick Space Force Base, Florida, the 920th Rescue Wing is Air Force Reserve Command's only combat search and rescue wing.

Pararescuements were hoisted down to the ship's deck, and Aiden and his mother were brought up to the helicopter.\n\nMira Simanovsky, who was also onboard the cruise, told USA TODAY the passengers were alerted of a medical evacuation via an intercom announcement. Simanovsky was on her balcony when she saw the two helicopters and army planes circling the ship. She later moved to the deck to watch the rescue mission with other passengers.\n\n\"It was scary.

By uniting our efforts, we saved crucial time, delivering life-saving assistance six hours ahead of other response teams. Our collective determination and efficiency ensured the successful rescue and transport of the individual in need,\" said Capt. Dylan Gann, 301st Rescue Squadron pilot.\n\nThe wing assembled a wing operations center battle staff to coordinate all aspects of the rescue across the wing. Air Force specialty codes from maintenance to weather directed information to the on-scene team. Flight doctors were used to find the right treatment facility for the patient from home station and relayed information via over the horizon communication and data links to the rescue force.\n\nReaching the ship's remote location required three helicopter air-to-air refuelings. A HAAR involves connecting a probe from the helicopter to a drogue on the HC-130J aircraft, allowing fuel transfer mid-flight. This ensures extended mission duration and combat readiness in austere environments and dynamic situations.\n\nWhen the mission commander arrived on location, two HC-130J's circled the airspace to assess the situation and assumed on-scene command while ready to conduct HAAR as needed. Then HH-60s approached the ship to execute the extraction of the patient. Pararescuemen were hoisted down and immediately began preparing the patient and then the patient and his mother were then hoisted up into the helicopter, where he was received medical attention enroute to a hospital.\n\n\"This is what ready now looks like. These real-world missions are what our countless hours of training have prepared us for. Rescue was able to plan and execute this mission without hesitation. This combined arms team is highly trained in their field while understanding what role they play in the bigger picture and led to the successful completion of the mission,\" said Lt. Col. John Lowe, 920th Operations Group commander.\n\nThe patient was successfully transferred to a hospital in the United States. After 8-hours, and more than 1,000 miles flown, the mission was complete when all of the aircraft returned to Patrick Space Force Base.\n\nBased at Patrick SFB, the 920th Rescue Wing is Air Force Reserve Command's only combat search and rescue wing. Its primary mission is to plan, lead and conduct military rescue operations and missions to deny competitors and adversaries exploitation of isolated personnel.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_HC-130", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed HC-130"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/920th_Rescue_Wing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "920th Rescue Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Pararescue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force Pararescue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_HH-60_Pave_Hawk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sikorsky HH-60 Pave Hawk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlift", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airlift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/301st_Rescue_Squadron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "301st Rescue Squadron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data link"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Space_Force_Base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Space Force Base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_arms", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Combined arms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_search_and_rescue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Combat search and rescue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant colonel (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Reserve_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air Force Reserve Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Medical_Relief", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Medical Relief", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Regulations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Regulations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551235", "eventUri": "eng-9551235", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 205, "textEnd": 210}], "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 452990859, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 27, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 27}}}

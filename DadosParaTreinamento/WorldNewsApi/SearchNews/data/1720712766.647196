While Bongaon MP Shantanu Thakur was already an MoS, Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar has been given a spot. The earlier NDA govt had three MoS from the state.Majumdar\u2019s appointment, however, will vacate the post of BJP\u2019s Bengal president, according to the party\u2019s constitution. \u201cWe have provisions in the party constitution and the party will abide by that. The position of state president will follow the same principle,\u201d Majumdar said. It may take nearly two months to nominate a state president, BJP sources said. Majumdar had taken over as state president in 2021, replacing Dilip Ghosh.The two MPs had been invited to Modi\u2019s residence on Sunday morning for tea. They were informed about the allocation of berths then, said sources.\u201cI don\u2019t have any preference for any ministry and will work with whichever portfolio is allocated to me,\u201d Majumdar said, adding: \u201cThis is the first time Balurghat will have a minister at Centre. No other govt had thought of nominating a minister from the area before.\u201d The Balurghat MP said that he and Thakur had an informal talk with Modi over issues in Bengal.\u201cFor me the nature of my job will change, but the hard work will continue. The PM has a dream and we will work towards realising it,\u201d Majumdar added.Thakur, who has been serving as a minister of state for ports, shipping and waterways since 2021, said that he had never worked with ministerial berths in mind. \u201cI don\u2019t work with an expectation to become a minister. There has been an unprecedented amount of work in the shipping ministry in the past five years. I am open to any responsibility the party gives me,\u201d Thakur added.", "summary": "", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shantanu-thakur-sukanta-majumdar-west-bengals-faces-in-pm-modi-council-of-ministers/articleshow/110851363.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-110851482/110851482.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:58:13", "author": "TNN", "authors": ["TNN"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "IN", "sentiment": -0.15}

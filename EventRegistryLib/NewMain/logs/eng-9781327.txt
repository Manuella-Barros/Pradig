Additionally, it should establish a maintenance protocol and ensure transparency by publicly sharing their findings. I urge all members to support this initiative to uphold the safety and integrity of our Parliament,\" Tagore added.\n\nThe Central Public Works Department (CPWD), the Centre's construction arm under the housing and urban affairs ministry, said Thursday that the water leakage in the new Parliament building was because of erosion of silicon from the glass joints and there was no structural stability issue.\n\n\"Heat of unprecedented summer followed by very intense rain eroded silicon from a glass joint on Lok Sabha lobby skylight creating a small issue. It was addressed immediately. Structural integrity, water proofing etc are in good condition,\" the CPWD said in a post on X.\n\nWhile the problem has been fixed, the ministry of housing and urban affairs has asked the CPWD to look for an alternative for silicon sealant or measures to avoid such incidents in the future. \"There was no major problem. This was minor leakage at one location, which was addressed at the earliest. But we will have to look for measures or alternatives to silicon sealant to prevent such incidents in the future,\" said a senior ministry official, who didn't wish to be named.\n\nThe waterlogging in the parliament complex was due to overflowing drains, which are maintained by the New Delhi Municipal Council, in the nearby areas. NDMC vice-chairman Satish Upadhayay said, \"Due to the heavy rainfall, it took time for the water to clear. But the main problem is the Barapullah drain. As it overflows, the water backflows in NDMC areas. There is a need for deep desilting of the Barapullah drain. In June, we wrote to the Delhi government to carry out deep desilting of the drain, as a large number of our drains flow into it.\"\n\nAlso read: First Parliament session in Modi 3.0 ends on bitter note as Oppn walks out of RS during PM's address\n\nThe Narendra Modi government's decision, in its previous term, to construct the new Parliament building under its ambitious Central Vista redevelopment plan during the Covid-19 pandemic had drawn severe criticism from the Opposition. Most parties boycotted the inauguration of the new building in 2023.\n\n\"The new Parliament building has been built at great expense during a once-in-a-century pandemic with no consultation with the people of India or MPs, for whom it is apparently being built. When the soul of democracy has been sucked out from the Parliament, we find no value in a new building,\" a joint statement by 19 Opposition parties had said.\n\nIn the all-party meeting ahead of the Budget session, the Opposition had demanded the Central Hall in the old Parliament be kept open for MPs to interact with each other and improve communications across parties.\n\nSP's Akhilesh Yadav posted on X Thursday that the Old Parliament, \"where even the old MPs could come and meet\", was better than the new building. \"Why not go back to the Old Parliament, at least till the time the water dripping program is going on in the Parliament built with billions of rupees. People are asking whether water dripping from every new roof constructed under the BJP government is a part of their well thought out design or...?\" Yadav wrote.\n\nTMC's Moitra also took a jibe at the PM over the dripping ceiling.

While severe waterlogging was witnessed at many places, almost all roads across Delhi, Noida and Gurugram witnessed massive traffic snarls. A house collapse incident has also been reported in Vasant Kunj area on Wednesday night. A 22-year-old woman and her three-year-old son drowned in Ghazipur after they slipped into an under-construction drain due to waterlogging. Three men were electrocuted to death in Gurugram while wading through the rainwater at IFFCO Chowk and came in contact with a live wire.\n\nThe rain fury continued on Thursday morning with several areas in the national capital still waterlogged. The new building of Parliament also faced water leakages along the path used by the President of India when entering the new Parliament building. Congress MP Manickam Tagore also submitted an adjournment motion notice in the Lok Sabha, proposing the formation of a specialised committee to inspect the Parliament building after alleged water leaks.\n\nALSO READ: Delhi Rains: UPSC Aspirants Continue Protest In Knee-Deep Water As Old Rajinder Nagar Flooded Again | Watch\n\nTagore also shared a video of the water leaks in the Parliament building on his official X handle and stated that the water leakage highlights potential issues with the building's weather resilience, just one year after its completion. \"I rise to address concerns following yesterday's heavy rains, which caused water leaks inside the Parliament lobby along the path used by our President of India when entering the new Parliament building,\" he said.\n\nSamajwadi Party chief and Kannauj MP Akhilesh Yadav also slammed the BJP over the leakage in the new Parliament building and said that the proceedings should return to the old building. \"The old Parliament was better than this new one, where even the former MPs could visit. Why not return to the old Parliament until the issues with the new one, built with billions of rupees, are resolved? People are questioning whether the water dripping from every new roof constructed under the BJP government is part of their well-thought-out design or something else,\" he tweeted.\n\nHeavy rainfall unleashed chaos in the national capital on Wednesday evening, inundating large parts of the city, while key stretches were choked with unending traffic and people were left stranded as roads resembled rivers. The torrential downpour prompted the weather office to include Delhi in its list of \"areas of concern\" in the National Flash Flood Guidance Bulletin.\n\nThe department advised people to remain indoors, secure windows and doors, and refrain from unnecessary travel. Delhi Education Minister Atishi announced late night that all schools in the city will remain closed on Thursday. \"In light of the very heavy rainfall this evening and the forecast of heavy rainfall tomorrow, all schools both government and private will remain closed on August 1st,\" she posted on 'X'.\n\nALSO READ: Himachal Rain Fury: Cloudbursts in Shimla, Kullu and Mandi Claim 3 Lives, Over 50 Missing; CM Sukhu Convenes Emergency Meet\n\nThe inclement weather also hit air traffic.

But no one accused the Britishers of building the old Parliament in haste. The Brown Sahibs they have left behind, still find it aesthetic.\"\n\nHe further accused the opposition of doing politics and claimed that they reminisce the good old days of power and pelf, and scream at their rising irrelevance.\n\n\"However, the iconic Central Hall of the wonderfully distinctive and charming old Parliament building now stinks of piss and is not usable anymore.

Given the building is a monstrous edifice to @narendramodi's ego it is only fitting that it has got shaky post 2024 lok sabha results. Bharat Mandapam leaks another case in point.\n\nCongress MP Manickam Tagore also shared the video on his X platform and swiped at the centre saying that outside the parliament, paper leak is going on (referring to recent NEET-UG paper leak) and inside the parliament, water leak is going on.\n\n\"Paper leakage outside, water leakage inside. The recent water leakage in the Parliament lobby used by the President highlights urgent weather resilience issues in the new building, just a year after completion,\" he said.\n\nHe also moved an Adjournment motion on this issue in Lok Sabha on Thursday.\n\nSP Leader Akhilesh Yadav also slammed the BJP and said, \"The old parliament was better than this new parliament, where even the old MPs could come and meet. Why not go back to the old parliament, at least till the time the water dripping program is going on in the parliament built with billions of rupees.

The last time we saw Yolande, she bravely confided in her husband Patrick (Rudolph Walker) that she had been sexually assaulted by vile Pastor Clayton (Howard Saddler). As a result of the revelation, the couple took a break from Walford, deciding only to report the Pastor to the church rather than the police, who she feared wouldn\u2019t take the incident seriously. Levi promised he had escalated it further, but when nothing was actioned, Patrick felt the need to take the matter into his own hands and charged towards Clayton. Luckily, Yolande was able to drag him away before he got himself into trouble and made matters worse. Kim can\u2019t believe the couple left Denzel alone (Picture: BBC/Jack Barnes/Kieron McCarron) Chelsea gives the sad news about Levi (Picture: BBC/Jack Barnes/Kieron McCarron) Upon their return next week, she is left baffled by his lack of communication and heads to the pub where she asks family friend Chelsea Fox (Zaraah Abrahams) for an update on his whereabouts. Chelsea informs them that Levi has left the area, and can\u2019t comprehend her sadness just moments after asking Yolande and Patrick to be her son Jordan\u2019s godparents.

{"id": 232096674, "title": "Here are the 2 Democrats vying to run against Rep. Rob Wittman in Virginia&#8217;s 1st Congressional District", "text": "Businessman Herb Jones and attorney Leslie Mehta are vying for the Democratic nomination in the 1st Congressional District. The winner of the June 18 primary will face Republican incumbent Rob Wittman in the general election. Wittman has held the U.S. House of Representatives seat since 2007. The district includes portions of suburban Richmond down through York and James City counties, Williamsburg and Poquoson. Jones previously served three terms as treasurer of New Kent County. Mehta has not held elected office. Jones, 64, is a retired Army colonel who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is the chief executive officer of Pyramid Technologies, LLC. Jones said he is running for office because he sees \u201ca lot of people who are hurting\u201d and wants to help his community. He also fears for the nation\u2019s democracy. \u201cIf we collectively make the wrong decision this November, the United States, although we are the most powerful country on Earth, we will go the way of the Roman Empire,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to save democracy.\u201d Jones believes no president should be above the law. If elected, he said he would use his role to help keep the president\u2019s powers in check. He also supports term limits for U.S. Supreme Court justices. Jones identified women\u2019s rights as another priority. He backs the Equal Rights Amendment, which would change the U.S. Constitution to ban discrimination on the basis of sex, and would vote in favor of codifying abortion rights into federal law. \u201cWomen should have the right to make their own decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cI will fight for women to have full and complete autonomy over their own health care.\u201d Explaining his wife formerly worked as a principal, Jones said he is also committed to education. He wants to increase taxes on the nation\u2019s wealthiest citizens and use some of that revenue to raise teacher pay and fund schools. \u201cWe are the most powerful country on earth but we have millionaires and billionaires who are not paying their fair share,\u201d he said. Jones and Mehta had raised $118,250 and $135,261 as of March 31, respectively, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. VPAP is a nonpartisan nonprofit that tracks campaign donations. Mehta, 47, is the chief of staff and counsel for the Richmond Metropolitan Transportation Authority. She formerly worked as the legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia. Mehta was a member of Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s Commission to Examine Racial and Economic Inequity in Virginia Law. She currently serves on the Virginia Rare Disease Council, which advises Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the General Assembly. Her 5-year old daughter, Brooke, died in 2021 from Rett syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. \u201cBefore she passed away, I started doing a lot more work in the rare disease, disability rights, accessibility and health care spaces,\u201d she said. \u201cI worked on securing bipartisan legislation for Rett syndrome and rare disease research funding on the federal level \u2014 that led me to more advocacy.\u201d Mehta felt running for office was a natural next step. If elected, she said securing more funding to improve health care affordability and accessibility would be a top priority. She also supports codifying abortion rights into federal law and offering protections for other forms of reproductive health care. \u201cWe know what happened recently in Alabama and the assault and attack on IVF,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are at a point where there are attacks on things like birth control.\u201d Mehta said she would also work to address climate change by backing measures that support the environment, such as legislation to protect air quality or the Chesapeake Bay and other waterways, and invest in climate resilience strategies. Mehta added she believes Congress needs \u201cadults back in the room\u201d who can be civil when they disagree. She said she would treat others with respect. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with (Republican) Gov. Glenn Youngkin on rare diseases and I\u2019m currently on his board right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with him on everything and I am certainly a proud Democrat, but I\u2019m also a proud pragmatist and I want to be able to get things done.\u201d Katie King, katie.king@virginiamedia.com", "summary": "Businessman Herb Jones and attorney Leslie Mehta are seeking the Democratic nomination in the 1st Congressional District on June 18.

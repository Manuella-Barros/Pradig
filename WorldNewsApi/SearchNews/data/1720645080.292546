{"id": 231334606, "title": "King Charles had 'cancer treatment 24 hours before' his moving D-Day speech", "text": "King Charles has been revealed to have led the D-Day commemorations in Normandy, a mere 24 hours after undergoing cancer treatment in hospital. At the age of 75, Charles received medical care at a London hospital on Tuesday but was resolute in his commitment to be present with veterans the next day, aiming to \"lead from the front.\" On Wednesday, he first made his way to Portsmouth where he gave an eight-minute speech. The emotional impact of the King's words was evident as Queen Camilla was seen with tears in her eyes. The royal couple later spent time with some of the 21 invited D-Day heroes during the event. Following medical advice, Charles curtailed his scheduled appearance by 45 minutes, reports the Mirror. His \"carefully calibrated\" participation then took him swiftly to Normandy, France, for the significant 80th-anniversary commemoration, as reported by the Sun. There, King Charles delivered a stirring tribute to the D-Day heroes at the British Normandy Memorial, which bears the names of the 22,442 individuals who lost their lives on D-Day and the French civilians who perished during the war in Normandy. He called upon people to draw lessons from history and urged free nations to unite against despotism. Furthermore, he commended the wartime generation for their steadfast courage, saying they \"did not flinch.\" Accompanied by Camilla, he engaged with veterans, assuring them that he was \"doing well.\" According to the Sun, Charles' physicians had recommended \"compromises\" leading to Prince William stepping in for his father at the international ceremony on Omaha Beach, attended by numerous global leaders, just a few hours later. Following a demanding three-day stint, Charles was able to return to the UK thanks to Prince William's appearance at the Omaha Beach commemorations. The event on June 6 was scheduled from 3.30pm to 5.30pm, but many world leaders remained until 7pm. Aware of the previous 75th anniversary ceremony in 2019 that overran by two hours, Charles' team consulted with doctors while planning for the event. \"All events were looked at in consultation with doctors. They were extremely long days and some compromises had to be made,\" royal insiders revealed. Prince William's presence at the D-Day commemoration is the latest instance where he has stepped in for his father, following Charles' announcement of his prostate cancer diagnosis. This also marked William's busiest period of engagements after his wife Kate courageously disclosed her own cancer diagnosis. A source close to William shared: \"As Prince of Wales, he has a strong sense of wanting to support his father, both at home and overseas.\" Charles is expected to attend the King's Foundation Awards at St James's Palace, London, next Tuesday. The King and Queen have several other commitments in the coming weeks, including a garden party at the Palace of Holyroodhouse during Scotland week. This event coincides with the General Election, requiring Charles to return to London on July 5 to formally invite the winning party leader to form a new government.

But I just hope that when they do those types of things, that what they take into (account) is to think about their teammates first.\n\nIt was a heck of a detailed response, particularly from someone who's been mum for so long. When he was asked about linebacker Brandon Marshall, who joined in on the protests last year, Elway emphasized the things Marshall did off the field to make his point.\n\n\"Brandon made a point last year, but he carried it forward. He just didn't make a stand on the field. He went out in the community and did something and talked to different people,\" Elway said. \"He talked to law enforcement and got involved. I was proud of Brandon. Not only did he show his support but he went out and did something in the community.\"\n\nMarshall was apparently kept in the dark about the team's response. According to Denver7, when they texted Marshall, he was excited about Elway's words.\n\n\"It felt great!\" he told Denver 7 in a text. \"I honestly never knew how the organization felt about what I did.\"\n\nThere were rumors during the 2016 offseason that the Broncos were pursuing Colin Kaepernick via trade, but ultimately nothing came of those rumors. Many people wondered whether or not Kaepernick's politics prevented the Broncos from ultimately pulling the trigger, a claim that Elway has emphatically denied. On the contrary, he's said that the Broncos are simply happy with Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch, who are currently competing for the starting job.\n\nElway also dispelled rumors that the Broncos were looking for quarterback help earlier this month, calling them \"fake news\" via tweet.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 31, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 100, "id": 447, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 100, "id": 673, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "type": "loc", "id": "230018"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302605", "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309400", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "321241", "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "322056", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "331327", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "336230", "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elway", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "350359", "label": {"eng": "John Elway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Marshall", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "355415", "label": {"eng": "Brandon Marshall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "395519", "label": {"eng": "Colin Kaepernick"}}]}

And if we do that, everything's going to be fine.\"\n\nLast season Broncos inside linebacker Brandon Marshall joined the movement initiated by Colin Kaepernick, kneeling for the anthem in protest of perceived social injustice in the United States. Marshall kneeled for half the season last year and was asked by the media about his protest almost daily. He said kneeling was to create conversation and that his intent was to follow it with work in the community.\n\nMarshall later met with Denver Police Chief Robert White to discuss the department's use-of-force policy, and continued to work with youth to improve school attendance at local elementary schools.

But he also wants anyone who does to make their protests meaningful by following up with action, the way Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall did last year.\n\nVia Nicki Jhabvala of the Denver Post, Elway said he hasn't talked to the players as a team about the situation, but hoped they'd concentrate on how their personal beliefs impact the greater good (in both society and sport).\n\n\"My stance is, . . . everybody has the right to do what they wish to do and their beliefs are their beliefs. That's why we live in this country,\" Elway said. \"They have the right to display whatever they wish to display. I think one thing that where we stand and I kind of stand with the Broncos is that, 'You know what? That's OK. We'll respect that and whatever you want to do is fine with us.

If the questions and everything, if the tenor changes everything that's going on in these interviews and now you're not talking about our next opponent but you're talking about what's going on in the world, that's not the best thing for our football team. So I only advise and would tell our players, 'I respect where you stand. But when you're doing anything, just understand what it's doing to the football team,' because I want all these guys to understand that we're football-first and we want to win football games. And if we do that, everything's going to be fine.\"\n\nMarshall was one of the players last year who joined then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in kneeling for the national anthem to protest discrimination by law enforcement. Marshall then later met with Denver Police Chief Robert White to discuss the department's use-of-force policy, as well as work in elementary schools in the Denver area.\n\n\"And I think obviously Brandon made a point last year, but he carried it forward,\" Elway said. \"He didn't just make a stand on the field before the games.

I was proud of Brandon and the fact that not only did he show his support for what it was last year, but also he went out and did something in the community about it.\"\n\nIt's refreshing and interesting to hear Elway take that stance, since it gives players the freedom to express their beliefs. But considering the fact the Broncos had interest in trading for Kaepernick before his protests, but then not afterward, the actions speak as well. Letting a player express himself is apparently fine, so long as the individual doesn't believe that stance is bigger than the goal of winning a ball game.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 31, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 100, "id": 447, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 100, "id": 673, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "type": "loc", "id": "230018"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302557", "label": {"eng": "Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302605", "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302606", "label": {"eng": "Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303465", "label": {"eng": "Departments of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309400", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "322056", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Police_Department", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Police Department"}, "type": "loc", "id": "322984"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "324122", "label": {"eng": "Tenor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "331327", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denver_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "334028", "label": {"eng": "The Denver Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "336230", "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elway", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "350359", "label": {"eng": "John Elway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Marshall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "355415", "label": {"eng": "Brandon Marshall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "395519", "label": {"eng": "Colin Kaepernick"}}]}

If we do that, everything's going to be fine.

In the case of Marshall, Elway appreciated how he handled the situation as he raised awareness for social causes and created dialogue with the Denver police over their training methods.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "wgt": 100, "id": 203, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100, "id": 333, "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "228719"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "type": "loc", "id": "229241"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "type": "loc", "id": "235512"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309400", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319773", "label": {"eng": "Protest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "322056", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "336230", "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshawn_Lynch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "347589", "label": {"eng": "Beast Quake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elway", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "350359", "label": {"eng": "John Elway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "355412", "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Marshall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "355415", "label": {"eng": "Brandon Marshall"}}]}

Elway has said -- over and over in the offseason -- he is happy with the Broncos' top two quarterbacks.\n\nHe held that line throughout the rumored and largely overstated interest in Tony Romo early in the offseason, through the scouting combine, the league meetings the draft and as recently as last week when he quashed a report the Broncos were considering a trade for Cincinnati Bengals backup A.J. McCarron.\n\nAfter the second of two days' worth of joint practices with the 49ers, Elway went to bat again for his young quarterbacks.\n\n\"I've got confidence in the fact they're both young and with practice they're going to continue to get better,\" Elway said. \"That's why I have confidence in them.\"\n\nElway drafted both quarterbacks -- Siemian in the seventh round in 2015, Lynch in the first round last year after moving up to select him -- so he naturally has an affinity for each of them. He has said while he would offer his input that coach Vance Joseph \"will make the call\" about a starter this time around.\n\nBut Thursday, Elway expanded on why he has remained confident in what either Siemian or Lynch can do in the offense.\n\n\"They don't grow on trees, there are not quarterbacks growing on trees out there,\" Elway said. \"So there wasn't another answer. But with that being said, I like the guys that we have because I know talent-wise they can do it. It's just they need the time and experience to continue to get better. ... Whoever becomes the starter during this year, there's going to be growing pains because they're both so young.\"\n\nSiemian started the Broncos' preseason opener in Chicago last week and Lynch will start Saturday's game against the 49ers. Elway said that a decision has not been made.\n\n\"No, it's not,\" Elway said. \"That's why, you know, they'll split time this week and we'll see what happens. As we said we wanted to see these guys in preseason and eventually we're going to name a starter, we just don't know when.\"\n\nJoseph has said naming a starter before the Broncos' third preseason game -- Aug. 26 against the Green Bay Packers -- would be ideal, but that he would take more time to decide if he believed it was needed.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 31, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "wgt": 100, "id": 69, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 100, "id": 447, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "type": "loc", "id": "206540"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "type": "loc", "id": "229241"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304978", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309406", "label": {"eng": "National Football League Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311921", "label": {"eng": "Bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Romo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "313670", "label": {"eng": "Tony Romo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "322056", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "331327", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elway", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "350359", "label": {"eng": "John Elway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._McCarron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "360792", "label": {"eng": "AJ McCarron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "384523", "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxton_Lynch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1272948", "label": {"eng": "Paxton Lynch"}}]}

He then returned to the same Marriott hotel room in Santa Clara where he celebrated the Broncos' Super Bowl 50 victory.\n\n\"That was a good feeling,\" he said Thursday. \"But we go into every year with that being the idea, that we want to compete for championships. With the year we came off last year, not having made the playoffs, we had some strides to make. We're in that process right now but I'm excited with where we are.\"\n\nElway, back in the place that launched his career as a player and that gave him his first title as an NFL general manager, is looking for a fourth Super Bowl title to add to his collection. And as he watched the progression of his two young quarterbacks on Thursday, watched the elite defense he built back in 2014, and watched the first-year head coach, Vance Joseph, he hired only seven months ago, he seemed pleased.\n\n\"Vance has brought a renewed enthusiasm and really has done a tremendous job with the new staff on the offensive side and the defense,\" Elway said. \"I think we saw a little bit of it today.\"\n\nWhat he saw was one of the finest performances of quarterback Paxton Lynch's second NFL training camp, mixed with a trio of brawls between 49ers and Broncos players that led to punches and sharp words.\n\nBut what he also saw was an feistiness and overall improvement from Denver's offensive line, a priority for Elway this offseason.\n\n\"I think the mentality has changed tremendously and (offensive line coach) Jeff Davidson, as well as (assistant offensive line coach) Chris Strausser are doing a tremendous job with the offensive line,\" Elway said. \"We made huge strides there, and that's where we needed to. And that was our starting point.\"\n\nThe front five on offense -- whomever those starting five may be -- are the first line of defense for Broncos' quarterbacks, who are still duking it out in a battle for the starting job. Lynch will start Saturday in Denver's second preseason game and play a quarter and a half before Trevor Siemian takes over. Their time will be equal as they get another chance -- possibly one of the final remaining chances -- to win the job.\n\n\"We talked about that decision being made by itself,\" Elway said. \"We want one of them to take the reins and take over. That'd be the ideal situation, but we'll get through this game and go from there, see what happens. ... We want to see these guys in preseason and eventually we're going to name a starter. We just don't know when.\"\n\nThe hope all along was that the decision would be obvious at a certain point in the preseason, that one quarterback would separate himself. The hope remains, even as time runs out.\n\nSince Jan. 1, before he even knew who would succeed Gary Kubiak as head coach, Elway said he was happy with his quarterbacks, Siemian and Lynch. He said it again in March at the NFL scouting combine. He said it again later that month at the NFL owners meetings. He said it again in July and once more in August, with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell sitting at his side in the Broncos' fieldhouse.\n\nAnd he said it once more Thursday.\n\n\"I've got confidence in the fact that they're both young and they're going to continue with practice to get better,\" Elway said. \"Looking at the guys that we had and them wanting to go and compete in practice, they don't grow on trees. There are not quarterbacks growing on trees out there. ... I like the guys that we have because I know talent-wise they can do it. It's just a matter of they need the time and experience and with that they'll continue to get better.\n\n\"Obviously that position is very, very important. We got better around them to give them better opportunities to be successful, but there are still going to be growing pains. Whoever is the starter this year, there are still going to be growing pains because they're both so young.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100, "id": 485, "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 100, "id": 487, "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 100, "id": 552, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Jewelry", "wgt": 100, "id": 553, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Jewelry"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "wgt": 100, "id": 948, "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto"}, "type": "loc", "id": "228817"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "type": "loc", "id": "229241"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "type": "loc", "id": "230018"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305141", "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305436", "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp_(National_Football_League)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311049", "label": {"eng": "Training camp (National Football League)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316239", "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "322056", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "324464", "label": {"eng": "Offensive line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "325075", "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLIX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "329212", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl XLIX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "331327", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_L", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "349262", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl 50"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elway", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "350359", "label": {"eng": "John Elway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Kubiak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "357628", "label": {"eng": "Gary Kubiak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "384523", "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "415693", "label": {"eng": "Jeff Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxton_Lynch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1272948", "label": {"eng": "Paxton Lynch"}}]}

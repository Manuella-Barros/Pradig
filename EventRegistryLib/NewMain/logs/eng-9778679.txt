A win in this bout would ensure at least a bronze medal for her.\n\nHer performance on the day was an assured one. While her rival seemed keen to draw her into a slugfest, Borgohain kept her composure and distance to land clean blows on counter-attack.\n\nThe Indian also had to deal with plenty of clinching by Hofstad, who came across busier of the two boxers, complete with a perilously low guard.\n\nBut the Assam-boxer didn't fall into the trap and attacked the Norwegian with precision by drawing her in.\n\nBorgohain has been handed a tough draw but the wiry pugilist has shown the ability to rise above it in her past performances, most notably in Tokyo where she defeated world champion Chen Nien-Chin in the quarterfinals to secure herself a bronze.\n\nHer opponent on August 4, Qian, is a silver-medallist from the Tokyo Games in the middle-weight (75kg) division.\n\nShe had also won a bronze in the 2016 Rio Games and claimed a gold medal in the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.\n\nThe Indian boxing campaign at the Games has been mixed so far with three of the six in contention, already out of the competition.\n\nThose ousted early include former Asian Games champion Amit Panghal (51kg), Preeti Pawar (54kg) and Jaismine Lamboria (57kg).\n\nRemaining in fray apart from

Four out of five judges awarded ten points to the Philippine boxer. In the second round, Petecio continued to dominate. She looked at ease throughout, and all five judges awarded her ten points.\n\nIn the third and final round, Jasmine needed a remarkable comeback to turn the bout in her favour. However, the comeback never materialised, and she lost the match 0:5 on points. Amit Panghal also exited the Paris Olympics following a loss in the 16th round of the men's 51 kg category.\n\nAmit lost to Zambia's Patrick Chinyemba by 1-4. In the initial rounds, Amit was highly aggressive, and both boxers traded punches. But in the third round, judges ruled entirely in favour of the Zambian boxer, who won by a split decision of 1-4.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/07/31/1455749-lovelin.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778679", "eventUri": "eng-9778679", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 941, "textEnd": 949}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

But Lovlina, with her trademark composure, deflected her opponent's punches and countered back, even managing a smile as she controlled the bout.\n\nThe third round saw Hofstad improve, but it was not enough to trouble the reigning Asian Games silver medallist.

She is now just one win away from adding to her Tokyo bronze, which was won in the 69kg category.\n\nBut her path is not an easy one as she will take on top-seeded Chinese Li Qian in the last-eight stage on August 4. A win in this bout would ensure at least a bronze medal for her.\n\nHer performance on the day was an assured one. While her rival seemed keen to draw her into a slugfest, Borgohain kept her composure and distance to land clean blows on counter-attack.\n\nThe Indian also had to deal with plenty of clinching by Hofstad, who came across busier of the two boxers, complete with a perilously low guard.\n\nBut the Assam-boxer didn't fall into the trap and attacked the Norwegian with precision by drawing her in.\n\nBorgohain has been handed a tough draw but the wiry pugilist has shown the ability to rise above it in her past performances, most notably in Tokyo where she defeated world champion Chen Nien-Chin in the quarterfinals to secure herself a bronze.\n\nHer opponent on August 4, Qian, is a silver-medallist from the Tokyo Games in the middle-weight (75kg) division.\n\nShe had also won a bronze in the 2016 Rio Games and claimed a gold medal in the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.

She looked at ease throughout, and all five judges awarded her ten points.\n\nIn the third and final round, Jasmine needed a remarkable comeback to turn the bout in her favour. However, the comeback never materialised, and she lost the match 0:5 on points. Amit Panghal also exited the Paris Olympics following a loss in the 16th round of the men's 51 kg category.\n\nAmit lost to Zambia's Patrick Chinyemba by 1-4. In the initial rounds, Amit was highly aggressive, and both boxers traded punches. But in the third round, judges ruled entirely in favour of the Zambian boxer, who won by a split decision of 1-4.

Her first competitor is a 20-year-old former world youth champion as well as a European youth champion and stands at 1.75m.\n\nBut her father Tiken Borgohain believes she is better prepared than Tokyo and will be able to make a positive start in Paris. \"Her preparation ahead of the Olympics has been good. Her new coach has also been guiding her well and she is more comfortable fighting in her new category,\" Tiken said during a brief interaction with TOI on Tuesday evening.\n\nWhile she obviously worked hard during the camp in Patiala under CA Kuttappa and Dmitry Dmitruk, it was during a three-week camp in Saarbrucken, Germany, that she polished her skills alongside boxers from Ireland, US, Mongolia, Germany and Denmark among others.\n\nAnd boxing coach Abhishek Sah, who was part of the camp in Patiala as well as worked with her in SAI Guwahati during her formative years, believes if Lovlina does perform to her strengths, she will be able to bag the win.\n\n\"She has to make good use of her height and attack and counter attack from a distance,\" Sah added. \"However, it all depends on how it goes on the day. We all had expected Amit Panghal to medal but he lost in the round of 16.\"\n\nLovlina's father has also learnt to think in that way and has accepted that winning and losing are part of the game. He doesn't even speak with Lovlina about the bouts and sticks to just asking general stuff. \"We haven't spoken anything about her upcoming matches. Just asked her how things have been, whether she has eaten or not, and we keep telling her to take care of herself,\" he added.\n\nAlthough he doesn't ask her anything he does worry at times and Lovlina has delivered on more than one occasion. After the disappointment of Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, she won gold in Asian Championships in 75kg category. Then last year in New Delhi, she won the gold in World Championships and also made it to the final of Asian Games.\n\nIf she can keep up the form, there won't be much to worry about for her but it's hard to predict the result in a sport like boxing despite the best efforts of the athlete.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"},

Despite Sunniva's attempt to get off to an aggressive start, Borgohain carefully established her dominance in the game with some great defense after not facing much of a challenge.\n\nSunniva is the Junior World Champion in this weight class and one of the upcoming stars in the sport.

Despite her opponent's attempts to engage in a brawl, the Indian boxer maintained her poise and range, landing precise strikes on counter-attack.\n\nHofstad's strategy involved frequent clinching, and she appeared to be the more active of the two fighters, albeit with a dangerously low guard. However, Borgohain refused to be lured into the trap.\n\nInstead, she employed a tactical approach, enticing the Norwegian to come forward and then unleashing accurate attacks with great timing and precision.\n\nBorgohain faces a challenging draw in her upcoming bout. However, her past achievements, particularly her triumph over the world champion Chen Nien-Chin in the Tokyo quarterfinals, which earned her a bronze medal, demonstrate her capability to overcome adversity.\n\nOn August 4, Borgohain will face Qian, a formidable opponent who secured a silver medal in the middle-weight (75kg) category at the Tokyo Games. Qian's impressive resume also includes a bronze medal from the 2016 Rio Games and a gold medal from the 2022 Asian Games held in Hangzhou, China.\n\nThe Indian boxing campaign at the Games has seen mixed results, with three of the six contenders already eliminated from the competition.\n\nAmong those who exited early are former Asian Games champion Amit Panghal (51kg), Preeti Pawar (54kg), and Jaismine Lamboria (57kg).\n\nStill in contention, alongside Lovlina Borgohain, are debutants Nikhat Zareen, the reigning world champion in the women's 50kg category, and Nishant Dev in the men's 71kg category.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Lovlina defeated the Norweigan 5-0 via unanimous decision in her round of 16 match in Paris.\n\n26-year-old Lovlina, who bagged a bronze medal for India at the Tokyo Olympics 2020, gained a direct entry in the pre-quarter-final at the Paris Olympics 2024. She dominated the proceedings from the onset against Sunniva despite the Norweigan being more aggressive and quick.\n\nLovlina showed incredible composure throughout the clash and landed her punches at the right time to take the first round 5-0 before winning the second round 5-0 once again. She ended up registering a clinical 5-0 win at the end of round 3 to qualify for the quarter-finals in the women's 75kg category.\n\nLovlina is on the cusp of history at the Paris Olympics 2024 as she just needs one more victory to confirm a medal at the Games. She will be up against China's Li Qian in the quarter-final on August 04 and if she manages to win, she will be assured of a bronze medal in Paris. The medal will be her second at the Olympics having won a bronze in the women's 69kg category at the Tokyo Games in 2021.\n\nLovlina had become only the third Indian boxer after the legendary MC Mary Kom and Vijender Singh to win an Olympic medal for India in boxing. She now has a chance to emulate the likes of Manu Bhaker and PV Sindhu in becoming the third Indian woman to win two medals at the Olympics.\n\nWhile Manu has won back-to-back bronze medals at the ongoing Paris Olympics 2024, Sindhu won a silver medal in women's singles badminton at the Rio Olympics in 2016 and followed it up with a bronze medal at the Tokyo Games. No other Indian woman has managed to win two medals at the Olympics.\n\nIf Lovlina manages to beat Li Qian in the quarter-final, she will also become the first Indian boxer to win two medals at the Olympics, rewriting history.

Sunniva, the 2022 World Youth Champion, tried to land some counters to tackle the lanky Indian, before Lovlina responded with a couple of jabs and a right hook to collect the much-needed points in the first round.\n\nThe second round saw Lovlina make an effective use of her precise left jab as she began with a flurry of strong jabs to leave her opponent fending for cover. The Norwegian struggled to get anything going as Lovlina landed a few clean ramming swipes at Hofstad and toyed with her frustration to get the better of her throughout the round.\n\nDesperate to get the momentum on her side in the final round, Hofstad began by charging on Lovlina who instead took down her opponent before the referee reprimanded the Indian pugilist. With over a minute to go for the third round, Lovlina found her balance after being attacked on the head, and came up with a flurry of jabs to end the round in dominant fashion.\n\nIn the last eight stages, the lanky Assamese pugilist will be up against her old nemesis and number one seed China's Li Qian on Sunday. Both these boxers met in two major events last year - the Asian Games final and World Championships semi-final.\n\nLi Qian, a two-time Olympic medallist, won the Asian Games final in Hangzhou and most recently at the Grand Prix in Czechia in mid-June while Borgohain emerged on top in the World Championships semi-finals in New Delhi. Thus the balance isn't totally one-sided.\n\nIf Lovlina manages to get past Qian, she could face either fifth-seeded Caitlin Parker, who she had beaten for the World Championship title or three-time Worlds medallist and fourth-seeded Khadija El-Mardi of Morocco in the semifinal. She could then face either Worlds bronze medallist Davina Michel or European champion Aoife O'Rourke in the final.\n\nOnly two other Indian boxers remain in contention for a medal at Paris 2024.\n\nLater in the day, Nishant Dev (71 kg) will make his Olympics debut in a round of 16 clash against Ecuador's Jose Rodriguez after receiving a bye in the first round. This technically means, Nishant will need to win only a couple of bouts to assure himself at least a bronze. A win could land him against Pan American champion Marco Verde in the quarterfinal. Nishant had beaten the Mexican when they last fought in Belgrade in 2021.\n\nTwo-time world champion Nikhat Zareen will face reigning world champion Wu Yu of China in the women's 50kg round of 16 on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lovlina.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778679", "eventUri": "eng-9778679", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Olympic-Medallist Boxer Set To Shine Again In Paris", "body": "Boxing champion Lovlina Borgohain, who won a bronze for India at the Tokyo Games 2020, is aiming to outdo herself and clinch an Olympic gold in Paris.\n\nTokyo Olympics bronze medallist Lovlina Borgohain is aiming to outdo herself and clinch a gold medal at the Paris Games. The 26-year-old boxing champion is set to pose a tough challenge to Norway's Sunniva Hofstad in the Round of 16 on July 31. In 2020, Borgohain made history as the first female athlete and the second boxer from Assam to make it to the Olympics. The Arjuna Awardee won gold medals at the 2023 IBA Women's World Boxing Championships and the 2022 Asian Boxing Championships.\n\nHow Did Lovlina Borgohain Start Out?\n\nBorgohain started out as a kickboxer before Sports Authority of India's Padum Boro, while scouting for talent in Assam's Golaghat district, discovered her talent. He inspired her to take up boxing and she won a bronze medal in her debut world championship in 2018, following it up with another bronze the next year. She has been undergoing training for months to become India's top-most medal contender this year at the Games. She became the first woman pugilist from Assam to qualify for the Olympics.\n\nIn 2019, the aggressive boxer said in an interview with SheThePeople that in her family her father is a huge supporter of pursuing sports. She noted that her dream of winning Olympic gold was getting stronger every day and even though the injury brings her down sometimes, she was excited to get back to full fitness for the qualifying events. Subsequently, she finished third place at the Asia and Oceania Boxing Olympics qualifiers, defeating Maftunakhon Melieva of Uzbekistan in April this year.\n\nGolaghat to Tokyo\n\nSpeaking about her early beginnings and the way forward, the aggressive boxer had confessed, \"I come from a lower-middle-class family, that belongs to Assam's Golaghat. From an early age, my twin sisters and I were taught to be strong in order to pursue our dreams or to be successful in life. My mother is a very strong woman and despite having a poor economic condition she never let us suffer in any situation. My sisters are well-trained in martial arts and seeing them I also got interested in doing so.\"\n\nBorgohain was laid low by COVID-19 and missed a training trip to Europe because of it.

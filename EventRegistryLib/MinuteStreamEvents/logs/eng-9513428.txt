As he prepares to take his career to its highest level yet, his storied high school career continues to make headlines.\n\nTwo high school teammates have never been drafted together in the first round, but that could be set to change this year. Williams graduated from Washington DC's Gonzaga College High School in 2021, where he first caught the nation's attention with a dramatic final-play championship win, secured by a 53-yard Hail Mary pass.\n\nREAD MORE: Taylor Swift appears to take shot at Travis Kelce's Kansas City Chiefs teammate in new song\n\nREAD MORE: NFL star's wife who complained about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce sees plea backfire\n\nAlso starring in that game was Olu Fashanu, a formidable left tackle who had never played football before arriving at the school. He quickly ascended to varsity, and after impressing at Penn State University, he is a top draft prospect and expected to be a first-round pick also.\n\nWith the draft less than a week away, Gonzaga's campus is buzzing, even though most of the school's student body never shared its hallways with Williams or Fashanu.\n\nGonzaga senior Finn Rezendes feels that \"the morale on campus is really high, people are posting pictures of Caleb and Olu in Gonzaga outfits all over Instagram. More than anything we're just proud that they have accomplished what they have and that they are taking their careers to the next level, especially as first-round picks.\"\n\nFollow us on Xfor the best and latest in sports news\n\nWilliams receiving his Diploma in 2021 Students at Gonzaga College High School are buzzing over Williams' pending first pick\n\nRezendes' classmate Kyan Pires added that \"as an athlete and in the classroom, he has a reputation of being very respectful... he always carried himself well on the field when games got scrappy.\"\n\nRandy Trivers, Head Coach of Gonzaga's football program since 2012, still holds his players to Williams' standard, both on and off the field. He likens the pride he feels watching his alumni approach the draft to that which a parent might feel for their child.\n\n\"Any parent will know how good it feels when their kid accomplishes something, like walking or talking for the first time,\" he said. \"That is the only feeling I can equate it to. It is such a unique accomplishment.\"\n\nWilliams donning an LSU jacket during his High School days before heading to USC Williams' high school coach knew he had a special talent on his hands\n\nEven as teenagers, Trivers knew that both players had the potential to be special. \"I'd be lying if I said I knew they would go pro that early,\" he admits. \"I've coached a lot of really talented high school players, it's impossible to tell.\n\n\"I will say I'm not surprised, they both have great intangible qualities... They were ultra-talented, but there are so many things that have to happen for a young man to ascend from being a great high school player to an NFL first-round draft pick.\"\n\nTrivers, who will attend the draft in Detroit, will remember Williams and Fashanu above all for their personalities. \"They're both just awesome guys,\" he happily reminisced. \"There were so many opportunities off the field to laugh, to smile, to love with them, not to mention the great moments on the field. Having the opportunity to watch them grow as people was really special.\"\n\nOlu Fashanu played in the same high school team as Caleb Williams and will also be picked in the first round of this month's draft Fashanu, an offensive tackle, carved out a stellar college career at Penn State\n\nSpeaking on the mood in Gonzaga's football team, Trivers said: \"The guys are pretty juiced for it, they are excited to be a part of that legacy, part of a historic moment.\"\n\nOperated by Jesuit priests since opening in 1821, Gonzaga's academics place great emphasis on the content of its students' characters, something which is plainly evident in Williams and Fashanu. Long-serving math teacher Paul Buckley taught Williams geometry in his sophomore year and likes to remind his students of the quarterback's work ethic.\n\n\"The kids are starstruck... They all want to know how he's going to dress, how he will do his hair, but we know Caleb is not in this position by accident, he knew what his goal was and he worked really hard to make it happen,\" he said. \"Caleb used to come in on Sundays to work with a tutor, that shows his dedication. Combine unbelievable talent with absolute dedication to his craft, he deserves every accolade that comes to him.\"\n\nWilliams was a popular figure at the school\n\nDirector of Athletics Terry Kernan has similar memories of Fashanu, who he coached as a freshman in both basketball and football. \"Olu is just a great human being, great personality, really hard-working,\" he recalls. \"He came out to football having never played before... he just blossomed and got better every year.\"\n\n\"Caleb was so mature and so hardworking,\" he continues. \"I taught him in his senior year when he left Gonzaga early to train in Oklahoma. He joined class on Zoom and never missed a class, it was incredible to see that dedication. Everyone on campus is pretty fired up, the energy around campus is great, not just with students but alumni too, the alumni association is holding a watch party.\"\n\nA devout supporter of the Washington Commanders, Kernan would love to see either player return to the District. \"No matter what teams they go to I'll be rooting for them, but it would be amazing to have them back in their hometown,\" he says. \"Whatever team they end up at, I'm sure we'll see a lot of those jerseys around campus!\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors":

He cries': Caleb Williams' relatability, big arm go back to high school days", "body": "WASHINGTON - Caleb Williams was halfway across the country, but that didn't stop him from attending his senior year statistics course at Gonzaga College High School.\n\n\"He would Zoom into my class every day from Norman, (Oklahoma),\" said Terry Kernan, Gonzaga's athletics director. \"He would be in the football facility, or in his dorm room, or he'd be studying in the weight room. But he'd be there every day, just showing that commitment, where he could have easily just cashed it in and said, 'I'm already at Oklahoma.' \"\n\nThese were abnormal circumstances for a student at Gonzaga, an all-boys Jesuit private school for grades 9-12 located roughly 10 blocks from the Capitol Building. These were also abnormal times. Like millions of Americans his age, Williams completed his senior year of high school (the 2020-21 academic year) virtually as the COVID-19 pandemic curtailed in-person learning. His senior football season was canceled.\n\nBecause he could Zoom into the classroom, Williams was able to enroll early at Oklahoma. And he was still able to complete his education at Gonzaga and, ultimately, graduate.\n\nDoing both at the same time would have been a challenge had it not been for the pandemic, said Gonzaga's special teams coordinator and manager of athletic communications Conrad Singh.\n\n\"If there's no pandemic, who knows if he wears a white tux?\" said Singh, referencing the graduation attire worn by Gonzaga students. \"I don't know if that's ever been said before. For him to be able to be at Oklahoma and here virtually, that's unique. That's not what Gonzaga does. If there's no pandemic, that's not what Gonzaga allows, so he would have been in a hard position to figure out 'how can I be early enrolled?'\"\n\nIt was a question Williams never had to answer. This preceded Williams' lone season in Oklahoma. He subsequently transferred to Southern California, where he won the 2022 Heisman Trophy and solidified his standing as a top prospect widely expected to be taken first overall by the Chicago Bears in Thursday's NFL draft.\n\nWilliams, Singh said, displayed a different type of mental capacity to envision the future and create situations he wants. Then he goes after it.\n\n\"You believe in yourself and you create opportunity and choices,\" Singh said. \"That's what it's all about. And that's what Caleb represents to a lot of people.\"\n\nWilliams returned to Gonzaga for his No. 18 jersey retirement last May.\n\n\"He was right at home,\" Singh said. \"Firing the guys up, leading the fight song, he loves it here.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Williams won't be the only Gonzaga graduate to hear his name called by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Penn State left tackle Olu Fashanu, who protected Williams' blind side for two seasons at Gonzaga, is a projected first-round pick and will be one of the first offensive tackles off the board in a loaded class at the position.\n\nA pair of former high-school teammates being taken in the same first round of the NFL draft isn't unheard of. Bryant Westbrook (Lions) and Michael Booker (Falcons), for example, were teammates at El Camino High School in California and were selected six picks apart (fifth and 11th, respectively) in 1997.\n\nThat doesn't diminish the impact the selections of Williams and Fashanu will have on Gonzaga.\n\n\"Sometimes, it's hard for people to have perspective on how powerful or unique something is,\" Gonzaga head football coach Randy Trivers told USA TODAY Sports. \"This is like an eclipse. This doesn't happen.\"\n\nGonzaga beat out other schools in the D.C., Maryland, Virginia area and other prep powerhouses, such as IMG Academy in Florida, to secure Williams. The coaching staff scouted him heavily during when he was in eighth grade, current defensive coordinator and strength and conditioning coach Justin Young said. They knew he was special, Young said, but \"there was just a different glow about him\" upon his arrival on campus in 2017.\n\n\"I knew he had the potential to be the starting quarterback, which is rare for a freshman for us, at any position,\" Trivers said.\n\nThe staff needed to see if he had another quality needed to be a freshman starter - the mental maturity that comes with the job. Throughout that first training camp, Williams passed each step. He digested the material in the meeting room and retained the information overnight. He proved he was tough enough during scrimmages.\n\n\"He's relatable in the sense that he laughs. He cries. He's human, just like us. He loves. He can have a conversation,\" said Trivers, who will be in Detroit for the draft. \"Sometimes, we see these people, we don't really know them, but we imagine what they are because they do these extraordinary things.\"\n\nYoung was the offensive line coach during Williams' freshman year and was responsible for developing a big-bodied sophomore who was still new to football: Fashanu. Now 6-foot-6 and 312 pounds, Fashanu went to Gonzaga as a basketball player who was young for his grade. He played on the freshman team before the varsity coaches brought him up the next year, Williams' freshman campaign. Fashanu - who went on to win the 2023 Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year Award - didn't play much. He spent plenty of time in the weight room with Young. Squats, explosion drills and flexibility exercises became his new language.\n\n\"He was like a fresh mold of clay. If we got him right, bending well, kick-stepping well, he was going to be well,\" Young told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nBefore being taken in the same first round, Williams and Fashanu were forever linked by Gonzaga's 2018 Washington Catholic Athletic Conference championship - and \"one of the best moments in Gonzaga history,\" as Kernan put it.\n\nGonzaga entered the playoffs as the No. 4 seed and upset top-seeded St. John's on the road with Fashanu, who became the starting left tackle that season, battling an injury. In the championship against DeMatha Catholic, there were three lead changes in the final 33 seconds, the last of which came on a Hail Mary fired more than 60 yards through the air by Williams and caught by receiver John Marshall as time expired.\n\nThe day before the championship, Gonzaga practiced that play on the same field going in the same direction.\n\n\"We were very poised to make that happen,\" Singh said.\n\nAs Williams climbed the pocket as the final seconds ticked off, Fashanu kicked the pass rush out wide to give his quarterback enough space to unleash his prayer. Gonzaga defeated DeMatha, 46-43.\n\n\"We've been riding the Caleb wave since he threw that Hail Mary,\" Young said.\n\nGonzaga lost in the WCAC semifinals in 2019, Fashanu's senior year and Williams' last season with the school due to the pandemic. More than four years later, they'll share the stage once again, this time in Detroit as NFL draftees.\n\n\"To have this No. 1 pick and another first-round pick, who played together, who are friends, who both developed under the system, who both have gone on and done great things, it would be incredible,\" Kernan said.\n\nFor the two of them to have been teammates and champions has Gonzaga \"buzzing\" this week, Kernan said.\n\n\"They're good friends to this day,\" Young said. \"They still talk. That's just the brotherhood this school supplies.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Odunze, on the other hand, has A-plus character in the same way as his old teammate Trent McDuffie, and projects as a Davante Adams-type of receiver.\"\n\nIf this turns out to be true, the Bears most likely would rather have Odunze.\n\nAt least one of the last-second mock drafts took Caleb Williams quite literally.\n\nIn Detroit on Wednesday, Williams said if he was picking he would draft tackle Olu Fashanu of Penn State at No. 9. Fashanu might be a first-rounder but probably isn't held in the same high regard by mock drafts as Williams holds him.\n\nOf course, that's because Fashanu is his former high school teammate.\n\nBrugler, in the last mock draft, chooses Fashanu for the Bears. So does NFL.com analyst Daniel Jeremiah.\n\n\"I believe the Bears might be interested in trading down from No. 9, which could still put them in the range to land Fashanu,\" Jeremiah wrote. \"Remember, they only have four picks this year. However, if they do stay at No. 9, I expect this will be a selection to support Caleb Williams, whether it's a receiver (Rome Odunze) or offensive tackle.\"\n\nBEARS STADIUM PLAN FACES ECONOMIC CHALLENGES\n\nJeremiah refers to Fashanu as \"..a massive upgrade over incumbent left tackle Braxton Jones.\"\n\nRyan Wilson of CBS Sports also sees Fashanu going ninth, but not to the Bears. He projects a trade down with the Saints, and then the Bears pick defensive tackle Byron Murphy II at No. 14.\n\n\"The Bears could take an edge rusher here and it would make all the sense in the world, or they could take the best defensive player in this class in Byron Murphy II,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nCBS sidekick Josh Edwards is convinced the Bears like Murphy enough to take him at No. 9 without trading back.\n\n\"Chicago took Gervon Dexter and Zacch Pickens a year ago, but Byron Murphy II would give it greater expectations for the position,\" he wrote. \"The Bears defense took a large step forward last season but is now poised to take an even bigger step.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gene_chamberlain@si.com", "name": "Gene Chamberlain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mock draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik_Nabers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Malik Nabers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Odunze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome Odunze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Kiper_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mel Kiper Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schrager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Schrager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Y._Hilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T.

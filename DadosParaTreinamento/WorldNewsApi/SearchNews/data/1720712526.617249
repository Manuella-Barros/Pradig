Rashford managed just eight goals in all competitions for Manchester United last term and has been left out of Gareth Southgate\u2019s 26-man party set to fly out to Germany for this summer\u2019s eagerly anticipated tournament. It\u2019s just the latest setback in a concerning fall from grace for the attacker, who enjoyed his best ever campaign in front of goal in the 2022/23 season after finding the back of the net 30 times in 56 appearances for the Red Devils. After Rashford\u2019s England omission was confirmed, Southgate praised the \u2018maturity\u2019 and \u2018professionalism\u2019 the United star \u2013 capped 60 times by the Three Lions \u2013 displayed when receiving such disappointing news. \u2018Clearly he\u2019s played in a lot of important matches for us and scored a lot of important goals for us,\u2019 the England head coach told reporters. We\u2019ve worked with Marcus for a long, long time which makes those calls harder. Asked how Rashford took the news on the phone, Southgate replied: \u2018Look, I have to say, both him and Jordan Henderson were both incredibly professional and respectful. Rashford managed just eight goals for United last season (Picture: Getty) \u2018I think they know, over a long period of time, that we\u2019ve been very supportive when we\u2019ve needed to be. \u2018They\u2019re not pleasant calls for the boys to receive so I fully understand that. \u2018But they were both very mature.\u2019 Southgate praised Rashford\u2019s reaction to being left out (Picture: Getty) Jones, who shared a dressing room with Rashford for nine years at Old Trafford, believes England could miss his former team-mate\u2019s \u2018brilliance\u2019 and moments of \u2018magic\u2019 in Germany. However, the former United and England defender understands the strength in depth at Southgate\u2019s disposal in attack, with \u2018so many talented players\u2019 battling it out for minutes. \u2018Rashford is the one I would identify as the biggest decision. It\u2019s a tough call, and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the right or wrong call,\u2019 Jones told Ladbrokes 1-2-Free. Former United and England centre-back Jones hung up his boots last year (Picture: Getty) \u2018I always think Marcus \u2013 even if he\u2019s not had the season he\u2019d have liked \u2013 has the ability to do something special. \u2018I know him as a person, and as a player, and I think he could have certainly offered something, especially in games where we\u2019re struggling to break teams down. \u2018You know, he\u2019s got that little bit of brilliance \u2013 that little bit of magic where he can just take it out of his feet, whip one in the top bin and win you the game. \u2018But, again, there are so many talented players to choose from \u2013 so there\u2019s always going to be someone who misses out, and unfortunately it\u2019s him this year.\u2019 Southgate\u2019s England are one of the favourites for Euro 2024 (Picture: Getty) Jones says Rashford is among the finest players he\u2019s ever played with and has \u2018no doubt\u2019 that the forward will return \u2018much better\u2019 next season with United. \u2018Marcus is incredibly talented,\u2019 he added. \u2018He\u2019s one of the best players I\u2019ve ever played with. He\u2019s got a strong mentality, he\u2019s level-headed and he has a good support network around him. \u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come back firing next season\u2026 I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have a good pre-season. \u2018He\u2019s the type of guy who\u2019ll go away this summer and work on himself, making sure he\u2019s in the best possible condition to start next season. \u2018He\u2019ll know there is pressure on him next season, but I have no doubt that he\u2019ll have a much better season than perhaps the one he\u2019s just had.\u2019 For more stories like this, check our sport page.

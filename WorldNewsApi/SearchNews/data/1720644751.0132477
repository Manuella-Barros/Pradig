{"id": 231263362, "title": "I was a drug addict eating out of bins until six words of wisdom changed my life", "text": "A former heroin addict who is preparing for a climb up one of the world's tallest mountains has shared the six words of wisdom which changed his life. Scott Stevenson, a former heroin addict from Castle Vale in the West Midlands, has shared his journey from drug dependency to scaling the Swiss Alps. Now 36, Scott first dabbled in drugs at the age of 13, starting with cannabis and spiralling into a severe addiction that dominated his life. Throughout his twenties, Scott was addicted by heroin and crack cocaine, leading him to resort to shoplifting and scavenging food from bins to fuel his addiction. His darkest days saw him lose touch with his three year old son, face rejection from family and friends, and narrowly escape death following an overdose. Now 36 and five years clean, Scott is dedicating his life to redemption and reconnecting with his two year old daughter. With the help of a Birmingham-based charity, he overcame his addiction and is now eager to give back, advocating for the vital role of drug and alcohol recovery services in the community. At his lowest point, someone told him \"it's not rough at sea forever\", words which stuck with him as he gradually changed his life for the better. Reflecting on his past, Scott told Birmingham Live about his descent into drug use, which began with casual party drugs as a teenager. He said: \"It started with soft stuff - but by 16 I was taking ecstasy and LSD. When I was 21 I tried heroin, even though I always told myself I'd never touch it. I was a heroin addict for ten years - the obsession took over my life. I was committing petty crimes like shoplifting and eating from bins to support my habit. My mental health was terrible - I was in a really dark place.\" \"I lost a lot of friends through overdoses - I had one myself but luckily the paramedics were able to save me. It was horrible but it didn't stop me, I was still addicted to drugs and carried on for years.\" Scott first referred himself to rehab in 2016 but relapsed just months later. He said his drug habit led to him losing contact with his son, who was just three years old at the time. In 2019, Scott turned to the rehab service Right Start in Moseley for support, who assigned him a key worker and put him on a Narcotics Anonymous programme. Five years later, Scott is gearing up to climb the Swiss Alps as part of the charity Climbing Out's Addicts to Alps programme. He said: \"I'm really grateful that I found a way out of that lifestyle. Breaking the cycle was really tough but I'm so proud to be five years sober now. I've now got a daughter and a full-time job. I've also done some amazing things like the Great Birmingham Run, climbed Ben Nevis and I'm running the Great North Run later this year. I'm also hiking the alps over nine days later this year with a big group of people who've all gone through some form of trauma. It's going to be amazing - ten years ago I wouldn't have thought any of this would be possible. When my dealer used to phone me and I'd have to run to pick up the drugs, I'd be panting like a dog - now I'm climbing mountains.\" Scott, a passionate Villa supporter, has called on the government to increase funding for drug and alcohol recovery services as he claims 'addiction is on the rise' nationwide. He aims to motivate others battling any form of addiction with his personal journey. \"I hope my story gives hope to people out there who are struggling with addiction that you don't have to stay trapped in that lifestyle,\" said. \"I've got a daughter now and I'm working to makeup for lost time that I missed out on with my son.\" \"When I was trapped in addiction, I didn't see a way out. There are people out there who can help, but you've really got to want to change. When I was at my worst, I remember someone telling me 'it's not rough at sea forever' - and that bit of wisdom has stayed with me for years. If you're not changing it, you're choosing it - the only time you fail is when you stop trying.\"", "summary": "Scott Stevenson, from Castle Vale in the West Midlands, first took drugs at the age of 13 before spiralling into addiction.

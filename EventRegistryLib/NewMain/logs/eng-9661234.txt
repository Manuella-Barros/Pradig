Republicans will also choose a U.S. Senate nominee to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the fall.\n\nGood knocked on doors Monday in the western part of the district and took part in his own tele-town hall with Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\nGood had endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for the GOP presidential nomination in May 2023. When DeSantis dropped out of the race in January of this year, Good endorsed Trump.\n\nTrump said Good \"despite his name, really has been bad for Virginia and bad for the country, and frankly, he fought us on so many different things that would have been so good.\"\n\nAfter Trump endorsed McGuire in late May, Good responded by releasing a list of two dozen current and former elected officials who support him, including former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and members of the House Freedom Caucus, which Good chairs.\n\nElections With so many choices in primary races, will Virginia consider ranked choice voting? MICHAEL MARTZ Richmond Times-Dispatch\n\nGood also said McGuire's campaign is financed by allies of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, whom he helped oust last fall.\n\n\"I have never been the choice of political power brokers in Washington,\" Good said in a statement at the time. \"The people of Virginia's 5th District know me better than anyone, and I trust them. I believe they will renominate me on June 18, because they understand and appreciate that I have fought for them during my three years in Washington.\"\n\nGood said his supporters \"all know I am the true conservative in this race who is committed to reversing the Biden agenda and putting America back on track to be great again as it was in President Trump's first term.\"\n\nTrump's remarks Monday touched on some of his common campaign themes: a promise to seal the border with Mexico, cut taxes and to \"get critical race theory and gender ideology out of our schools.\"\n\nThe former president also pledged to \"put a very heavy play on Virginia,\" adding, \"I think we're gonna win the state of Virginia.\"\n\nNo Republican has carried Virginia for president since President George W. Bush won reelection in 2004. President Joe Biden beat Trump in Virginia by 10 percentage points in 2020. But last month, a Roanoke College poll found that both Biden and Trump received 42% in a head-to-head matchup in Virginia. With other candidates added, Biden received 40% to Trump's 38%.\n\nAs for McGuire, Trump said Monday, \"He's strong on the border, strong on defeating the drug cartels, and tough on crime like very few people and will always defend your under-siege Second Amendment which is indeed under siege.\"\n\nThe race between Good and McGuire has largely focused on Trump.\n\nTrump last month endorsed McGuire, saying Good \"turned his back on our incredible movement and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently.\"\n\nThis month, Trump's campaign sent a letter to Good's campaign, telling it to stop putting up signs that featured both Good and Trump's names.\n\nGood's eventual endorsement of the former president did not sway Trump.\n\n\"After I won the primaries, he became a big fan, but that's not good enough, because those are the people that tend to leave you very quickly,\" Trump told the tele-rally Monday night.\n\nGood has fired back at McGuire's criticism that he isn't conservative enough for the strongly Republican 5th District, saying he is more conservative than McGuire because McGuire has won support from allies of McCarthy.\n\nIn addition, Good has called McGuire a \"perpetual candidate,\" who has announced multiple bids for Congress in recent years and declared his candidacy for Good's congressional seat less than two weeks after his election to the state Senate last year.\n\nMcGuire, a former Navy SEAL and a three-term member of the House of Delegates, has said in an email to supporters that Good, a two-term member of Congress, has been \"backstabbing Trump again and again.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the state senator campaigned with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, who praised McGuire for his loyalty to Trump.\n\nTwo dozen members of the 5th District Republican Congressional Committee sent a letter to Trump in which they praised Good, attacked McGuire and called the endorsement \"ill-advised.\"\n\nGood has also won endorsements from Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, and other members of the Freedom Caucus, as well as Paul.\n\nSteve Bannon, a former Trump adviser, recently campaigned with Good in Powhatan County.\n\nMcGuire attended Trump's Jan. 6, 2021, \"Stop the Steal\" rally in Washington but said he did not enter the Capitol.

When DeSantis dropped out of the race in January of this year, Good endorsed Trump.\n\nTrump said Good \"despite his name, really has been bad for Virginia and bad for the country, and frankly, he fought us on so many different things that would have been so good.\"\n\nAfter Trump endorsed McGuire in late May, Good responded by releasing a list of two dozen current and former elected officials who support him, including former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and members of the House Freedom Caucus, which Good chairs.\n\nGood also said McGuire's campaign is financed by allies of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., whom he helped oust last fall.\n\n\"I have never been the choice of political power brokers in Washington,\" Good said in a statement at the time. \"The people of Virginia's 5th District know me better than anyone, and I trust them. I believe they will renominate me on June 18, because they understand and appreciate that I have fought for them during my three years in Washington.\"\n\nGood said his supporters \"all know I am the true conservative in this race who is committed to reversing the Biden agenda and putting America back on track to be great again as it was in President Trump's first term.\"\n\nTrump's remarks Monday touched on some of his common campaign themes: a promise to seal the border with Mexico, cut taxes and to \"get critical race theory and gender ideology out of our schools.\"\n\nThe former president also pledged to \"put a very heavy play on Virginia,\" adding, \"I think we're gonna win the state of Virginia.\"\n\nNo Republican has carried Virginia for president since President George W. Bush won reelection in 2004. President Joe Biden beat Trump in Virginia by 10 percentage points in 2020. But last month, a Roanoke College poll found that both Biden and Trump received 42% in a head-to-head matchup in Virginia. With other candidates added, Biden received 40% to Trump's 38%.\n\nAs for McGuire, Trump said Monday, \"He's strong on the border, strong on defeating the drug cartels, and tough on crime like very few people and will always defend your under-siege Second Amendment which is indeed under siege.\"\n\nThe race between Good and McGuire has largely focused on Trump.\n\nTrump last month endorsed McGuire, saying Good \"turned his back on our incredible movement and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently.\"\n\nThis month, Trump's campaign sent a letter to Good's campaign, telling it to stop putting up signs that featured both Good and Trump's names.\n\nGood's eventual endorsement of the former president did not sway Trump.\n\n\"After I won the primaries, he became a big fan, but that's not good enough, because those are the people that tend to leave you very quickly,\" Trump told the tele-rally Monday night.\n\nGood has fired back at McGuire's criticism that he isn't conservative enough for the strongly Republican 5th District, saying he is more conservative than McGuire because McGuire has won support from allies of McCarthy.\n\nIn addition, Good has called McGuire a \"perpetual candidate,\" who has announced multiple bids for Congress in recent years and declared his candidacy for Good's congressional seat less than two weeks after his election to the state Senate last year.\n\nMcGuire, a former Navy SEAL and a three-term member of the House of Delegates, has said in an email to supporters that Good, a two-term member of Congress, has been \"backstabbing Trump again and again.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the state senator campaigned with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who praised McGuire for his loyalty to Trump.\n\nTwo dozen members of the 5th District Republican Congressional Committee sent a letter to Trump in which they praised Good, attacked McGuire and called the endorsement \"ill-advised.\"\n\nGood has also won endorsements from Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and other members of the Freedom Caucus, as well as Sen. Paul.\n\nSteve Bannon, a former Trump adviser, recently campaigned with Good in Powhatan County.\n\nMcGuire attended Trump's Jan. 6, 2021, \"Stop the Steal\" rally in Washington but said he did not enter the Capitol. Good objected to the certification of Biden's 2020 Electoral College victory.\n\nDave Ress (804) 649-6948\n\ndress@timesdispatch.com\n\nMore Coverage\n\nINSIDE: Here's what you need to know about Tuesday's Virginia primaries.

Ron DeSantis over him. He also turned off a number of House colleagues when he voted to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership.\n\nThis week, a fellow Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, even endorsed Good's opponent. The caucus typically likes to put on a united front.\n\nTrump tore into Rep. Bob Good and endorsed his primary challenger John McGuire on Tuesday morning, days after the Freedom Caucus leader went to New York to support him at trial\n\nThe race has attracted more spending by outside groups - $10.7 million - than any other Virginia races. By comparison, the candidates themselves only spent $1.7 million.\n\nSuch groups spent some $5.9 million either opposing Good or supporting McGuire.\n\nMcGuire, a former Navy SEAL, state senator and election denier who attended the 'Stop the Steal' rally on January 6, 2021, had the backing of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who traveled to his district to tell voters Good is a 'traitor' to Trump.\n\nOn the other side, Steve Bannon is backing Good, and told voters in his district 'this isn't about Trump' and the primary challenge was spurred by Good's McCarthy opposition.\n\nTrump conducted a tele-townhall for McGuire on Monday night - the eve of the primary.\n\nThe ex-president also tore into Good days after the Freedom Caucus leader went to New York to support him at trial.\n\n'Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA. He turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement - But really, it was too late,' Trump repeated again on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nGood originally endorsed Ron DeSantis for president before backing Trump when the Florida governor dropped out of the running. But weeks ago Trump endorsed another DeSantis supporter in Congress: Georgia Rep. Rich McCormick.\n\nTrump went on: 'I just want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, and the person that can most help me do that is Navy Seal and highly respected State Legislator, John McGuire, a true American Hero.'\n\nGood pictured with Donald Trump in an old photo\n\n'John, who fought the Cartels on the Front Line, and then came home and fought the drug dealers in Virginia, will ALWAYS PUT AMERICA FIRST.'\n\nGood was one of a handful of right wing lawmakers who traveled to Manhattan on May 16 to support Trump in his criminal trial. McGuire went to New York to court Trump's support that same day.\n\nGood leads the roughly 50-member hard right Freedom Caucus, which is comprised of some of Speaker Mike Johnson's biggest Republican antagonists.\n\nReps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and Chip Roy, R-Texas, have come out in support of Good, Greene has supported his challenger.\n\nRep. Derrick Van Orden traveled to the district to support McGuire - as did Armed Services Chair Mike Rogers. Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows supports Good.\n\n'Bob Good didn't come here to govern. He came here to be famous,' Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican, told CNN. 'Bob Good's wearing our jersey, and he's not on the team.'\n\nGood was one of a handful of right wing lawmakers who traveled to Manhattan on May 16 to support Trump in his criminal trial. McGuire went to New York to court Trump's support that same day\n\nGood has local backing in the district's GOP committee.\n\nRick Buchanan, the chairman of the district's GOP committee, told Cardinal News last month that a Trump endorsement 'wouldn't move the needle that much.'\n\n'If you listen to McGuire's campaign, then yes, [Trump] is the issue, because McGuire has nothing else,' Buchanan said. 'I'm not seeing where he takes a stance on any real issue, except Bob Good's no good, and Bob Good is not a Trump supporter, which is a lie. That's why he's got the name McLiar.'\n\nBuchanan said Good is trying to run to the right of Good, but 'there is no position to the right of Bob.'\n\n'McGuire has no place to run, he has no issues that he can stand on that Bob hasn't already taken a stand on.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Bob Good attempts to fend off a challenge from state Sen. John McGuire, who received endorsements from former President Donald Trump. The outcome of the race could signal the power of Trump's endorsement.\n\nGood, who was first elected to the House in 2020, had antagonized the former president by initially endorsing his presidential primary opponent, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Trump then attacked Good -- an effort to take down the candidate he once endorsed, too.\n\n\"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me,\" Trump said at a rally for McGuire earlier this week.\n\nMORE: High-stakes House primaries in Virginia show fissures across both parties\n\nIn an election year, many are looking at the close race to see the power of Trump's influence and how his endorsement affected the race.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, it's not yet clear if Trump's plan to replace Good with McGuire has panned out. McGuire, who was also endorsed by former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, has a slim lead over Good by a margin of about 300 votes, according to unofficial election results.\n\nGood has not conceded. In a post on X late Tuesday night, Good thanked supporters, saying, \"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help we were able to make this race too close to call.\"\n\nGood said the campaign will aim to closely follow the vote count \"to ensure all the votes are properly counted in the coming days.\"\n\n\"No matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right. Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now,\" Good wrote.\n\nMORE: Trump endorses GOP Rep. Bob Good's primary challenger -- a blow to the House Freedom Caucus chair\n\nBut McGuire has declared victory in the race, striking a different tone than Good.\n\n\"My life is a testament to the fact that America is the greatest country on this planet and I'm so honored to have the chance to serve her again... Folks in the 5th can rest assured that should they elect me in Nov., they will have an effective fighter in Congress who will get the job done for them,\" McGuire wrote in a thread on X.\n\n\"I look forward to working with Trump to beat Joe Biden in November & pass Trump's agenda in Congress. Trump & McGuire will Make America Great Again!\"\n\nEarlier this week, McGuire implied that he thought Good might cheat to win the election or that there could be issues with the election.\n\n\"Let's make this too big to rig tomorrow, so we can lock arms, and make it too big to rig, so we win Virginia for President Trump in November so we can get him back in there and make America great again,\" McGuire said at his rally on Monday.\n\nIn a phone interview with ABC News on Tuesday, McGuire said it would be \"healthy\" to question election results in general when asked about the \"too big to rig\" comments.\n\nWhen pressed to share any specific concerns about the primary, McGuire pointed to confusion among voters about who Trump endorsed.\n\n\"I was at a Food Lion parking lot the other day, and a woman said, 'Well, who did Trump endorse...[you] or Bob Good?' And I said, 'He's endorsed me,'\" McGuire said, adding that Good is trying to \"trick\" voters -- a reference to messaging on Good's website that created some confusion about Trump's endorsement.\n\nBefore Trump made his official endorsement of McGuire, Good was touting Trump's endorsement of him in 2022 on his campaign website. The website was then updated to reflect the caveat that Trump hadn't endorsed Good in his 2024 race.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Good eschewed the trappings of a fancy election night hotel ballroom soiree for a gathering with supporters at an Italian restaurant in a strip-mall filled stretch of Lynchburg, Virginia. Inside La Villa, it was subdued, with the restaurant's normal activity blending with the watch party.\n\nWhen he entered the restaurant over half an hour after polls closed, Good spent his time glad-handing supporters, greeting each table. He hugged and kissed his family, before picking up a family member's baby in a \"Babies for Bob\" bib to continue the tour.\n\nHe spent time sitting, thinking and quietly conferring with his wife. He later left the party without speaking to reporters.\n\nIt is possible that the candidate who ends up trailing could request a recount. Virginia does not have automatic recounts. According to Virginia state law, the losing candidate can request a recount if the vote margin is less than 1% of the votes cast. The state pays if the margin is less than 0.5%; the requester pays if it is more than that.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Good", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGuire_(Virginia_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McGuire (Virginia politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Lion", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food Lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynchburg,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lynchburg, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lynchburg, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Educational_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Educational Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Morality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Morality", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zlqymYOVrH_rkSVhEHNf4w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.abcnews.go.com/e049766372cc7263cc3d07452e724ee8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661234", "eventUri": "eng-9661234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The right-wing Freedom Caucus chair lost the support of the president when he initially endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over him. He also turned off a number of House colleagues when he voted to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership.\n\nThis week, a fellow Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, even endorsed Good's opponent. The caucus typically likes to put on a united front. The race has attracted more spending by outside groups - $10.7 million - than any other Virginia races. By comparison, the candidates themselves only spent $1.7 million. Such groups spent some $5.9 million either opposing Good or supporting McGuire.\n\nMcGuire, a former Navy SEAL, state senator and election denier who attended the 'Stop the Steal' rally on January 6 , 2021, had the backing of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , R-Ga., who traveled to his district to tell voters Good is a 'traitor' to Trump. On the other side, Steve Bannon is backing Good, and told voters in his district 'this isn't about Trump' and the primary challenge was spurred by Good's McCarthy opposition. Trump conducted a tele-townhall for McGuire on Monday night - the eve of the primary.\n\nThe ex-president also tore into Good days after the Freedom Caucus leader went to New York to support him at trial. 'Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA. He turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement - But really, it was too late,' Trump repeated again on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nGood originally endorsed Ron DeSantis for president before backing Trump when the Florida governor dropped out of the running. But weeks ago Trump endorsed another DeSantis supporter in Congress: Georgia Rep. Rich McCormick. Trump went on: 'I just want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, and the person that can most help me do that is Navy Seal and highly respected State Legislator, John McGuire, a true American Hero.' 'John, who fought the Cartels on the Front Line, and then came home and fought the drug dealers in Virginia, will ALWAYS PUT AMERICA FIRST.'\n\nGood was one of a handful of right wing lawmakers who traveled to Manhattan on May 16 to support Trump in his criminal trial. McGuire went to New York to court Trump's support that same day. Good leads the roughly 50-member hard right Freedom Caucus, which is comprised of some of Speaker Mike Johnson's biggest Republican antagonists.\n\nReps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and Chip Roy, R-Texas, have come out in support of Good, Greene has supported his challenger. Rep. Derrick Van Orden traveled to the district to support McGuire - as did Armed Services Chair Mike Rogers. Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows supports Good.\n\n'Bob Good didn't come here to govern. He came here to be famous,' Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican, told CNN. 'Bob Good's wearing our jersey, and he's not on the team.' Good has local backing in the district's GOP committee. Rick Buchanan, the chairman of the district's GOP committee, told Cardinal News last month that a Trump endorsement 'wouldn't move the needle that much.'\n\n'If you listen to McGuire's campaign, then yes, [Trump] is the issue, because McGuire has nothing else,' Buchanan said. 'I'm not seeing where he takes a stance on any real issue, except Bob Good's no good, and Bob Good is not a Trump supporter, which is a lie. That's why he's got the name McLiar.' Buchanan said Good is trying to run to the right of Good, but 'there is no position to the right of Bob.' 'McGuire has no place to run, he has no issues that he can stand on that Bob hasn't already taken a stand on.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

John McGuire, a former Navy SEAL, in a race that has highlighted a divide within the Trump faction of the GOP.\n\nThe Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan election tracker, rates the race \"Solid Republican,\" so the winner of the Republican primary is almost certain to win the general election in Southside Virginia.\n\nGood, running for his fifth term, lost the support of both Kevin McCarthy-aligned Republicans in the wake of his vote to oust McCarthy as speaker and former President Donald Trump, after he endorsed the former president's primary opponent, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nGood later endorsed Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but not soon enough for Trump, who posted on Truth Social, \"It was too late\" -- and then endorsed his primary challenger.\n\n\"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA,\" Trump wrote, adding, \"I just want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, and the person that can most help me do that is Navy Seal and highly respected State Legislator, John McGuire, a true American Hero.\"\n\nAt a telerally for McGuire on Monday night, Trump said, \"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me.\"\n\nMcGuire has also been knocking Good in ads for his disloyalty to Trump. In a recent ad, McGuire is holding a rifle while a narrator says, \"Trump doesn't need another backstabber in Congress. He needs John McGuire -- a straight shooter who always has his six.\"\n\nMcGuire not only has the former president's support but also has been endorsed by other Trump-aligned Republicans including Reps.

Jen Kiggans of Virginia, who has even helped fundraise for Good's challenger.\n\nBut Good still has a swath of endorsements from congressional Republicans like Reps. Matt Gaetz and Byron Donald of Florida and Virginia Rep. Ben Cline.\n\nOutside groups, including Club for Growth and the House Freedom Fund, also donated millions to promote Good's reelection bid while others -- some with ties to McCarthy -- spent millions trying to oust him. McGuire also narrowly outraised Good, $1.2 million to $1.1 million, according to May federal election documents.\n\nThis will be McCarthy's second attempt to unseat one of the lawmakers who voted to oust him.

John McGuire. a former Navy SEAL, in a race that highlighted a divide within the Trump faction of the GOP.\n\nThe winner of the Republican primary will almost certainly win the general election in the Southside Virginia district. The nonpartisan election tracker Cook Political Report calls the race \"solid Republican.\"\n\nGood, running for his fifth term, lost the support of both Republicans aligned with Kevin McCarthy following his vote to oust McCarthy as speaker and former President Donald Trump, after supporting the primary opponent former president, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\nGood then endorsed Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but not soon enough for Trump, who posted on Truth Social: \"It was too late\" -- and then endorsed his primary challenger.\n\n\"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA AND BAD FOR THE UNITED STATES,\" Trump wrote, adding: \"I just want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, and the person who can most help me do that is Navy Seal and highly respected state legislator John McGuire, a true American hero.\"\n\nDuring a conference call for McGuire Monday night, Trump said, \"If he's re-elected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back, much like he did to me.\"\n\nMcGuire also criticized Good in advertisements for his disloyalty to Trump. In a recent ad, McGuire holds a rifle while a narrator says, \"Trump doesn't need another traitor in Congress. He needs John McGuire - a straight shooter who always has his six.\"\n\nMcGuire not only has the support of the former president, but has also been endorsed by other Trump-aligned Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Freedom Caucus member Warren Davidson. Some of Good's Republican colleagues in Washington came to the district to support McGuire, including Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, who even helped raise money for Good's challenger.\n\nBut Good still has the support of many congressional Republicans like Reps. Matt Gaetz and Byron Donald of Florida and Virginia Rep. Ben Cline.\n\nOutside groups also poured money into this race to boost Good's reelection, while others -- including some with ties to McCarthy -- spent millions trying to unseat him. McGuire also trailed Good, by $1.2 million to $1.1 million, according to May federal election filings.\n\nThis will be McCarthy's second attempt to unseat one of the lawmakers who voted for him. He failed to unseat Rep. Nancy Mace, who won her primary last week.\n\nMore\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Bob Good, leader of the anti-Republican-establishment House Freedom Caucus, is running up against a challenger bolstered by the endorsements of Trump and former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy. On Tuesday, voters will signal which brand of conservatism they prefer.\n\nAnd with Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger vacating her 7th district seat to run for governor, former Army colonel Yevgeny \"Eugene\" Vindman, who rose to prominence during Trump's first impeachment trial, has moved to the top of a crowded field of local electeds by highlighting his role in protecting democracy from the former president.\n\nThe Republican primary in Virginia's 5th district\n\nGood's willingness to push against his party's establishment has garnered him political power in Congress, but it also brought him a tough primary challenge, and has shown a schism within the more conservative wing of the party.\n\nGood, who was first elected to the House in 2020, is facing state Sen. John McGuire, a primary opponent endorsed by former President Donald Trump and financially backed by Defending Main Street, the pro-incumbent PAC that claims responsibility for ousting former Republican Rep. Steve King.\n\nGood has not been afraid to make enemies in his party, voting to oust former Speaker McCarthy and initially endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' bid for president, though he flipped to Trump after DeSantis dropped out.\n\nGood has also attempted to get back in Trump's good graces, traveling up to New York to attend the former president's hush-money trial -- the same day McGuire also made the same trip.\n\n\"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA. He turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement - But really, it was too late,\" Trump posted on Truth Social in May.\n\nHe added, \"John McGuire has my Complete and Total Endorsement!\" He posted the attack on Good again on Wednesday.\n\nGood had also received a cease-and-desist from Trump's campaign after using his name and image in campaign material.\n\n\"Trump's endorsement represents a huge advantage for McGuire, and that's why Good has tried to suggest that he is actually the favorite of the former president,\" Stephen J. Farnsworth, professor of political science and international affairs at the University of Mary Washington, told ABC News by email. \"While prominent Republicans have split in their preferences in this contest, none of them has anything like the influence with Republican primary voters that the former president has.\"\n\nThe ire Good has drawn has landed him in a vulnerable position. McGuire has outraised Good and holds more cash on hand, according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission (FEC) records by OpenSecrets. The state senator has also benefited from slightly more outside spending, OpenSecrets found.\n\nGood still has the support of groups such as the conservative organization, Club for Growth and Trump-aligned members such as Republican Rep. Byron Donalds.\n\nHe has also portrayed himself as a known quantity to his constituents.\n\n\"They can trust me; they know that I'm a consistent conservative. They know that I'm the same thing publicly as I am privately, and I think they like that I've been fighting for them,\" Good told Roanoke, Virginia, TV station WDBJ earlier in June.\n\nMcGuire, meanwhile, has slammed Good for portraying himself as a Trump-aligned conservative.\n\n\"We found out that Bob is not who he says he is ... All over the district, people are saying, 'thank you for giving us a choice.' And the people of the district are the ones that asked me to do this. And they basically said, 'John, you're the only one who can beat them,'\" McGuire told Lynchburg, Virginia, ABC affiliate WSET.\n\nThe fight between Good and McGuire has split Republicans both at the national and at the hyperlocal level.\n\nFor instance, there are signs of a fissure in the House Freedom Caucus itself. Republican Rep. Warren Davidson, a self-identified member of the House Freedom Caucus, endorsed McGuire on Sunday, writing in a statement shared by McGuire's campaign, \"I've served in Congress since 2016, and we need reinforcements to help Make America Great Again ... [McGuire] will work well with others to deliver conservative results.\"\n\nAnd at the local level, some Republican leaders from the district have pushed back against Trump's endorsement. The Charlottesville Daily Progress and other local outlets reported that 5th District Republican Congressional Committee Chair Rich Buchanan and other local Republican leaders wrote an open letter to Trump asking him to reconsider his endorsement of McGuire.\n\n\"Congressman Bob Good has championed America First policies ... Congressman Good's opponent is relying on millions of dollars from outside Virginia to support his candidacy,\" they wrote.\n\nABC News has reached out to Buchanan for comment.\n\nThe district includes a wide swath of the southern part of the state, including the cities of Charlottesville and Lynchburg, and Cook Political Report rates the seat as likely to safely stay in Republican hands.\n\nThe Democratic primary in Virginia's 7th district\n\nIn 2018, Eugene Vindman helped his twin brother Alexander -- both staffers for the National Security Council under Trump -- blow the whistle on a phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Hunter Biden's business dealings there. The Vindmans' efforts launched the first of Trump's two impeachment trials and catapulted Alexander and, to a lesser extent, Eugene into the national spotlight.\n\nNow, propelled by name recognition, a campaign war chest much larger than his competitors', and military bona fides -- many members of the armed forces call the district home -- Eugene Vindman appears poised to secure the Democratic party's nomination in the tightly-contested swing district. Per FEC filings, Vindman has raised more than $5 million -- and amount that's more than all of his challengers combined.\n\n\"I sacrificed my military career to expose Trump's corruption,\" Vindman said in a campaign ad. \"Now I'm running for Congress to get things done.\"\n\nAs Vindman's four leading opponents have been quick to point out, though, they each have something he does not: experience governing. Two -- Andrea Bailey and Margaret Franklin -- currently serve as Prince William County supervisors, and, until recently, two others -- Elizabeth Guzman and Briana Sewell -- served as members of Virginia's House of Delegates. Guzman narrowly lost a primary after redistricting; Sewell remains in office.\n\nThat's not all that differentiates Vindman and the field. Vindman, who is white, is running alongside three Black women and a Hispanic woman in a diversifying suburban district where roughly 35% of the population is not white, according to 2020 Census data.\n\n\"He does not understand the community. He's not very infused in the community. He's not been participating in the community as an advocate,\" Bailey told the Associated Press.\n\n\"Vindman has three advantages going into this primary: he is very well-liked among Democratic activists and donors, he has a military background ... and he is running as part of a large field where the people who do not support him will splinter in a variety of directions,\" Farnsworth told ABC News.\n\nIf he secures the nomination, Vindman will likely draw a stark contrast with the Republican nominee.\n\nThe Republican primary for Virginia's 7th district, which will also take place Tuesday, features nearly as many candidates and two frontrunners: Derrick Anderson, a former Army Green Beret who has received support from GOP leadership and finished second in the 2022 primary; and Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL with the backing of the House Freedom Caucus.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP) -- One of America's most conservative congressmen was locked in a tight renomination battle against an opponent endorsed by former President Donald Trump in Virginia's primary election Tuesday.\n\nRep. Bob Good, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, is seeking a third term representing Virginia's 5th Congressional District, but state Sen. John McGuire has mounted a strong challenge that highlights frictions in the party.\n\nBallots remained to be counted, and the close margin made the race too early to call. Virginia observes the Juneteenth holiday and isn't expected to count votes Wednesday as a result. McGuire led Good by 327 votes, or 0.52 percentage points, out of 62,495 ballots counted as of 12 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats in northern and central Virginia chose nominees to replace popular incumbents who aren't seeking reelection. In House District 7, Eugene Vindman won a crowded Democratic primary to try to hold the seat being vacated by U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor in 2025, while Republicans chose Derrick Anderson.\n\nAnd in House District 10, voters chose Suhas Subramanyam from a field of 12 Democrats to try to hold the seat held by U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, who is not seeking reelection to her northern Virginia seat after being diagnosed with a rare, incurable neurological illness. Republican voters nominated Mike Clancy for that seat.\n\nStatewide, voters selected Hung Cao as the Republican nominee to the U.S. Senate to take on Democrat Tim Kaine.\n\nHere's a look at the major battles on the ballot:\n\nHouse District 5\n\nConventional politics might suggest a congressman with the conservative credentials of Good would be safe in a primary. But he earned the wrath of Trump when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president. He switched back to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but Trump is endorsing McGuire and portraying Good as a backstabber.\n\nTrump continued to bash Good as he campaigned for McGuire in a telephone rally Monday night.\n\n\"Unlike Bob Good, John McGuire will not let you down,\" Trump said, adding that McGuire is \"strong on the border\" and \"will always defend your under-siege Second Amendment.\"\n\nGood says he considers Trump the best president in his lifetime and only endorsed DeSantis because Trump is constitutionally limited to only one more term.\n\nMcGuire, for his part, claimed victory late Tuesday and thanked Trump for \"believing in me.\" No winner has been called by The Associated Press.\n\n\"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory,\" McGuire said in a written statement.\n\nGood, meanwhile, posted a statement on social media saying his campaign \"implemented the best early voting operation that the 5th District has ever seen.\"\n\n\"We are still waiting for the results of mail-in ballots and provisional ballots,\" he said. \"We are doing what we can to ensure we have teams of observers and legal counsel to ensure all the votes are properly counted in the coming days.\"\n\nGood also alienated Republican insiders by voting to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, throwing the party into a measure of chaos.\n\nSeeking to capitalize is McGuire, a state legislator and former Navy SEAL who has echoed Trump's attacks on Good, calling him a \"never Trumper.\"\n\nGood has bashed McGuire as a serial campaigner who announced his congressional bid just one week after winning election to a four-year term in the state Senate.\n\nIf Good loses, he would be the first House incumbent to go down to a primary challenge this year, with the exception of one race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\nThe winner will face Democrat Gloria Tinsley Witt, who defeated Gary Terry and Paul Riley.\n\nThe 5th Congressional District stretches from Charlottesville in the north, past the far western suburbs of Richmond, through Lynchburg and down to Danville and the North Carolina border.\n\nHouse District 7\n\nVindman, a political newcomer who was nonetheless familiar to voters for his role in Trump's first impeachment, has won the Democratic nomination in the 7th Congressional District for what will be a closely watched congressional seat in November.\n\nVindman, who crushed his opponents in fundraising, won in a crowded seven-person field that included four women of color who were all current or former officeholders in Prince William County, a suburban area outside the nation's capital that constitutes the largest portion of the district.\n\nThe former Army officer gained a measure of fame when he and his twin brother, Alex, reported their concerns about Trump's 2019 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which Trump sought an investigation of Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nVindman highlighted his opposition to Trump in his campaign and in a victory statement issued Tuesday evening said, \"our grass-roots movement is coming for the extreme MAGA agenda. Virginia voters are first and foremost values driven, and want to elect leaders with integrity who preserve fundamental rights and freedoms and not extremists.\"\n\nHe faced criticism from some local officials who said he was unconnected to the region's political dynamics.\n\nIn a battle between a former Army Green Beret and a former Navy SEAL, Republican voters chose the Army man, Anderson, over Navy veteran Cameron Hamilton.\n\nAnderson and Hamilton were the top two fundraisers in a six-person field. Anderson drew support from House GOP leadership in Washington, while Hamilton had support from members of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe district, which stretches from Prince William County south to Fredericksburg and west past Culpeper, tilts just slightly toward Democrats.\n\nHouse District 10\n\nSubramanyam defeated fellow Democratic candidates former Virginia House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, state Sens. Dan Helmer and Jennifer Boysko, and former Virginia Education Secretary Atif Qarni. Wexton endorsed Subramanyam.\n\nRepublican voters chose Clancy from a field of four candidates.\n\nHouse District 2\n\nIn Virginia's coastal 2nd Congressional District, Missy Cotter Smasal, a Navy veteran who runs a nonprofit that honors fallen servicewomen, defeated Jeremiah \"Jake\" Denton IV, a constitutional law and civil rights attorney, in the Democratic primary.\n\nShe'll face Republican U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans in November.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday evening, Smasal took aim at Kiggans and \"the MAGA extremism she supports in Congress.\"\n\n\"I will protect abortion rights and access for all and fight for resources for veterans and military families,\" Smasal said. \"I will always defend democracy and reject party extremism.\"\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nIn the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, Navy veteran Cao prevailed over his four opponents for a chance to try to unseat Kaine, a Democrat who is seeking his third term as the state's junior U.S. senator.\n\nCao had the most money and previous campaign experience running for higher officer among the Republican primary contenders. He also had Trump's endorsement.\n\nIn a victory post on Facebook, Cao immediately criticized President Joe Biden's decision on Tuesday to allow certain U.S. citizens' spouses without legal status to apply eventually for citizenship.\n\n\"Tomorrow, we begin our campaign to save the country that saved my life,\" Cao stated. \"I spent twenty-five years in the Navy, while Tim Kaine spent thirty years in elected office.\"\n\nCao defeated Scott Parkinson, a former congressional staffer for DeSantis, as well as Jonathan Emord, an author and lawyer who often cites his court battles against the Food and Drug Administration. The other Republican candidates were Eddie Garcia, a U.S. Army veteran who owns a mobile app that serves veterans, and Chuck Smith, a former Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps commander and an attorney.\n\nFinley contributed to this report from Norfolk.\n\nMatthew Barakat And Ben Finley, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "princegeorgecitizen.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Prince

Bob Good and Virginia state Sen. John McGuire, the results will reverberate among House Republicans.\n\nIf Good goes down, he would be the first sitting chair in the influential group's nearly decade-long history to be defeated -- a loss that would embolden critics of the increasingly fractious bloc.\n\nBut if he wins, he'll have done it despite strong opposition from former (and possibly future) President Donald Trump and only mild backing from Republican leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson -- signaling friction ahead. \"Mike Johnson has done nothing to help me in my race,\" Good said in a Friday interview after campaigning outside the Louisa County courthouse.\n\nMcGuire boasts the backing of more than a half-dozen high-profile colleagues of Good's in the House GOP. And after telling supporters outside the courthouse on Friday that McGuire and his backers misled Trump to win the former president's support, Good said in an interview: \"There's people in the [former] president's ear who have their own agenda, and they're dishonest, and they've lied to him about me.\"\n\nHe wouldn't elaborate on the nature of those alleged lies beyond claiming he's consistently supported Trump since 2016; Trump has made clear that Good's early backing of Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) in the presidential primary helped prompt his endorsement of McGuire.\n\nRep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.), a Freedom Caucus member who's backing Good, said that if Good's opponents are \"able to take out the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, it will send a definite message to other conservatives that want [to] challenge the status quo and make big moves.\"\n\nBut if Good survives McGuire's challenge, his allies predict he'll emerge from the fight even more emboldened. Good may even have time to exact revenge should McGuire win the primary -- there's still a lot of legislating left to do this Congress and a lot of opportunities for him to cause trouble for the party's fractured two-vote House majority.\n\nIn the run-up to primary day, the district was blanketed by competing Good vs. McGuire events. More than two dozen Hill GOP staffers led by Rep. William Timmons (R-S.C.) chartered a bus from Washington on Saturday to meet with and campaign for McGuire, a former Navy SEAL.\n\nIt was an unorthodox move by Timmons, but a clear revenge play. Good had backed the primary challenger Timmons defeated just a few days prior, so the South Carolina lawmaker decided to personally tell Virginia voters about their representative's polarizing reputation within his party.\n\nAmong quite a few GOP colleagues, Good is nicknamed \"Bob Bad\" for what they call his abrasive criticism of fellow Republicans, and the blowback he's received lately is a testament to the number of colleagues who consider themselves enemies. Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy -- whom Good voted to oust last fall -- and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) are among the Republican players backing McGuire.\n\nThe most talked-about McGuire endorser, of course, is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Trump's campaign sent a cease-and-desist letter last month seeking to block Good's campaign from putting the two men's names together on signs. But the Good team kept using and touting signs with Trump's name -- to criticism from McGuire, who said in an interview that Good is trying to \"trick people.\"\n\nAsked about the flap over his Trump-themed signs, Good replied: \"I'm not talking about stupid topics. That's a stupid topic.\"\n\nHe may be onto something among his local base. Three Good supporters at his event, including Louisa Mayor Garland Nuckols, lauded the incumbent's willingness to fight for conservative principles and largely shrugged off the attacks on Good from the former president they support. Good's supporters in the district include a strong contingent of local elected officials in the district McGuire represents in the state Senate.\n\nA group of 24 Virginia GOP leaders led by Rick Buchanan, chair of the 5th District Republican Congressional Committee, have \"strongly urged\" Trump to reconsider his backing of McGuire over Good.\n\nMcGuire countered that some of those Good endorsements are retribution from state officials he hadn't supported during their own contested races.\n\n\"I have focused more on getting the people to endorse me,\" McGuire said in a Saturday interview. \"Like Trump -- he goes for the common man.\"\n\nThe list of recriminations between the two Republican campaigns gets longer still: Good supporters ding McGuire for declining to debate and accuse him of being a ladder-climber who jumped quickly from his state Senate seat to challenging Good.\n\nMcGuire, who ran for a House seat in 2020 against Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) before dropping out, said he was encouraged to take on Good while on the campaign trail for state Senate.\n\n\"The whole time I'm campaigning, people are like this,\" McGuire said, pulling on his own shirt sleeve for effect. \"'I know you are running for state Senate, but you are the only guy who [can] beat that guy. He's a tyrant. He's really mean.\"\n\nThe race for the south central Virginia district has drawn a whopping $14.5 million in ad spending, mostly from super PACs. That includes some tied to allies of McCarthy, who went after Good as part of a nationwide vengeance push against the fellow Republicans who voted to end his speakership.\n\nGood's allies have spent roughly $5.4 million, while pro-McGuire forces have spent $7.5 million, according to data from the media tracking firm AdImpact. McGuire's campaign has spent nearly $1.5 million on ads, while Good has spent only a few thousand dollars on radio spots.\n\nMcGuire has tried to leverage his big advantage on TV to stress his Trump endorsement in a district that the former president won by more than 8 points in 2020. It is also mentioned often on his campaign materials, including T-shirts and signs.\n\nAnd while Good is trying to portray the race as the establishment \"swamp\" attacking a conservative who fought it, he's also avoided acknowledging his own role in his current predicament -- specifically, his repeated willingness to do the exact sort of Republican-versus-Republican campaigning that he's criticizing his own colleagues for.\n\nGood has also sought to portray any attacks on him as attacks on the Freedom Caucus and its policies.\n\nMembers like Timmons disagree. To them, it's personal.\n\n\"It is not because I don't agree with Bob Good on policies,\" Timmons said last week, ahead of his door-knocking trip to Good's district. \"It is because of his tactics. Such a critical part of this job is earning your colleagues' respect and their trust. And he is a bad advocate because of his tactics, not because of his policies.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Bob Good (R) is still fighting for his political life the day after polls closed in Virginia.\n\nThe bitter race between Good, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, and his primary challenger, John McGuire -- a state senator who won the coveted endorsement of former President Trump -- remained too close to call as of Wednesday afternoon, with McGuire holding a razor-thin edge over Good.\n\nMcGuire is leading Good by just 307 votes -- or 0.4 percent -- with 95 percent of the vote in, according to results from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ. More than 62,000 voters cast ballots in the race to represent Virginia's 5th Congressional District.\n\nThe contest is almost certainly headed to a recount: Virginia law allows candidates to request a recount if the margin is less than 1 percent.\n\nGood expressed confidence Wednesday morning that he has a path to victory, but he warned that the final stretch of counting could take weeks.\n\n\"Provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are also still to be counted. We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed,\" Good wrote on social platform X. \"We believe we can still prevail.\"\n\nMcGuire, meanwhile, encouraged by his late lead Tuesday night, went ahead and declared victory in a room full of supporters, taking a page from Trump's 2020 election playbook.\n\n\"Ladies and gentleman, the votes are in and the people have spoken: It is an honor to be your Republican nominee for the 5th Congressional District,\" McGuire declared, prompting cheers.\n\nHe echoed that sentiment overnight Wednesday, writing on X: \"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory.\"\n\nCounting could be at least delayed until Thursday. Virginia observes the federal Juneteenth holiday, so ballots are not expected to be tallied Wednesday, according to The Associated Press.\n\nGood, however, is optimistic that he will take the edge as more votes are counted.\n\nA handful of counties in the Old Dominion had a fair portion of outstanding ballots as of Wednesday morning, with both Good and McGuire leading in some of the areas.\n\nA source close to the Good campaign told The Hill that they are closely watching returns in Albemarle County and Lynchburg, both of which the incumbent has a leg up in.\n\nIn Albemarle, Good has a 523 vote -- or 9.4 point -- edge over McGuire with much of the county reporting. Over in Lynchburg, Good is hanging on to an 842 vote -- or 16.4 percent -- lead over McGuire.\n\n\"This race remains too close to call,\" Good wrote on X Wednesday. \"We are in a period where the law provides a process for evaluating the accuracy of all the vote totals from election day to ensure everyone can have full confidence in the certified results.\"\n\nThe battle in Virginia's 5th Congressional District -- Tuesday's marquee race -- has drawn national headlines for months, both for its intense interest inside the Beltway and heavy spending.\n\nTrump and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) both endorsed McGuire after Good crossed them -- Good initially backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential primary, and he voted to oust McCarthy from the top job -- earning the incumbent the ire of two GOP heavyweights, their supporters, and their war chests.\n\nTrump declared in a Truth Social post on the eve of the primary election that \"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA,\" and he participated in a tele-rally for McGuire, where he warned that if Good is elected the incumbent he \"will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me.\"\n\nMcCarthy's Majority Committee PAC, meanwhile, funneled $10,000 to McGuire's campaign, looking to knock off the first of eight Republicans who voted to remove him from the Speakership. He faced his first defeat last week after Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), who voted to remove McCarthy, reigned supreme in her primary.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), another GOP firebrand, joined Trump and McCarthy in backing McGuire, while other Freedom Caucus members on Capitol Hill backed their chair, including Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas), Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).\n\nGood nodded to that opposition against him in an election night post on X, writing: \"No matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right.\"\n\n\"Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now,\" he added.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Bob Good attempts to fend off a challenge from state Sen. John McGuire, who received endorsements from former President Donald Trump. The outcome of the race could signal the power of Trump's endorsement.\n\nGood, who was first elected to the House in 2020, had antagonized the former president by initially endorsing his presidential primary opponent, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Trump then attacked Good -- an effort to take down the candidate he once endorsed, too.\n\n\"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me,\" Trump said at a rally for McGuire earlier this week.\n\nIn an election year, many are looking at the close race to see the power of Trump's influence and how his endorsement affected the race.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, it's not yet clear if Trump's plan to replace Good with McGuire has panned out. McGuire, who was also endorsed by former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, has a slim lead over Good by a margin of about 300 votes, according to unofficial election results.\n\nGood has not conceded. In a post on X late Tuesday night, Good thanked supporters, saying, \"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help we were able to make this race too close to call.\"\n\nGood said the campaign will aim to closely follow the vote count \"to ensure all the votes are properly counted in the coming days.\"\n\n\"No matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right. Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now,\" Good wrote.\n\nBut McGuire has declared victory in the race, striking a different tone than Good.\n\n\"My life is a testament to the fact that America is the greatest country on this planet and I'm so honored to have the chance to serve her again... Folks in the 5th can rest assured that should they elect me in Nov., they will have an effective fighter in Congress who will get the job done for them,\" McGuire wrote in a thread on X.\n\n\"I look forward to working with Trump to beat Joe Biden in November & pass Trump's agenda in Congress. Trump & McGuire will Make America Great Again!\"\n\nEarlier this week, McGuire implied that he thought Good might cheat to win the election or that there could be issues with the election.\n\n\"Let's make this too big to rig tomorrow, so we can lock arms, and make it too big to rig, so we win Virginia for President Trump in November so we can get him back in there and make America great again,\" McGuire said at his rally on Monday.\n\nIn a phone interview with ABC News on Tuesday, McGuire said it would be \"healthy\" to question election results in general when asked about the \"too big to rig\" comments.\n\nWhen pressed to share any specific concerns about the primary, McGuire pointed to confusion among voters about who Trump endorsed.\n\n\"I was at a Food Lion parking lot the other day, and a woman said, 'Well, who did Trump endorse...[you] or Bob Good?' And I said, 'He's endorsed me,'\" McGuire said, adding that Good is trying to \"trick\" voters -- a reference to messaging on Good's website that created some confusion about Trump's endorsement.\n\nBefore Trump made his official endorsement of McGuire, Good was touting Trump's endorsement of him in 2022 on his campaign website. The website was then updated to reflect the caveat that Trump hadn't endorsed Good in his 2024 race.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Good eschewed the trappings of a fancy election night hotel ballroom soiree for a gathering with supporters at an Italian restaurant in a strip-mall filled stretch of Lynchburg, Virginia. Inside La Villa, it was subdued, with the restaurant's normal activity blending with the watch party.\n\nWhen he entered the restaurant over half an hour after polls closed, Good spent his time glad-handing supporters, greeting each table. He hugged and kissed his family, before picking up a family member's baby in a \"Babies for Bob\" bib to continue the tour.\n\nHe spent time sitting, thinking and quietly conferring with his wife. He later left the party without speaking to reporters.\n\nIt is possible that the candidate who ends up trailing could request a recount. Virginia does not have automatic recounts. According to Virginia state law, the losing candidate can request a recount if the vote margin is less than 1% of the votes cast. The state pays if the margin is less than 0.5%; the requester pays if it is more than that.", "source": {"uri": "abc7ny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7 New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Good", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGuire_(Virginia_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McGuire (Virginia politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Lion", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food Lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynchburg,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lynchburg, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lynchburg, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Educational_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Educational Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Morality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Morality", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/john-mcguire-2-ap-bb-240619_1718806157532_hpMain_16x9_608.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661234", "eventUri": "eng-9661234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

More than 62,000 voters cast ballots in the race to represent Virginia's 5th Congressional District.\n\nThe contest is almost certainly headed to a recount: Virginia law allows candidates to request a recount if the margin is less than 1 percent.\n\nGood expressed confidence Wednesday morning that he has a path to victory, but he warned that the final stretch of counting could take weeks.\n\n\"Provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are also still to be counted. We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed,\" Good wrote on social platform X. \"We believe we can still prevail.\"\n\nMcGuire, meanwhile, encouraged by his late lead Tuesday night, went ahead and declared victory in a room full of supporters, taking a page from Trump's 2020 election playbook.\n\n\"Ladies and gentleman, the votes are in and the people have spoken: It is an honor to be your Republican nominee for the 5th Congressional District,\" McGuire declared, prompting cheers.\n\nHe echoed that sentiment overnight Wednesday, writing on X: \"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory.\"\n\nCounting could be at least delayed until Thursday. Virginia observes the federal Juneteenth holiday, so ballots are not expected to be tallied Wednesday, according to The Associated Press.\n\nGood, however, is optimistic that he will take the edge as more votes are counted.\n\nA handful of counties in the Old Dominion had a fair portion of outstanding ballots as of Wednesday morning, with both Good and McGuire leading in some of the areas.\n\nA source close to the Good campaign told The Hill that they are closely watching returns in Albemarle County and Lynchburg, both of which the incumbent has a leg up in.\n\nIn Albemarle, Good has a 523 vote -- or 9.4 point -- edge over McGuire with much of the county reporting. Over in Lynchburg, Good is hanging on to an 842 vote -- or 16.4 percent -- lead over McGuire.\n\n\"This race remains too close to call,\" Good wrote on X Wednesday. \"We are in a period where the law provides a process for evaluating the accuracy of all the vote totals from election day to ensure everyone can have full confidence in the certified results.\"\n\nThe battle in Virginia's 5th Congressional District -- Tuesday's marquee race -- has drawn national headlines for months, both for its intense interest inside the Beltway and heavy spending.\n\nTrump and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) both endorsed McGuire after Good crossed them -- Good initially backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential primary, and he voted to oust McCarthy from the top job -- earning the incumbent the ire of two GOP heavyweights, their supporters, and their war chests.\n\nTrump declared in a Truth Social post on the eve of the primary election that \"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA,\" and he participated in a tele-rally for McGuire, where he warned that if Good is elected the incumbent he \"will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me.\"\n\nMcCarthy's Majority Committee PAC, meanwhile, funneled $10,000 to McGuire's campaign, looking to knock off the first of eight Republicans who voted to remove him from the Speakership. He faced his first defeat last week after Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), who voted to remove McCarthy, reigned supreme in her primary.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), another GOP firebrand, joined Trump and McCarthy in backing McGuire, while other Freedom Caucus members on Capitol Hill backed their chair, including Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas), Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).\n\nGood nodded to that opposition against him in an election night post on X, writing: \"No matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right.\"\n\n\"Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now,\" he added.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Tim Kaine (D-VA) come November, and that Eugene Vindman could be headed to Congress after his primary win, the results of Virginia's 5th Congressional District are still too close to call. The race has led to considerable chatter in the news and over social media.\n\nRepublican Rep. Bob Good, who also chairs the House Freedom Caucus (HFC), faces a primary challenge from state Sen. John McGuire, who has the backing of former and potentially future President Donald Trump. While McGuire claimed victory late on Tuesday night, Good hasn't conceded. In fact, it looks like the race could be headed for a recount.\n\nMcGuire isn't the only one to recognize himself as the Republican nominee. Republicans from all factions, including Reps. Don Bacon (NE) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA), have already congratulated him.\n\nLate on Wednesday morning, Good posted to X a reminder that the race has not yet been called. Despite McGuire declaring victory, Good doesn't look to be giving up. \"We believe we can still prevail,\" his post mentioned in part.\n\n\"This race remains too close to call,\" he started off by reminding and also pointing out that provisional and mail-in ballots are also still being counted.\n\nGood made headlines last October when he was one of eight Republicans to vote with all Democrats to oust now-former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA). One of those members, Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado has since resigned, though Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina was able to easily fend off a primary challenger of her own last week.\n\nHowever, Good also made the move to endorse Florida's Gov. Ron DeSantis in the Republican presidential primary, which Trump didn't take too kindly to. Last Thursday, when Trump visited with Republican members at the Capitol Hill Club, Good was in attendance, and Trump looks to have made reference to his presence.\n\nGood, however, did show up to the New York City courthouse to show his support for Trump last month, even showing up beside McGuire. Trump was ultimately convicted of 34 felonies on May 30, and Good almost immediately after released a statement in support of the former president.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, McGuire looks to be slightly ahead by 0.4 percent and hundreds of votes. According to DecisionDesk HQ, which again, has not yet called the race, McGuire is at 50.2 percent with 31,380 votes, while Good has 49.8 percent, with 31,073 votes.\n\n\"If the margin stays within 1 percentage point, the losing candidate can request a recount within 10 days after the election results are certified, according to Virginia state law,\" NBC News reported about the race.", "source":

Bob Good, leader of the anti-Republican-establishment House Freedom Caucus, is running up against a challenger bolstered by the endorsements of Trump and former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy. On Tuesday, voters will signal which brand of conservatism they prefer.\n\nAnd with Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger vacating her 7th district seat to run for governor, former Army colonel Yevgeny \"Eugene\" Vindman, who rose to prominence during Trump's first impeachment trial, has moved to the top of a crowded field of local electeds by highlighting his role in protecting democracy from the former president.\n\nGood's willingness to push against his party's establishment has garnered him political power in Congress, but it also brought him a tough primary challenge, and has shown a schism within the more conservative wing of the party.\n\nGood, who was first elected to the House in 2020, is facing state Sen. John McGuire, a primary opponent endorsed by former President Donald Trump and financially backed by Defending Main Street, the pro-incumbent PAC that claims responsibility for ousting former Republican Rep. Steve King.\n\nGood has not been afraid to make enemies in his party, voting to oust former Speaker McCarthy and initially endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' bid for president, though he flipped to Trump after DeSantis dropped out.\n\nGood has also attempted to get back in Trump's good graces, traveling up to New York to attend the former president's hush-money trial -- the same day McGuire also made the same trip.\n\n\"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA. He turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement - But really, it was too late,\" Trump posted on Truth Social in May.\n\nHe added, \"John McGuire has my Complete and Total Endorsement!\" He posted the attack on Good again on Wednesday.\n\nGood had also received a cease-and-desist from Trump's campaign after using his name and image in campaign material.\n\n\"Trump's endorsement represents a huge advantage for McGuire, and that's why Good has tried to suggest that he is actually the favorite of the former president,\" Stephen J. Farnsworth, professor of political science and international affairs at the University of Mary Washington, told ABC News by email. \"While prominent Republicans have split in their preferences in this contest, none of them has anything like the influence with Republican primary voters that the former president has.\"\n\nThe ire Good has drawn has landed him in a vulnerable position. McGuire has outraised Good and holds more cash on hand, according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission (FEC) records by OpenSecrets. The state senator has also benefited from slightly more outside spending, OpenSecrets found.\n\nGood still has the support of groups such as the conservative organization, Club for Growth and Trump-aligned members such as Republican Rep. Byron Donalds.\n\nHe has also portrayed himself as a known quantity to his constituents.\n\n\"They can trust me; they know that I'm a consistent conservative. They know that I'm the same thing publicly as I am privately, and I think they like that I've been fighting for them,\" Good told Roanoke, Virginia, TV station WDBJ earlier in June.\n\nMcGuire, meanwhile, has slammed Good for portraying himself as a Trump-aligned conservative.\n\n\"We found out that Bob is not who he says he is ... All over the district, people are saying, 'thank you for giving us a choice.' And the people of the district are the ones that asked me to do this. And they basically said, 'John, you're the only one who can beat them,'\" McGuire told Lynchburg, Virginia, ABC affiliate WSET.\n\nThe fight between Good and McGuire has split Republicans both at the national and at the hyperlocal level.\n\nFor instance, there are signs of a fissure in the House Freedom Caucus itself. Republican Rep. Warren Davidson, a self-identified member of the House Freedom Caucus, endorsed McGuire on Sunday, writing in a statement shared by McGuire's campaign, \"I've served in Congress since 2016, and we need reinforcements to help Make America Great Again ... [McGuire] will work well with others to deliver conservative results.\"\n\nAnd at the local level, some Republican leaders from the district have pushed back against Trump's endorsement. The Charlottesville Daily Progress and other local outlets reported that 5th District Republican Congressional Committee Chair Rich Buchanan and other local Republican leaders wrote an open letter to Trump asking him to reconsider his endorsement of McGuire.\n\n\"Congressman Bob Good has championed America First policies ... Congressman Good's opponent is relying on millions of dollars from outside Virginia to support his candidacy,\" they wrote.\n\nABC News has reached out to Buchanan for comment.\n\nThe district includes a wide swath of the southern part of the state, including the cities of Charlottesville and Lynchburg, and Cook Political Report rates the seat as likely to safely stay in Republican hands.\n\nIn 2018, Eugene Vindman helped his twin brother Alexander -- both staffers for the National Security Council under Trump -- blow the whistle on a phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Hunter Biden's business dealings there. The Vindmans' efforts launched the first of Trump's two impeachment trials and catapulted Alexander and, to a lesser extent, Eugene into the national spotlight.\n\nNow, propelled by name recognition, a campaign war chest much larger than his competitors', and military bona fides -- many members of the armed forces call the district home -- Eugene Vindman appears poised to secure the Democratic party's nomination in the tightly-contested swing district. Per FEC filings, Vindman has raised more than $5 million -- and amount that's more than all of his challengers combined.\n\n\"I sacrificed my military career to expose Trump's corruption,\" Vindman said in a campaign ad. \"Now I'm running for Congress to get things done.\"\n\nAs Vindman's four leading opponents have been quick to point out, though, they each have something he does not: experience governing. Two -- Andrea Bailey and Margaret Franklin -- currently serve as Prince William County supervisors, and, until recently, two others -- Elizabeth Guzman and Briana Sewell -- served as members of Virginia's House of Delegates. Guzman narrowly lost a primary after redistricting; Sewell remains in office.\n\nThat's not all that differentiates Vindman and the field. Vindman, who is white, is running alongside three Black women and a Hispanic woman in a diversifying suburban district where roughly 35% of the population is not white, according to 2020 Census data.\n\n\"He does not understand the community. He's not very infused in the community. He's not been participating in the community as an advocate,\" Bailey told the Associated Press.\n\n\"Vindman has three advantages going into this primary: he is very well-liked among Democratic activists and donors, he has a military background ... and he is running as part of a large field where the people who do not support him will splinter in a variety of directions,\" Farnsworth told ABC News.\n\nIf he secures the nomination, Vindman will likely draw a stark contrast with the Republican nominee.\n\nThe Republican primary for Virginia's 7th district, which will also take place Tuesday, features nearly as many candidates and two frontrunners: Derrick Anderson, a former Army Green Beret who has received support from GOP leadership and finished second in the 2022 primary; and Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL with the backing of the House Freedom Caucus.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Good had already drawn the ire of fellow House Republicans for voting to oust McCarthy as speaker last year, but the incumbent's job appears to be in much more serious jeopardy after Trump's endorsement.\n\nTrump, seemingly still outraged over Good supporting Florida governor Ron DeSantis in the Republican presidential primary, has praised McGuire as \"a true American Hero\". Good's eventual endorsement of Trump, which came after DeSantis withdrew from the presidential primary in January, failed to appease the former president.\n\n\"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social last month. \"He turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement - But really, it was too late.\"\n\nRelated: Virginia home of mother of January 6 police officer swatted\n\nTrump went so far as to send Good a cease and desist letter, demanding that his campaign stop using the former president's name and likeness to promote his re-election effort.\n\nBurdened with Trump's claims of disloyalty, Good is simultaneously fending off attacks from more establishment-minded Republicans, who say the Freedom caucus chair has undermined the party's agenda. In addition to voting for McCarthy's removal, Good has pushed for aggressive funding cuts, even calling on Republicans to force a government shutdown over the issue, and rejected all four components of a foreign aid package that provided money to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nMcCarthy and his allies have rallied around McGuire despite the fact that his policy views largely align with Good's. For example, Good was one of the 139 House Republicans who voted against certifying Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election, while McGuire actually attended Trump's rally that preceded the January 6 attack on the Capitol. McGuire has said that he only attended the rally and did not enter the Capitol itself.\n\nIn the final days leading up to the primary, several House Republicans have traveled to Good's district to campaign for McGuire. McCarthy himself has encouraged his supporters to donate to McGuire's campaign, and outside groups have spent heavily against Good. The American Patriots Pac, which has thrown its support behind McGuire, has already spent more than $4.3m in the race.\n\nBut Good is not without allies in the race, as fellow members of the House Freedom caucus have rallied around him. Congressman Matt Gaetz, who spearheaded the effort to remove McCarthy as speaker, has urged voters to back Good, and hard-right groups have offered their financial support as well. The Conservative Outsider Pac has spent more than $2.5m in its effort to re-elect Good.\n\nIn total, outside groups have dumped more than $10m into the fifth district, according to OpenSecrets. The hefty investment has not produced a clear frontrunner in the race, as recent polls present conflicting evidence about whether Good or McGuire has the advantage heading into Tuesday.\n\nIf Good can make it out of the primary, he is poised to win a third term, as the Cook Political Report rates the fifth district as solid Republican. But Good's disastrous political miscalculation of endorsing DeSantis may very well cost him his seat.\n\nAlthough the fifth district is not considered a toss-up in the general election, other Virginia races will carry significant implications for the national fight over control of Congress.\n\nTrump has endorsed Navy veteran Hung Cao in the Republican Senate primary, but the winner of that race will face an uphill climb to unseat the Democratic Senator Tim Kaine in the general election. Two of Virginia's House seats are also considered competitive, with the Cook Political Report rating the seventh district as lean Democrat and the second district as lean Republican.\n\nIn the seventh district, Democratic incumbent Abigail Spanberger has launched a gubernatorial campaign instead of seeking re-election, and her absence has kicked off a hotly contested primary. Eugene Vindman, who attracted national attention for his role in Trump's first impeachment trial, has significantly out raised his Democratic rivals and is favored in the race. The winner of the primary will go on to face one of six Republican candidates seeking their party's nomination.\n\nIn the second district, Republican incumbent Jen Kiggans is slightly favored to win reelection, but a Democratic over performance could put her seat in play. After Democrats' impressive showing in Virginia's legislative races last year, party leaders hope the state can help them rebuild a House majority in November.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com",

(AP) One of America's most conservative members of Congress found himself locked in a tight re-nomination battle against an opponent backed by former President Donald Trump in Virginia's primary election Tuesday .\n\nRep. Bob Good, who chairs the far-right House Freedom Caucus, is seeking a third term to represent Virginia's 5th Congressional District, but state Sen. John McGuire has mounted a strong challenge that highlights the friction within the party.\n\nBallots remained to be counted and the tight margin made the race too early to call. Virginia observes the Juneteenth holiday and therefore is not expected to count votes on Wednesday. McGuire led Good by 327 votes, or 0.52 percentage points, out of 62,495 ballots counted as of midnight Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats in northern and central Virginia have been choosing candidates to replace popular incumbents who are not seeking re-election. In House District 7, Eugene Vindman won a crowded Democratic primary to try to hold on to the seat vacated by U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor in 2025, while Republicans chose Derrick Anderson.\n\nAnd in District 10, voters chose Suhas Subramanyam among 12 Democrats to try to hold on to the seat held by U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, who is not seeking re-election to her northern Virginia seat after receiving a diagnosis of a rare and incurable neurological disease. . Republican voters nominated Mike Clancy for this seat.\n\nStatewide, voters chose Hung Cao as the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate to take on Democrat Tim Kaine.\n\nWhat you need to know about the 2024 elections\n\nHere is an overview of the main battles in the election:\n\nHouse District 5\n\nConventional politics might suggest that a member of Congress with Good's conservative credentials would be safe in a primary. But he drew Trump's ire when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president. He returned to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but Trump supports McGuire and describes Good as a traitor.\n\nTrump continued to criticize Good as he campaigned for McGuire during a telephone rally Monday evening.\n\nUnlike Bob Good, John McGuire won't let you down, Trump said, adding that McGuire is strong on the border and will always defend your embattled Second Amendment.\n\nGood says he considers Trump the best president of his lifetime and only supported DeSantis because Trump is constitutionally limited to just one more term.\n\nMcGuire, for his part, claimed victory Tuesday night and thanked Trump for believing in me. No winner has been announced by the Associated Press.\n\nThere are still a few votes to be counted, but it is clear that all paths lead to victory, McGuire said in a written statement.\n\nGood, meanwhile, released a statement on social media saying his campaign had implemented the best early voting operation the 5th District has ever seen.\n\nWe are still waiting for the results of the absentee and provisional votes, he said. We are doing what we can to ensure that we have teams of observers and legal advisors to ensure that all votes are counted correctly in the coming days.\n\nGood also alienated Republican insiders by voting to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, plunging the party into some measure of chaos.\n\nSeeking to capitalize is McGuire, a state lawmaker and former Navy SEAL, who echoed Trump's attacks on Good, calling him a never-Trumper.\n\nGood criticized McGuire as a serial activist who announced his candidacy for Congress just a week after winning election to a four-year term in the state Senate.\n\nIf Good loses, he would be the first House incumbent to face a primary challenge this year, except for a race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\nThe winner will face Democrat Gloria Tinsley Witt, who defeated Gary Terry and Paul Riley.\n\nThe 5th Congressional District stretches from Charlottesville north, past the far western suburbs of Richmond, through Lynchburg and on to Danville and the North Carolina border.\n\nHouse District 7\n\nVindman, a political newcomer who was nevertheless known to voters for his role in Trump's first impeachment, won the Democratic nomination in the 7th Congressional District for what will be a closely watched Congressional seat in November.\n\nVindman, who crushed her opponents at the fundraiser, won against a field of seven people, including four women of color, all of whom were current or former officials in Prince William County, a suburban area in outside the national capital which constitutes the largest part of the district. .\n\nThe former Army officer gained some fame when he and his twin brother, Alex, raised concerns about Trump's 2019 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which Trump demanded an investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nVindman emphasized his opposition to Trump in his campaign and said in a victory declaration released Tuesday evening that our grassroots movement is moving toward MAGA's extreme agenda. Virginia voters are driven by values above all and want to elect leaders with integrity who preserve fundamental rights and freedoms, not extremists.\n\nIt was criticized by some local officials who said it was not connected to the region's political dynamics.\n\nIn a battle between a former Army Green Beret and a former Navy SEAL, Republican voters chose Army man Anderson over Navy veteran Cameron Hamilton.\n\nAnderson and Hamilton were the top two fundraisers out of a field of six. Anderson gained the support of House GOP leaders in Washington, while Hamilton had the support of members of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe district, which stretches from Prince William County south to Fredericksburg and west past Culpeper, leans slightly Democratic.\n\nHouse District 10\n\nSubramanyam defeated fellow Democratic candidates former Virginia House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, state Senators Dan Helmer and Jennifer Boysko, and former Virginia Secretary of Education Atif Qarni. Wexton endorsed Subramanyam.\n\nRepublican voters chose Clancy over four candidates.\n\nHouse District 2\n\nIn Virginia's coastal 2nd Congressional District, Missy Cotter Smasal, a Navy veteran who runs a nonprofit that honors fallen servicewomen, defeated Jeremiah Jake Denton IV, a constitutional and civil rights attorney , during the Democratic primary.\n\nShell will face Republican U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans in November.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday evening, Smasal took aim at Kiggans and the MAGA extremism she supports in Congress.\n\nI will protect the right and access to abortion for all and fight for resources for veterans and military families, Smasal said. I will always defend democracy and reject partisan extremism.\n\nUS Senate\n\nIn the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, Navy veteran Cao got the better of his four opponents in an attempt to unseat Kaine, a Democrat who is seeking his third term as a junior U.S. senator.\n\nAmong the Republican candidates in the primary, Cao had the most money and previous campaign experience for a senior officer position. He also had the support of Trump.\n\nIn a victory message on Facebook, Cao immediately criticized President Joe Biden's decision Tuesday to allow some spouses of U.S. citizens without legal status to potentially apply for citizenship.\n\nTomorrow we will begin our campaign to save the country that saved my life, Cao said. I spent twenty-five years in the Navy, while Tim Kaine spent thirty years in elected office.\n\nCao defeated Scott Parkinson, a former DeSantis congressman, as well as Jonathan Emord, an author and lawyer who often cites his legal battles against the Food and Drug Administration. The other Republican candidates were Eddie Garcia, a U.S. Army veteran who owns a mobile app serving veterans, and Chuck Smith, a former commander of the Navy Judge Advocate General Corps and an attorney.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Bob Good, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, was locked in a close primary fight Tuesday night against a challenger backed by powerful Republicans including former President Donald Trump and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nJust a few hundred votes separated state Sen. John McGuire in the lead and Good close behind him in Virginia's deep-red 5th District as of late Tuesday night. If the margin stays within 1 percentage point, the losing candidate can request a recount within 10 days after the election results are certified, according to Virginia state law.\n\nGood is at risk of becoming the first sitting lawmaker to lose to a primary challenger this year.\n\nLate Tuesday night, Good urged his supporters to \"keep the faith\" in a lengthy post on X.\n\n\"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help we were able to make this race too close to call,\" he wrote, touting his campaign's early vote operation and noting that there are outstanding mail-in and provisional ballots.\n\n\"We are doing what we can to ensure we have teams of observers and legal counsel to ensure all the votes are properly counted in the coming days,\" Good added.\n\nGood drew McCarthy's ire as is one of eight Republicans who voted to oust him last year. McGuire vastly outspent Good on the airwaves and outside groups aligned with McCarthy also outspent the Virginia congressman's allies, according to the ad tracking firm AdImpact.\n\n\"This is the Kevin McCarthy revenge tour,\" Good told NBC News on Friday at an event in Goochland, Va.\n\n\"He has devoted his life apparently to trying to exact some revenge on those he holds responsible for him not being Speaker, except himself,\" Good later added. \"But the people of the 5th District are not going to be bought.\"\n\nMcGuire also had the most coveted endorsement in GOP primaries: Trump.\n\nMcGuire thanked Trump Tuesday night as he declared victory, despite the race remaining very close.\n\n\"This is a time where we need to come together because we still have a lot of work to do. I'm your Republican nominee but I'm not going to take it lightly,\" Good said at his election night party, according to a livestream of his election night speech from ABC13.\n\nMcGuire said Trump is \"a huge part of our win and I will not forget that.\"\n\nThe challenger couched things a little more in a statement from his campaign: \"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory.\"\n\nThe former president endorsed McGuire three weeks before Tuesday's primary, making a veiled reference to Good backing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the presidential primary. Good's subsequent endorsement of Trump wasn't enough to put him in the former president's good graces.\n\nAfter backing McGuire, Trump appeared in a TV ad and held a tele-rally for McGuire on Monday night, telling supporters, \"John is running against Bob Good, who is not good. Despite his name, he's very bad for Virginia.\"\n\nMcGuire, a former Navy SEAL whose campaign slogan was, \"We can do better than Good,\" told NBC News at a community concert in Powhatan on Friday that Trump's endorsement was helpful in the race.\n\n\"I've had many people say 'I don't know anything about you, never met you before, but if Trump's endorsing you, I've got you,'\" McGuire said. \"I believe with all that Trump has been through he has earned the right to call the shots and pick his team.\"\n\nBut Good is no stranger to running against a Trump-backed candidate. In 2020, Good defeated then-Rep. Denver Riggleman at a party convention, conducted via a drive-through amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole was also on defense Tuesday but saw off his chief primary opponent, businessman Paul Bondar, who spent millions of dollars of his own money on the race. Cole, who chairs the powerful House Appropriations Committee, got a boost from Trump in the race and recently told NBC News that Trump's endorsement was \"enormously helpful\" as he faced the most competitive and expensive primary since he was first elected in 2002.\n\nBondar loaned his campaign $5.1 million of his own money, launching ads that accused Cole of losing touch with the 4th District and spending too much time in the nation's capital. Bondar also said Cole was not sufficiently conservative, pointing to Cole's support for government spending and aid to Ukraine.\n\nCole and his allies blanketed the airwaves with ads accusing Bondar of actually being a Texan. Bondar does own property in Oklahoma, outside of the 4th District, but he did vote in Texas' primaries in March.\n\nElsewhere in Virginia on Tuesday, Republican voters chose Navy veteran Hung Cao to take on Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in November, NBC News projects. Cao, who had Trump's endorsement in the race, led the Republican field in fundraising and defeated two other GOP contenders.\n\nCao ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2022, losing to Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton by nearly 7 points. He is in for a tough race against Kaine, who is running for a third term in a state that has sent Democrats to the Senate in recent years. Biden won the state by 10 points in 2020 and Kaine won a second term in 2018 by 17 points.\n\nIn the House, Democrats are also picking a candidate to take on Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans in the 2nd District, and both parties are picking their nominees in the open 7th and 10th Districts.\n\nRetired Army Col. Yevgeny \"Eugene\" Vindman is projected to win the Democratic nomination in the 7th District, giving Democrats a high-profile candidate with military experience and strong fundraising chops, He hopes to hold the seat for Democrats in the fall despite the decision by Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger, another strong fundraiser with a national security background, to run for governor.\n\nVindman gained national notoriety during Trump's first impeachment trial, when he and his brother raised concerns, from their perch on the National Security Council, about Trump's phone conversation with the Ukrainian president in 2019. Despite being a first-time candidate, he was far-and-away the best fundraiser in the race, and got a boost from outside groups on the airwaves as he ran against more experienced local politicians.\n\nHe'll face off against Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret, who bested former Navy SEAL Cameron Hamilton in a clash between the establishment and insurgent wings of the party. Anderson was backed by a super PAC tied to McCarthy and Republican megadonors, as well as House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nIn the 10th District, state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam is projected to win the crowded and expensive Democratic primary in Virginia's 10th District, where Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton is not seeking re-election after being diagnosed with a rare and serious condition called progressive supranuclear palsy.\n\nSubramanyam won Wexton's endorsement, which helped him separate himself from a crowded field of well-funded Democrats that included state Del. Dan Helmer, former state Assembly Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn and former Defense Department official Krystle Kaul. He'll be in the driver's seat to hold the district for Democrats in the fall, as Democrats have performed well recently in this suburban-Washington D.C. district, and will face off against Republican businessman and lawyer Mike Clancy.\n\nKiggans will face Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, a military veteran who had been backed by Virginia's every Democratic House member from Virginia. This is a swing district that's likely to be competitive in the fall, but Kiggans has a significant fundraising edge and defeated a Democratic incumbent there to win the seat in 2022.\n\nGeorgia also held its primary runoffs in races where no candidate won a majority of the primary vote back in March.\n\nIn the Democratic-leaning 2nd District, activist Chuck Hand, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense in connection with the attack on Jan. 6, 2021, lost a runoff for the Republican nomination.\n\nAnd Trump's former White House political director, Brian Jack, is projected to win his GOP primary runoff against state Sen. Mike Dugan. The Republican will be the heavy favorite to win in November to replace retiring GOP Rep. Drew Ferguson.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person",

Bob Good (R) is still fighting for his political life the day after polls closed in Virginia.\n\nThe bitter race between Good, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, and his primary challenger, John McGuire -- a state senator who won the coveted endorsement of former President Trump -- remained too close to call as of Wednesday afternoon, with McGuire holding a razor-thin edge over Good.\n\nMcGuire is leading Good by just 307 votes -- or 0.4 percent -- with 95 percent of the vote in, according to results from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ. More than 62,000 voters cast ballots in the race to represent Virginia's 5th Congressional District.\n\nThe contest is almost certainly headed to a recount: Virginia law allows candidates to request a recount if the margin is less than one percent.\n\nGood expressed confidence Wednesday morning that he has a path to victory, but warned that the final stretch of counting could take weeks.\n\n\"Provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are also still to be counted. We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed,\" Good wrote on X. \"We believe we can still prevail.\"\n\nMcGuire, meanwhile, encouraged by his late lead Tuesday night, went ahead and declared victory in a room full of supporters, taking a page from Trump's 2020 election playbook.\n\n\"Ladies and gentleman, the votes are in and the people have spoken: It is an honor to be your Republican nominee for the 5th congressional district,\" McGuire declared, prompting cheers.\n\nHe echoed that sentiment overnight Wednesday, writing on X: \"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory.\"\n\nCounting could be at least delayed until Thursday. Virginia observes Juneteenth, a federal holiday, so ballots are not expected to be tallied on Wednesday, according to The Associated Press.\n\nGood, however, is optimistic that he will take the edge as more votes are counted.\n\nA handful of counties in the Old Dominion had a fair portion of outstanding ballots as of Wednesday morning, with both Good and McGuire leading in some of the areas.\n\nA source close to the Good campaign told The Hill that they are closely watching returns in Albemarle and Lynchburg Counties, both of which the incumbent has a leg up in.\n\nIn Albemarle, Good has a 523 vote -- or 9.4 point -- edge over McGuire with much of the county reporting. Over in Lynchburg, Good is hanging on to an 842 vote -- or 16.4 percent -- lead over McGuire.\n\n\"This race remains too close to call,\" Good wrote on X Wednesday. \"We are in a period where the law provides a process for evaluating the accuracy of all the vote totals from election day to ensure everyone can have full confidence in the certified results.\"\n\nThe battle in Virginia's 5th Congressional District -- Tuesday's marquee race -- has drawn national headlines for months, both for its intense interest inside the beltway and heavy spending.\n\nTrump and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) both endorsed McGuire after Good crossed them -- Good initially backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential primary, and he voted to oust McCarthy from the top job -- earning the incumbent the ire of two GOP heavyweights, their supporters -- and their warchests.\n\nTrump declared in a Truth Social post on the eve of Election Day that \"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA,\" and participated in a tele-rally for McGuire, where he warned that if Good is elected the incumbent \"will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me.\"\n\nMcCarthy's Majority Committee PAC, meanwhile, funneled $10,000 to McGuire's campaign, looking to knock off the first of eight Republicans who voted to remove him from the Speakership. He faced his first defeat last week after Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), who voted to remove McCarthy, reigned supreme in her primary.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), another GOP firebrand, joined Trump and McCarthy in backing McGuire, while other Freedom Caucus members on Capitol Hill backed their chairman, including Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas), Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).\n\nGood nodded to that opposition against him in an Election night post on X, writing: \"No matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right.\"\n\n\"Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "wtaj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTAJ -

Good had already drawn the ire of fellow House Republicans for voting to oust McCarthy as speaker last year, but the incumbent's job appears to be in much more serious jeopardy after Trump's endorsement.\n\nTrump, seemingly still outraged over Good supporting Florida governor Ron DeSantis in the Republican presidential primary, has praised McGuire as \"a true American Hero\". Good's eventual endorsement of Trump, which came after DeSantis withdrew from the presidential primary in January, failed to appease the former president.\n\n\"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social last month. \"He turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement - But really, it was too late.\"\n\nTrump went so far as to send Good a cease and desist letter, demanding that his campaign stop using the former president's name and likeness to promote his re-election effort.\n\nBurdened with Trump's claims of disloyalty, Good is simultaneously fending off attacks from more establishment-minded Republicans, who say the Freedom caucus chair has undermined the party's agenda. In addition to voting for McCarthy's removal, Good has pushed for aggressive funding cuts, even calling on Republicans to force a government shutdown over the issue, and rejected all four components of a foreign aid package that provided money to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nMcCarthy and his allies have rallied around McGuire despite the fact that his policy views largely align with Good's. For example, Good was one of the 139 House Republicans who voted against certifying Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election, while McGuire actually attended Trump's rally that preceded the January 6 attack on the Capitol. McGuire has said that he only attended the rally and did not enter the Capitol itself.\n\nIn the final days leading up to the primary, several House Republicans have traveled to Good's district to campaign for McGuire. McCarthy himself has encouraged his supporters to donate to McGuire's campaign, and outside groups have spent heavily against Good. The American Patriots Pac, which has thrown its support behind McGuire, has already spent more than $4.3m in the race.\n\nBut Good is not without allies in the race, as fellow members of the House Freedom caucus have rallied around him. Congressman Matt Gaetz, who spearheaded the effort to remove McCarthy as speaker, has urged voters to back Good, and hard-right groups have offered their financial support as well. The Conservative Outsider Pac has spent more than $2.5m in its effort to re-elect Good.\n\nIn total, outside groups have dumped more than $10m into the fifth district, according to OpenSecrets. The hefty investment has not produced a clear frontrunner in the race, as recent polls present conflicting evidence about whether Good or McGuire has the advantage heading into Tuesday.\n\nIf Good can make it out of the primary, he is poised to win a third term, as the Cook Political Report rates the fifth district as solid Republican. But Good's disastrous political miscalculation of endorsing DeSantis may very well cost him his seat.\n\nAlthough the fifth district is not considered a toss-up in the general election, other Virginia races will carry significant implications for the national fight over control of Congress.\n\nTrump has endorsed Navy veteran Hung Cao in the Republican Senate primary, but the winner of that race will face an uphill climb to unseat the Democratic Senator Tim Kaine in the general election. Two of Virginia's House seats are also considered competitive, with the Cook Political Report rating the seventh district as lean Democrat and the second district as lean Republican.\n\nIn the seventh district, Democratic incumbent Abigail Spanberger has launched a gubernatorial campaign instead of seeking re-election, and her absence has kicked off a hotly contested primary. Eugene Vindman, who attracted national attention for his role in Trump's first impeachment trial, has significantly out raised his Democratic rivals and is favored in the race. The winner of the primary will go on to face one of six Republican candidates seeking their party's nomination.\n\nIn the second district, Republican incumbent Jen Kiggans is slightly favored to win reelection, but a Democratic over performance could put her seat in play. After Democrats' impressive showing in Virginia's legislative races last year, party leaders hope the state can help them rebuild a House majority in November.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

(WRIC) - The margin between Republican incumbent Bob Good and his Trump-backed challenger John McGuire in Virginia's 5 Congressional District primary is in recount territory and votes still need to be counted.\n\nState Sen. McGuire (R-Goochland) leads Rep. Good (R-Va.), who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, by 309 votes (31,377 to 31,068), per the state's unofficial count as of noon Wednesday, with provisional ballots and mail-in ballots sent by Tuesday still to be included.\n\nThis 0.5% difference is within the 1% margin needed for a potential recount in Virginia, which, if it holds after the results are certified by the State Board of Elections, would ultimately be paid for by the state instead of Good.\n\nStill, McGuire declared victory Tuesday night.\n\n\"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory,\" McGuire said in a statement minutes before midnight.\n\nNearly an hour before McGuire's declaration, Good told supporters on social media that his campaign was \"still waiting on the final election results.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Good said he believes he can still win and is asking for \"full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed.\"\n\n\"This race remains too close to call,\" Good wrote on X on Wednesday. \"We are in a period where the law provides a process for evaluating the accuracy of all the vote totals from election day to ensure everyone can have full confidence in the certified results.\"\n\nLocal electoral boards still need to go over the unofficial primary returns and any potential errors, including reviewing provisional ballots that could or could not be accepted and ballots mailed in by Tuesday to local election offices.\n\nIn his bid to deny Good a third term, McGuire picked up an endorsement from former President Donald Trump that political experts said was key in his push to unseat an incumbent in a red-leaning district.\n\nThe 5 District stretches from the Charlottesville area to the North Carolina border, including the cities of Lynchburg and Danville and Louisa, Powhatan, and Goochland counties. It also includes part of Hanover County.\n\nThe Good-McGuire head-to-head was one of the most closely watched primaries by political experts. It pitted two far-right conservatives against each other who appear aligned on major policy points in a potential litmus test on Trump's influence in Virginia.\n\nIt was also one of the most expensive primaries, with the Virginia Public Access Project reporting that nearly $10.9 million was spent in the race.\n\nTrump endorsed McGuire over Good after the congressman backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential primary over Trump. Good ultimately endorsed Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but the former president said the switch was \"too late\" and the \"damage had been done.\"\n\nAnd the day before Tuesday's primary, Trump took part in a tele-town hall for McGuire in which he said the state senator had his \"complete and total endorsement\" and called Good \"not good.\"\n\nDespite Trump campaigning against him, Good joined McGuire in making Trump a focal point in the primary. They aligned themselves with the former president and invoked his name during their campaigns.\n\nMcGuire made Trump's endorsement a central focus of his campaign, touting the former president's support in ads, signs and even his transportation. Good also focused on Trump, including using campaign signs with Trump's name that he was asked to take down.\n\nThe winner of the GOP primary will go up against Democrat Gloria Witt in November. The Associated Press called the 5th District's Democratic primary for Witt, the founder and CEO of a business executive coaching company, on Tuesday.\n\n8News relies on The Associated Press for race calls. All election results are unofficial until certified by the State Board of Elections.\n\nThere are no automatic recounts in Virginia. The losing candidate can petition for one and if the margin is within 0.5%, the state pays the cost. If it is between that and 1%, the losing candidate covers the cost.", "source": {"uri": "wric.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "8News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dean_mirshahi@wric.com", "name": "Dean

John McGuire, the candidate backed by former President Donald Trump and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, remains too close to call, with watchers saying a vote recount is expected in the 5th Congressional District contest.\n\nThe New York Times reported Thursday that McGuire is holding a tight lead of just 321 votes, with 31,418 votes, over Good, with 31,097 votes. The Times' numbers were updated early Thursday, but were based on tallies reported Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBut even with the few hundred votes separating the candidates, McGuire appeared to be taking a victory lap on X early Wednesday, thanking his family and \"everyone who helped out on this campaign, thank you to the people who endorsed and supported me, and thank you to Donald J. Trump for believing in me. There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory.\"\n\nGood, meanwhile, pointed out in an X post of his own Wednesday that the race \"remains too close to call.\"\n\n\"We are in a period where the law provides a process for evaluating the accuracy of all the vote totals from election day to ensure everyone can have full confidence in the certified results,\" he said. \"Provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are also still to be counted. We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed. We believe we can still prevail.\"\n\nTrump backed McGuire over Good after the incumbent Republican endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis early on in the GOP presidential primary. McCarthy threw his support behind McGuire after Good voted to oust him from his House speaker role last year.\n\nMeanwhile, considering there are still provisional ballots and postmarked mail-in ballots still coming in by Friday, the race will likely turn into a full recount that could take weeks to determine who will square off against Democrat challenger Gloria Witt in November, reports The Washington Post.\n\nFormer Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, who backed Good over McGuire, going against Trump's endorsement, said that \"we're not going to know for a month\" who won the race.\n\nHowever, he was quick to label McCarthy and his \"revenge tour\" as a loser in the primaries. McCarthy, R-Calif., pushed to unseat Good and seven other House Republicans who voted to oust him.\n\nMcCarthy has already fallen short in his push to unseat Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., and Bannon said he's been \"humiliated\" in his efforts.\n\nRichmond political analyst Bob Holsworth said the close race between Good and McGuire weakens Trump's endorsement powers.\n\n\"The fact that it was so close suggests that Trump's reach is not as deep and extensive as may have been thought,\" he told The Post.\n\nGood told Newsmax Tuesday, as voters headed to the polls, that he still supports Trump, even though the former president didn't back him.\n\nHe also insisted he was the best choice to help Trump win the White House.\n\n\"We have no choice but to elect him,\" said Good. \"After four years of [Joe] Biden, everybody is doing worse, except the illegal aliens. ... I'll continue to support President Trump and do everything I can to help him get elected and help him win Virginia.\"\n\nMcGuire, however, told Newsmax Tuesday that he's been loyal to Trump since the beginning, unlike Good, who he said \"went around the district trashing Trump, saying he's the only man that could lose to Biden.\"\n\nSandy Fitzgerald \u2709\n\nSandy Fitzgerald has more than three

Bobby Scott, D-3rd, faces only two independents in November.\n\nBut it was the 5th district that attracted the most outside interest, after Trump endorsed McGuire.\n\n\"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back sort of like he did with me,\" Trump told a tele-rally for McGuire on the eve of the primary.\n\nGood had endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for the GOP presidential nomination in April 2023, but then backed Trump after DeSantis dropped out of the race in January of this year.\n\nThe race for the GOP nomination was a highly personalized contest between two conservatives -- one, Good, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, who voted not to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 election and the other, McGuire, who attended Trump's Jan. 6, 2021, \"Stop the Steal\" rally, but says he did not enter the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMcGuire, a former Navy SEAL, is a three-term member of the House of Delegates who declared his candidacy for Good's congressional seat less than two weeks after his election to the state Senate last year.\n\nSupporters wait and watch\n\nGood had trailed McGuire in the early evening tally, and more than 100 of his supporters who'd gathered for his election party at La Villa, an Italian restaurant in Lynchburg, were tense. Members of the crowd stared at their phones, examining election results and refreshing the page over and over again in hopes their candidate would rally.\n\nJust before 9:30 p.m. their wish came true, at least for the moment, as results showed Good had cut into the lead and made it a one-point race. It was the first time in the evening that the crowd had cheered.\n\nGood had spent most of the night sitting with family, with supporters walking past to offer him words of encouragement. The congressman looked tense, occasionally resting his chin on his left hand, as servers walked through the crowd bringing pizza to customers.\n\nGood campaign manager Diana Shores said she had expected a tight race.\n\n\"But it's still so nerve-racking,\" Shores said.\n\nMcGuire supporters gathered Tuesday night at The Virginian Hotel in downtown Lynchburg, where they were cautiously optimistic as the vote counts from the 24 counties and cities in the 5th District continued to be updated. Among the supporters were Lynchburg Mayor Stephanie Reed and Lynchburg School Board Chair Atul Gupta.\n\nOne voter at the McGuire watch party -- a lifelong Lynchburg area resident -- said he followed Trump's endorsement and voted for McGuire, hoping it will bring harmony to the Republican Party.\n\nAt a June 8 campaign event in Lynchburg for McGuire, Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., interior secretary under Trump, said he and Trump \"have talked about it long and hard, and we've come to the conclusion that Bob Good is destructive.\"\n\nBesides Trump's endorsement, McGuire campaigned with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, while Good has won backing from conservatives including Rep, Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, Sen Rand Paul, R-Kentucky and Steve Bannon a former Trump adviser.\n\nTwo dozen members of the 5th District Republican Congressional Committee sent a letter to Trump in which they praised Good, attacked McGuire and called the endorsement \"ill-advised.\"\n\nGood has called McGuire a \"perpetual candidate\" and argues that he's more conservative because McGuire has won support from allies of the former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Good was one of eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy last year.\n\nMcGuire raised more than $1.2 million while Good collected more than $1.1 million, according to the latest financial reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission.\n\nBut the outside spending dwarfed these sums.\n\nSix political action committees have spent $5 million to attack Good or promote McGuire, led by the American Patriots PAC.\n\nNine outside PACs have spent more than $3.4 million to attack McGuire or promote Good, led by the Conservative Outsider and Protect Freedom, a super PAC associated with Paul.\n\n5th District Democrats\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, selected Gloria Tinsley Witt, of Amherst County, founder of a leadership coaching firm, who prevailed in a three-way contest.\n\nThe district has not elected a Democrat to Congress since 2008, when Tom Perriello edged Rep. Virgil Goode, R-5th, by 727 votes.\n\n1st District Democrats\n\nIn another district touching Richmond's suburbs, the 1st, Leslie C. Mehta defeated Herb Jones, winning 14,734, or 66% of votes cast, to 7,489 or 34%, for Jones, with 95% of precincts reporting unofficial results. She will take on Rep. Rob Wittman, R-1st, who has represented the district since 2007.\n\nA political newcomer, Mehta, the former legal director of the ACLU of Virginia, beat the former New Kent County treasurer, Jones, who tried but failed to unseat Wittman in 2022.\n\n\"I am proud to accept the nomination ... and excited to head on to November because our communities deserve better,\" Mehta said in a post on X.\n\nWittman won in 2022 with 57% of the vote. The district voted 58% to 42%, for Republican Glenn Youngkin in the 2021 contest for governor.\n\nJones was backed by former Gov. Ralph Northam, while Mehta was supported by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-7th, as well as by a deep-pocketed Democratic couple, Charlottesville billionaire hedge fund executive Michael Bills and his wife, Sonija Smith.\n\nThis district stretches from parts of Hanover, Henrico and Chesterfield counties to Williamsburg and the Northern Neck.\n\n2nd District Democrats\n\nIn the 2nd District, anchored in Virginia Beach, Navy veteran and nonprofit executive Missy Cotter Smasal won the Democratic nomination, defeating attorney Jake Denton for the right to take on Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-2nd, who is seeking a second term. Smasal received 18,424 votes, or 70%, to Denton's 7,858 votes, or 30%.\n\n\"Thank you to all the voters, volunteers, and donors who have put their faith in me. I'll always have your back,\" Smasal said in a social media post.\n\nRedistricting in 2021 left this district, which includes the Eastern Shore, Suffolk and rural western Tidewater communities in Isle of Wight and Southampton counties, more Republican, though national Democrats have targeted Kiggans seeing a possible pick up here.\n\n7th District\n\nIn Northern Virginia's 7th District, an open seat after Democrat Abigail Spanberger decided not to seek another term in order to run for governor next year, Eugene Vindman captured the Democratic nomination. He bested six other Democrats, with 16,609 votes, or of 49% of the tally, with 97% of precincts reporting unofficial results.\n\nDerrick Anderson a former U.S. Army Green Beret who lost a GOP primary for a Prince William County board seat in 2022, won the GOP nomination. He prevailed in a six-way GOP race with 16,180 votes, or 46% of votes cast.\n\nVindman, who with his twin brother Alexander played a role in Trump's first impeachment, defeated a state legislator, Del. Briana Sewell, D-Prince William and former Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, as well as Prince Willian supervisors Margaret Angela Franklin and Andrea O. Bailey.\n\n\"The stakes of this election couldn't be higher, the passion behind my campaign comes from voters wanting integrity, moderation, and professionalism in a government that works for them; and our grass-roots movement is coming for the extreme MAGA agenda,\" Vindman said in a statement.\n\nAnderson, the GOP nominee, said in a statement: \"I choose a path that takes America back to being the greatest country the world has ever known. A country that is loved by our allies, feared by our enemies, and sought after in every corner of the world.\"\n\nThe district is based in Prince William, Stafford and Spotsylvania counties.\n\n10th District\n\nIn Northern Virginia's 10th District, 12 Democrats and four Republicans sought their parties' nominations for the seat of Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-10th, who is retiring for health reasons.\n\nState Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudon, won with 12,859, or 30% of votes cast, with 96% of precincts reporting unofficial results.\n\nSubramanyam, who received Wexton's endorsement, defeated several other current and former Democratic legislators, including Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, state Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, Del. David Reid, D-Loudoun, Del, Michelle Lopes Maldonado, D-Prince William, and former Speaker of the House Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax.\n\nSubramanyam said in a statement: \"This district is my home. I got married here. My kids were born here. The issues our community faces are personal to our family.\" He added: This district will remain blue.\"\n\nRepublican Mike Clancy, a lawyer and conservative commentator, won the Republican nomination with 64% of votes cast.\n\nThe district is based in Loudoun and Prince William counties.\n\n11th District\n\nIn Fairfax County's 11th Congressional district, longtime Rep Gerry Connolly fended off a challenge from attorney Ahsan Nasar in the Democratic primary. Connolly had 35,894 votes, or 86% of votes cast, to 5,928 or 14% for Nasar, with 98% of votes counted.\n\nDave Ress (804) 649-6948\n\ndress@timesdispatch.com\n\nTimes-Dispatch reporter Michael Martz

John McGuire the push he needed to eke out what's now a tiny lead in Virginia's 5th District, political scientists say.\n\nBut the big question is what McGuire's current 315-vote, 0.5-point margin signifies about the influence of an endorsement from the former president.\n\nTrump-backed McGuire holds slight lead in race with incumbent Bob Good, inside recount margin\n\nWith that close a result, political scientists think a recount is coming.\n\n\"Why did Good make it so close, and perhaps even prevail despite Trump's severe attacks?\" asked John McGlennon, a College of William and Mary political scientist.\n\nLocal electoral boards must still complete their work of checking and doubling-checking Tuesday night's preliminary tallies and count the final mail-in and provisional ballots.\n\nThe 0.5-point gap between McGuire and Good opens the path to a recount, once the boards certify results.\n\nIn a way, the question of Trump's influence comes down to 5th District voters' strong feelings about Washington, government officials and outsiders telling them what to do.\n\n\"It's useful to recognize that for many MAGA voters, Trump's appeal is his willingness to stick it to the establishment,\" McGlennon said.\n\n\"In this race, ironically, the incumbent could proudly point to the Republican establishment's attacks as a sign that he's even more Trump than Trump. Good has that grassroots support that rejects all the party leaders and elected officials ganging up on him because he won't play their game,\" he said.\n\nDuring the campaign, Good made a point of noting that groups close to former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy had supported McGuire.\n\nTrump calls in for McGuire on eve of 5th District primary\n\n\"Even Marjorie Taylor Greene became part of the establishment. Look at the lack of turnout for McGuire and Greene on their two-day blitz,\" McGlennon said.\n\nMcGuire's narrow lead shows that that large numbers of 5th district conservatives did not believe that either McGuire or Trump offered a principled reason to abandon Good, while McCarthy allies' support for McGuire was another reason to stick to Good, said longtime Virginia analyst Bob Holsworth, a former VCU dean.\n\n\"The vast majority of Good voters will cast a ballot for Trump in November. But for Trump to be competitive in Virginia, he will need a huge turnout in the parts of the district that supported Good. The open question is whether the enthusiasm level that drives turnout will be as high as he need,\" Holsworth said.\n\nRoanoke College political scientist Harry Wilson said Trump's impact is obvious.\n\n\"In an election this close, you can point to a variety of factors, but I seriously doubt McGuire would have won, assuming he does, without Trump's endorsement. Kevin McCarthy may have a fingerprint on it as well,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"Maybe some folks were tired of Good's style. Maybe folks actually like McGuire. Some may still be smarting over Good defeating [Denver] Riggleman,\" Wilson said, referring to the Republican who represented the district for one term before Good defeated him in a 2020 nominating convention after Riggleman officiated a same-sex marriage and drew fire for his stands on immigration and fiscal policy.\n\nStill, it was Trump who swung the election for McGuire, said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington.\n\n\"If the former president had not weighed in against Good, the incumbent would have been renominated in a walk,\" Farnsworth said. \"His combative brand of conservatism fits well with the preferences of Republican primary voters in the district.\"\n\nGood's bad luck was an early endorsement last year of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' short-lived bid to challenge Trump for the GOP's presidential nomination, Farnsworth said.\n\n\"Trump personalizes politics at every opportunity. If Good had made the politically savvy choice of backing Trump from the start, rather than endorsing DeSantis, he wouldn't be on the knife's edge of losing this renomination,\" he added.\n\nCao wins GOP nomination for US Senate, will take on Kaine\n\nEd Lynch, chairman of Hollins University's global politics and societies department, said McGuire probably would not have received much more than 30% of the vote without Trump's support.\n\n\"To my mind, there is no question that the only way to put up a serious primary challenge to a rock-ribbed conservative like Bob Good was with an endorsement by Donald Trump,\" he said.\n\nEarly voting offers a key clue to Trump's influence, political scientists say.\n\nGood won 5,822 early votes to McGuire's 5,012, but McGuire had a 943-vote edge with Election Day ballots, according to unofficial state Department of Election tallies. All in all, once mail-in ballots already counted are included, McGuire won 31,370 votes to Good's 31,055.\n\n\"The early voting numbers demonstrated that Good's appeal remained stronger until Trump ramped up his attacks on the Republican incumbent in recent days over what Trump viewed as Good's disloyalty,\" Farnsworth said.\n\nThose attacks included the virtual rally on Monday evening during which Trump declared: \"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back sort of like he did with me.\"\n\nThe primary saw some big spending, much of it from outsiders. All in all, the sums spent will likely exceed $15 million from the two campaigns themselves and outside independent committees, with more backing McGuire and attacking Good, McGlennon said.\n\nTurnout was big, as well, with more than 62,000 voting, nearly double the turnout in the busiest of Virginia's eight other House primaries.\n\n\"Turnout was huge in the 5th because you had two combative candidates who were roughly evenly matched,\" said Farnsworth. \"The margin was far closer than in any of the other congressional primary contests in Virginia on Tuesday, and there was huge campaign spending dropped into this race from national Republicans.\"\n\nGood beat McGuire in his Lynchburg-area home base, racking up margins as high at 56% and 59% of votes cast, and also led in the Charlottesville area. McGuire won 60%-plus margins in the parts of the district nearest Richmond, including his Goochland County home as well as Louisa, Powhatan and parts of Hanover counties.\n\nA blow to Bob: Trump endorsement could tilt 5th District GOP primary in John McGuire's favor\n\n\"I wouldn't read anything into this race carrying over to November, but the polls, including Roanoke College, suggest the general election will be much closer than 2020,\" Wilson said.\n\nThe real message from the 5th District may be how the presidential campaigns interpret the 5th when they start allocating resources to different states, Wilson said.\n\nAnd Trump gave one clue at the McGuire virtual rally, when he said he would \"put a very heavy play on Virginia,\" adding, \"I think we're gonna win the state of Virginia.\"\n\nTrump's other big Virginia endorsement, of retired Navy Capt. Hung Cao's bid to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine, shows the former president's strength among Virginia Republicans, Hollins' Lynch said. Cao won a five-way race with 62% of votes cast.\n\n\"That race could have gone right down to the wire had Trump stayed out of it,\" Lynch said.\n\n\"I still rate the commonwealth as safe for the Democrats in the Senate, but not solid,\" Lynch said.\n\n\"Ironically, the better Trump does in Virginia, the better for Kaine. Reluctant Trump voters, who are voting for Trump simply because they can't stand Biden, will want to balance that uncomfortable vote with a much more comfortable vote for Kaine,\" he added.\n\nCao began the race last year with an advantage from name recognition in his competitive race against Democratic U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton of Virginia's 10th, which he lost by 6.5 percentage points.\n\nTrump's endorsement \"may have bumped him from being just a favorite to a landslide winner,\" Larry Sabato, president of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said in an analysis.\n\nThe former president \"probably knew he had a winning choice,\" said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. \"He likes to run up the number of Trump-endorsed candidates who won in order to show he had control of the party apparatus across the country.\"\n\nTrump's presence was felt in the Democratic primary in Northern Virginia's 7th District, where Eugene Vindman won a 49% plurality in a seven-way race that featured four current or former officeholders in the district.\n\nIt was Vindman's first political race, but he benefited from national name recognition because of the role that he and his twin brother, Alexander, played in the first impeachment of Trump.\n\nHe ran on a message of protecting democracy that invoked Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe winner of the GOP primary, Derrick Anderson, told supporters, \"Eugene Vindman is only running for revenge -- revenge against Donald Trump and revenge against Republicans.\"\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger won the swing district two years ago after a new political map moved it from the Richmond suburbs to Northern Virginia and Fredericksburg. Spanberger, who lives in Henrico County, is running for governor next year instead of a fourth term in Congress.\n\nIn his victory statement, Vindman tried to link Anderson to Trump's Make America Great Again supporters, \"who wants nothing more than to play politics with our classrooms and let politicians ban books on the holocaust and slavery and throw them into the fire.\"\n\n\"Running as a MAGA Republican would put him [Anderson] at odds with the vast majority of voters in the district,\" he said. \"You don't go from Spanberger to MAGA candidate in one election cycle.\"\n\nA political endorsement may have been decisive in Sen. Suhas Subramanyam's victory in a 12-person race in the 10th District Democratic primary, but it wasn't Trump's. Wexton, who is stepping down because of a serious medical condition, endorsed Subramanyam as her preferred successor, emphasizing his roots in Loudoun County, with more than half of the registered voters in the district.\n\nWhile other congressional races have been largely national in message, Rozell said Subramanyam's ties to Loudoun and emphasis on local issues gave him an advantage over Democratic Del. Dan Helmer of Fairfax, who had raised the most money in the race but lived just outside of the district.\n\n\"He had a geographical challenge,\" Rozell said.\n\nSubramanyam won the race with a 30% plurality and a margin of less than 1,500 votes over Helmer.\n\nDave Ress (804) 649-6948\n\ndress@timesdispatch.com\n\nMichael Martz (804) 649-6964\n\nmmartz@timesdispatch.com\n\nBe the first to

McGuire led slightly with 92% of votes counted. Good, a hardline House Republican, faced backlash from both Trump and moderate Republicans. The district is strongly Republican, favoring the primary winner in November.\n\nThe race between U.S. Representative Bob Good, a prominent hardline House Republican, and a primary challenger backed by both Donald Trump and a key group of moderate Republicans, remained too close to call on Tuesday night. The winner of the contest between Good, chair of the House Freedom Caucus, and former Navy SEAL John McGuire is expected to easily carry the strongly Republican-leaning southern Virginia district in the Nov. 5 election, when control of the White House and both chambers of Congress will be up for grabs.\n\nVirginia state laws allow for a recount if results are within one percentage point. McGuire led Good by 0.4% - less than 300 votes - with 92% of votes counted, according to the Associated Press at time of publication. Good angered former President Trump by endorsing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in his Republican presidential primary campaign against Trump, switching his endorsement to Trump only after DeSantis dropped out.\n\nGood also ignited the ire of moderate Republicans after he voted to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy from his role in October, launching weeks of chaos and bitter, highly public infighting as Republicans attempted to coalesce around a replacement. Trump endorsed Good's challenger McGuire, a Virginia state senator, in a May social media post. Defending Main Street, the super PAC affiliated with the moderate Republican Main Street Caucus, has spent $600,000 on ads to defeat Good.\n\n\"He's a Republican in name only,\" Sarah Chamberlain, CEO of the Republican Main Street Partnership, the nonprofit organization affiliated with the caucus, said. The group does not normally work to oust incumbents, she said, calling Good \"a unique situation\" after he campaigned against moderate Republican colleagues and voted against Republican bills on the House floor. Following Trump's endorsement of McGuire, Good said in a statement, \"I have never been the choice of political power brokers in Washington.\"\n\nDEMOCRATS NOMINATE CANDIDATES Virginia Democrats and Republicans will also pick candidates on Tuesday to vie for the seats currently held by Democratic U.S. Representatives Jennifer Wexton and Abigail Spanberger, both elected in 2018 when their party won control of the House for the second half of Trump's term.\n\nThe districts could also play an important role in Democrats' efforts to win back a House majority in November. In Virginia's 7th district, Eugene Vindman, the brother of Alexander Vindman, who played an important role in Trump's first impeachment, was projected by the Associated Press to win the Democratic nomination for Spanberger's seat, which she is leaving to run for governor.\n\nDerrick Anderson, a former Green Beret, beat Cameron Hamilton, a former NAVY Seal, for the Republican nomination in the competitive district where many military families live, according to the Associated Press. In Virginia's 10th district, state Senator Democratic Suhas Subramanyam edged out a win in a crowded race to succeed the retiring Wexton, who endorsed him in May. The winner of Tuesday's primary is strongly favored to win the heavily Democratic district in November.\n\nPolls closed in Virginia at 7 p.m. (2300 GMT).\n\n(This story has not been edited by

John McGuire's bid to unseat U.S. Rep. Bob Good.\n\nAs of press time, McGuire was up by fewer than 300 votes and the contest was too close for the Associated Press to make a call. The bitter rivals had traded the lead back and forth in a contest that had largely revolved around loyalty to the former president.\n\nElections\n\nTrump calls in for McGuire on eve of 5th District primary\n\nDAVE RESS Richmond Times-Dispatch\n\nIn Tuesday's low-turnout voting, Virginians picked Democratic and Republican candidates in six of the state's 11 U.S. House districts.\n\nIn some, like the sprawling 5th District, which stretches southwest from Goochland, Louisa, Powhatan and parts of Hanover to the North Carolina line around Danville, the primary winner is the odds-on favorite to win the November general election.\n\nIn four congressional districts, Democratic and Republican candidates faced no intraparty challengers. In the 3rd District, anchored in Newport News, Democratic U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott faces only two independents in November.\n\nBut it was the 5th District that attracted the most outside interest, after Trump endorsed McGuire.\n\n\"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back sort of like he did with me,\" Trump told a virtual rally for McGuire on the eve of the primary.\n\nGood had endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for the GOP presidential nomination in April 2023, but then backed Trump after DeSantis dropped out of the race in January of this year.\n\nThe race for the GOP nomination was a highly personalized contest between two conservatives: one Good, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus who voted not to certify President Biden's election, and the other McGuire, who admittedly attended Trump's Jan. 6, 2021, \"Stop the Steal\" rally the day before the certification vote. McGuire has said he did not enter the U.S. Capitol during the riot that ensued.\n\nMcGuire, a former Navy SEAL, is a three-term member of the House of Delegates who declared his candidacy for Good's congressional seat less than two weeks after his election to the state Senate last year despite telling voters he was dedicated to serving in the state house.\n\nGood had trailed McGuire in the early evening tally, and more than 100 of his supporters who'd gathered for his election party at La-Villa, an Italian restaurant in Lynchburg, were tense. Members of the crowd stared at their phones, examining election results and refreshing the page over and over again in hopes their candidate would rally.\n\nJust before 9:30 p.m. their wish came true at least for the moment, as results showed Good had cut into the lead and made it a one-point race. It was the first time in the evening that the crowd cheered.\n\nGood spent most of the night sitting with family, supporters walking past to offer him words of encouragement. The congressman looked tense, occasionally resting his chin on his left hand, as servers walked through the crowd bringing pizza to customers.\n\nGood campaign manager Diana Shores said she had expected a tight race.\n\n\"But it's still so nerve-racking,\" Shores said.\n\nThe race split Republican leaders nationwide. McGuire campaigned with U.S. Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, while Good won the backing of Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon.\n\nTwo dozen members of the 5th District Republican Congressional Committee sent a letter to Trump in which they praised Good, attacked McGuire and called his endorsement of the latter \"ill-advised.\"\n\nGood has called McGuire a \"perpetual candidate\" who lacks his conservative bona fides, seeing as how McGuire was supported by former allies of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Good was one of eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy last year.\n\nMcGuire raised more than $1.2 million, while Good collected more than $1.1 million, according to the latest financial reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission.\n\nBut the outside spending dwarfed these sums.\n\nSix political action committees have spent $5 million to attack Good or promote McGuire, led by the American Patriots PAC.\n\nNine outside PACs have spent more than $3.4 million to attack McGuire or promote Good, led by the Conservative Outsider and Protect Freedom, a super PAC associated with Paul.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats on Tuesday nominated Gloria Tinsley Witt, a leadership coach and head of the Amherst County NAACP, who prevailed in a three-way contest.\n\nThe district has not elected a Democrat to Congress since 2008, when Charlottesville's Tom Perriello edged Rep. Virgil Goode of Rocky Mount by 727 votes.\n\nTimes-Dispatch reporter Michael Martz and Daily Progress reporter Jason Armesto contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "dailyprogress.com",

The remaining votes are not expected to be counted on Wednesday as Virginia observes the Juneteenth federal holiday.\n\nIf the margin of victory between the candidates is less than 1 percent, the race -- which has not been called by the AP or other prominent news outlets -- could head to a recount.\n\nThe Cook Political Report, an independent publication for election analysis, cited Trump's endorsement of McGuire as the reason Good is considered one of the GOP incumbents most vulnerable to losing their candidacy before November's elections.\n\nAs Good and McGuire remain neck and neck, it seems Trump's influence on primary elections may not have the pull it once did.\n\nTrump has often cited his record of endorsing candidates who go on to win their respective races as a sign of his influence and power over the Republican Party.\n\nWhile the former president has urged Republican primary voters to support McGuire over Good -- who has also been targeted by establishment Republicans and super PACs after being one of eight GOP lawmakers who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy as House speaker in October -- the incumbent could still win Virginia's 5th Congressional District.\n\nIf Good manages to win the race, it will be the third time in recent weeks that a Trump-backed candidate has lost their election.\n\nOn May 28, Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan narrowly defeated David Covey, his Trump-endorsed challenger, in the primary runoff for the state's District 21.\n\nThough the GOP primary election for Virginia's 5th Congressional District has not been called, McGuire declared himself the victor Tuesday night.\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, McGuire wrote, \"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory.\"\n\nIn his own statement on the social media platform, Good thanked his supporters and said he was waiting for the final election results.\n\n\"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help we were able to make this race too close to call,\" he wrote on X.\n\nGood continued: \"We implemented the best early voting operation that the 5th District has ever seen, and we are still waiting for the results of mail-in ballots and provisional ballots. We are doing what we can to ensure we have teams of observers and legal counsel to ensure all the votes are properly counted in the coming days.\"\n\nTrump endorsed McGuire over Good after the congressman backed Florida Governor Ron DeSantis over the former president in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.\n\nGood later switched allegiances to Trump after DeSantis ended his White House bid in January. Trump described Good's endorsement as being \"too late,\" saying the \"damage had been done.\"\n\n\"I just want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, and the person that can most help me do that is Navy Seal and highly respected State Legislator, John McGuire, a true American Hero,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nHe added: \"John, who fought the Cartels on the Front Line, and then came home and fought the drug dealers in Virginia, will ALWAYS PUT AMERICA FIRST.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ewan_palmer@newsweek.com", "name":

Bob Good, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, trailed primary challenger state Sen. John McGuire by 327 votes as of 12 a.m. Wednesday morning, according to unofficial returns in the GOP nomination race in the reliably red southern Virginia district.\n\nVirginia observes the Juneteenth holiday, and a resumption of the vote tabulation for the remaining uncounted ballots in the race may not take place until Thursday. The current margin in the election is less than one percent and if it remains under that level, the race would qualify for a recount according to Virginia law.\n\nFOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN, TRUMP IN A DEAD HEAT IN VIRGINIA\n\nGood, who is running for a third term in Congress, aims to avert becoming the first House incumbent this election cycle to be ousted by a primary challenger, in a contentious intra-party primary battle that pitted conservatives versus conservatives and Trump against some of his biggest allies in the House of Representatives.\n\n\"We need leaders that know how to put petty differences aside and bring people together for a better future,\" McGuire, a former Navy SEAL, told supporters on Tuesday night. \"And that's what I'm all about.\"\n\nHEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS PRIMARY RESULTS\n\nHis comments came as he prematurely declared victory in a speech at his election party in Lynchburg, Virginia.\n\n\"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory,\" McGuire argued in a social media post just after midnight.\n\nGood did not give a speech at his primary night gathering, which was also held in Lynchburg, but in a social media post he noted that \"we're still waiting on the final election results.\"\n\n\"This race remains too close to call,\" Good wrote on social media on Wednesday. \"We are in a period where the law provides a process for evaluating the accuracy of all the vote totals from election day to ensure everyone can have full confidence in the certified results. Provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are also still to be counted. We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed. We believe we can still prevail.\"\n\nIn a race where a whopping $14 million was spent -- with much of it targeting the incumbent -- Good wrote that \"no matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right. Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now.\"\n\nGood incurred Trump's wrath for being one of just a handful of House Republicans to endorse Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential primaries.\n\nEven though Good avoided criticizing Trump and quickly endorsed the former president after DeSantis ended his White House bid in January, Trump wrote on this Truth Social platform that \"the damage has been done!\"\n\nThe former president last month endorsed McGuire, who also had the backing of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a conservative firebrand and major Trump ally who is a vocal critic of Good who last year broke with the House Freedom Caucus. The group is considered the most far-right organization of lawmakers in the chamber.\n\nMcCarthy also targeted Good, who was one of eight Republicans last autumn who joined with Democrats to vote to oust McCarthy from his leadership position.\n\nGood had the support of Reps. Matt Gaetz and Byron Donalds of Florida, two conservatives who are also strong backers of Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFellow House Freedom Caucus members, Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Andy Biggs of Arizona, joined Good in Virginia for a rally on Friday.\n\nEven though he was targeted by Trump, Good spotlighted his support for the former president as he ran for re-election.\n\n\"Happy Birthday to the best and next president of the United States, President Trump!\" Good wrote on social media on Friday, which was the former president's 78th birthday.\n\nGood also showed up earlier this spring at Trump's criminal trial in New York City to show his support for the former president.", "source": {"uri": "1010wcsi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "1010

Bob Good (R-VA) is at the center of one of the most hotly contested primaries on Tuesday as several key GOP figures want him out of Congress for different reasons.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus chairman has received the backing of several of his Republican colleagues, but his opponent, Republican state Sen. John McGuire, has received the support of some GOP power players, including former President Donald Trump, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). Here are why those three Republicans are trying to ensure Good has a bad night on Tuesday.\n\nTrump endorsed Good in 2020 and 2022, but for the 2024 GOP presidential primary, the Virginia congressman chose to support Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, over the former president. When DeSantis dropped out of the race in January, Good flipped his endorsement to Trump, but months later, Trump endorsed against Good.\n\nThe former president took a jab at Good during a meeting on Capitol Hill last week and has lambasted the Virginia congressman as bad for his state and the country -- largely due to the loyalty factor.\n\n\"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA. He turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement -- But really, it was too late. The damage had been done!\" Trump said in his Truth Social post endorsing McGuire.\n\nMcCarthy allies have made Good's race a part of the former House speaker's revenge tour after he was ousted from the speakership in October 2023. Good was one of the eight Republicans who joined all Democrats to remove McCarthy, making him the first and only speaker to be successfully ousted via a motion to vacate.\n\nGood opposed McCarthy's speakership bid in January 2023 and remained one of his chief critics until he was one of the key votes to remove him nine months later. McCarthy has attempted to oust other House Republicans who voted to remove him, but his endorsement of Rep. Nancy Mace's (R-SC) opponent in last week's primary for South Carolina's 1st Congressional District failed to move the needle.\n\nCurrent House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) did not make an endorsement in Good's primary despite endorsing incumbents who have faced challenges throughout the country.

(AP) -- One of America's most conservative congressmen was locked in a tight renomination battle against an opponent endorsed by former President Donald Trump in Virginia's primary election Tuesday\n\nRep. Bob Good, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, is seeking a third term representing Virginia's 5th Congressional District, but state Sen. John McGuire has mounted a strong challenge that highlights frictions in the party.\n\nMeanwhile, in House District 10, voters chose Suhas Subramanyam from a field of 12 Democrats to try to hold the seat held by U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, who is not seeking reelection to her northern Virginia seat after being diagnosed with a rare, incurable neurological illness.\n\nIn House District 7, voters chose Eugene Vindman in a crowded Democratic primary to try to hold the seat being vacated by U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a popular incumbent who is running for governor in 2025.\n\nStatewide, voters selected Hung Cao as the Republican nominee to the U.S. Senate to take on Democrat Tim Kaine.\n\nHere's a look at the major battles on the ballot:\n\nHouse District 5\n\nConventional politics might suggest a congressman with the conservative credentials of Good would be safe in a primary. But he earned the wrath of Trump when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president. He switched back to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but Trump is endorsing McGuire and portraying Good as a backstabber.\n\nTrump continued to bash Good as he campaigned for McGuire in a telephone rally Monday night.\n\n\"Unlike Bob Good, John McGuire will not let you down,\" Trump said, adding that McGuire is \"strong on the border\" and \"will always defend your under-siege Second Amendment.\"\n\nGood, for his part, says he considers Trump the best president in his lifetime and only endorsed DeSantis because Trump is constitutionally limited to only one more term.\n\nGood also alienated Republican insiders by voting to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, throwing the party into a measure of chaos.\n\nSeeking to capitalize is McGuire, a state legislator and former Navy SEAL who has echoed Trump's attacks on Good, calling him a \"never Trumper.\"\n\nGood has bashed McGuire as a serial campaigner who announced his congressional bid just one week after winning election to a four-year term in the state Senate.\n\nIf Good loses, he would be the first House incumbent to go down to a primary challenge this year, with the exception of one race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\nThe winner will face Democrat Gloria Tinsley Witt, who defeated Gary Terry and Paul Riley.\n\nThe 5th Congressional District stretches from Charlottesville in the north, past the far western suburbs of Richmond, through Lynchburg and down to Danville and the North Carolina border.\n\nHouse District 7\n\nVindman, a political newcomer who was nonetheless familiar to voters for his role in Trump's first impeachment, has won the Democratic nomination in the 7th Congressional District for what will be a closely watched congressional seat in November.\n\nVindman, who crushed his opponents in fundraising, won in a crowded seven-person field that included four women of color who were all current or former officeholders in Prince William County, a suburban area outside the nation's capital that constitutes the largest portion of the district.\n\nThe former Army officer gained a measure of fame when he and his twin brother, Alex, reported their concerns about Trump's 2019 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which Trump sought an investigation of Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nVindman highlighted his opposition to Trump in his campaign and in a victory statement issued Tuesday evening said \"our grass-roots movement is coming for the extreme MAGA agenda. Virginia voters are first and foremost values driven, and want to elect leaders with integrity who preserve fundamental rights and freedoms and not extremists.\"\n\nHe faced criticism from some local officials who said he was unconnected to the region's political dynamics.\n\nIn a battle between a former Army Green Beret and a former Navy SEAL, Republican voters chose the Army man, Derrick Anderson, over Navy veteran Cameron Hamilton.\n\nAnderson and Hamilton were the top two fundraisers in a six-person field. Anderson drew support from House GOP leadership in Washington, while Hamilton had support from members of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe district, which stretches from Prince William County south to Fredericksburg and west past Culpeper, tilts just slightly toward Democrats.\n\nHouse District 10\n\nSubramanyam defeated fellow Democratic candidates former Virginia House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, state Sens. Dan Helmer and Jennifer Boysko, and former Virginia Education Secretary Atif Qarni. Wexton endorsed Subramanyam.\n\nRepublican voters chose Mike Clancy from a field of four candidates.\n\nHouse District 2\n\nIn Virginia's coastal 2nd Congressional District, Missy Cotter Smasal, a Navy veteran who runs a nonprofit that honors fallen servicewomen, defeated Jeremiah \"Jake\" Denton IV, a constitutional law and civil rights attorney, in the Democratic primary.\n\nShe'll face Republican U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans in November.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday evening, Smasal took aim at Kiggans and \"the MAGA extremism she supports in Congress.\"\n\n\"I will protect abortion rights and access for all and fight for resources for veterans and military families,\" Smasal said. \"I will always defend democracy and reject party extremism.\"\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nIn the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, Navy veteran Cao prevailed over his four opponents for a chance to try to unseat Kaine, a Democrat who is seeking his third term as the state's junior U.S. senator.\n\nCao had the most money and previous campaign experience running for higher officer among the Republican primary contenders. He also had Trump's endorsement.\n\nIn a victory post on Facebook, Cao immediately criticized President Joe Biden's decision on Tuesday to allow certain U.S. citizens' spouses without legal status to apply eventually for citizenship.\n\n\"Tomorrow, we begin our campaign to save the country that saved my life,\" Cao stated. \"I spent twenty-five years in the Navy, while Tim Kaine spent thirty years in elected office.\"\n\nCao defeated Scott Parkinson, a former congressional staffer for DeSantis, as well as Jonathan Emord, an author and lawyer who often cites his court battles against the Food and Drug Administration. The other Republican candidates were Eddie Garcia, a U.S. Army veteran who owns a mobile app that serves veterans, and Chuck Smith, a former Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps commander and an attorney.\n\nFinley contributed to this report from Norfolk.", "source": {"uri": "dailyprogress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Progress"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Bob Good, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, found himself in a tight fight Tuesday night against a challenger backed by powerful Republicans, including former President Donald Trump and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nJust a few hundred votes separated Sen. John McGuire in the lead and Good closely behind him in Virginia's deep-red 5th District on Tuesday evening. If the margin remains less than 1 percentage point, the losing candidate may request a recount within 10 days of certification of the election results, in accordance with Virginia state law.\n\nGood risks becoming the first sitting lawmaker to lose to a primary challenger this year.\n\nIn an article on He appeared to hint at the possibility of a recount and said the process could take weeks to declare a winner.\n\nWe are in a period where the law provides a process to evaluate the accuracy of all vote totals beginning on Election Day to ensure that everyone can have full confidence in the certified results, Good said on X.\n\nWe think we can still win.\n\nGood drew McCarthy's ire, as did one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust him last year. McGuire vastly outspent Good on the airwaves, and McCarthy-aligned outside groups also outspent allies of Virginia congressmen, according to ad tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nThis is Kevin McCarthy's revenge tour, Good told NBC News Friday at an event in Goochland, Virginia.\n\nHe has apparently dedicated his life to trying to get revenge on those he holds responsible for not being president, except himself, Good later added. But the people of the 5th District will not be bought.\n\nMcGuire also had the most coveted endorsement in the GOP primaries: Trump.\n\nMcGuire thanked Trump Tuesday night by declaring victory, even though the race remains very close.\n\nThis is a time when we need to come together because we still have a lot of work to do. I'm your Republican candidate, but I'm not going to take it lightly, Good said during his election night, according to a live broadcast of his election night speech on ABC13.\n\nMcGuire said Trump was a big part of our victory and I won't forget him.\n\nThe challenger put things a little further in a campaign statement: \"There are still a few votes to count, but it is clear that all paths lead to victory.\"\n\nThe former president endorsed McGuire three weeks before Tuesday's primary, making a veiled reference to Good's support of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the presidential primary. Trump's subsequent endorsement was not enough to put him in the former president's good graces.\n\nAfter endorsing McGuire, Trump appeared in a television ad and held a tele-rally for McGuire Monday night, telling his supporters that John is running against Bob Good, who is no good. Despite his name, he is very bad for Virginia.\n\nMcGuire, a former Navy SEAL whose campaign slogan was \"We can do better than right,\" told NBC News Friday at a community concert in Powhatan that Trump's support had been helpful in the race.\n\nA lot of people said I don't know anything about you, I've never met you before, but if Trump supports you, I've got you, McGuire said. I believe that with everything Trump has been through, he has earned the right to take the lead and choose his team.\n\nBut Good is no stranger to running against a Trump-backed candidate. In 2020, Good defeated then-Rep. Denver Riggleman at a party convention, held via drive-thru amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Cole was also in the running Tuesday, but defeated his primary opponent, businessman Paul Bondar, who spent millions of dollars of his own money on the race. Cole, who chairs the powerful House Appropriations Committee, received a boost from Trump in the race and recently told NBC News that Trump's support has been extremely helpful to him as he faces the toughest primary competitive and the most expensive since its first election in 2002.\n\nBondar loaned his campaign $5.1 million of his own money, running ads accusing Cole of losing touch with the 4th District and spending too much time in the nation's capital. Bondar also said Cole was not conservative enough, pointing to Cole's support for government spending and aid to Ukraine.\n\nCole and his allies blanketed the airwaves with ads accusing Bondar of actually being a Texan. Bondar owns property in Oklahoma, outside the 4th District, but he voted in the Texas primary in March.\n\nElsewhere in Virginia on Tuesday, Republican voters chose Navy veteran Hung Cao to take on Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in November, according to NBC News projects. Cao, who had Trump's support in the race, led the Republican field in fundraising and beat two other GOP contenders.\n\nCao unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2022, losing by nearly 7 points to Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton. He enters a tough race against Kaine, who is seeking a third term in a state that has sent Democrats to the Senate in recent years. Biden won the state by 10 points in 2020 and Kaine won a second term in 2018 by 17 points.\n\nIn the House, Democrats are also choosing a candidate to take on Republican Jen Kiggans in the 2nd District, and both parties are choosing their candidates in the 7th and 10th Districts.\n\nRetired Army Col. Yevgeny Eugene Vindman is expected to win the Democratic nomination in the 7th District, giving Democrats a high-profile candidate with military experience and strong fundraising abilities. He hopes to hold the Democratic seat in the fall despite the Democratic Party's decision. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, another top fundraiser with national security experience, is running for governor.\n\nVindman gained national prominence during Trump's first impeachment trial, when he and his brother raised concerns, from their seats on the National Security Council, about Trump's phone conversation with the Ukrainian president in 2019 . Although he was a first-time candidate, he was by far. and by far the best fundraiser in the race, and received support from outside groups on the airwaves as he ran against more experienced local politicians.\n\nHe will face Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret, who defeated former Navy SEAL Cameron Hamilton in a clash between the establishment and the party's insurgent wings. Anderson was backed by a super PAC linked to McCarthy and Republican megadonors, as well as House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nIn the 10th District, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam is expected to win the crowded and costly Democratic primary in Virginia's 10th District, where Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton is not seeking re-election after being diagnosed with a rare and serious illness called paralysis progressive supranuclear. .\n\nSubramanyam earned Wexton's endorsement, which helped distinguish him from a large group of well-funded Democrats that included state Rep. Dan Helmer, the former speaker of the state Assembly, Eileen Filler-Corn, and former Defense Department official Krystle Kaul. He will control the district for Democrats in the fall, as Democrats have performed well recently in this suburban Washington, D.C., district and will face Republican businessman and lawyer Mike Clancy.\n\nKiggans will face Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, a military veteran who had been endorsed by all of Virginia's Democratic members of the House of Representatives. This is a swing district that will likely be competitive in the fall, but Kiggans has a significant fundraising advantage and defeated a Democratic incumbent there to win the seat in 2022.\n\nGeorgia also held its runoff in an election where no candidate won a majority of primary votes in March.\n\nIn the Democratic-leaning 2nd District, activist Chuck Hand, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with the January 6, 2021 attack, lost the runoff for the Republican nomination.\n\nAnd Trump's former White House political director, Brian Jack, is expected to win the Republican Party primary runoff against state Sen. Mike Dugan. The Republican will be the heavy favorite to win in November to replace retiring GOP Rep. Drew Ferguson.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Bob Good vs. Trump-backed challenger election still too close to call\n\nMargie Cullen, USA TODAY\n\nJune 20, 2024 at 4:59 PM\n\nWith more than 95% of the results for Virginia's primary election on Tuesday, the outcome of the hotly contested primary race between Republican incumbent Representative Bob Good and state Senator John McGuire was still too close to call.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, McGuire led Good by just 324 votes, or just .52%, out of 62,536 votes cast in the Republican primary race for Virginia's fifth congressional district.\n\nWho are the candidates?\n\nGood, a conservative Republican who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, has represented Virginia's fifth district since 2020 and is seeking a third term.\n\nMcGuire is a Virginia state senator representing the 56th district, which encompasses the north and west of Richmond. Before becoming a state Senator in 2023, he served on Virginia's House of Delegates.\n\nMcGuire claims victory\n\nDespite a still-undecided election, McGuire's posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday suggested he expects victory.\n\n\"Thank you to my family, thank you to everyone who helped out on this campaign, thank you to the people who endorsed and supported me, and thank you to Donald J. Trump for believing in me. There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory,\" he wrote. \"\n\nFor his part, Good said that they are still waiting on the results of mail-in and provisional ballots.\n\n\"Right now, we're still waiting on the final election results of today's Primary,\" he posted on social media. \"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help, we were able to make this race too close to call.\"\n\nHow Trump shook up the race\n\nVirginia's 5th Congressional District is a Republican stronghold that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. It would seem a safe place for a conservative congressman like Good to be re-elected.\n\nBut Good earned Trump's wrath after initially endorsing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for president. After DeSantis dropped out, he switched to supporting Trump, but the former president endorsed Good's opponent instead.\n\n\"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA. He turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"John McGuire has my Complete and Total Endorsement!\"\n\nLater, Trump's attorneys sent Good a cease-and-desist letter for using the presumptive Republican nominee's name and likeness on campaign materials.\n\nOnce the votes are finally tallied, Virginia law allows for a recount if the margin of victory is less than a percentage point. If the ballot count is within half a percentage point, the recount can be conducted at the state's expense, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Portsmouth Herald: VA Rep.

Bob Good campaign claims he 'can still prevail' in cliff-hanger...", "body": "House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good was adamant Wednesday that he could still eke out a win in his bruising Virginia primary contest against state Sen. John McGuire, despite trailing by more than 300 votes.\n\nAfter the bulk of the ballots were tallied Tuesday night, McGuire -- who scored the coveted endorsement of former President Donald Trump last month -- declared victory, telling supporters: \"I'm your Republican nominee.\"\n\nBut Good, 58, declined to concede, with his campaign posting on X: \"This race remains too close to call. We are in a period where the law provides a process for evaluating the accuracy of all the vote totals from election day to ensure everyone can have full confidence in the certified results.\"\n\nAs of 2 p.m. Wednesday, McGuire led Good by 0.6 percentage points with an estimated 98% of the vote in -- inside the 1% margin needed to trigger a recount should the incumbent request and pay for it.\n\n\"Provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are also still to be counted,\" Good's campaign said. \"We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed. We believe we can still prevail.\"\n\nVirginia's 5th District GOP primary was widely seen as a chance at revenge both for Trump, 78, and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)\n\nGood had rankled Trump by endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the 2024 GOP presidential primary and he was one of the eight Republican rabble-rousers who banded together with 208 Democrats to topple McCarthy as speaker this past Oct. 3.\n\nFar-right Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who spearheaded the mutiny against McCarthy, had backed Good, a rare instance of him being at odds with Trump.\n\n\"This is a time where we need to come together because we still have a lot of work to do,\" McGuire declared Tuesday evening.\n\n\"I'm your Republican nominee, but I'm not going to take it lightly. We've got to win in November.\"\n\nThroughout the primary, outside groups dumped an estimated $10.7 million into the race, with more than half of it earmarked against Good, per an analysis from OpenSecrets.\n\nThe 5th District, which covers much of the central part of the commonwealth south of the James River, is widely seen as solid Republican territory, meaning whoever wins the primary is favored to keep the seat red in November\n\nSeveral prominent Republicans quickly cheered the news of Good trailing McGuire.\n\n\"This victory shows just how toxic Bob Good has been to the Republican Party, the America First movement, and perhaps most critically to the reelection of President Trump,\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) posted on X.\n\nGreene was booted from the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus last year after a spat with Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), whom Greene referred to as a \"little b -- .\"\n\nModerate members of the GOP also hailed the primary outcome.\n\n\"Bob Good has done more to undermine and divide Republicans than any Democrat,\" Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) posted on X late Tuesday. \"I congratulate John McGuire on a huge win for the GOP.

(AP) - Conservative U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., is asking for \"patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks\" as he hopes the final ballot count from Tuesday's primary will allow him to fend off a challenger endorsed by former president Donald Trump.\n\nGood, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, currently trails state Sen. John McGuire by a little over 300 votes as elections officials finalize their vote counts and mail-in ballots continue to trickle in.\n\nThe Associated Press has not yet called the race for either candidate.\n\nIf Good loses, he would be the first House incumbent to lose a primary challenge this year, with the exception of one race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\nAs one of the most conservative congressmen in the country, Good might be impervious to a primary challenge under normal circumstances. But he earned Trump's wrath when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president. He switched back to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but Trump endorsed McGuire and called Good a backstabber.\n\nMcGuire's lead of roughly 300 votes translates to a margin of about half a percentage point out of more than 62,000 ballots cast. Once the results are certified, Virginia law allows for a recount if the margin of victory is less than a percentage point. If it's within half a percentage point, the recount can be conducted at the state's expense.\n\nVirginia state Sen.

We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved,\" he said.\n\nBoth Good and McGuire are among Republicans who have raised concerns about election integrity in the wake of Trump's false claims of voter fraud in his 2020 reelection defeat. Good was among more than 100 GOP House members who voted in January 2021 to object to the Electoral College count from states that Trump disputed.\n\nIn a pre-election telephone rally with Trump on Monday, McGuire urged supporters to deliver him a margin of victory \"too big to rig.\"\n\nRep.

With about 94 percent of the votes tallied, McGuire earned 31,411 votes -- about 50.26 percent -- to Good's 31,084 votes, or 49.74 percent.\n\nVideo posted online by reporter Reese Gorman showed McGuire pumping his fist and beginning a \"hooyah\" chant with his supporters.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, the votes are in and the people have spoken,\" McGuire began. \"It is an honor to be your Republican nominee ... [inaudible].\"\n\nGood, meanwhile, did not concede defeat as of midnight.\n\n\"Right now, we're still waiting on the final election results of today's Primary,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"As we wait, I wanted to thank you for your support thus far. You made sure your vote was cast.\"\n\nGood thanked his staff and volunteers -- \"several of you had tough conversations to ensure people knew the truth about this race\" -- as well as poll workers. He also blasted what he called the \"entire DC Swamp,\" which he said was aligned against his campaign and supplied more than $10 million in attack ads.\n\n\"No matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right. Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now,\" Good said.\n\nEven before Trump handed down his endorsement of McGuire, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) already signaled he was unlikely to commit resources to defending Good in his primary.\n\nVirginia's 5th District is a right-leaning constituency in the central and southern parts of the state, which also includes the heavily blue community of Charlottesville.\n\nALSO READ: Neuroscientist explains how Trump and Biden's cognitive impairments are different\n\nWhile its boundaries and partisan composition have varied somewhat over the years, the district centered here hasn't elected a Democrat in a congressional contest since 2008. However, one Republican elected in this district during that time, Rep. Denver Riggleman, became an outspoken Trump opponent and helped the House Select Committee on Jan. 6 conduct its investigation.\n\nBoth Good and McGuire spent the campaign trying to prove their Trump bona fides to voters, with the two traveling to Manhattan during the former president's criminal trial to denounce the proceedings.\n\nHowever, in the final days of the campaign, Trump officials slapped Good with a cease-and-desist order for using Trump's campaign symbols on his own yard signs, implying an endorsement. Asked for comment, Good dismissed Trump's opposition, calling it a \"stupid topic.\"", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Bob Good, R-5th, waits at his watch party at La Villa restaurant in Lynchburg as primary results come in on Tuesday night.\n\nMARK J. ROZELL\n\nHis name was not on the ballot, but the most fiercely fought of Tuesday's congressional primaries in Virginia were referendums on the 45th president and Republican nominee-apparent to be the 47th president -- Donald J. Trump.\n\nThat was the case in one remarkably bitter Republican primary and, for different reasons, in a Democratic primary in an adjacent district.\n\nThe 5th Congressional District's GOP bloodbath started out as a contest to see which of two hard-right conservatives could cling most tightly to Trump's mantle: incumbent U.S. Rep. Bob Good or his challenger, state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland.\n\nLast month, Trump left no doubt, siding with McGuire. On Tuesday, the unofficial count showed the race too close to call with all precincts reporting and possibly resulting in a recount.\n\nPeople are also reading...

A polarizing figure in the U.S. House and to many in the GOP as leader of small a clique of fringe-right Republicans known as the Freedom Caucus, Good made two very powerful and unforgiving enemies in the past year.\n\nMcGuire holds slight lead in 5th district, inside recount margin\n\nIn the Virginia race where former president Donald Trump's endorsement boomed loudest, his favored candidate, state Sen. John McGuire eked out a narrow 315 vote lead over Rep. Bob Good.\n\nLast fall, he led the charge to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy for compromising with House Democrats on a stopgap spending bill that averted a government shutdown. Good and the Freedom Caucus banded with Democrats to oust McCarthy. That prompted a pro-McCarthy group, the Defending Main Street super PAC, to align with McGuire, a hard-right conservative who won a four-year state Senate seat only seven months ago.\n\nThen Good angered Trump by initially backing his bitter primary rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. After DeSantis folded his campaign, Good endorsed Trump and even appeared with other Republicans in a New York City courtroom recently to show GOP unity for Trump during his trial for falsifying business records to conceal hush money paid during his 2016 campaign to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nWhen Trump endorsed McGuire three weeks ago, it turbocharged an already spiteful primary where an unheard-of $12 million was spent by the May 29 campaign finance reporting deadline. Independent expenditures from outside groups accounted for just over $10 million, according to OpenSecrets.org.\n\nNo group spent more than the American Patriots PAC. Through May, it had spent more than $2.7 million attacking Good and about $1.7 million in support of McGuire. Since then, it has increased its saturation of broadcast and online advertising in which Trump praises McGuire, a former Navy SEAL, as a hero and condemns Good as \"bad for Virginia\" and a traitor who \"turned his back on our incredible movement.\" Other outside groups backing McGuire and opposing Good included Virginians for Freedom.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nDems nominate Subramanyam to run for Wexton's seat in 10th District\n\nGood wasn't without super PAC allies. They included Conservative Outsider, which spent $2.8 million backing Good; Protect Freedom PAC allied with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky; and House Freedom Action.\n\nIn defending his seat, Good went for broke, bizarrely branding McGuire a \"liberal,\" alleging that he is permissive toward unchecked immigration along the border with Mexico. In 2023, the most recent year for which grades are available, the American Conservative Union gave McGuire a 91% conservative voting score, putting him in a five-way tie for the third most conservative voting record in the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nIn the neighboring 7th Congressional District, which takes in a swath of the Washington, D.C., suburbs and exurbs, Trump cast a different sort of shadow in the Democratic primary, and a notable Trump foe was its beneficiary.\n\nRetired Army Lt. Col. Yevgeny \"Eugene\" Vindman won his nomination in a rout Tuesday over a field of six other Democrats that included local and state elected officeholders.\n\nRepublicans pick Anderson to run for Spanberger's congressional seat\n\nVindman and his twin brother, Alex, both officers with the National Security Council at the time, listened to a 2019 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and told their superiors that Trump tried to persuade Zelenskyy to investigate his 2020 re-election rival, Joe Biden, and Biden's son, Hunter.\n\nHe embraced that record in his first bid for elective office, seeking to succeed incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor next year.\n\nVindman's name and his story allowed him to build a national fundraising juggernaut that took in just over $5 million -- roughly four-fifths of the $6.3 million raised by all seven Democratic primary candidates combined through May 29. Massachusetts and California were particularly generous to his campaign, according to Federal Election Commission data.\n\nWinning the 5th District primary is tantamount to winning the seat in the strongly conservative area. Good was re-elected in 2022 by a margin of nearly 16 percentage points. The last time a Democrat won the seat was 2008.\n\nThe 7th, however, is Virginia's most competitive U.S. House district and will be among the most closely followed nationally this fall as Republicans fight desperately to hold their tenuous majority and Democrats battle just as desperately to take it.\n\nThe the lesson from this week's primary will extend to November: Trump's name will only be on the presidential ballot, but he will influence races up and down the ballot.\n\nPHOTOS: Primary voting in the Richmond area\n\nMark J.

John McGuire the push he needed to eke out what's now a tiny lead in Virginia's 5th District, political scientists say.\n\nBut the big question is what McGuire's current 315-vote, 0.5-point margin signifies about the influence of an endorsement from the former president.\n\nElections Trump-backed McGuire holds slight lead in race with incumbent Bob Good, inside recount margin DAVE RESS Richmond Times-Dispatch\n\nWith that close a result, political scientists think a recount is coming.\n\n\"Why did Good make it so close, and perhaps even prevail despite Trump's severe attacks?\" asked John McGlennon, a College of William and Mary political scientist.\n\nLocal electoral boards must still complete their work of checking and doubling-checking Tuesday night's preliminary tallies and count the final mail-in and provisional ballots.\n\nThe 0.5-point gap between McGuire and Good opens the path to a recount, once the boards certify results.\n\nIn a way, the question of Trump's influence comes down to 5th District voters' strong feelings about Washington, government officials and outsiders telling them what to do.\n\n\"It's useful to recognize that for many MAGA voters, Trump's appeal is his willingness to stick it to the establishment,\" McGlennon said.\n\n\"In this race, ironically, the incumbent could proudly point to the Republican establishment's attacks as a sign that he's even more Trump than Trump. Good has that grassroots support that rejects all the party leaders and elected officials ganging up on him because he won't play their game,\" he said.\n\nDuring the campaign, Good made a point of noting that groups close to former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy had supported McGuire.\n\nElections Trump calls in for McGuire on eve of 5th District primary DAVE RESS Richmond Times-Dispatch\n\n\"Even Marjorie Taylor Greene became part of the establishment. Look at the lack of turnout for McGuire and Greene on their two-day blitz,\" McGlennon said.\n\nMcGuire's narrow lead shows that that large numbers of 5th district conservatives did not believe that either McGuire or Trump offered a principled reason to abandon Good, while McCarthy allies' support for McGuire was another reason to stick to Good, said longtime Virginia analyst Bob Holsworth, a former VCU dean.\n\n\"The vast majority of Good voters will cast a ballot for Trump in November. But for Trump to be competitive in Virginia, he will need a huge turnout in the parts of the district that supported Good. The open question is whether the enthusiasm level that drives turnout will be as high as he need,\" Holsworth said.\n\nRoanoke College political scientist Harry Wilson said Trump's impact is obvious.\n\n\"In an election this close, you can point to a variety of factors, but I seriously doubt McGuire would have won, assuming he does, without Trump's endorsement. Kevin McCarthy may have a fingerprint on it as well,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"Maybe some folks were tired of Good's style. Maybe folks actually like McGuire. Some may still be smarting over Good defeating [Denver] Riggleman,\" Wilson said, referring to the Republican who represented the district for one term before Good defeated him in a 2020 nominating convention after Riggleman officiated a same-sex marriage and drew fire for his stands on immigration and fiscal policy.\n\nStill, it was Trump who swung the election for McGuire, said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington.\n\n\"If the former president had not weighed in against Good, the incumbent would have been renominated in a walk,\" Farnsworth said. \"His combative brand of conservatism fits well with the preferences of Republican primary voters in the district.\"\n\nGood's bad luck was an early endorsement last year of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' short-lived bid to challenge Trump for the GOP's presidential nomination, Farnsworth said.\n\n\"Trump personalizes politics at every opportunity. If Good had made the politically savvy choice of backing Trump from the start, rather than endorsing DeSantis, he wouldn't be on the knife's edge of losing this renomination,\" he added.\n\nElections Cao wins GOP nomination for US Senate, will take on Kaine RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH STAFF\n\nEd Lynch, chairman of Hollins University's global politics and societies department, said McGuire probably would not have received much more than 30% of the vote without Trump's support.\n\n\"To my mind, there is no question that the only way to put up a serious primary challenge to a rock-ribbed conservative like Bob Good was with an endorsement by Donald Trump,\" he said.\n\nEarly voting offers a key clue to Trump's influence, political scientists say.\n\nGood won 5,822 early votes to McGuire's 5,012, but McGuire had a 943-vote edge with Election Day ballots, according to unofficial state Department of Election tallies. All in all, once mail-in ballots already counted are included, McGuire won 31,370 votes to Good's 31,055.\n\n\"The early voting numbers demonstrated that Good's appeal remained stronger until Trump ramped up his attacks on the Republican incumbent in recent days over what Trump viewed as Good's disloyalty,\" Farnsworth said.\n\nThose attacks included the virtual rally on Monday evening during which Trump declared: \"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back sort of like he did with me.\"\n\nThe primary saw some big spending, much of it from outsiders. All in all, the sums spent will likely exceed $15 million from the two campaigns themselves and outside independent committees, with more backing McGuire and attacking Good, McGlennon said.\n\nTurnout was big, as well, with more than 62,000 voting, nearly double the turnout in the busiest of Virginia's eight other House primaries.\n\n\"Turnout was huge in the 5th because you had two combative candidates who were roughly evenly matched,\" said Farnsworth. \"The margin was far closer than in any of the other congressional primary contests in Virginia on Tuesday, and there was huge campaign spending dropped into this race from national Republicans.\"\n\nGood beat McGuire in his Lynchburg-area home base, racking up margins as high at 56% and 59% of votes cast, and also led in the Charlottesville area. McGuire won 60%-plus margins in the parts of the district nearest Richmond, including his Goochland County home as well as Louisa, Powhatan and parts of Hanover counties.\n\nPolitics A blow to Bob: Trump endorsement could tilt 5th District GOP primary in John McGuire's favor Jason Armesto\n\n\"I wouldn't read anything into this race carrying over to November, but the polls, including Roanoke College, suggest the general election will be much closer than 2020,\" Wilson said.\n\nThe real message from the 5th District may be how the presidential campaigns interpret the 5th when they start allocating resources to different states, Wilson said.\n\nAnd Trump gave one clue at the McGuire virtual rally, when he said he would \"put a very heavy play on Virginia,\" adding, \"I think we're gonna win the state of Virginia.\"\n\nTrump's other big Virginia endorsement, of retired Navy Capt. Hung Cao's bid to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine, shows the former president's strength among Virginia Republicans, Hollins' Lynch said. Cao won a five-way race with 62% of votes cast.\n\n\"That race could have gone right down to the wire had Trump stayed out of it,\" Lynch said.\n\n\"I still rate the commonwealth as safe for the Democrats in the Senate, but not solid,\" Lynch said.\n\n\"Ironically, the better Trump does in Virginia, the better for Kaine. Reluctant Trump voters, who are voting for Trump simply because they can't stand Biden, will want to balance that uncomfortable vote with a much more comfortable vote for Kaine,\" he added.\n\nCao began the race last year with an advantage from name recognition in his competitive race against Democratic U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton of Virginia's 10th, which he lost by 6.5 percentage points.\n\nTrump's endorsement \"may have bumped him from being just a favorite to a landslide winner,\" Larry Sabato, president of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said in an analysis.\n\nThe former president \"probably knew he had a winning choice,\" said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. \"He likes to run up the number of Trump-endorsed candidates who won in order to show he had control of the party apparatus across the country.\"\n\nTrump's presence was felt in the Democratic primary in Northern Virginia's 7th District, where Eugene Vindman won a 49% plurality in a seven-way race that featured four current or former officeholders in the district.\n\nIt was Vindman's first political race, but he benefited from national name recognition because of the role that he and his twin brother, Alexander, played in the first impeachment of Trump.\n\nHe ran on a message of protecting democracy that invoked Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe winner of the GOP primary, Derrick Anderson, told supporters, \"Eugene Vindman is only running for revenge -- revenge against Donald Trump and revenge against Republicans.\"\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger won the swing district two years ago after a new political map moved it from the Richmond suburbs to Northern Virginia and Fredericksburg. Spanberger, who lives in Henrico County, is running for governor next year instead of a fourth term in Congress.\n\nIn his victory statement, Vindman tried to link Anderson to Trump's Make America Great Again supporters, \"who wants nothing more than to play politics with our classrooms and let politicians ban books on the holocaust and slavery and throw them into the fire.\"\n\n\"Running as a MAGA Republican would put him [Anderson] at odds with the vast majority of voters in the district,\" he said. \"You don't go from Spanberger to MAGA candidate in one election cycle.\"\n\nA political endorsement may have been decisive in Sen. Suhas Subramanyam's victory in a 12-person race in the 10th District Democratic primary, but it wasn't Trump's. Wexton, who is stepping down because of a serious medical condition, endorsed Subramanyam as her preferred successor, emphasizing his roots in Loudoun County, with more than half of the registered voters in the district.\n\nWhile other congressional races have been largely national in message, Rozell said Subramanyam's ties to Loudoun and emphasis on local issues gave him an advantage over Democratic Del. Dan Helmer of Fairfax, who had raised the most money in the race but lived just outside of the district.\n\n\"He had a geographical challenge,\" Rozell said.\n\nSubramanyam won the race with a 30% plurality and a margin of less than 1,500 votes over Helmer.", "source": {"uri": "dailyprogress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Progress"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Bob Good or his challenger state Sen. John McGuire of Goochland.\n\nLast month, Trump left no doubt, siding with McGuire. On Wednesday, McGuire held a small lead -- about 300 votes -- with all precincts reporting and possibly heading toward a recount.\n\nIt's rare to see a large segment of a party turn against its own incumbent, but Good invited it. A polarizing figure in the U.S. House and to many in the GOP as leader of a small clique of fringe-right Republicans known as the Freedom Caucus, Good made two very powerful and unforgiving enemies in the past year.\n\nLast fall, he led the charge to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy for compromising with House Democrats on a stopgap spending bill that averted a government shutdown. Good and the Freedom Caucus banded with Democrats to oust McCarthy. That prompted a pro-McCarthy group, the Defending Main Street super PAC, to align with McGuire, a hard-right conservative who won a four-year state Senate seat only seven months ago.\n\nThen Good angered Trump by initially backing his bitter primary rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. After DeSantis folded his campaign, Good endorsed Trump and even appeared with other Republicans in a New York City courtroom recently to show GOP unity for Trump during his trial for falsifying business records to conceal hush money paid during his 2016 campaign to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nElections\n\nTrump calls in for McGuire on eve of 5th District primary\n\nDAVE RESS Richmond Times-Dispatch\n\nWhen Trump endorsed McGuire three weeks ago, it turbocharged an already spiteful primary where an unheard-of $12 million was spent by the May 29 campaign finance reporting deadline. Independent expenditures from outside groups accounted for just over $10 million, according to OpenSecrets.org.\n\nNo group spent more than the American Patriots PAC. Through May, it had spent more than $2.7 million attacking Good and about $1.7 million in support of McGuire. Since then, it has increased its saturation of broadcast and online advertising in which Trump praises McGuire, a former Navy SEAL, as a hero and condemns Good as \"bad for Virginia\" and a traitor who \"turned his back on our incredible movement.\" Other outside groups backing McGuire and opposing Good included Virginians for Freedom.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nGood wasn't without super PAC allies. They included Conservative Outsider, which spent $2.8 million backing Good; Protect Freedom PAC allied with Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky; and House Freedom Action.\n\nIn defending his seat, Good went for broke, bizarrely branding McGuire a \"liberal,\" alleging that he is permissive toward unchecked immigration along the border with Mexico. In 2023, the most recent year for which grades are available, the American Conservative Union gave McGuire a 91% conservative voting score, putting him in a five-way tie for the third-most conservative voting record in the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nElections\n\nRepublicans pick Anderson to run for Spanberger's congressional seat\n\nRICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH STAFF\n\nIn the neighboring 7th Congressional District, which takes in a swath of the Washington, D.C., suburbs and exurbs, Trump cast a different sort of shadow in the Democratic primary, and a notable Trump foe was its beneficiary.\n\nRetired Army Lt. Col. Yevgeny \"Eugene\" Vindman won his nomination in a rout Tuesday over a field of six other Democrats that included local and state elected officeholders.\n\nVindman and his twin brother, Alex, both officers with the National Security Council at the time, listened to a 2019 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and told their superiors that Trump tried to persuade Zelenskyy to investigate his 2020 reelection rival, Joe Biden, and Biden's son, Hunter.\n\nHe embraced that record in his first bid for elective office, seeking to succeed incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor next year.\n\nVindman's name and his story allowed him to build a national fundraising juggernaut that took in just over $5 million -- roughly four-fifths of the $6.3 million raised by all seven Democratic primary candidates combined through May 29.\n\nWinning the 5th District primary is tantamount to winning the seat in the strongly conservative area. Good was reelected in 2022 by a margin of nearly 16 percentage points. The last time a Democrat won the seat was 2008.\n\nThe 7th, however, is Virginia's most competitive U.S. House district and will be among the most closely followed nationally this fall as Republicans fight desperately to hold their tenuous majority and Democrats battle just as desperately to take it.\n\nThe lesson from this week's primary will extend to November: Trump's name will only be on the presidential ballot, but he will influence races up and down the ballot.", "source": {"uri": "dailyprogress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Progress"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_J._Rozell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark J.

(AP) -- One of America's most conservative congressmen was locked in a tight renomination battle against an opponent endorsed by former President Donald Trump in Virginia's primary election Tuesday\n\nRep. Bob Good, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, is seeking a third term representing Virginia's 5th Congressional District, but state Sen. John McGuire has mounted a strong challenge that highlights frictions in the party.\n\nMeanwhile, in House District 10, voters chose Suhas Subramanyam from a field of 12 Democrats to try to hold the seat held by U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, who is not seeking reelection to her northern Virginia seat after being diagnosed with a rare, incurable neurological illness.\n\nIn House District 7, voters chose Eugene Vindman in a crowded Democratic primary to try to hold the seat being vacated by U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a popular incumbent who is running for governor in 2025.\n\nStatewide, voters selected Hung Cao as the Republican nominee to the U.S. Senate to take on Democrat Tim Kaine.\n\nHere's a look at the major battles on the ballot:\n\nHouse District 5\n\nConventional politics might suggest a congressman with the conservative credentials of Good would be safe in a primary. But he earned the wrath of Trump when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president. He switched back to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but Trump is endorsing McGuire and portraying Good as a backstabber.\n\nTrump continued to bash Good as he campaigned for McGuire in a telephone rally Monday night.\n\n\"Unlike Bob Good, John McGuire will not let you down,\" Trump said, adding that McGuire is \"strong on the border\" and \"will always defend your under-siege Second Amendment.\"\n\nGood, for his part, says he considers Trump the best president in his lifetime and only endorsed DeSantis because Trump is constitutionally limited to only one more term.\n\nGood also alienated Republican insiders by voting to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, throwing the party into a measure of chaos.\n\nSeeking to capitalize is McGuire, a state legislator and former Navy SEAL who has echoed Trump's attacks on Good, calling him a \"never Trumper.\"\n\nGood has bashed McGuire as a serial campaigner who announced his congressional bid just one week after winning election to a four-year term in the state Senate.\n\nIf Good loses, he would be the first House incumbent to go down to a primary challenge this year, with the exception of one race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\nThe winner will face Democrat Gloria Tinsley Witt, who defeated Gary Terry and Paul Riley.\n\nThe 5th Congressional District stretches from Charlottesville in the north, past the far western suburbs of Richmond, through Lynchburg and down to Danville and the North Carolina border.\n\nHouse District 7\n\nVindman, a political newcomer who was nonetheless familiar to voters for his role in Trump's first impeachment, has won the Democratic nomination in the 7th Congressional District for what will be a closely watched congressional seat in November.\n\nVindman, who crushed his opponents in fundraising, won in a crowded seven-person field that included four women of color who were all current or former officeholders in Prince William County, a suburban area outside the nation's capital that constitutes the largest portion of the district.\n\nThe former Army officer gained a measure of fame when he and his twin brother, Alex, reported their concerns about Trump's 2019 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which Trump sought an investigation of Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nVindman highlighted his opposition to Trump in his campaign and in a victory statement issued Tuesday evening said \"our grass-roots movement is coming for the extreme MAGA agenda. Virginia voters are first and foremost values driven, and want to elect leaders with integrity who preserve fundamental rights and freedoms and not extremists.\"\n\nHe faced criticism from some local officials who said he was unconnected to the region's political dynamics.\n\nIn a battle between a former Army Green Beret and a former Navy SEAL, Republican voters chose the Army man, Derrick Anderson, over Navy veteran Cameron Hamilton.\n\nAnderson and Hamilton were the top two fundraisers in a six-person field. Anderson drew support from House GOP leadership in Washington, while Hamilton had support from members of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe district, which stretches from Prince William County south to Fredericksburg and west past Culpeper, tilts just slightly toward Democrats.\n\nHouse District 10\n\nSubramanyam defeated fellow Democratic candidates former Virginia House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, state Sens. Dan Helmer and Jennifer Boysko, and former Virginia Education Secretary Atif Qarni. Wexton endorsed Subramanyam.\n\nRepublican voters chose Mike Clancy from a field of four candidates.\n\nHouse District 2\n\nIn Virginia's coastal 2nd Congressional District, Missy Cotter Smasal, a Navy veteran who runs a nonprofit that honors fallen servicewomen, defeated Jeremiah \"Jake\" Denton IV, a constitutional law and civil rights attorney, in the Democratic primary.\n\nShe'll face Republican U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans in November.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday evening, Smasal took aim at Kiggans and \"the MAGA extremism she supports in Congress.\"\n\n\"I will protect abortion rights and access for all and fight for resources for veterans and military families,\" Smasal said. \"I will always defend democracy and reject party extremism.\"\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nIn the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, Navy veteran Cao prevailed over his four opponents for a chance to try to unseat Kaine, a Democrat who is seeking his third term as the state's junior U.S. senator.\n\nCao had the most money and previous campaign experience running for higher officer among the Republican primary contenders. He also had Trump's endorsement.\n\nIn a victory post on Facebook, Cao immediately criticized President Joe Biden's decision on Tuesday to allow certain U.S. citizens' spouses without legal status to apply eventually for citizenship.\n\n\"Tomorrow, we begin our campaign to save the country that saved my life,\" Cao stated. \"I spent twenty-five years in the Navy, while Tim Kaine spent thirty years in elected office.\"\n\nCao defeated Scott Parkinson, a former congressional staffer for DeSantis, as well as Jonathan Emord, an author and lawyer who often cites his court battles against the Food and Drug Administration. The other Republican candidates were Eddie Garcia, a U.S. Army veteran who owns a mobile app that serves veterans, and Chuck Smith, a former Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps commander and an attorney.\n\nFinley contributed to this report from Norfolk.", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@ktbs.com", "name": "Associated

But the race has turned out far closer than expected, with the two candidates separated by a fraction of a point in their fight for the 5th Congressional District seat.\n\nWith more than 90 percent of votes reported at the time of publication, Good was trailing McGuire by roughly 500 votes, according to Decision Desk HQ.\n\nGood drew Trump's fury when he backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in the Republican presidential primary, and though the conservative lawmaker quickly moved to endorse Trump after DeSantis exited, the former president has argued the support came too late.\n\nGood also got on McCarthy's bad side when he joined seven other Republicans and all Democrats in the historic vote to remove the California lawmaker from his House leadership role last year. McCarthy's Majority Committee PAC has contributed to McGuire.\n\nThe closely-watched race could end House incumbents' winning streak so far this cycle, with the exception of a rare incumbent-on-incumbent race in Alabama, which was prompted by redistricting.\n\nOver in Oklahoma, incumbent Rep. Tom Cole (R) fought off several primary challengers on Tuesday night to win the GOP nomination for his House seat in the Sooner State's 4th Congressional District.\n\nShould McGuire ultimately prevail, the race would be the first big win for McCarthy as he targets the Republicans who voted to oust him. His revenge tour got off to a rough start last week when South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace (R) easily won her primary against a challenger supported by McCarthy's PAC.\n\nRep.

Byron Donalds (R-Fla.).\n\n\"Right now, we're still waiting on the final election results of today's Primary,\" Good said in a post on X around 11 p.m. Eastern, thanking his supporters.\n\nHe noted

Bob Good, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, trailed primary challenger state Sen. John McGuire by 327 votes as of 12 a.m. Wednesday morning, according to unofficial returns in the GOP nomination race in the reliably red southern Virginia district.\n\nVirginia observes the Juneteenth holiday, and a resumption of the vote tabulation for the remaining uncounted ballots in the race may not take place until Thursday.

Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now.\"\n\nGood incurred Trump's wrath for being one of just a handful of House Republicans to endorse Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential primaries.\n\nEven though Good avoided criticizing Trump and quickly endorsed the former president after DeSantis ended his White House bid in January, Trump wrote on this Truth Social platform that \"the damage has been done!\"\n\nThe former president last month endorsed McGuire, who also had the backing of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a conservative firebrand and major Trump ally who is a vocal critic of Good who last year broke with the House Freedom Caucus. The group is considered the most far-right organization of lawmakers in the chamber.\n\nMcCarthy also targeted Good, who was one of eight Republicans last autumn who joined with Democrats to vote to oust McCarthy from his leadership position.\n\nGood had the support of Reps. Matt Gaetz and Byron Donalds of Florida, two conservatives who are also strong backers of Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFellow House Freedom Caucus members, Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Andy Biggs of Arizona, joined Good in Virginia for a rally on Friday.\n\nEven though he was targeted by Trump, Good spotlighted his support for the former president as he ran for re-election.\n\n\"Happy Birthday to the best and next president of the United States, President Trump!\" Good wrote on social media on Friday, which was the former president's 78th birthday.\n\nGood also showed up earlier this spring at Trump's criminal trial in New York City to show his support for the former president.", "source": {"uri": "foxwilmington.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

John McGuire are seeing the race as a victory, even as it remains too close to call.\n\nWith bitter anger about Good's vote to yank away former Speaker Kevin McCarthy's (R-Calif.) gavel in large part fueling the opposition to him, those who worked against Good say the race should serve as a warning against the kind of tactics, style and demeanor that contributed to discord in the House.\n\n\"He represented, for many of us, what was wrong with this Congress, the dysfunction. And he was sort of part of the soul of it -- the seed of all this dysfunction,\" said Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who endorsed McGuire.\n\n\"Is it conservative to shut down government? I don't think it is,\" Bacon said. \"What does conservative mean? I think the way he went about it by trying to dethrone, you know, McCarthy -- he did -- and all the other shenanigans this year, I don't think that's conservative.\"\n\nTo be sure, former President Trump's endorsement of McGuire after Good initially endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential primary played a key role in the outcome. But Good's detractors in the House point to the support -- and money -- McGuire got that stemmed from anger about McCarthy and Good's political choices as having played a large part in the race.\n\nStill, the race is not final.\n\nMcGuire led Good by 307 votes -- or 0.4 percent -- as of Wednesday afternoon, according to Decision Desk HQ, which reported 95 percent of the vote in. The election is at a standstill for now: Votes are not expected to be tallied Wednesday, Juneteenth, which Virginia observes, according to The Associated Press.\n\nEven so, the race is likely headed for a recount: In the Old Dominion, candidates can request a recount if the margin is less than 1 percent.\n\nGood, for his part, is keeping the faith, calling the race \"too close to call,\" warning that counting can stretch on for weeks, and expressing a strong sense of optimism that the tally could flip in his direction.\n\n\"We believe we can still prevail,\" he wrote on social platform X.\n\nMcGuire, however, sees the race differently. The former Navy SEAL declared victory Tuesday night, telling the crowd at his victory party, \"It is an honor to be your Republican nominee.\"\n\n\"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory,\" he echoed in a post on X early Wednesday morning.\n\nA number of McGuire's supporters followed with celebrations for McGuire on social media, including Bacon and Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.). Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who also supported McCarthy and was removed from the Freedom Caucus last year after clashes with members, called Good \"toxic\" as she congratulated McGuire in a post on X.\n\n\"I hope he's right,\" Bacon said of McGuire's victory lap coming before the race was called. \"Talking to other people in Virginia right now, they're pretty confident.\"\n\nSarah Chamberlain, the president and CEO of the Republican Main Street Partnership, said she hopes that the uprising against Good gives other members pause before using the kind of tactics that he used. Defending Main Street, her group's affiliated super PAC, spent $452,000 on ads supporting McGuire.\n\n\"He votes against Republican bills. He also votes Republican rules, so we don't even get the bills to the floor,\" Chamberlain said of Good, referring to procedural votes that are normally party-line measures but that Good and other Republicans have used to protest bills.\n\n\"It wasn't as much about Kevin McCarthy as it was like, listen, can't have Republican members voting with the Democrats to take down Republican initiatives,\" Chamberlain said.\n\nGood is only the second incumbent Republican that Defending Main Street has campaigned against in a primary, with former Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) being the first in 2020.\n\nGood's endorsements of challengers to other incumbent Republicans earlier in the year also inspired support for McGuire. Bacon endorsed McGuire in large part because Good backed his more hard-line conservative challenger who fell short of unseating the incumbent by 24 percentage points.\n\n\"This is a little bit about ideology, I think, but more of it was how Bob Good treated people. He was sort of just obnoxiously rude,\" Bacon said.\n\nMcGuire is not the Republican who would usually be lumped in with moderates like Bacon. He attended the \"Stop the Steal\" rally at the Capitol on Jan. 6 -- but did not go into the Capitol -- and has defended doing so, saying Tuesday on CNN that \"Trump was robbed.\"\n\nBut if GOP members who supported the Virginia state senator hope that it will change how hard-line conservatives in the conference act, they will have to hope that their colleagues discount other major takeaways from the race.\n\nGood supporters could argue that the results in the race -- albeit still pending -- reflect a strong showing and outperformance of expectations in the face of so much opposition.\n\nA June 2-4 poll commissioned by the conservative Virginia Faith and Freedom Coalition found McGuire with a 10-point lead over Good -- a far cry from the half-percentage point that separates them in the current vote tally. Twenty-nine percent of poll respondents were undecided.\n\nGood was also out-spent on the airwaves; the ad tracking firm AdImpact found $9 million was spent on ads in support of McGuire or opposed to the incumbent, compared to $5.6 million worth that was supportive of Good or opposed to McGuire.\n\nPerhaps most important is the influence of Trump.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), another one of the eight Republicans who had moved to oust McCarthy, said that McGuire's strong showing, and potential victory, was due to Trump's backing more than anything else.\n\n\"It 100% has to do with Trump,\" Burchett said. \"The President is very, very strong, especially in the grassroots. That carries a lot of weight.\"\n\nRep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), another Republican who voted to oust McCarthy, prevailed in her primary last week despite McCarthy and his allies supporting her opponent in the first stop on his \"revenge\" primary tour against those who voted to remove him. Mace had the support, importantly, of Trump.\n\nBurchett is not facing a primary challenger this year, though he said that did not stop his antagonists from trying to find one.\n\nStill, Burchett said that the support for Good from those who did not like his tactics and style are not dissuading him from voting how he wants to.\n\n\"I knew it could possibly cost me my job,\" Burchett said of his vote to remove McCarthy, \"but I still think it was the right decision to make at the time.\"", "source": {"uri": "wtaj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTAJ - www.wtaj.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

John McGuire (R) appears to be leading Virginia's 5th Congressional District race against Rep. Bob Good (R-VA), although the race remains too close to call.\n\nHours after the polls have closed, Good and McGuire remain in a close race, with McGuire receiving 31,411 votes, or 50.3 percent of the vote. Good was reported to have received 31,084 votes, or 49.7 percent, according to the Associated Press (AP).\n\nWhile the race is still too close to call officially, McGuire declared victory on Tuesday evening just before midnight saying he is confident that the remaining votes will break his way.\n\n\"My life is a testament to the fact that America is the greatest country on this planet and I'm so honored to have the chance to serve her again,\" McGuire said in a statement. \"Thank you to my family, thank you to everyone who helped out on this campaign, thank you to the people who endorsed and supported me, and thank you to Donald J. Trump for believing in me. There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory.\"\n\nMcGuire added that \"folks in the 5th District can rest assured that they should\" elect him in the upcoming November election.\n\n\"They will have an effective fighter in Congress who will get the job done for them,\" McGuire added. \"I look forward to working with Trump to beat Joe Biden in November and pass Trump's agenda in Congress. Trump and McGuire will Make America Great Again!\"\n\nFelicity Taylor, a reporter with CBS19 News wrote in a post on X that McGuire was set to address a crowd of people, while Good had reportedly left his election party without addressing members of the media.\n\nGood wrote in a post on X that as they awaited \"the final results of today's primary,\" he \"wanted to thank\" the voters for their support.\n\n\"You made sure your vote was cast,\" Good wrote. \"many of you gave up your precious time to make phone calls and knock on doors. Several of you had tough conversations to ensure people knew the truth about this race. You encouraged your family, friends, and church members to get out and vote. And some of you worked the polls for hours to hand out literature.\"\n\nGood added that \"most\" of his campaign had been \"made up of small donations given by thousands,\" who believed in him and his campaign.\n\nDave Wasserman reported that \"it's fair to say McGuire (R), who leads Good (R) by 327 votes with 1,532 early votes left to count in Bedford and Fluvanna\" counties, could be a \"slight favorite.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump issued an endorsement of McGuire on May 28 in which he slammed Good as being \"BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA.\"\n\nTrump stated that Good \"turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting\" with the former president until he gave Trump a \"warm and 'loving' Endorsement.\"\n\n\"But really, it was too late,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"The damage had been done!\"\n\nGood initially supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in his bid for the Republican nomination for president, even after Trump had endorsed Good in his primary race last year.\n\n\"I'm not against President Trump - I like what President Trump did,\" Good explained to reporters in January. \"I just think we need eight years and so that's why I endorsed Gov. DeSantis.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_weibel@breitbart.com", "name": "Elizabeth Weibel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia's_5th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virginia's 5th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Good", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGuire_(Virginia_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McGuire (Virginia politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bedford, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bedford, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/06/virginia-5th-John-McGuire-June-15-2024-file-getty.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661234", "eventUri": "eng-9661234", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 2578, "textEnd": 2584}], "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

John McGuire's bid to unseat Rep. Bob Good, R-5th.\n\nAs of press time, McGuire was up by fewer than 300 votes and the contest was too close for the Associated Press to make a call. The bitter rivals had traded the lead back and forth in a contest that had largely revolved around loyalty to the former president.\n\nIn Tuesday's low-turnout voting, Virginians picked Democratic and Republican candidates in six of the state's 11 U.S. House districts.\n\nIn some, like the sprawling 5th District, which stretches southwest from Goochland, Louisa, Powhatan and parts of Hanover to the North Carolina line around Danville, the primary winner is odds-on favorite to win the November general election.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In the 3rd District, anchored in Newport News, Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd, faces only two independents in November.\n\nBut it was the 5th district that attracted the most outside interest, after Trump endorsed McGuire.\n\n\"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back sort of like he did with me,\" Trump told a tele-rally for McGuire on the eve of the primary.\n\nGood had endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for the GOP presidential nomination in April 2023, but then backed Trump after DeSantis dropped out of the race in January of this year.\n\nThe race for the GOP nomination was a highly personalized contest between two conservatives - one, Good, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, who voted not to certify President Joe Biden's election and the other, McGuire, attended Trump's Jan. 6, 2021, \"Stop the Steal\" rally the day before the certification vote, but says he did not enter the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMcGuire, a former Navy SEAL, is a three-term member of the House of Delegates who declared his candidacy for Good's congressional seat less than two weeks after his election to the state Senate last year.\n\nGood had trailed McGuire in the early evening tally, and more than 100 of his supporters who'd gathered for his election party at La-Villa, an Italian restaurant in Lynchburg, were tense. Members of the crowd stared at their phones, examining election results and refreshing the page over and over again in hopes their candidate would rally.\n\nJust before 9:30 p.m. their wish came true at least for the moment, as results showed Good had cut into the lead and made it a one-point race. It was the first time in the evening that the crowd had cheered, their hopes of Good returning to office\n\nGood had spent most of the night sitting with family, with supporters walking past to offer him words of encouragement. The congressman looked tense, occasionally resting his chin on his left hand, as servers walked through the crowd bringing pizza to customers.\n\nGood campaign manager Diana Shores said she had expected a tight race.\n\n\"But it's still so nerve-racking,\" Shores said.\n\nBesides Trump's endorsement, McGuire campaigned with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, while Good has won backing from conservatives including Rep, Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, Sen Rand Paul, R-Kentucky and Steve Bannon.\n\nTwo dozen members of the 5th District Republican Congressional Committee sent a letter to Trump in which they praised Good, attacked McGuire and called the endorsement \"ill-advised.\"\n\nGood has called McGuire a \"perpetual candidate\" and argues that he's more conservative because McGuire has won support from allies of the former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Good was one of eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy last year.\n\nMcGuire raised more than $1.2 million while Good collected more than $1.1 million, according to the latest financial reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission.\n\nBut the outside spending dwarfed these sums.\n\nSix political action committees have spent $5 million to attack Good or promote McGuire, led by the American Patriots PAC.\n\nNine outside PACs have spent more than $3.4 million to attack McGuire or promote Good, led by the Conservative Outsider and Protect Freedom, a super PAC associated with Paul.\n\n5th District Democrats\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, selected Gloria Tinsley Witt, of Amherst, founder of a leadership coaching firm, who prevailed in a three-way contest.\n\nThe district has not elected a Democrat to Congress since 2008, when Tom Perriello edged Rep. Virgil Goode, R-5th by 727 votes, though its 24 cities and counties include strongly Democratic Charlottesville.\n\n1st District Democrats\n\nIn another district touching Richmond's suburbs, the 1st, Leslie C. Mehta defeated Herb Jones, winning 12,393, or 68% of votes cast to 5,883 or 32%, with 93% of precincts reporting unofficial results. She will take on Rep. Rob Wittman, R-1st, who has represented the district since 2007.\n\nA political newcomer, Mehta, the former legal director of the ACLU of Virginia, beat the former New Kent County treasurer, Jones, who tried but failed to unseat Wittman in 2022.\n\n\"I am proud to accept the nomination... and excited to head on to November because our communities deserve better,\" Mehta said in a tweet on X (formerly known as Twitter).\n\nWittman won in 2022 with 57% of the vote. The district voted 58% to 42%, for Republican Glenn Youngkin in the 2021 contest for governor.\n\nJones was backed by former Gov. Ralph Northam, while Mehta was supported by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-7th, as well as by a deep-pocketed Democratic couple, Charlottesville billionaire hedge fund executive Michael Bills and his wife, Sonija Smith.\n\nThis district stretches from parts of Hanover, Henrico and Chesterfield counties to Williamsburg and the Northern Neck.\n\n2nd District Democrats\n\nIn the Virginia Beach-anchored 2nd District Navy veteran and nonprofit executive Missy Cotter Smasal defeated attorney Jake Denton winning 17,239 votes, or 70% for the Democratic Party nomination to challenge Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-2nd, who is seeking a second term.\n\n\"Thank you to all the voters, volunteers, and donors who have put their faith in me. I'll always have your back,\" Smasal said in a social media post.\n\nRedistricting in 2021 left this district, which includes the Eastern Shore, Suffolk and rural western Tidewater communities in Isle of Wight and Southampton counties more Republican, though national Democrats have targeted Kiggans seeing a possible pick up here.\n\n7th District\n\nIn Northern Virginia's 7th District, an open seat after Democrat Abigail Spanberger decided not to seek another term in order to run for governor next year, Eugene Vindman captured the Democratic nomination. He bested six other Democrats, with 16,170 votes of 49% with 99% of precincts reporting unofficial results.\n\nDerrick Anderson a former U.S. Army Green Beret who lost a GOP primary for a Prince William County board seat in 2022, won the GOP nomination. He prevailed in a six-way GOP race with 15,870 votes, or 46% of votes cast.\n\nVindman, who with his twin brother Alexander played a role in Trump's first impeachment, defeated a state legislator, Del. Briana Sewell, D-Prince William and former Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William as well as Prince Willian supervisors Margaret Angela Franklin and Andrea O. Bailey.\n\n\"The stakes of this election couldn't be higher, the passion behind my campaign comes from voters wanting integrity, moderation, and professionalism in a government that works for them; and our grass-roots movement is coming for the extreme MAGA agenda,\" Vindman said in a statement.\n\nThe district is based in Prince William, Stafford and Spotsylvania counties.\n\n10th District\n\nIn Northern Virginia's 10th District, 12 Democrats and four Republicans sought their parties' nominations for the seat of Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-10th, who is retiring for health reasons.\n\nState Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudon, won with 12,859, or 30% of votes cast, with 96% of precincts reporting unofficial results.\n\nSubramanyam, who won Wexton's endorsement, defeated several other current and former Democratic legislators, including state Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, Del. David Reid, D-Loudoun, Del, Michelle Lopes Maldonado, D-Prince William, and former Speaker of the House Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Prince William.\n\nSubramanyam said in a statement: \"This district is my home. I got married here. My kids were born here. The issues our community faces are personal to our family.\" He added: This district will remain blue.\"\n\nRepublican Mike Clancy, a lawyer and conservative commentator, won the Republican nomination with 64% of votes cast.\n\nThe district is based in Loudoun and Prince William counties.\n\n11th District\n\nIn Fairfax County's 11th Congressional district, longtime Rep Gerry Connolly fended off a challenge from attorney Ahsan Nasar in the Democratic primary. Connolly had 34,922 votes, or 86% of votes cast, to 5,757 or 14% for Nasar, with 94% of precincts reporting.\n\nPHOTOS: Trump rally in Richmond\n\nDave Ress (804) 649-6948\n\ndress@timesdispatch.com\n\nTimes-Dispatch reporter Michael Martz and Jason Armesto of the Daily Progress contributed to this report.\n\nDave Ress\n\nGrowth and Development Reporter\n\nAuthor twitter Author email Follow Dave Ress Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Bob Good, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, trailed primary challenger state Sen. John McGuire by 327 votes as of 12 a.m. Wednesday morning, according to unofficial returns in the GOP nomination race in the reliably red southern Virginia district.\n\nVirginia observes the Juneteenth holiday, and a resumption of the vote tabulation for the remaining uncounted ballots in the race may not take place until Thursday. The current margin in the election is less than one percent and if it remains under that level, the race would qualify for a recount according to Virginia law.\n\nFOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN, TRUMP IN A DEAD HEAT IN VIRGINIA\n\nGood, who is running for a third term in Congress, aims to avert becoming the first House incumbent this election cycle to be ousted by a primary challenger, in a contentious intra-party primary battle that pitted conservatives versus conservatives and Trump against some of his biggest allies in the House of Representatives.\n\n\"We need leaders that know how to put petty differences aside and bring people together for a better future,\" McGuire, a former Navy SEAL, told supporters on Tuesday night. \"And that's what I'm all about.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS PRIMARY RESULTS\n\nHis comments came as he prematurely declared victory in a speech at his election party in Lynchburg, Virginia.\n\nGood did not give a speech at his primary night gathering, which was also held in Lynchburg, but in a social media post he noted that \"we're still waiting on the final election results.\"\n\nIn a race where a whopping $14 million was spent - with much of it targeting the incumbent - Good wrote that \"no matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right. Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now.\"\n\nGood incurred Trump's wrath for being one of just a handful of House Republicans to endorse Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential primaries.\n\nEven though Good avoided criticizing Trump and quickly endorsed the former president after DeSantis ended his White House bid in January, Trump wrote on this Truth Social platform that \"the damage has been done!\"\n\nThe former president last month endorsed McGuire, who also had the backing of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a conservative firebrand and major Trump ally who is a vocal critic of Good who last year broke with the House Freedom Caucus. The group is considered the most far-right organization of lawmakers in the chamber.\n\nMcCarthy also targeted Good, who was one of eight Republicans last autumn who joined with Democrats to vote to oust McCarthy from his leadership position.\n\nGood had the support of Reps. Matt Gaetz and Byron Donalds of Florida, two conservatives who are also strong backers of Trump.\n\nFellow House Freedom Caucus members, Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Andy Biggs of Arizona, joined Good in Virginia for a rally on Friday.\n\nEven though he was targeted by Trump, Good spotlighted his support for the former president as he ran for re-election.\n\n\"Happy Birthday to the best and next president of the United States, President Trump!\" Good wrote on social media on Friday, which was the former president's 78th birthday.\n\nGood also showed up earlier this spring at Trump's criminal trial in New York City to show his support for the former president.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews

Former President Donald Trump-backed candidate John McGuire is battling incumbent Robert Good.\n\nThe Context\n\nGood, chairman of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, previously endorsed Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for the 2024 presidential Republican nomination. Good then threw his support behind Trump after DeSantis dropped out.\n\nTrump, while acknowledging Good's \"warm\" endorsement, posted to his social media platform Truth Social on Monday, saying in part, \"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA! He turned his back on our incredible Movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and \"loving\" Endorsement - But really, it was too late! The damage had been done.\"\n\nThe former president instead offered his \"complete and total endorsement\" for McGuire, a Virginia state senator and former Navy SEAL who backed the pro-Trump \"Stop the Steal\" movement following President Joe Biden's 2020 election win.\n\nWhat We Know\n\nAs of 11:27 p.m. Eastern time, McGuire was leading Good by less than 400 votes with 93 percent counted, according to the Associated Press. The lead had switched hands on more than one occasion earlier in the night.\n\nGood issued a statement on the race just before 11 p.m., thanking his supporters for showing \"the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right\" regardless of \"the outcome.\"\n\n\"Right now, we're still waiting on the final election results of today's Primary,\" Good said in the statement, which was shared to X, formerly Twitter. \"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help we were able to make this race too close to call.\"\n\nGaetz posted to X on Monday, saying, \"It has been an honor to campaign with my friend and conservative fighter \u2066@GoodForCongress VA5 please get out and vote TODAY for Bob Good!\"\n\nBoebert also shared multiple campaign posts from Good on X in the lead-up to the election. However, the MAGA split was evident as Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene threw her weight behind McGuire.\n\n\"VA-05 polls close at 7 pm, make sure you vote for the REAL Trump endorsed candidate, John McGuire!!\" Greene posted to X on Tuesday. \"NOT Trump back stabber Bob Good! Also do you want to know the truth about Bob Good and Kevin McCarthy? Sound up! Listen to the end!\"\n\nWhat's Next\n\nThe election outcome remained too close to call at the time of publication. A recount is possible if the candidates are still separated by hundreds of votes or less in the final tally.\n\nRegardless of the final margin, the close finish could indicate that Trump has less sway over Republicans than some might imagine. A poll of 300 likely voters commissioned by the Virginia Faith and Freedom Coalition and conducted earlier this month indicated that McGuire had a solid 10-point lead over Good.", "source": {"uri":

Provisional ballots are also still being counted.\n\n\"There is no way anyone can know for certain how many mail-in ballots are pending for count,\" she said.\n\nIf Good loses, he would be the first House incumbent to lose a primary challenge this year, with the exception of one race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\nAs one of the most conservative congressmen in the country, Good might be impervious to a primary challenge under normal circumstances. But he earned Trump's wrath when he endorsed the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, for president. He switched back to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but Trump endorsed McGuire and called Good a backstabber.\n\nMcGuire's lead translates to a margin of about half a percentage point out of more than 62,000 ballots cast. Once the results are certified, Virginia law allows for a recount if the margin of victory is less than a percentage point.

This race, significant for its impact on the heavily Republican district in Virginia, reflects broader GOP tensions and power struggles, especially after Good's controversial decisions against former President Trump and moderate Republicans.\n\nU.S. Representative Bob Good, the leader of a bloc of hardline House Republicans, faces off on Tuesday against a primary challenger backed by both Donald Trump and a key group of moderate Republicans. The winner of the contest between the House Freedom Caucus chair and former Navy SEAL John McGuire is expected to easily carry the strongly Republican-leaning southern Virginia district in the Nov. 5 election, when control of the White House and both chambers of Congress will be up for grabs.\n\nGood angered former President Trump by endorsing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in his Republican presidential primary campaign against Trump, switching his endorsement to Trump only after DeSantis dropped out. Good also ignited the ire of moderate Republicans after he voted to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy from his role in October, launching weeks of chaos and bitter, highly public infighting as Republicans attempted to coalesce around a replacement.\n\nTrump endorsed Good's challenger McGuire, a Virginia state senator, in a May social media post.

The districts could also play an important role in Democrats' efforts to win back a House majority in November.\n\nIn Virginia's 7th district, Eugene Vindman, the brother of Alexander Vindman, who played an important role in Trump's first impeachment, was projected by the Associated Press to win the Democratic nomination for Spanberger's seat, which she is leaving to run for governor. Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret, and Cameron Hamilton, a former NAVY Seal, are jostling for the Republican nomination in the competitive district where many military families live.\n\nIn Virginia's 10th district, Democratic candidates seeking to succeed the retiring Wexton include state Representative Dan Helmer, state Senator Suhas Subramanyam and Eileen Filler-Corn, former speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates. The winner of Tuesday's primary is strongly favored to win the heavily Democratic district in November.

Before becoming a state Senator in 2023, he served on Virginia's House of Delegates.\n\nDespite a still-undecided election, McGuire's posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday suggested he expects victory.\n\n\"Thank you to my family, thank you to everyone who helped out on this campaign, thank you to the people who endorsed and supported me, and thank you to Donald J. Trump for believing in me. There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory,\" he wrote. \"\n\nFor his part, Good said that they are still waiting on the results of mail-in and provisional ballots.\n\n\"Right now, we're still waiting on the final election results of today's Primary,\" he posted on social media. \"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help, we were able to make this race too close to call.\"\n\nVirginia's 5th Congressional District is a Republican stronghold that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. It would seem a safe place for a conservative congressman like Good to be re-elected.\n\nBut Good earned Trump's wrath after initially endorsing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for president. After DeSantis dropped out, he switched to supporting Trump, but the former president endorsed Good's opponent instead.\n\n\"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA. He turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"John McGuire has my Complete and Total Endorsement!\"\n\nLater, Trump's attorneys sent Good a cease-and-desist letter for using the presumptive Republican nominee's name and likeness on campaign materials.\n\nOnce the votes are finally tallied, Virginia law allows for a recount if the margin of victory is less than a percentage point. If the ballot count is within half a percentage point, the recount can be conducted at the state's expense, according to the Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Good", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGuire_(Virginia_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McGuire (Virginia politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_House_of_Delegates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia House of Delegates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia's_5th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia's 5th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Morality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Morality", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pOW.s33lZn4mtqk7kwPqZA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xMjAwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_news_641/7b5445cdd09e7166c4a1172e44525279", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661234", "eventUri": "eng-9661234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Good Locked in Tight Race With Trump-Backed Challenger", "body": "LYNCHBURG, Va. -- Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.) is locked in a tight race with Trump-backed Virginia state Sen. John McGuire.\n\nThe race may not be called on June 18 if the results remain close and it may ultimately head to a recount. A candidate may request a recount if the difference between candidates is 1 percent or less, according to Virginia law.\n\nMr. Good, chair of the staunchly conservative House Freedom Caucus, risks being the first House incumbent to go down to a primary challenge this year, with the exception of one race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\nThe incumbent, in a late-night post on X urged supporters to \"[k]eep the faith and don't stop fighting now.\"\n\n\"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help we were able to make this race too close to call,\" Mr. Good wrote\n\nDespite the race not being called, Mr. Guire, a former Navy SEAL, declared victory at his watch party in Lynchburg at about 11:30 p.m.\n\nThe contentious primary battle has been largely defined by loyalty to former President Trump. Mr. Good had initially endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the presidential race, before flipping to the former president after the governor dropped out.\n\nFormer President Trump and Mr. McGuire have cast Mr. Good as disloyal to the presumptive Republican nominee. Former President Trump, in a Truth Social post, said that despite the House Freedom Caucus chair's subsequent endorsement, \"the damage had been done.\"\n\nWhen previously asked if he regretted endorsing Mr. DeSantis, Mr. Good said \"The time for talking about previous endorsements is over.\"\n\nHe said, following a June 7 rally on the lawn in front of a courthouse in Powhatan, Virginia, that it's time to unite behind former President Trump.\n\nIn interviews with The Epoch Times outside polling places on June 18, voters explained why they voted for either Mr. McGuire or Mr. Good.\n\nJimmy, who was wearing a Make America Great Again hat and a shirt with faces of former President Trump plastered all over, said he supported Mr. McGuire simply because \"Trump endorsed him\" even though Mr. Good \"did an alright job.\"\n\nJames said he pulled the lever for Mr. McGuire even though he did not like either candidate but in the end had to pick one. He said there needs to be a change in the U.S. government. He also cited former President Trump's endorsement of Mr. McGuire.\n\nHowever, Ray said he cast his ballot for Mr. McGuire because \"he's the better choice\" and given his experience as a Navy SEAL.\n\nDavid, on the other hand, voted for Mr. Good, he said, simply \"because he's a conservative.\"\n\nKay said she cast her ballot for Mr. Good because \"of his record,\" though she did not specify which policies she appreciates.\n\nAll interviewees declined to provide their last names.\n\nWhile Mr. Good received endorsements from a dozen or so members of the House Freedom Caucus, Mr. McGuire boasted backing from some prominent Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Ala.).\n\nOne Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), supported Mr. McGuire, calling him \"conservative and effective.\"\n\nMr. Good was one of eight Republicans to join all Democrats in ousting former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) as House Speaker in October.\n\nA super PAC affiliated with Republican Main Street Partnership, a group that supports moderate Republicans, has spent more than $450,000 to defeat the GOP incumbent, according to Open Secrets.\n\nThe seat is likely to stay in GOP hands as Mr. Good won reelection in 2022 with 57.6 percent of the vote.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com",

Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now.\"\n\nGood incurred Trump's wrath for being one of just a handful of House Republicans to endorse Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential primaries.\n\nEven though Good avoided criticizing Trump and quickly endorsed the former president after DeSantis ended his White House bid in January, Trump wrote on this Truth Social platform that \"the damage has been done!\"\n\nThe former president last month endorsed McGuire, who also had the backing of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a conservative firebrand and major Trump ally who is a vocal critic of Good who last year broke with the House Freedom Caucus. The group is considered the most far-right organization of lawmakers in the chamber.\n\nMcCarthy also targeted Good, who was one of eight Republicans last autumn who joined with Democrats to vote to oust McCarthy from his leadership position.\n\nGood had the support of Reps.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nA Virginia primary congressional race between a right-wing firebrand incumbent and a challenger endorsed by Donald Trump remained too close to call on Wednesday morning -- but that didn't stop the former president's candidate of choice from prematurely declaring victory.\n\nJohn McGuire, a Virginia state senator, was endorsed by Trump after Representative Bob Good, a two-term incumbent who serves as chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, came out in support of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for the Republican nomination for president. As of Wednesday morning, only 315 votes stood between Good and McGuire in Virginia's 5th congressional district.\n\nNonetheless, McGuire declared victory Tuesday evening.\n\n\"Thank you to my family, thank you to everyone who helped out on this campaign, thank you to the people who endorsed and supported me, and thank you to Donald J. Trump for believing in me,\" McGuire posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Good applauded his campaign for the close race despite a lack of support from Trump and the Republican establishment.\n\n\"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help we were able to make this race too close to call,\" he said. \"No matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right. Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now.\"\n\nGood has become an outspoken right-wing figure since he joined the House of Representatives in 2021. He vocally opposed Kevin McCarthy's bid to become speaker of the House in January of last year. When Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida filed his motion to remove McCarthy, Good joined Democrats and seven Republicans in supporting it.\n\nDuring the fight to replace replace McCarthy, Good was one of a handful of hardliners who opposed electing House Majority Leader Steve Scalise as speaker. He later threw his weight behind Mike Johnson, as did the rest of the House Republican conference.\n\nMcCarthy and a prominent political action committee ultimately poured money into an effort to oppose Good's bid. Trump endorsed McGuire despite the fact that Good traveled to New York in May to support the former president in his hush money trial. McGuire also made the trip.\n\n\"John is running against Bob Good, who is not good. Despite his name, he's very bad for Virginia,\" Trump told supporters on Monday.\n\nGood enjoyed the support of Gaetz, as well as former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and Representative Chip Roy of Texas. Meanwhile, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been kicked out of the Freedom Caucus, backed McGuire.\n\nVirginia's 5th district, which includes Charlottesville and the University of Virginia as well as nearby suburbs and rural areas. has seen frequent turnover. Indeed, Good defeated incumbent Republican Denver Riggleman in 2020 largely in response to Riggleman presiding over a same-sex wedding.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

The Freedom Caucus, which Good leads, represents House conservatives.\n\nTrump opposed Good, who had endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the Republican presidential primary March 5. In that contest, Trump easily defeated his former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, as well as DeSantis, who had dropped out.\n\nIn a June 17 post on Truth Social, his social media platform, Trump wrote: \"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA! He turned his back on our incredible Movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement - But really, it was too late!\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., whom Good voted last year to oust, also endorsed McGuire. So did the centrist Republican Mainstreet Partnership.\n\nGood had the endorsements of former Trump adviser and \"War Room\" host Steve Bannon, as well as the backing of former U.S. Rep. Dave Brat, a former Freedom Caucus member best known for ousting one-time House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a GOP primary.\n\nIn the November general election, whichever candidate wins will face Democrat candidate Gloria Tinsley Witt, a businesswoman and activist. She defeated Gary Terry and Paul Riley. The Associated Press called the race at 8:19 p.m.\n\nMcGuire, a former Navy SEAL, has been criticized for being in the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when rioters clashed with Capitol Police as a joint session of Congress met to certify Joe Biden's Electoral College victory over Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nMcGuire called Good a \"never Trumper\" during the campaign.\n\nGood has said he considered Trump the best president in his lifetime, but endorsed DeSantis because Trump is constitutionally limited to only one more four-year term, The Associated Press reported.\n\nAlso on the Virginia front, the primary results will determine who vies for open seats in the U.S. House of Representatives created by the pending retirements of two incumbent Democrats.\n\nIn 2018, Rep. Abigail Spanberger won the once Republican-leaning 7th Congressional District, defeating Brat, the incumbent Republican. Spanberger reportedly plans to run for Virginia governor in 2025.\n\nThe congressional district spans northern and central Virginia.\n\nRetired Army Col. Eugene Vindman won the Democratic primary to fill the seat being vacated by Spanberger. He is the twin brother of retired Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who became famous for his congressional testimony during the first Trump impeachment in 2019. The AP called the race at 8:06 p.m.\n\nVindman had the endorsement of Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who was censured by the House and removed from the House Intelligence Committee he once chaired for making repeated misleading statements to the public.\n\nIn the primary, Vindman took on current and former elected officials, including state Delegate Briana Sewell, Prince William County Board of Supervisors member Andrea Bailey, and former state Delegate Elizabeth Guzman.\n\nOn the Republican side former Green Beret Derrick Anderson defeated former Navy SEAL Cameron Hamilton. The AP called the race at 9 p.m.\n\nAlso, Rep. Jennifer Wexton, a Democrat, isn't seeking another term representing the 10th Congressional District in Northern Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Wexton-endorsed Virginia state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam won a 12-candidate primary among Democrats.\n\nOther contenders included former Virginia House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, state Sen. Dan Helmer, Jennifer Boysko, and former Virginia Education Secretary Atif Qarni. The AP called the race at 9:15 p.m.\n\nLawyer Mike Clancy won the Republican primary in the congressional district, which leans heavily Democrat, defeating Aliscia Andrews, who ran for the seat in 2020. The AP called the race at 7:41 p.m.", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Signal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fred_lucas@dailysignal.com", "name": "Fred Lucas",

(AP) -- One of America's most conservative congressmen was locked in a tight renomination battle against an opponent endorsed by former President Donald Trump in Virginia's primary election Tuesday.\n\nRep. Bob Good, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, is seeking a third term representing Virginia's 5th Congressional District, but state Sen. John McGuire has mounted a strong challenge that highlights frictions in the party.\n\nThe close margin made the race too early to call.\n\nMeanwhile, in House District 10, voters chose Suhas Subramanyam from a field of 12 Democrats to try to hold the seat held by U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, who is not seeking reelection to her northern Virginia seat after being diagnosed with a rare, incurable neurological illness.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Abigail Spanberger, a popular incumbent who is running for governor in 2025.\n\nStatewide, voters selected Hung Cao as the Republican nominee to the U.S. Senate to take on Democrat Tim Kaine.\n\nHere's a look at the major battles on the ballot:\n\nHouse District 5\n\nConventional politics might suggest a congressman with the conservative credentials of Good would be safe in a primary. But he earned the wrath of Trump when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president. He switched back to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but Trump is endorsing McGuire and portraying Good as a backstabber.\n\nTrump continued to bash Good as he campaigned for McGuire in a telephone rally Monday night.\n\n\"Unlike Bob Good, John McGuire will not let you down,\" Trump said, adding that McGuire is \"strong on the border\" and \"will always defend your under-siege Second Amendment.\"\n\nGood, for his part, says he considers Trump the best president in his lifetime and only endorsed DeSantis because Trump is constitutionally limited to only one more term.\n\nGood also alienated Republican insiders by voting to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, throwing the party into a measure of chaos.\n\nSeeking to capitalize is McGuire, a state legislator and former Navy SEAL who has echoed Trump's attacks on Good, calling him a \"never Trumper.\"\n\nGood has bashed McGuire as a serial campaigner who announced his congressional bid just one week after winning election to a four-year term in the state Senate.\n\nIf Good loses, he would be the first House incumbent to go down to a primary challenge this year, with the exception of one race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\nThe winner will face Democrat Gloria Tinsley Witt, who defeated Gary Terry and Paul Riley.\n\nThe 5th Congressional District stretches from Charlottesville in the north, past the far western suburbs of Richmond, through Lynchburg and down to Danville and the North Carolina border.\n\nHouse District 7\n\nVindman, a political newcomer who was nonetheless familiar to voters for his role in Trump's first impeachment, has won the Democratic nomination in the 7th Congressional District for what will be a closely watched congressional seat in November.\n\nVindman, who crushed his opponents in fundraising, won in a crowded seven-person field that included four women of color who were all current or former officeholders in Prince William County, a suburban area outside the nation's capital that constitutes the largest portion of the district.\n\nThe former Army officer gained a measure of fame when he and his twin brother, Alex, reported their concerns about Trump's 2019 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which Trump sought an investigation of Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nVindman highlighted his opposition to Trump in his campaign and in a victory statement issued Tuesday evening said \"our grass-roots movement is coming for the extreme MAGA agenda. Virginia voters are first and foremost values driven, and want to elect leaders with integrity who preserve fundamental rights and freedoms and not extremists.\"\n\nHe faced criticism from some local officials who said he was unconnected to the region's political dynamics.\n\nIn a battle between a former Army Green Beret and a former Navy SEAL, Republican voters chose the Army man, Derrick Anderson, over Navy veteran Cameron Hamilton.\n\nAnderson and Hamilton were the top two fundraisers in a six-person field. Anderson drew support from House GOP leadership in Washington, while Hamilton had support from members of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe district, which stretches from Prince William County south to Fredericksburg and west past Culpeper, tilts just slightly toward Democrats.\n\nHouse District 10\n\nSubramanyam defeated fellow Democratic candidates former Virginia House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, state Sens. Dan Helmer and Jennifer Boysko, and former Virginia Education Secretary Atif Qarni. Wexton endorsed Subramanyam.\n\nRepublican voters chose Mike Clancy from a field of four candidates.\n\nHouse District 2\n\nIn Virginia's coastal 2nd Congressional District, Missy Cotter Smasal, a Navy veteran who runs a nonprofit that honors fallen servicewomen, defeated Jeremiah \"Jake\" Denton IV, a constitutional law and civil rights attorney, in the Democratic primary.\n\nShe'll face Republican U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans in November.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday evening, Smasal took aim at Kiggans and \"the MAGA extremism she supports in Congress.\"\n\n\"I will protect abortion rights and access for all and fight for resources for veterans and military families,\" Smasal said. \"I will always defend democracy and reject party extremism.\"\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nIn the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, Navy veteran Cao prevailed over his four opponents for a chance to try to unseat Kaine, a Democrat who is seeking his third term as the state's junior U.S. senator.\n\nCao had the most money and previous campaign experience running for higher officer among the Republican primary contenders. He also had Trump's endorsement.\n\nIn a victory post on Facebook, Cao immediately criticized President Joe Biden's decision on Tuesday to allow certain U.S. citizens' spouses without legal status to apply eventually for citizenship.\n\n\"Tomorrow, we begin our campaign to save the country that saved my life,\" Cao stated. \"I spent twenty-five years in the Navy, while Tim Kaine spent thirty years in elected office.\"\n\nCao defeated Scott Parkinson, a former congressional staffer for DeSantis, as well as Jonathan Emord, an author and lawyer who often cites his court battles against the Food and Drug Administration. The other Republican candidates were Eddie Garcia, a U.S. Army veteran who owns a mobile app that serves veterans, and Chuck Smith, a former Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps commander and an attorney.\n\nFinley contributed to this report from Norfolk.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Bob Good - an arch conservative whom Trump is trying to bump out of Congress for disloyalty - trails his GOP challenger, state Sen. John McGuire, by just over 340 votes after Tuesday's election in Virginia's 5th Congressional District, with about 96% of votes in. The fate of Trump's quest for revenge could ironically partly hang on mail-in ballots - a category of votes the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has often decried with his false claims of 2020 election fraud.\n\nTrump is angry at Good, the chair of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, because he initially endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential race.\n\nKevin McCarthy also showed that Virginia is for vengeance by seeking his own bounty on Good, who helped to oust the California Republican as speaker last year. Good could become the first Republican incumbent to lose a House primary to a nonincumbent this year despite his frantic efforts to win back Trump's support, which included a trip to support the former president at his hush money trial in New York.\n\nMcGuire told supporters Tuesday night, \"I'm your Republican nominee,\" and thanked Trump for his help, even though the race could be heading for a recount if the margin between the two candidates remains so tight and the losing candidate requests one. Good said on social media that he'd held off the \"Washington swamp\" and declared the race \"too close to call.\" CNN has not made a projection.\n\nDefeat for Good would strangle a fast-rising congressional career born when he won a drive-thru GOP convention in a Lynchburg church parking lot during the pandemic. The staunch conservative was elected to chair the powerful Freedom Caucus in only his second term. But he authored his own demise by getting crosswise with two key forces in the riotous Republican House majority -- the ex-president and McCarthy, whose still potent financial machine is on a revenge tour.\n\nBut the significance of the drama in this district - an area that produced presidents James Madison and James Monroe - goes far beyond a single, thwarted political arc. It shows that the real dividing line in the GOP is no longer a question of ideology. In more normal times, it would have been hard to imagine a conservative challenger getting to the right of Good. But in the modern GOP, the true acid test of political viability is total fealty to the presumptive nominee. And this race, which was the most expensive House GOP primary of the 2024 cycle so far, will also serve as the perfect emblem of a chaotic House majority that will be remembered far more for vicious internal fights and members trampling over one another to prove their devotion to Trump than for its legislative record.\n\nThe ex-president has plenty of weightier worries amid a staggering confluence of legal crises following his first criminal conviction and three other indictments and with a potential second presidency to plan. But he also has a sensitive political radar that picks out even the merest hint of disloyalty.\n\nIt was therefore not surprising that Trump conducted a tele-rally for McGuire on primary eve and left his supporters with no doubt about who he favored and why.\n\n\"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me. He was against things that everybody would have wanted and always made it difficult,\" Trump told supporters on the call. \"He just let us down, he let us down very big. ... As you probably know, he was against me for numerous years and then after I won the primaries, he became a big fan. But that's not good enough, because those are the people that - they tend to leave you very quickly.\"\n\nTrump's attempt to drive Good out of Congress sprung from the same reflex to exert power that he showed last week. In his first visit to Capitol Hill since his mob beat up police officers and smashed their way into the House and Senate on January 6, 2021, the ex-president gathered Republican lawmakers around him in a show of homage. The image of the day was a handshake offered by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who hasn't hidden his disdain for the former president but who has never shirked from what needs to be done for the GOP to win and retain power.\n\nWhile he was estranged from Trump, Good campaigned as though he and the former president were on the same side. He used signs that said: \"Trump, Bob Good: Keeping America Great\" - as he appeared alongside the former president's final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, himself a former Freedom Caucus chairman. Speaking to CNN's Manu Raju in March, Good dismissed questions about his backing of DeSantis, whose primary bid ended in January after a second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. \"Why don't you get with the present? This is a time to rally behind President Trump,\" Good said. \"My opponent wants to continue to divide people based on the past. We're all behind President Trump. He must win. The country can't handle four more years of Joe Biden.\"\n\nMcGuire displayed the behavior required of anyone who wants a future in the Trump-era GOP in an interview with \"CNN This Morning\" on Tuesday just before polls opened in Virginia. He attacked Good for not being loyal to the party's presumptive presidential nominee. \"Obviously, he bagged Trump for an endorsement in 2022. And less than a year later, when the chips were down ... he endorsed a different candidate.\"\n\nThe retired Navy SEAL also upheld the former president's claims of election fraud in 2020 by arguing that Trump was doomed by changes to voting arrangements that were introduced during the Covid-19 emergency. \"I would say changing the rules in the middle of the game is cheating. And I think that that Trump was robbed,\" McGuire said. A new law allowing no-excuse absentee voting was passed by Virginia's legislature and approved by the governor in April 2020, seven months before the election.\n\nMcGuire also voiced Trump's claims that the former president is a victim of a weaponized justice system following his conviction for falsifying business records to hide a payment to a former adult film star in 2016. Trump has made similar claims about his indictments over his attempt to overturn the election in 2020 and for alleged mishandling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. \"I'm not a lawyer, but I think all Americans, we go back to trust. You know, if we don't have trust in our institutions, our country is going to fall apart. And there is evidence everywhere of a two-tiered justice system. Rules for thee, not for me,\" McGuire said.\n\nThe candidate's willingness to submit to the modern GOP's trifecta -- unflinching loyalty to Trump and acceptance of his election fraud conspiracies and legal persecution narrative could yet see him emerge as the district's GOP nominee.\n\nGood could only manage two of the three -- and it could cost him his career.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

(AP) -- One of America's most conservative congressmen was locked in a tight renomination battle against an opponent endorsed by former President Donald Trump in Virginia's primary election Tuesday\n\nRep. Bob Good, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, is seeking a third term representing Virginia's 5th Congressional District, but state Sen. John McGuire has mounted a strong challenge that highlights frictions in the party.\n\nMeanwhile, in House District 10, voters chose Suhas Subramanyam from a field of 12 Democrats to try to hold the seat held by U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, who is not seeking reelection to her northern Virginia seat after being diagnosed with a rare, incurable neurological illness.\n\nIn House District 7, voters chose Eugene Vindman in a crowded Democratic primary to try to hold the seat being vacated by U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a popular incumbent who is running for governor in 2025.\n\nStatewide, voters selected Hung Cao as the Republican nominee to the U.S. Senate to take on Democrat Tim Kaine.\n\nHere's a look at the major battles on the ballot:\n\nConventional politics might suggest a congressman with the conservative credentials of Good would be safe in a primary. But he earned the wrath of Trump when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president. He switched back to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but Trump is endorsing McGuire and portraying Good as a backstabber.\n\nTrump continued to bash Good as he campaigned for McGuire in a telephone rally Monday night.\n\n\"Unlike Bob Good, John McGuire will not let you down,\" Trump said, adding that McGuire is \"strong on the border\" and \"will always defend your under-siege Second Amendment.\"\n\nGood, for his part, says he considers Trump the best president in his lifetime and only endorsed DeSantis because Trump is constitutionally limited to only one more term.\n\nGood also alienated Republican insiders by voting to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, throwing the party into a measure of chaos.\n\nSeeking to capitalize is McGuire, a state legislator and former Navy SEAL who has echoed Trump's attacks on Good, calling him a \"never Trumper.\"\n\nGood has bashed McGuire as a serial campaigner who announced his congressional bid just one week after winning election to a four-year term in the state Senate.\n\nIf Good loses, he would be the first House incumbent to go down to a primary challenge this year, with the exception of one race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\nThe winner will face Democrat Gloria Tinsley Witt, who defeated Gary Terry and Paul Riley.\n\nThe 5th Congressional District stretches from Charlottesville in the north, past the far western suburbs of Richmond, through Lynchburg and down to Danville and the North Carolina border.\n\nVindman, a political newcomer who was nonetheless familiar to voters for his role in Trump's first impeachment, has won the Democratic nomination in the 7th Congressional District for what will be a closely watched congressional seat in November.\n\nVindman, who crushed his opponents in fundraising, won in a crowded seven-person field that included four women of color who were all current or former officeholders in Prince William County, a suburban area outside the nation's capital that constitutes the largest portion of the district.\n\nThe former Army officer gained a measure of fame when he and his twin brother, Alex, reported their concerns about Trump's 2019 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which Trump sought an investigation of Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nVindman highlighted his opposition to Trump in his campaign and in a victory statement issued Tuesday evening said \"our grass-roots movement is coming for the extreme MAGA agenda. Virginia voters are first and foremost values driven, and want to elect leaders with integrity who preserve fundamental rights and freedoms and not extremists.\"\n\nHe faced criticism from some local officials who said he was unconnected to the region's political dynamics.\n\nIn a battle between a former Army Green Beret and a former Navy SEAL, Republican voters chose the Army man, Derrick Anderson, over Navy veteran Cameron Hamilton.\n\nAnderson and Hamilton were the top two fundraisers in a six-person field. Anderson drew support from House GOP leadership in Washington, while Hamilton had support from members of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe district, which stretches from Prince William County south to Fredericksburg and west past Culpeper, tilts just slightly toward Democrats.\n\nSubramanyam defeated fellow Democratic candidates former Virginia House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, state Sens. Dan Helmer and Jennifer Boysko, and former Virginia Education Secretary Atif Qarni. Wexton endorsed Subramanyam.\n\nRepublican voters chose Mike Clancy from a field of four candidates.\n\nIn Virginia's coastal 2nd Congressional District, Missy Cotter Smasal, a Navy veteran who runs a nonprofit that honors fallen servicewomen, defeated Jeremiah \"Jake\" Denton IV, a constitutional law and civil rights attorney, in the Democratic primary.\n\nShe'll face Republican U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans in November.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday evening, Smasal took aim at Kiggans and \"the MAGA extremism she supports in Congress.\"\n\n\"I will protect abortion rights and access for all and fight for resources for veterans and military families,\" Smasal said. \"I will always defend democracy and reject party extremism.\"\n\nIn the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, Navy veteran Cao prevailed over his four opponents for a chance to try to unseat Kaine, a Democrat who is seeking his third term as the state's junior U.S. senator.\n\nCao had the most money and previous campaign experience running for higher officer among the Republican primary contenders. He also had Trump's endorsement.\n\nIn a victory post on Facebook, Cao immediately criticized President Joe Biden's decision on Tuesday to allow certain U.S. citizens' spouses without legal status to apply eventually for citizenship.\n\n\"Tomorrow, we begin our campaign to save the country that saved my life,\" Cao stated. \"I spent twenty-five years in the Navy, while Tim Kaine spent thirty years in elected office.\"\n\nCao defeated Scott Parkinson, a former congressional staffer for DeSantis, as well as Jonathan Emord, an author and lawyer who often cites his court battles against the Food and Drug Administration. The other Republican candidates were Eddie Garcia, a U.S. Army veteran who owns a mobile app that serves veterans, and Chuck Smith, a former Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps commander and an attorney.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person",

Unofficial data from the Department of Elections shows just hundreds of votes separating the two candidates after the primary election on Tuesday.\n\nAs of Wednesday, McGuire, a state senator, was 315 votes ahead of Good, who was vying for his third congressional term. The results account for all Election Day, early voting and mail-in ballots, a report by The Daily Progress said, but the race remains neck-and-neck as election staff count mail-in ballots that continue to trickle in and provisional ballots.\n\nMcGuire earned 31,370 votes, hundreds more than Good's 31,055, according to unofficial data. However, the outcome could still change. Even if McGuire is deemed the official winner, Good could demand a recount, an effort covered by state dollars if only .5 percent of the votes separate the two candidates.\n\nOfficial results are expected by Friday.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Good maintained high spirits and expressed gratitude for those who supported him during the campaign. He also made it clear that his team planned to ensure all votes were counted properly.\n\n\"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help we were able to make this race too close to call. We implemented the best early voting operation that the 5th District has ever seen, and we are still waiting for the results of mail-in ballots and provisional ballots,\" he said. \"We are doing what we can to ensure we have teams of observers and legal counsel to ensure all the votes are properly counted in the coming days. No matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right. Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now.\"\n\nMeanwhile, McGuire remained confident that he would secure the primary election.\n\n\"Thank you to my family, thank you to everyone who helped out on this campaign, thank you to the people who endorsed and supported me, and thank you to Donald J. Trump for believing in me. There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory,\" he said in a post on X.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Good and McGuire's campaigns by email for comment.\n\nDespite the unofficial results, some already believed McGuire to be the winner.\n\nU.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene touted that she was the first member of Congress to endorse McGuire in a celebratory social media post on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"John McGuire WINS! I was the first member of Congress to endorse @JohnMcGuire4VA because of his conservative record, his loyalty to President Trump, and his service to our country,\" Greene posted. \"This victory shows just how toxic Bob Good has been to the Republican Party, the America First movement, and perhaps most critically to the reelection of President Trump.\" It's time for the Republican Party to unite, stop pushing self-serving politicians, and DEFEAT the Democrats in November! Congrats to Trump & MTG-endorsed John McGuire, the next Congressman from Virginia's Fifth District!!!\"\n\nOthers complimented Good's actions but criticized him for endorsing DeSantis over Trump.\n\n\"Bob Good has a stellar voting record. But he knew what he was getting into by endorsing against Trump,\" conservative X account Red Eagle Politics posted. \"It's sad all around, truly. I just hope McGuire turns out to be better than expected and this doesn't turn out to be a total \"cut your nose off to spite your face\" moment.\"\n\nHowever, some people supported Good for his actions, including former Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis.\n\n\"Thank you for standing firm on the truth and being principled,\" Ellis wrote in response to Good's X post. \"Praying you win.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_skinner@newsweek.com", "name": "Anna Skinner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Postal voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Early voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Good", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGuire_(Virginia_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McGuire (Virginia politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia's_5th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia's 5th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Ellis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Ellis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2413253/maga-republican-race-virginia-too-close.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=ecf8ec8c1b72b3633590d97dda2ab068", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661234", "eventUri": "eng-9661234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Conservative U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., is asking for \"patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks\" as he hopes the final ballot count from Tuesday's primary will allow him to fend off a challenger endorsed by former president Donald Trump.\n\nGood, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, currently trails state Sen. John McGuire by a little over 300 votes as elections officials finalize their vote counts and mail-in ballots continue to trickle in.\n\nThe Associated Press has not yet called the race for either candidate.\n\nIf Good loses, he would be the first House incumbent to lose a primary challenge this year, with the exception of one race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\nAs one of the most conservative congressmen in the country, Good might be impervious to a primary challenge under normal circumstances. But he earned Trump's wrath when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president. He switched back to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but Trump endorsed McGuire and called Good a backstabber.\n\nMcGuire's lead of roughly 300 votes translates to a margin of about half a percentage point out of more than 62,000 ballots cast. Once the results are certified, Virginia law allows for a recount if the margin of victory is less than a percentage point. If it's within half a percentage point, the recount can be conducted at the state's expense.\n\nIn a social media post Wednesday, Good said the race remains too close to call.\n\n\"Provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are also still to be counted. We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved,\" he said.\n\nBoth Good and McGuire are among Republicans who have raised concerns about election integrity in the wake of Trump's false claims of voter fraud in his 2020 reelection defeat. Good was among more than 100 GOP House members who voted in January 2021 to object to the Electoral College count from states that Trump disputed.\n\nIn a pre-election telephone rally with Trump on Monday, McGuire urged supporters to deliver him a margin of victory \"too big to rig.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Good", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia's_5th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia's 5th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Postal voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistricting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redistricting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Morality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Morality", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/preview-1686.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661234", "eventUri": "eng-9661234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Bob Good, R-5th, including an election eve tele-rally saying the conservative Congressman stabbed him in the back, gave state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, the push he needed to eke out what's now a tiny lead, political scientists say.\n\nBut the big question is what McGuire's current 315 vote, 0.5 percentage point margin signifies about the influence of an endorsement from the former president.\n\nWith that close a result, political scientists think a recount is coming.\n\n\"Why did Good make it so close, and perhaps even prevail despite Trump's severe attacks?\" said John McGlennon, a College of William and Mary political scientist.\n\nLocal electoral boards must still complete their work of checking and double-checking Tuesday night's preliminary tallies and count the final mail-in and provisional ballots.\n\nThe 0.5 percentage point gap between McGuire's vote and Good's opens the path to a recount, once the boards certify results.\n\nIn a way, the question of Trump's influence comes down to 5th District voters' strong feelings about Washington, government officials and outsiders telling them what to do.\n\n\"It's useful to recognize that for many MAGA voters, Trump's appeal is his willingness to stick it to the establishment,\" McGlennon said.\n\n\"In this race, ironically, the incumbent could proudly point to the Republican establishment's attacks as a sign that he's even more Trump than Trump. Good has that grassroots support that rejects all the party leaders and elected officials ganging up on him because he won't play their game,\" he said.\n\nDuring the campaign, Good made a point of noting that groups close to former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy had supported McGuire.\n\n\"Even Marjorie Taylor Greene became part of the establishment. Look at the lack of turnout for McGuire and Greene on their two-day blitz,\" McGlennon said.\n\nMcGuire's narrow lead shows that that large numbers of 5th District conservatives did not believe that either McGuire or Trump offered a principled reason to abandon Good, while McCarthy allies' support for McGuire was another reason to stick to good, said longtime Virginia analyst Bob Holsworth, a former VCU dean.\n\n\"The vast majority of Good voters will cast a ballot for Trump in November. But for Trump to be competitive in Virginia, he will need a huge turnout in the parts of the district that supported Good. The open question is whether the enthusiasm level that drives turnout will be as high as he need,\" Holsworth said.\n\nRoanoke College political scientist Harry Wilson said Trump's impact is obvious.\n\n\"In an election this close, you can point to a variety of factors, but I seriously doubt McGuire would have won, assuming he does, without Trump's endorsement. Kevin McCarthy may have a fingerprint on it as well,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"Maybe some folks were tired of Good's style. Maybe folks actually like McGuire. Some may still be smarting over Good defeating [Denver] Riggelman,\" Wilson said, referring to the Republican who represented the district for one term before Good defeated him in a 2020 nominating convention, after Riggleman officiated at a same-sex marriage and drew fire for his stands on immigration and fiscal policy.\n\nStill, it was Trump who swung the election for McGuire, said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington.\n\n\"If the former president had not weighed in against Good, the incumbent would have been renominated in a walk,\" Farnsworth said.\n\n\"His combative brand of conservatism fits well with the preferences of Republican primary voters in the district,\" he said.\n\nGood's bad luck was an early endorsement last year of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' short-lived bid to challenge Trump for the GOP's presidential nomination, Farnsworth said.\n\n\"Trump personalizes politics at every opportunity. If Good had made the politically savvy choice of backing Trump from the start, rather than endorsing DeSantis, he wouldn't be on the knife's edge of losing this renomination,\" he added.\n\nEd Lynch, chair of Hollins University's global politics and societies department, said McGuire probably would not have received much more than 30% of the vote without Trump's support.\n\n\"To my mind, there is no question that the only way to put up a serious primary challenge to a rock-ribbed conservative like Bob Good was with an endorsement by Donald Trump,\" he said.\n\nEarly voting and turnout\n\nEarly voting offers a key clue to Trump's influence, political scientists say.\n\nGood won 5,822 early votes to McGuire's 5,012, but McGuire had a 943-vote edge with Election Day ballots, according to unofficial state Department of Election tallies. All in all, McGuire won 31,370 votes to Good's 31,055 of the ballots that have been counted so far.\n\n\"The early voting numbers demonstrated that Good's appeal remained stronger until Trump ramped up his attacks on the Republican incumbent in recent days over what Trump viewed as Good's disloyalty,\" Farnsworth said.\n\nThose attacks included the tele-rally on Monday evening during which Trump declared: \"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back sort of like he did with me.\"\n\nThe primary saw some big spending, much of it from outsiders. All in all, the sums spent will likely exceed $15 million from the two campaigns themselves and outside independent committees, with more backing McGuire and attacking Good, McGlennon said.\n\nTurnout was big, as well, with more than 62,000 voting, nearly double the turnout in the busiest of Virginia's eight other House primaries.\n\n\"Turnout was huge in the 5th because you had two combative candidates who were roughly evenly matched,\" said Mary Washington's Farnsworth.\n\n\"The margin was far closer than in any of the other congressional primary contests in Virginia on Tuesday, and there was huge campaign spending dropped into this race from national Republicans,\" he said.\n\nGood beat McGuire in his Lynchburg-area home base, racking up margins as high at 56% and 59% of votes cast, and also led in the Charlottesville area. McGuire won 60 percent-plus margins in the parts of the district nearest Richmond, including his Goochland County home as well as Louisa, Powhatan and parts of Hanover counties.\n\n\"I wouldn't read anything into this race carrying over to November, but the polls, including Roanoke College, suggest the general election will be much closer than 2020,\" Wilson said.\n\nThe real message from the 5th District may be how the presidential campaigns interpret the 5th, when they start allocating resources to different states, Wilson said.\n\nAnd Trump gave a clue at the McGuire tele-rally, when he said he would \"put a very heavy play on Virginia,\" adding, \"I think we're gonna win the state of Virginia.\"\n\nTrump's other big Virginia endorsement, of retired Navy Capt. Hung Cao's bid to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine, shows the former president's strength among Virginia Republicans, Hollins' Lynch said. Cao won a 5-way race by getting 62% of the votes cast.\n\n\"That race could have gone right down to the wire had Trump stayed out of it,\" Lynch said.\n\n\"I still rate the Commonwealth as safe for the Democrats in the Senate, but not solid,\" Lynch said.\n\n\"Ironically, the better Trump does in Virginia, the better for Kaine. Reluctant Trump voters, who are voting for Trump simply because they can't stand Biden, will want to balance that uncomfortable vote with a much more comfortable vote for Kaine,\" he added.\n\nCao began the race last year with an advantage from name recognition in his competitive race against Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-10th, which he lost by 6.5 percentage points.\n\nTrump's endorsement \"may have bumped him from being just a favorite to a landslide winner,\" said J. Miles Coleman at the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.\n\nThe former president \"probably knew he had a winning choice,\" said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. \"He likes to run up the number of Trump-endorsed candidates who won in order to show he had control of the party apparatus across the country.\"\n\nTrump's influence on the 7th\n\nTrump's presence was felt in the Democratic primary in Northern Virginia's 7th District, where Eugene Vindman, won a 49% plurality in a seven-way race that featured four current or former office holders in the district.\n\nIt was Vindman's first political race, but he benefited from national name recognition because of the role that he and his twin brother, Alexander, played in the first impeachment of Trump.\n\nHe ran on a message of protecting democracy that invoked Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe winner of the GOP primary, Derrick Anderson, told supporters \"Eugene Vindman is only running for revenge -- revenge against Donald Trump and revenge against Republicans.\"\n\nRep. Abigail Spanberger, D-7th, won the political swing district two years ago after a new political map moved it from the Richmond suburbs to Northern Virginia and the Fredericksburg area. Spanberger, who lives in Henrico County, is running for governor next year instead of a fourth term in Congress.\n\nIn his victory statement, Vindman tried to link Anderson to Trump's Make America Great Movement, \"who wants nothing more than to play politics with our classrooms and let politicians ban books on the Holocaust and slavery and throw them into the fire.\"\n\n\"Running as a MAGA Republican would put him at odds with the vast majority of voters in the district,\" Vindman said of Anderson. \"You don't go from Spanberger to MAGA candidate in one election cycle.\"\n\n'A geographical challenge'\n\nA political endorsement may have been decisive in Sen. Suhas Subramanyam's victory in a 12-person race in the 10th District Democratic primary, but it wasn't Trump's. Wexton, who is stepping down because of a serious medical condition, endorsed Subramanyam as her preferred successor, emphasizing his roots in Loudoun County, with more than half of the registered voters in the district.\n\nWhile other congressional races have been largely national in message, Rozell said Subramanyam's ties to Loudoun and emphasis on local issues gave him an advantage over Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, who had raised the most money in the race but lived just outside of the district.\n\n\"He had a geographical challenge,\" Rozell said.\n\nSubramanyam won the race with a 30% plurality and a margin of less than 1,500 votes over Helmer.\n\nDave Ress (804) 649-6948\n\ndress@timesdispatch.com\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I

Bob Good - an arch conservative whom Trump is trying to bump out of Congress for disloyalty - trails his GOP challenger, state Sen. John McGuire, by just over 340 votes after Tuesday's election in Virginia's 5th Congressional District, with about 96% of votes in. The fate of Trump's quest for revenge could ironically partly hang on mail-in ballots - a category of votes the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has often decried with his false claims of 2020 election fraud.\n\nTrump is angry at Good, the chair of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, because he initially endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential race.\n\nKevin McCarthy also showed that Virginia is for vengeance by seeking his own bounty on Good, who helped to oust the California Republican as speaker last year. Good could become the first Republican incumbent to lose a House primary to a nonincumbent this year despite his frantic efforts to win back Trump's support, which included a trip to support the former president at his hush money trial in New York.\n\nMcGuire told supporters Tuesday night, \"I'm your Republican nominee,\" and thanked Trump for his help, even though the race could be heading for a recount if the margin between the two candidates remains so tight and the losing candidate requests one. Good said on social media that he'd held off the \"Washington swamp\" and declared the race \"too close to call.\" CNN has not made a projection.\n\nDefeat for Good would strangle a fast-rising congressional career born when he won a drive-thru GOP convention in a Lynchburg church parking lot during the pandemic. The staunch conservative was elected to chair the powerful Freedom Caucus in only his second term. But he authored his own demise by getting crosswise with two key forces in the riotous Republican House majority -- the ex-president and McCarthy, whose still potent financial machine is on a revenge tour.\n\nBut the significance of the drama in this district - an area that produced presidents James Madison and James Monroe - goes far beyond a single, thwarted political arc. It shows that the real dividing line in the GOP is no longer a question of ideology. In more normal times, it would have been hard to imagine a conservative challenger getting to the right of Good. But in the modern GOP, the true acid test of political viability is total fealty to the presumptive nominee. And this race, which was the most expensive House GOP primary of the 2024 cycle so far, will also serve as the perfect emblem of a chaotic House majority that will be remembered far more for vicious internal fights and members trampling over one another to prove their devotion to Trump than for its legislative record.\n\nTrump's intervention\n\nThe ex-president has plenty of weightier worries amid a staggering confluence of legal crises following his first criminal conviction and three other indictments and with a potential second presidency to plan. But he also has a sensitive political radar that picks out even the merest hint of disloyalty.\n\nIt was therefore not surprising that Trump conducted a tele-rally for McGuire on primary eve and left his supporters with no doubt about who he favored and why.\n\n\"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me. He was against things that everybody would have wanted and always made it difficult,\" Trump told supporters on the call. \"He just let us down, he let us down very big. ... As you probably know, he was against me for numerous years and then after I won the primaries, he became a big fan. But that's not good enough, because those are the people that - they tend to leave you very quickly.\"\n\nTrump's attempt to drive Good out of Congress sprung from the same reflex to exert power that he showed last week. In his first visit to Capitol Hill since his mob beat up police officers and smashed their way into the House and Senate on January 6, 2021, the ex-president gathered Republican lawmakers around him in a show of homage. The image of the day was a handshake offered by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who hasn't hidden his disdain for the former president but who has never shirked from what needs to be done for the GOP to win and retain power.\n\nWhile he was estranged from Trump, Good campaigned as though he and the former president were on the same side. He used signs that said: \"Trump, Bob Good: Keeping America Great\" - as he appeared alongside the former president's final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, himself a former Freedom Caucus chairman. Speaking to CNN's Manu Raju in March, Good dismissed questions about his backing of DeSantis, whose primary bid ended in January after a second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. \"Why don't you get with the present? This is a time to rally behind President Trump,\" Good said. \"My opponent wants to continue to divide people based on the past. We're all behind President Trump. He must win. The country can't handle four more years of Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe passport to power in Trump's GOP\n\nMcGuire displayed the behavior required of anyone who wants a future in the Trump-era GOP in an interview with \"CNN This Morning\" on Tuesday just before polls opened in Virginia. He attacked Good for not being loyal to the party's presumptive presidential nominee. \"Obviously, he bagged Trump for an endorsement in 2022. And less than a year later, when the chips were down ... he endorsed a different candidate.\"\n\nThe retired Navy SEAL also upheld the former president's claims of election fraud in 2020 by arguing that Trump was doomed by changes to voting arrangements that were introduced during the Covid-19 emergency. \"I would say changing the rules in the middle of the game is cheating. And I think that that Trump was robbed,\" McGuire said. A new law allowing no-excuse absentee voting was passed by Virginia's legislature and approved by the governor in April 2020, seven months before the election.\n\nMcGuire also voiced Trump's claims that the former president is a victim of a weaponized justice system following his conviction for falsifying business records to hide a payment to a former adult film star in 2016. Trump has made similar claims about his indictments over his attempt to overturn the election in 2020 and for alleged mishandling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. \"I'm not a lawyer, but I think all Americans, we go back to trust. You know, if we don't have trust in our institutions, our country is going to fall apart. And there is evidence everywhere of a two-tiered justice system. Rules for thee, not for me,\" McGuire said.\n\nThe candidate's willingness to submit to the modern GOP's trifecta -- unflinching loyalty to Trump and acceptance of his election fraud conspiracies and legal persecution narrative could yet see him emerge as the district's GOP nominee.\n\nGood could only manage two of the three -- and it could cost him his career.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com",

Bob Good and state Sen. John McGuire might be a ways off.\n\nWith McGuire's lead of about 300 votes and yet-to-be received mail-in ballots, the race hasn't been called in any candidates' favor just yet. A busy week of work lies ahead for the Virginia Department of Elections to count votes and for the state's Board of Elections to certify results on July 2. From there, the Good-McGuire matchup could be headed for a recount.\n\nVirginia law allows for candidates to request a recount if the margins are less than 1%.

After ostensibly losing by 78 votes, the recount confirmed that Taylor had topped Adams by 53 votes.\n\nAs of Thursday, Good's campaign did not respond to an inquiry into whether he is considering a recount, but he noted optimism in a social media post on Wednesday.\n\n\"This race remains too close to call. We are in a period where the law provides a process for evaluating the accuracy of all the vote totals from election day to ensure everyone can have full confidence in the certified results,\" he wrote. \"Provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are also still to be counted. We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed. We believe we can still prevail.\"\n\nIndeed, the Department of Elections will receive mail-in ballots by noon Friday, as long as they have been postmarked on or before election day. The department will also review and verify provisional ballots, which are typically used when someone forgot identification while voting or if someone is registering on the same day that they're voting.\n\nAfter all the various ballots are counted, the state board of elections will certify election results on July 2. Once completed, Good would have 10 days to file a petition for a recount if he meets the less than 1% threshold.\n\nWhile the 5th Congressional District is reliably Republican-leaning, the primary matchup between Good and McGuire was hotly contested -- at times drawing national attention. More locally, it represented the lawmakers' different factions and styles. Good hails from Campbell County where he served on its board of supervisors and McGuire has represented the Goochland area in the state legislature for several years.\n\nGood has previously been insulated by a convention nominating process with tuned-in party activists while his challenge from McGuire is the first time he's defended his seat in a district-wide primary.\n\nBut former President Donald Trump loomed large in the Virginia race. Aside from the various high-profile congresspeople who stumped for both men and former Trump strategist Steve Bannon rallying with Good -- Trump backed McGuire.\n\nThough Good has been a longtime fan of the once-and-possibly-future president, it's his brief endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last summer before he dropped out of the presidential race that has haunted Good. He backed DeSantis shortly after indictments were levied against Trump for cases that are still playing out in court. When DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race, Good supported Trump again.\n\nMcGuire's campaign went on to label Good a \"Never Trumper.\"\n\n\"By definition, you can't be a 'Never Something' that you have documented evidence that you currently are (a supporter of),\" Good said at a campaign event this year.\n\nBut Trump didn't forget the months Good boosted his former opponent and fealty to Trump emerged as a key issue between the candidates leading up to the primary.\n\n\"John McGuire has my complete and total endorsement,\" Trump said in a tele-rally for McGuire ahead of the election. \"I want that to be understood, because Bob Good's going around saying we're friends. I mean, he was fine the last six months, but before that, he was a basic disaster.\"\n\nWhile Trump loyalty was a litmus test that attracted national attention, congressional races are still somewhat local in nature.\n\n\"If there's one thing I guess we can take away is that a Trump endorsement alone -- even in one of our most conservative districts -- does not necessarily guarantee an outcome,\" Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner said during a press call on Thursday.\n\nWhoever wins will face Democrat nominee Gloria Tinsley Witt in November's general election. A Republican-leaning district, voters have historically favored GOP candidates, though Democrat Tom Periello represented the district from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn the meantime, McGuire believes he's likely won. On election night, he called it an \"honor\" to be the Republican nominee and echoed his stance on X this week.\n\n\"There are still a few votes left to count,\" he wrote. \"But it's clear that all paths end with a victory.\"", "source": {"uri": "virginiamercury.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Virginia Mercury"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_rene_woods@virginiamercury.com", "name":

Lauren Boebert as a member.\n\nCongressman Bob Good, the Chair of the House Freedom Caucus, still doesn't know if he is the first incumbent Member of Congress to lose a bid for re-election in 2024. As The Associated Press explains:\n\nGood currently trails state Sen. John McGuire by a little over 300 votes as elections officials finalize their vote counts and mail-in ballots continue to trickle in...\n\n...As one of the most conservative congressmen in the country, Good might be impervious to a primary challenge under normal circumstances. But he earned Trump's wrath when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president. He switched back to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but Trump endorsed McGuire and called Good a backstabber.\n\nMcGuire's lead of roughly 300 votes translates to a margin of about half a percentage point out of more than 62,000 ballots cast. Once the results are certified, Virginia law allows for a recount if the margin of victory is less than a percentage point. If it's within half a percentage point, the recount can be conducted at the state's expense.\n\nMcGuire has already declared victory, which seems a bit ridiculous, and there are plenty of Republicans who really want to believe that this race is over. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon are among the Republicans in Congress who are doing some early celebrating. While Bacon is tired of Good because of his penchant for throwing wrenches in gears, Greene is still salty about being kicked her out of the House Freedom Caucus last year following her verbal House Floor spat with Boebert.\n\nRep. Bob Good (R-Va.) squared off with a primary challenger backed by former President Donald Trump and has faced millions in negative ads. But it wasn't the blowout that one would expect when a candidate has nearly every major player in his party against him. Hours after the polls closed on Tuesday, the contentious battle between Good, the rabble-rousing House Freedom Caucus chair, and state Sen. John McGuire in Virginia's 5th District was far closer than widely anticipated, with a winner potentially not coming for days...\n\n...The coalition assembled against Good included everyone from former Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Trump, to a sitting member of the House Freedom Caucus that Good chairs. But that still wasn't enough for a decisive victory, with McGuire only narrowly leading as of early Wednesday morning, with the race too close to call.\n\nMcCarthy and other Republicans are mad at Good for getting in the way of just about everything in Congress, while Trump's anger was more reliably self-serving. If Good can pull out a victory, that could be very, um, bad for Republican efforts to actually accomplish a thing in Congress:\n\n...if Good does survive, he will return to Congress even more emboldened to hijack the GOP leadership's legislative agenda and endorse the primary rivals of his House colleagues. [Pols emphasis]\n\nNow former-Rep. Ken Buck was Colorado's only other House Freedom Caucus member, until he was kicked out because of a poor attendance record at the clubhouse. Even after being removed from the Freedom Caucus, however, Buck \"only had praise\" for Good, as POLITICO reported in March.\n\nBoebert is almost certain to be the Republican nominee to replace Buck in CO-04, but she's running out of allies in Congress; it's safe to say her job would get a little more complicated if Good isn't able to keep his seat.", "source": {"uri": "coloradopols.com",

Bob Good, the incumbent, faces a challenge from Trump-backed state Sen. John McGuire.\n\nOne of the most watched and most expensive primary battles nationwide this year remained too close to call by the end of Tuesday's election night.\n\nIn Virginia's heavily Republican 5th Congressional District, Rep. Bob Good, R-Campbell County and the chairman of the powerful House Freedom Caucus, faced a challenge from state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland County, who had made his campaign a referendum on which candidate is a more loyal supporter of former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut as all the other nomination contests statewide had been decided throughout the evening, the race between Good and the Trump-backed McGuire continued to hang in the air with the two candidates trading leads -- sometimes just in the single digits -- as results from different polling locations kept trickling in.\n\nBy 11:10 p.m., McGuire had a slight edge over Good with 50.26% to 49.74% of the vote -- a margin of 327 out of a total of 62,495 votes cast, with all precincts reporting, according to unofficial numbers by the Virginia Department of Elections.\n\nBut without all early and mail-in votes being included, his lead wasn't decisive enough to put an end to this viciously fought nomination contest that began last November, when the former Navy SEAL announced his challenge just days after winning a state Senate seat.\n\nAll of the 1,532 early votes yet to be counted are from localities where Good performed well, including 804 votes in Fluvanna County, where Good took 55.85% of the vote, and 728 in Bedford County, where the incumbent won with 58.55% of the vote. To make up the difference, Good would need more than 60% of those uncounted votes.\n\n\"With the race this close, we're not going to find out anytime soon. It could be tomorrow or even later in the week before we know. At this point a recount looks likely,\" David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said late Tuesday.\n\nVirginia does not have an automatic recount law, but if the difference is less than 1% of the vote either candidate may request a recount within 10 days after certification. By 11:20 p.m., McGuire was up by 0.52%.\n\nRichards said that the close contest shows that a Trump endorsement still has the ability to move the needle.\n\n\"His endorsement seems to have taken McGuire from virtually unknown to getting about half the vote tonight, which is pretty remarkable. Without Trump's approval McGuire would have been a footnote tonight. We're in for a long night and possibly a long week to sort out this election.\"\n\nThe eventual winner of the primary will face Gloria Witt, the Democratic nominee, in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nMcGuire had banked on his strategy to make this primary election about his unwavering loyalty to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and he continued to do so even after Trump's recent conviction in New York City on 34 counts of falsifying business records to influence the outcome of the 2016 election.\n\nGood had drawn Trump's ire after endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president a year ago. But despite his return to the Make America Great Again fold after DeSantis ended his campaign in January, and the continued support from most elected party officials in the district, the incumbent found himself trying to convince a majority of Republican voters that he deserved a third term on Capitol Hill.\n\nOn the campaign trail, McGuire has accused Good of \"hating Trump\" and being a \"Never-Trumper\" and a \"RINO\" -- a derogatory moniker for \"Republican In Name Only\" -- who is working to help Democrats. He has also alleged that the incumbent has been a divisive politician whose positions in Congress, including his key role in ousting former Speaker Kevin McCarthy last year, have damaged the Republican brand.\n\nLast month, Trump formally endorsed McGuire, and he held a tele-rally for the candidate Monday evening.\n\n\"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA,\" the former president wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. \"He turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement -- But really, it was too late. The damage had been done.\"\n\nMcGuire also collected endorsements from other MAGA celebrities, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the controversial congresswoman and conspiracy theorist from Georgia who joined him on the campaign trail in the 5th District earlier this month; Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who served as the secretary of interior in the previous administration; and former Trump attorney and New York City Mayor Rudy Guliani.\n\nGood's list of prominent supporters was much longer, boasting prominent names such as Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.; Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.; Byron Donalds, R-Fla.; and Scott Perry, R-Pa.; as well as former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and retired Gen. Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser in the Trump administration.\n\nBoth candidates benefited from record-breaking campaign contributions from outside Virginia, making the primary the second-most expensive race nationwide, with a total of more than $10 million spent, according to data collected by ProPublica, a nonprofit organization from New York dedicated to investigative journalism.", "source": {"uri": "cardinalnews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cardinal News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "markus_schmidt@cardinalnews.org", "name": "Markus Schmidt", "type": "author",

Ron DeSantis for president in May 2023, backing Trump only after DeSantis dropped out in January. Trump blasted Good, endorsed McGuire, made a TV ad for the challenger and headlined his tele-rally the eve of the primary.\n\n\"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back like he did with me,\" Trump warned on the phone-in rally Monday evening.\n\nFor a party accustomed to moderate-vs.-MAGA primary battles, the McGuire-Good contest represented more offbeat internal warfare, with two ultraconservatives fighting over who is closer to Trump. Both have Trump's name plastered alongside their own on campaign signs across the district - despite, in Good's case, a cease-and-desist letter from the former president's campaign, which claims the pairing falsely implies that the congressman had his endorsement.\n\nDrawing a stunning $10.7 million in outside spending - third-highest for any House primary nationally this year, behind two New York contests, according to money tracker Open Secrets - their clash has played out at the opening of a Trump merchandise store in Farmville, inside the Lynchburg megachurch on the campus of Liberty University and outside the Manhattan courthouse where Trump was convicted in a hush money trial.\n\n\"If you get down to the weeds of it, Congressman Good has been that extremely conservative voter that he said he was going to be throughout the entirety of his time in office. It seems that his only sin was that he did not support President Trump from the very beginning,\" said Aaron S. Van Allen, an associate professor of law and public policy at Liberty University's Helms School of Government. \"The big issue at the heart of this is merely allegiance to President Trump.\"\n\nAt the same time, Good has made enemies in his party's establishment wing as a member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus. Good played a key role in ousting Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) from the House speakership. His reputation as an unyielding conservative - one willing to blow up bipartisan deals on foreign aid, for instance, or risk government shutdowns to make a point on federal spending - allowed him to assume leadership of the group, which even some fellow GOP conservatives consider obstructionist and damaging to the party's reputation.\n\nMcCarthy allies have bankrolled a blitz of TV ads attacking Good and boosting McGuire. So have moderate Republican groups such as the Defending Main Street super PAC that do not ordinarily gravitate toward flamboyant MAGA cheerleaders like McGuire, who has had enormous Trump flags fluttering from the back of his Ford pickup since 2016.\n\nMcGuire led Good slightly in fundraising - $1.2 million to Good's $1.1 million - but enjoyed about $1 million more in supportfrom outside groups, whose spending exceeds what the candidates have raised by a factor of 10.\n\nThe establishment support for McGuire gave Good an opening to paint his challenger as a RINO (Republican in name only), while McGuire claimed Good's DeSantis endorsement made the incumbent an anti-MAGA insider. The claims and counterclaims could confuse voters and highlight the GOP's \"issues with the truth,\" said David Richards, chair of the political science department at the University of Lynchburg.\n\n\"It's not as if a real moderate or a real RINO candidate has popped up,\" he said. \"It's purely along [the lines of] who is Trump's bestie for reals. And in my mind, that's just kind of strange.\"\n\nWearing a navy blue Liberty University baseball cap Tuesday, Good greeted voters at St. Thomas More Catholic Church in Lynchburg, a couple of miles from campus, making last-minute appeals to constituents who squarely told him that they were listening to the former president and voting forGood's opponent.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that the president is listening to people who are absolutely lying to him,\" Good said. \"For people to say I don't support President Trump, I've supported him for eight years. They know I'm supporting him now.\"\n\nOutside the church, campaign supporters stood in front of red signs for McGuire and Good - the key distinction in them: a blue field on McGuire's signs that read \"Trump Endorsed.\" Good said his record and status as an incumbent would convince voters to reelect him, but he acknowledged the challenge he faced.\n\n\"That's not to say millions of dollars on spending, lies and distortions, and dishonest ads, and a high-level endorsement has no impact; I won't pretend it doesn't have an impact. But I don't think it'll be the deciding factor,\" he said.\n\nMcGuire - sporting Trump's signature look: blue suit, red tie - greeted voters at the polls early in the day but by early afternoon found himself stuck in the state Capitol in Richmond, where the state Senate was meeting in a special session.\n\nGood, 58, is a former Citibank banker and an athletic fundraiser for his alma mater, Liberty University, a Christian conservative touchstone in a district that stretches east to the Richmond exurbs and south to the North Carolina line. Good first went to Congress four years ago after unseating Rep. Denver Riggleman, a fellow Republican who inspired the challenge by officiating a same-sex wedding.\n\nMcGuire, 55, is a former Navy SEAL known in the Richmond area for founding a popular physical fitness business based on boot-camp-style workouts. He broke his neck in a trampoline accident and has made his recovery part of the story he shares as a motivational speaker. McGuire won election to the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, a year after Trump won the White House, and claimed a seat in the state Senate last November. He irked some Republicans in the district for taking on Good just days after winning his Senate race, breaking a promise he made during the campaign not to challenge Good.\n\nMcGuire counts himself among Trump's earliest and most ardent supporters, attending Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" rally in D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021, but stopping short, he says, of storming the Capitol. He later promoted a local showing of \"2000 Mules,\" a discredited film that purports to show voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGood often calls Trump \"the greatest president of my lifetime.\" He voted against certifying the 2020 election, echoed the falsehood that fraud cost Trump that race and rallied outside the Justice Department to demand answers about the treatment of Jan. 6 defendants.\n\nA self-described biblical conservative, Good was secretly videotaped saying said he endorsed DeSantis because the governor is more of a \"true conservative\" than Trump on some issues such as abortion and gun control.\n\nThere is a chance that plays well with voters in a conservative district, but given the choice between ideology and Trump, Republicans have tended to favor Trump, said Alex Keena, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor of political science.\n\n\"I don't even know what role ideology plays anymore,\" he said. \"It is really a cult of personality, and it seems to be the faction that's winning now in the Republican Party.\"\n\nFor Pam and Mike Ross of Lynchburg, it came as no surprise last month when Trump endorsed McGuire, potentially undermining Good. \"Trump said, '[Good] stabbed me in the back.' I mean, he has a vendetta,\" Mike Ross said. \"He's going to go after people that go against him.\"\n\nThe couple, who said they voted for Good, identify as \"strong Republicans\" but are wary of a second Trump term. They said they remain undecided on how they will vote in the general election this fall, citing their concerns about the former president's personal morals and embrace of nationalism.\n\nWith Trump and his allies directing money and resources behind McGuire in the contest, voter Esther Thulin said she was swayed to votefor McGuire by campaign mailers that came to her house assailing the congressman.\n\n\"I can't remember, but I was saying it doesn't look good,\" she said. \"It said he was a Republican badmouthing Republicans.\"\n\nTrump and political attacks aside, Daniel Markley, 33, said he voted for McGuire partially because of his background as a Navy SEAL, noting that his brother also serves in the armed forces. However, Markley said, the main issue that motivated him was the state of the economy and wanting to see a change in Congress.\n\n\"Gas is horrible. My grocery bill at the store is ridiculous. My dollar went so much further four years ago,\" he said. \"I don't blame them as much as possibly the president, but it's a big thing.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia in Palm Beach, Florida in July 2023 (Gage Skidmore)\n\nIn 2020, then-Rep. Denver Riggleman (R-Virginia) was voted out of office via an aggressive primary challenge from Bob Good, who now chairs the House Freedom Caucus and is seeking a third term. Good argued that Riggleman, a libertarian, wasn't far enough to the right -- and he enjoyed strong support from Christian nationalists.\n\nBut four years later, Good is the one being attacked from the far right. And he won't make it to the general election if Virginia State Sen. John McGuire prevails in an aggressive GOP primary challenge.\n\nThree prominent Republicans who have endorsed McGuire over Good are former President Donald Trump, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-California) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia).\n\nREAD MORE: Black Senate candidate's signs defaced with 'KKK' and crosshairs on her forehead: report\n\nIn an article published by the conservative Washington Examiner on June 18, reporter Jack Birle explains why they are backing McGuire instead of the House Freedom Caucus chairman.\n\nTrump, Birle notes, resents Good for endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the 2024 GOP presidential primary. Although Good endorsed Trump after DeSantis exited the race, Trump continues to hold a grudge.\n\nEndorsing McGuire on Truth Social on June 17, Trump wrote, \"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA. He turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement -- But really, it was too late. The damage had been done!\"\n\nMcCarthy, meanwhile, hasn't forgotten that Good was among the eight House Republicans who voted to oust him as speaker in October 2023.\n\nREAD MORE:'These two things cannot both be true': Top GOP rep scrutinized for 'mysterious' investments\n\nGreene, according to Birle, resents Good for a variety of reasons.\n\nBirle explains, \"Greene, a fierce ally of McCarthy and Trump, endorsed against Good in January. She cited Good's disloyalty to Trump, calling him a 'MAGA traitor.' Good also leads the House Freedom Caucus, which Greene was booted from last year, although Greene's ouster from the Caucus came prior to Good taking over as head.\"\n\nIn early June, Greene told WSET Channel 13 (an ABC affiliate in Virginia), \"This is important to me because I've served with Bob Good for several years now, and I have found him to be untrustworthy.

John McGuire was too close to call on Tuesday night.\n\nAs of 11 p.m., 92% of the vote was called - with McGuire being up by just 300 votes.\n\nThe race will now move to a recount for the GOP primary in the state's reliably red 5th Congressional District, in the southern part of the commonwealth.\n\nTRUMP-BACKED CANDIDATE WINS VIRGINIA'S REPUBLICAN SENATE PRIMARY TO TAKE ON TIM KAINE\n\nIn a statement on X, Good thanked supporters for their volunteer efforts and slammed the \"D.C. Swamp.\"\n\n\"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help we were able to make this race too close to call,\" Good wrote, in part.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"No matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right. Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now,\" he said.\n\nThe intra-party primary battle came after former President Donald Trump unleashed his wrath against Good for previously endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president.\n\nSMASAL WINS DEM PRIMARY TO FACE JEN KIGGANS IN KEY VIRGINIA SWING DISTRICT\n\nEven though the two-term congressional representative avoided criticizing Trump and quickly endorsed the former president after DeSantis ended his White House bid in January, Trump wrote on this Truth Social platform that \"the damage has been done!\"\n\nThe former president last month endorsed McGuire, who also had the backing of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a conservative firebrand and major Trump ally who is a vocal critic of Good who last year broke with the House Freedom Caucus. The group is considered the most far-right organization of lawmakers in the chamber.\n\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE BACKS CHALLENGER TO FREEDOM CAUCUS CHAIR AS 2024 STIRS HOUSE GOP CIVIL WAR\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy also targeted Good, who was one of eight Republicans last autumn who joined with Democrats voting to oust McCarthy from his leadership position.\n\nHowever, Good had the support of Reps. Matt Gaetz and Byron Donalds of Florida, two conservatives who are also strong backers of Trump.\n\nAdditionally, fellow House Freedom Caucus members, Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Andy Biggs of Arizona, joined Good in Virginia for a rally on Friday.\n\nEven though he was targeted by Trump, Good spotlighted his support for the former president as he ran for re-election.\n\n\"Happy Birthday to the best and next President of the United States, President Trump!\" Good wrote on social media last Friday, on the former president's 78th birthday.\n\nGood also showed up earlier this spring at Trump's criminal trial in New York City to show his support for the former president.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and

John McGuire remained too close to call as primary election night drew to a close, with a recount possibly being in the cards as the margin remained razor thin throughout the night.\n\nThe two candidates were locked in a tight race throughout the night, with both Good and McGuire alternating places to take the lead. McGuire still held a narrow advantage late Tuesday night, garnering 50.3% of the vote compared to Good's 49.7% with 98% of all ballots tallied as of 12:24 a.m. Wednesday morning.\n\nBut with the slight margin, it's possible the race could head into a recount.\n\nUnder Virginia state law, the losing candidate could request a recount if the final tally comes within 1 percentage point. The challenge would need to be made within 10 days of the results being certified, and the results of the recount would not be subject to appeal.\n\nIt's not clear whether either candidate would file for a recount.\n\nGood released a statement late Tuesday night to thank voters for their support despite having many of his Republican colleagues publicly campaign against him -- including former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help we were able to make this race too close to call,\" he said in a statement. \"We are doing what we can to ensure all the votes are properly counted in the coming days.\"\n\nMeanwhile, McGuire was quick to declare victory even as the race remained too close to call, telling supporters at his campaign watch party it is \"an honor to be your Republican nominee,\" according to reports.\n\nGood's reelection bid became one of the most closely watched primaries of the 2024 cycle after Trump became involved by endorsing McGuire over the GOP incumbent.\n\nTrump turned against Good because he endorsed Florida Gov.

(AP) -- One of America's most conservative congressmen was locked in a tight renomination battle against an opponent endorsed by former President Donald Trump in Virginia's primary election Tuesday\n\nRep. Bob Good, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, is seeking a third term representing Virginia's 5th Congressional District, but state Sen. John McGuire has mounted a strong challenge that highlights frictions in the party.\n\nMeanwhile, in House District 10, voters chose Suhas Subramanyam from a field of 12 Democrats to try to hold the seat held by U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, who is not seeking reelection to her northern Virginia seat after being diagnosed with a rare, incurable neurological illness.\n\nIn House District 7, voters chose Eugene Vindman in a crowded Democratic primary to try to hold the seat being vacated by U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a popular incumbent who is running for governor in 2025.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But he earned the wrath of Trump when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president. He switched back to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but Trump is endorsing McGuire and portraying Good as a backstabber.\n\nTrump continued to bash Good as he campaigned for McGuire in a telephone rally Monday night.\n\n\"Unlike Bob Good, John McGuire will not let you down,\" Trump said, adding that McGuire is \"strong on the border\" and \"will always defend your under-siege Second Amendment.\"\n\nGood, for his part, says he considers Trump the best president in his lifetime and only endorsed DeSantis because Trump is constitutionally limited to only one more term.\n\nGood also alienated Republican insiders by voting to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, throwing the party into a measure of chaos.\n\nSeeking to capitalize is McGuire, a state legislator and former Navy SEAL who has echoed Trump's attacks on Good, calling him a \"never Trumper.\"\n\nGood has bashed McGuire as a serial campaigner who announced his congressional bid just one week after winning election to a four-year term in the state Senate.\n\nIf Good loses, he would be the first House incumbent to go down to a primary challenge this year, with the exception of one race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\nThe winner will face Democrat Gloria Tinsley Witt, who defeated Gary Terry and Paul Riley.\n\nThe 5th Congressional District stretches from Charlottesville in the north, past the far western suburbs of Richmond, through Lynchburg and down to Danville and the North Carolina border.\n\nHouse District 7\n\nVindman, a political newcomer who was nonetheless familiar to voters for his role in Trump's first impeachment, has won the Democratic nomination in the 7th Congressional District for what will be a closely watched congressional seat in November.\n\nVindman, who crushed his opponents in fundraising, won in a crowded seven-person field that included four women of color who were all current or former officeholders in Prince William County, a suburban area outside the nation's capital that constitutes the largest portion of the district.\n\nThe former Army officer gained a measure of fame when he and his twin brother, Alex, reported their concerns about Trump's 2019 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which Trump sought an investigation of Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nVindman highlighted his opposition to Trump in his campaign and in a victory statement issued Tuesday evening said \"our grass-roots movement is coming for the extreme MAGA agenda. Virginia voters are first and foremost values driven, and want to elect leaders with integrity who preserve fundamental rights and freedoms and not extremists.\"\n\nHe faced criticism from some local officials who said he was unconnected to the region's political dynamics.\n\nIn a battle between a former Army Green Beret and a former Navy SEAL, Republican voters chose the Army man, Derrick Anderson, over Navy veteran Cameron Hamilton.\n\nAnderson and Hamilton were the top two fundraisers in a six-person field. Anderson drew support from House GOP leadership in Washington, while Hamilton had support from members of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe district, which stretches from Prince William County south to Fredericksburg and west past Culpeper, tilts just slightly toward Democrats.\n\nHouse District 10\n\nSubramanyam defeated fellow Democratic candidates former Virginia House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, state Sens. Dan Helmer and Jennifer Boysko, and former Virginia Education Secretary Atif Qarni. Wexton endorsed Subramanyam.\n\nRepublican voters chose Mike Clancy from a field of four candidates.\n\nHouse District 2\n\nIn Virginia's coastal 2nd Congressional District, Missy Cotter Smasal, a Navy veteran who runs a nonprofit that honors fallen servicewomen, defeated Jeremiah \"Jake\" Denton IV, a constitutional law and civil rights attorney, in the Democratic primary.\n\nShe'll face Republican U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans in November.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday evening, Smasal took aim at Kiggans and \"the MAGA extremism she supports in Congress.\"\n\n\"I will protect abortion rights and access for all and fight for resources for veterans and military families,\" Smasal said. \"I will always defend democracy and reject party extremism.\"\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nIn the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, Navy veteran Cao prevailed over his four opponents for a chance to try to unseat Kaine, a Democrat who is seeking his third term as the state's junior U.S. senator.\n\nCao had the most money and previous campaign experience running for higher officer among the Republican primary contenders. He also had Trump's endorsement.\n\nIn a victory post on Facebook, Cao immediately criticized President Joe Biden's decision on Tuesday to allow certain U.S. citizens' spouses without legal status to apply eventually for citizenship.\n\n\"Tomorrow, we begin our campaign to save the country that saved my life,\" Cao stated. \"I spent twenty-five years in the Navy, while Tim Kaine spent thirty years in elected office.\"\n\nCao defeated Scott Parkinson, a former congressional staffer for DeSantis, as well as Jonathan Emord, an author and lawyer who often cites his court battles against the Food and Drug Administration. The other Republican candidates were Eddie Garcia, a U.S. Army veteran who owns a mobile app that serves veterans, and Chuck Smith, a former Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps commander and an attorney.\n\nFinley contributed to this report from Norfolk.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The outcome of this race will likely determine the GOP candidate in a strongly Republican-leaning district in Virginia. This primary has ignited intra-party tensions, primarily due to Good's actions against moderate Republicans and his prior endorsement of Ron DeSantis.\n\nU.S. Representative Bob Good, the leader of a bloc of hardline House Republicans, faces off on Tuesday against a primary challenger backed by both Donald Trump and a key group of moderate Republicans.\n\nThe winner of the contest between the House Freedom Caucus chair and former Navy SEAL John McGuire is expected to easily carry the strongly Republican-leaning southern Virginia district in the Nov. 5 election, when control of the White House and both chambers of Congress will be up for grabs. Good angered former President Trump by endorsing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in his Republican presidential primary campaign against Trump, switching his endorsement to Trump only after DeSantis dropped out.\n\nGood also ignited the ire of moderate Republicans after he voted to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy from his role in October, launching weeks of chaos and bitter, highly public infighting as Republicans attempted to coalesce around a replacement. Trump endorsed Good's challenger McGuire, a Virginia state senator, in a May social media post. Defending Main Street, the super PAC affiliated with the moderate Republican Main Street Caucus, has spent $600,000 on ads to defeat Good.\n\n\"He's a Republican in name only,\" Sarah Chamberlain, CEO of the Republican Main Street Partnership, the nonprofit organization affiliated with the caucus, said. The group does not normally work to oust incumbents, she said, calling Good \"a unique situation\" after he campaigned against moderate Republican colleagues in their primaries and voted against Republican bills on the House floor. Following Trump's endorsement of McGuire, Good said in a statement, \"I have never been the choice of political power brokers in Washington.\"\n\nDEMOCRATS NOMINATE CANDIDATES Virginia Democrats and Republicans will also pick candidates on Tuesday to vie for the seats currently held by Democratic U.S. Representatives Jennifer Wexton and Abigail Spanberger, both elected in 2018 when their party won control of the House for the second half of Trump's term.\n\nThe districts could also play an important role in Democrats' efforts to win back a House majority in November. In Virginia's 7th district, Eugene Vindman, the brother of Alexander Vindman, who played an important role in Trump's first impeachment, is seeking the Democratic nomination for Spanberger's seat, which she is leaving to run for governor.\n\nDerrick Anderson, a former Green Beret, and Cameron Hamilton, a former NAVY Seal, are jostling for the Republican nomination in the competitive district where many military families live. In Virginia's 10th district, Democratic candidates seeking to succeed the retiring Wexton include state Representative Dan Helmer, state Senator Suhas Subramanyam and Eileen Filler-Corn, former speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates. The winner of Tuesday's primary is strongly favored to win the heavily Democratic district in November.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

Before joining Raw Story, he wrote for Shareblue and AlterNet, specializing in election and policy coverage.\n\nWith just 400 votes separating them, a Trump-backed challenger declared victory late Tuesday over incumbent Republican Bob Good in Virginia's contentious 5th District primary, a race marked by Trump's fierce denunciations and accusations of backstabbing against Good.\n\nThe race gained national attention in recent days when Good, the chair of the incendiary House Freedom Caucus, found himself in the crosshairs of a formidable enemy: former President Donald Trump. Trump openly asked Good after he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' ill-fated rival 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n\"John is running against Bob Good, who is actually bad for Virginia, and who will stab you in the back like he did me,\" Trump said in the video ahead of the primary.\"\n\nFar-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) also jumped into the race, urging other members of the Freedom Caucus to oppose Good as well. According to Greene, Good was likely to stab them in the back \"just like he did with President Trump.\"\n\nAs of midnight Tuesday, McGuire, a state lawmaker and accused Jan. 6 attendee, held a lead by the slimmest of margins. With about 94 percent of the votes tallied, McGuire earned 31,411 votes -- about 50.26 percent -- to Good's 31,084 votes, or 49.74 percent.\n\nVideo posted online by reporter Reese Gorman showed McGuire pumping his fist and beginning a \"hooyah\" chant with his supporters.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, the votes are in and the people have spoken,\" McGuire began. \"It is an honor to be your Republican nominee ... [inaudible].\"\n\nGood, meanwhile, did not concede defeat as of midnight.\n\n\"Right now, we're still waiting on the final election results of today's Primary,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"As we wait, I wanted to thank you for your support thus far. You made sure your vote was cast.\"\n\nGood thanked his staff and volunteers -- \"several of you had tough conversations to ensure people knew the truth about this race\" -- as well as poll workers. He also blasted what he called the \"entire DC Swamp,\" which he said was aligned against his campaign and supplied more than $10 million in attack ads.\n\n\"No matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right. Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now,\" Good said.\n\nEven before Trump handed down his endorsement of McGuire, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) already signaled he was unlikely to commit resources to defending Good in his primary.\n\nVirginia's 5th District is a right-leaning constituency in the central and southern parts of the state, which also includes the heavily blue community of Charlottesville.\n\nALSO READ: Neuroscientist explains how Trump and Biden's cognitive impairments are different\n\nWhile its boundaries and partisan composition have varied somewhat over the years, the district centered here hasn't elected a Democrat in a congressional contest since 2008. However, one Republican elected in this district during that time, Rep. Denver Riggleman, became an outspoken Trump opponent and helped the House Select Committee on Jan. 6 conduct its investigation.\n\nBoth Good and McGuire spent the campaign trying to prove their Trump bona fides to voters, with the two traveling to Manhattan during the former president's criminal trial to denounce the proceedings.\n\nHowever, in the final days of the campaign, Trump officials slapped Good with a cease-and-desist order for using Trump's campaign symbols on his own yard signs, implying an endorsement. Asked for comment, Good dismissed Trump's opposition, calling it a \"stupid topic.\"", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Bob Good, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, attempted to fend off a challenge from state Sen. John McGuire, whom former President Donald Trump has endorsed. Early Wednesday morning, the Associated Press had McGuire up by fewer than 400 votes with 98 percent counted, noting that Virginia observes the Juneteenth federal holiday, meaning the state's poll workers are not likely to count votes. The Virginia Public Access Project, which also shows election results in the state, said that the result of the race probably will not be official until Friday, given that officials have yet to count provisional ballots and eligible mail-in votes that will arrive between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nNevertheless, McGuire declared victory at his campaign's watch party late Tuesday night, saying it is \"an honor to be your Republican nominee.\" Meanwhile, Good's campaign said around the same time that it was still awaiting the final count. \"We implemented the best early voting operation that the 5th District has ever seen, and we are still waiting for the results of mail-in ballots and provisional ballots,\" the campaign posted on X, also telling supporters: \"No matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right.\" In a later post, the campaign said it believed it can \"still prevail.\"\n\nThe campaign in the district-which encompasses a vast area stretching from Charlottesville to Lynchburg to Danville-perhaps best illustrates the strange alliances in the GOP's Trump era.\n\nIn the lead-up to Tuesday's primary, Trump endorsed McGuire, in large part because Good backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis instead of Trump for the presidential nomination. And House leadership's support for the incumbent has been tepid. Good, who voted to eject former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy from his office last fall, has battled with Speaker Mike Johnson over such issues as aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"Mike Johnson has done nothing to help me in my race,\" Good told Politico in an interview last week. Good has, however, received support from Freedom Caucus members-including Reps. Chip Roy, Byron Donalds, and Matt Gaetz.\n\nBut McGuire, a retired Navy SEAL, has found allies across party factions. Although he earned support from some mainstream Republicans such as House Armed Services Committee Chair Rep. Mike Rogers, he also welcomed firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to his district to campaign for him earlier this month. Freedom Caucus member Rep. Warren Davidson also supported him. While there's no dedicated issues page on his campaign website, McGuire summarizes his political philosophy there as \"Pro-Life. Pro-Gun. Pro-Trump,\" and the site features prominently the Truth Social post in which Trump endorsed him.\n\nElsewhere in Virginia, the Republican primary in the state's 7th Congressional District saw the Johnson-endorsed Derrick Anderson defeat Cameron Hamilton-who touted the support of Good, as well as other Freedom Caucus members, including Reps. Chip Roy and Byron Donalds-by almost 9 points.\n\nAs Dispatch Politicspreviously reported, Anderson and Hamilton, both veterans, fought for the GOP nomination to replace Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who will retire at the end of her third term to run for governor. The swing district is one of the top targets for Republicans this cycle, and the GOP has become more bullish about its chances without Spanberger on the ballot.\n\nIn Oklahoma, Rep. Tom Cole, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, handily defeated deep-pocketed right-wing challenger Paul Bondar and three other challengers in the state's 5th Congressional District. The Trump-endorsed Cole toldDispatch Politics last week that he felt comfortable about his prospects leading up to the primary election given that Bondar had few ties to the Oklahoma district. Still, he took the challenge seriously due to the large amount of money Bondar was able to spend.\n\nCole was one of several incumbent House Republicans to face a primary challenge from the right this cycle. Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas eked out a runoff win in late May by about 400 votes against a primary challenger who attacked him over his vote for a gun control package that President Joe Biden supported. In Iowa's primaries a week later, Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Randy Feenstra defeated their challengers by 12 points and about 20 points, respectively. Cole had little difficulty defeating his top challenger, winning by nearly 40 points.\n\nWhat's Driving Larry Hogan's Senate Run?\n\nWhy is Larry Hogan, the purest example today of a moderate Republican, running for Senate when so many like him-practical problem solvers who prefer more civil discourse-are fleeing the Trumpified GOP conferences in Congress? Our colleague John McCormack spent some time recently with the Republican nominee in Maryland, who is trying to become the first of his party to win a Senate seat from that deep-blue state since 1980. Here's an excerpt from his article on the website:\n\nAn executive at heart, Hogan had rebuffed pleas from Republicans to run for Senate for years because he said he viewed the job as \"arguing all day and getting nothing done.\" But days before Maryland's February 9 Senate filing deadline, he was in a meeting in New York City with officials from No Labels, the centrist political group that had hoped to field a presidential ticket this year. They were \"asking me to be their candidate for president, and were showing me polls and modeling and whatnot that showed we could run a pretty good race,\" Hogan said of the meeting. \"I think I started at 23 percent with Biden and Trump in the high 20s.\"\n\nThe pitch was tempting, but while he was still in New York, he received an influential call from former President George W. Bush. \"I just don't think you can win,\" Bush said of a potential No Labels presidential bid, according to Hogan. \"I think you can't get to 270 [electoral votes].\"\n\nBut the former Republican president urged Hogan to consider a bid for the Senate. \"You can make a bigger difference than you think,\" Hogan remembers Bush saying. \"I never really wanted to be a senator. I know you don't want to be one either, but I think the party needs you and the country needs you. You've got an important voice. I think it'll give you a platform for that voice.\"\n\nHogan said he doubted he could accomplish much, but Bush disagreed: \"I think you're going to be the guy in the middle of every deal. You're going to be like a Joe Manchin or a John McCain.\"\n\nBut Democrats are working hard to paint Hogan as a stooge for Trump, despite the two-term former governor being one of the more prominent Republican critics of the former president. Hogan's opposition to Trump is one big hurdle for him winning his race against the Democratic nominee, Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, since he'll need nearly every Marylander voting for Trump to also vote for him. But Hogan will also need to win over some of the Democrats and independents that helped him win two races for governor, which means highlighting some of the moderate positions he has that puts him at odds with the GOP base:\n\nOn social issues, Hogan is running as a liberal and trying hard to differentiate himself from almost all congressional Republicans by endorsing a federal bill to codify Roe v. Wade. Yet even there he has also drawn a contrast with Alsobrooks. Shortly after the primary concluded on May 14, Hogan told the New York Times he backs federal abortion legislation to codify Roe sponsored by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine but does not support the Women's Health Protection Act, legislation backed by Alsobrooks and every Senate Democrat except Joe Manchin of West Virginia, because it would prohibit even modest state limits on abortion allowed under Roe.\n\nAsked if he had any tests for Supreme Court nominees, Hogan told The Dispatch: \"I don't believe in litmus tests, but I have more experience appointing judges than anybody in the Senate.\" Hogan said that as governor, he appointed nearly 200 judges, \"including six out of the seven members of our Supreme Court. Three of them I appointed were women, two of them African American women.\"\n\n\"I took every one of [the judicial nominations] completely seriously,\" he added. \"I never asked someone to prejudge-tell me how you might decide on this future case that might come before you.\"\n\n\"Willie Mays wasn't just a singular athlete, blessed with an unmatched combination of grace, skill and power. He was also a wonderfully warm and generous person-and an inspiration to an entire generation. I'm lucky to have spent time with him over the years, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family.\"\n\nRead more at The Dispatch", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com",

We believe we can still prevail,\" the congressman said.\n\nHis primary challenger, state Sen. John McGuire, declared victory Tuesday night, though the race had not been called.\n\n\"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory,\" McGuire said in a post on X just after midnight Eastern.\n\nFormer President Trump and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) were both aligned with McGuire, and many expected the incumbent to be easily knocked out of his reelection bid for the deep-red central Virginia seat -- but the nail-biter race was still up in the air Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWith 95 percent of votes reported at the time of publication, McGuire was ahead by fewer than 400 votes. There are no automatic recounts in Virginia, though candidates can request one when there's a difference of no more than 1 percentage point.\n\nThe race has been seen as a key test of both Trump and McCarthy's influence. Trump backed McGuire after Good initially supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the Republican presidential primary, and McCarthy targeted the Virginia lawmaker after he voted to oust him from the Speakership last year.\n\nIf Good loses his seat, it will mark the first House incumbent loss to an outside challenger this cycle.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Former President Donald Trump-backed candidate John McGuire is battling incumbent Robert Good.\n\nGood, chairman of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, previously endorsed Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for the 2024 presidential Republican nomination. Good then threw his support behind Trump after DeSantis dropped out.\n\nTrump, while acknowledging Good's \"warm\" endorsement, posted to his social media platform Truth Social on Monday, saying in part, \"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA! He turned his back on our incredible Movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and \"loving\" Endorsement - But really, it was too late! The damage had been done.\"\n\nThe former president instead offered his \"complete and total endorsement\" for McGuire, a Virginia state senator and former Navy SEAL who backed the pro-Trump \"Stop the Steal\" movement following President Joe Biden's 2020 election win.\n\nAs of 11:27 p.m. Eastern time, McGuire was leading Good by less than 400 votes with 93 percent counted, according to the Associated Press. The lead had switched hands on more than one occasion earlier in the night.\n\nGood issued a statement on the race just before 11 p.m., thanking his supporters for showing \"the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right\" regardless of \"the outcome.\"\n\n\"Right now, we're still waiting on the final election results of today's Primary,\" Good said in the statement, which was shared to X, formerly Twitter. \"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help we were able to make this race too close to call.\"\n\n\"Make America Great Again\"-branded Republicans like Florida Representative Matt Gaetz and Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert, however, have thrown their support behind Good, highlighting a noticeable split within MAGA.\n\nGaetz posted to X on Monday, saying, \"It has been an honor to campaign with my friend and conservative fighter \u2066@GoodForCongress VA5 please get out and vote TODAY for Bob Good!\"\n\nBoebert also shared multiple campaign posts from Good on X in the lead-up to the election. However, the MAGA split was evident as Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene threw her weight behind McGuire.\n\n\"VA-05 polls close at 7 pm, make sure you vote for the REAL Trump endorsed candidate, John McGuire!!\" Greene posted to X on Tuesday. \"NOT Trump back stabber Bob Good! Also do you want to know the truth about Bob Good and Kevin McCarthy? Sound up! Listen to the end!\"\n\nThe election outcome remained too close to call at the time of publication. A recount is possible if the candidates are still separated by hundreds of votes or less in the final tally.\n\nRegardless of the final margin, the close finish could indicate that Trump has less sway over Republicans than some might imagine. A poll of 300 likely voters commissioned by the Virginia Faith and Freedom Coalition and conducted earlier this month indicated that McGuire had a solid 10-point lead over Good.", "source": {"uri":

John McGuire, who is backed by Trump. Trump has said that Good is \"bad for Virginia.\"\n\nGood was among the members of Congress who endorsed Fla. Gov. Ron DeSantis for president, but he later endorsed Trump after DeSantis ended his presidential campaign.\n\nMcGuire was elected to the state Senate in 2023. He narrowly outraised Good, $1.2 million to $1.1 million as of May 29, but had $520,000 on hand for the final weeks of the campaign compared to Good's $168,000.\n\nOutside groups have spent a whopping $20 million in the 5th District ahead of Tuesday's primary. House Freedom Action, the political arm of the Freedom Caucus, spent $241,000 supporting Good and $1.3 million opposing McGuire. Defending Main Street Super PAC, which is aligned with the Republican Main Street Partnership, spent $904,000 supporting McGuire. Several other groups also made independent expenditures.\n\nA handful of House Republicans have also traveled to the central Virginia district, which includes Charlottesville and stretches to the North Carolina border, to campaign for both Good and McGuire.\n\nIn Oklahoma's ruby red 4th District, Cole is facing an aggressive challenge from a deep-pocketed Republican newcomer.\n\nBusinessman Paul Bondar has loaned his campaign more than $5 million, which has funded a flood of negative ads. He says he's the real \"Trump Republican\" in the race, even though former President Donald Trump is backing Cole.\n\nBondar, who owned an Illinois-based trucking insurance company, is facing questions about his residency. He owns a home outside Dallas, holds a Texas driver's license and voted in the Texas primary on March 5, according to a report on KFOR.\n\nBondar told the Oklahoma City television station that he's building a ranch in Durant, Okla., which is outside the boundaries of the 4th District, and registered to vote in Oklahoma on April 3, according to Oklahoma Voice. While the Constitution doesn't require candidates to live within the district they are seeking to represent, it does stipulate that they must live in the state.\n\nThe race has also drawn the attention of outside groups who are backing Cole. Americans 4 Security PAC spent $6.2 million and Defending Main Street SuperPAC Inc. spent $691,000 against Bodnar. On top of that, those two groups and five others, including the National Association of Realtors and the National Rifle Association, spent another $382,000 supporting Cole.\n\nThree other Republicans - Nick Hankins, Rick Harris and Andrew Hayes - are also on the primary ballot, and to win the nomination outright a candidate has to get over 50 percent or there will be a runoff on Aug. 27. Two Democrats - Mary Brannon and Kody Macaulay - are competing in the Democratic primary.\n\nTrump won the 4th District by more than 30 percentage points in 2020.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger's decision not to run for reelection and focus on a 2025 run for governor opens up the 7th District, a swing seat that's attracted seven Democrats and six Republicans.\n\nEugene Vindman, a former National Security Council official who rose to prominence alongside his twin brother for his role in the first Trump impeachment inquiry, has put a national spotlight on the race. He raised $5 million and had $876,000 on hand as of May 29.\n\nSix other candidates are on the Democratic ballot on Tuesday, including a quartet of female state and local officials: Prince William County Supervisors Andrea Bailey and Margaret Franklin, former state Del. Elizabeth Guzman and state Del. Briana Sewell. But none of those candidates have narrowed the campaign to make it a true two-person race.\n\nOn the Republican side, two military veterans, retired Green Beret Derrick Anderson and retired Navy SEAL Cameron Hamilton, are leading a field of six candidates.\n\nAnderson, who lost a 2022 primary for the 7th District, has led the GOP in fundraising and had $422,000 on hand for the final weeks of the campaign. He's endorsed by Speaker Mike Johnson and other members of the House GOP leadership. Virginia Rep. Jen Kiggans also backed him, along with several other House Republicans.\n\nHamilton is further to the right to Anderson. He was endorsed by several members of the Freedom Caucus, including Good. Hamilton raised $722,000 and had $178,000 on hand for the campaign's final stretch.\n\nGroups spent $8.4 million on independent expenditures to support candidates in the 7th District, as of Thursday afternoon. Protect Progress and VoteVets spent a combined $2.6 million to boost Vindman and Casa in Action PAC spent $378,000 to support Guzman. The Protect Freedom Fund Political Action Committee and House Freedom Fund spent $2.5 million to support Hamilton in the Republican primary.\n\nThe seat is on both parties' radar for November. Inside Elections rates the race as Tilt Democratic.\n\nThe race to succeed Rep. Jennifer Wexton has drawn a dozen Democrats and four Republicans seeking to represent Northern Virginia's 10th District.\n\nOf the 12 Democrats in the race, state Del. Dan Helmer, state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam and former defense official Krystle Kaul all raised more than $1 million as of May 29, and former House of Delegates Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn raised $972,000. Kaul's total includes $556,000 she loaned or donated to her campaign.\n\nThe race has stayed competitive and new developments this week led to one candidate calling on another to withdraw. NOTUS reported that four members of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee accused Helmer \"of behavior that led to the local party instituting a sexual harassment policy.\" The officials, two of whom reportedly endorsed different candidates, didn't detail specific allegations against him.\n\nFiller-Corn called on Helmer to drop out of the race on Thursday, saying his behavior was \"disqualifying.\"\n\nSubramanyam was endorsed by Wexton, who is retiring after being diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy, which she has referred to as \"a kind of 'Parkinson's on steroids.'\"\n\nHelmer led the Democrats in fundraising. He had $536,000 on hand as of May 29, while Subramanyam had $286,000 and Filler-Corn had $219,000. Kaul had $43,000.\n\nOutside spending in the race reached $11 million as of Thursday. Protect Progress, a PAC with ties to the cryptocurrency industry, VoteVets and With Honor Fund II Inc., spent a combined $9.6 million to support Helmer. A group called The Impact Fund spent $1 million to support Subramanyam. The pro-Israel DMFI PAC spent $300,000 and a group called Virginians United for Progress spent $24,000 to support Filler-Corn, while Virginia Democratic Action PAC and WFP National PAC spent $375,000 opposing her. Repro Rising Virginia PAC spent $25,000 supporting state Sen. Jennifer Boysko.\n\nIn the Republican primary, attorney Mike Clancy led three opponents in fundraising. He had $111,000 on hand as of May 29. Veteran Alex Isaac had $23,000 on hand, while Marine veteran Aliscia Andrews had $27,000. Manga Anantatmula had $2,800.\n\nInside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race as Likely Democratic.\n\nBrian Jack, who served as White House political director under Trump and has his endorsement, finished first in a five-candidate field in the May 21 primary for the open seat in Georgia's 3rd District.\n\nJack got nearly 47 percent but needed more than 50 percent to win the nomination outright. So he faces a runoff Tuesday against state Sen. Mike Dugan, who got about 25 percent in the primary.\n\nJack has the fundraising advantage, raising $1.3 million for the election cycle and holding $360,000 in his campaign account on May 29, compared to $605,000 raised and $173,000 on hand for Dugan. In addition, all but $25,000 of the $835,000 spent by outside groups since the primary went to boost Jack.\n\nThe largely rural district in western Georgia is represented by Republican Drew Ferguson, who won his fourth term in 2022 with 69 percent of the vote but said in December he would not run again.", "source": {"uri": "twincities.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twin Cities"}, "authors":

Bob Good believes he can 'still prevail' in tight race against John McGuire", "body": "House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good still hopes to beat state Sen. John McGuire in Virginia's 5th Congressional District GOP primary that was too close to call as late as Wednesday.\n\nNo decisive victor emerged from the contest between Mr. Good and Mr. McGuire, but the state legislator did lead by over 300 votes. Their race spilled into the day after polls closed in Virginia and could go on for the next few weeks as the results are certified by election officials.\n\nMr. Good said on X that it has become a waiting game as officials evaluate the accuracy of the vote totals and count provisional and mail-in ballots.\n\n\"We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed,\" he said. \"We believe we can still prevail.\"\n\nVirginia law doesn't provide for an automatic recount, but a candidate can ask for one if the Election Day margin is less than 1%. No major media outlets have officially called the race.\n\nMr. McGuire's lead is less than half a percentage point, according to Decision Desk HQ, but he claimed victory Tuesday night.\n\n\"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory,\" he said in a statement. \"Folks in the 5th District can rest assured that should they elect me in November, they will have an effective fighter in Congress who will get the job done for them.\"\n\nIndeed, the victor will likely easily cruise to Washington after the Nov. 5 general election in the historically deep-red district.\n\nThough a two-term incumbent, Mr. Good has faced an uphill struggle against Mr. McGuire, who received a coveted endorsement from Donald Trump. The former president spurned Mr. Good because of his previous support of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the Republican presidential primaries, claiming the lawmaker would \"stab Virginia in the back\" if reelected.\n\nDespite all the venom from Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, he has not pointed to specific policy issues he has with Mr. Good, nor does he appear to have any personal problems with the lawmaker. But the former president did note how other House Republicans don't like Mr. Good's disruptive activity in Congress.\n\nMr. McGuire also has the financial backing of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who has spent his retirement from Congress plotting revenge against the eight lawmakers who ousted him -- a clique that Mr. Good was part of.\n\nIf Mr. McGuire wins, it will be Mr. McCarthy's best shot at getting a sliver of vengeance against Mr. Good and his co-conspirators after failing to topple Rep. Nancy Mace, South Carolina Republican, in her primary and facing a hard-to-beat Rep. Matt Gaetz, Florida Republican, in his primary in August.\n\nEven though the Virginia race isn't over, congressional supporters of Mr. McGuire sounded the victory bell for him Wednesday.\n\nRep. Ryan Zinke, Montana Republican, said on X that Virginia agreed \"that we can do better than Good,\" while Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Georgia Republican, said Mr. McGuire's victory showed \"just how toxic\" Mr. Good has been to the GOP.\n\n\"John McGuire WINS,\" Ms. Greene said on X. \"I was the first member of Congress to endorse [Mr. McGuire] because of his conservative record, his loyalty to President Trump and his service to our country.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news",

John McGuire has mounted a strong challenge that highlights frictions in the party.\n\nOn the Democratic side, voters are looking to nominate candidates who can hold open seats being vacated by popular incumbents Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton.\n\nStatewide, voters selected Hung Cao as the Republican nominee to the U.S. Senate to take on Democrat Tim Kaine.\n\nConventional politics might suggest a congressman with the conservative credentials of Good would be safe in a primary. But he earned the wrath of Trump when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president. He switched back to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but Trump is endorsing McGuire and portraying Good as a backstabber.\n\nTrump continued to bash Good as he campaigned for McGuire in a telephone rally Monday night.\n\n\"Unlike Bob Good, John McGuire will not let you down,\" Trump said, adding that McGuire is \"strong on the border\" and \"will always defend your under-siege Second Amendment.\"\n\nGood, for his part, says he considers Trump the best president in his lifetime and only endorsed DeSantis because Trump is constitutionally limited to only one more term.\n\nGood also alienated Republican insiders by voting to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, throwing the party into a measure of chaos.\n\nSeeking to capitalize is McGuire, a state legislator and former Navy SEAL who has echoed Trump's attacks on Good, calling him a \"never Trumper.\"\n\nGood has bashed McGuire as a serial campaigner who announced his congressional bid just one week after winning election to a four-year term in the state Senate.\n\nIf Good loses, he would be the first House incumbent to go down to a primary challenge this year, with the exception of one race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\nThe winner will face one of three Democrats: Gloria Tinsley Witt, Gary Terry or Paul Riley.\n\nThe 5th Congressional District stretches from Charlottesville in the north, past the far western suburbs of Richmond, through Lynchburg and down to Danville and the North Carolina border.\n\nHouse District 7\n\nSpanberger is giving up the seat in northern and central Virginia to run for governor in 2025. The district tilts just slightly blue, and seven Democrats are seeking the seat. Leading the field is political newcomer Eugene Vindman, a military veteran who gained a measure of fame for his role in Trump's first impeachment. Four current and former elected officials -- Briana Sewell, Margaret Franklin, Andrea Bailey and Elizabeth Guzman -- are also in the race.\n\nOn the Republican side, fundraising figures suggest the top two contenders are Derrick Anderson and Cameron Hamilton. Anderson is a former Army Green Beret and Hamilton is a former Navy SEAL.\n\nHouse District 10\n\nWexton is not seeking reelection to her northern Virginia seat after being diagnosed with a rare, incurable neurological illness. The race to succeed her has attracted a field of 12 Democrats and four Republicans in a district that now tilts toward Democrats.\n\nDemocratic candidates include former Virginia House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, state Sens. Dan Helmer, Suhas Subramanyam and Jennifer Boysko, and former Virginia Education Secretary Atif Qarni. Wexton has endorsed Subramanyam.\n\nRepublicans include Aliscia Andrews, who ran for the seat four years ago, and lawyer Mike Clancy.\n\nHouse District 2\n\nIn the congressional district that spans Virginia's coast, Missy Cotter Smasal and Jeremiah \"Jake\" Denton IV are competing for the Democratic nomination.\n\nSmasal is a Navy veteran who runs a nonprofit that honors fallen servicewomen. Denton is a constitutional law and civil rights attorney who comes from a military family. Connection to the armed forces is often a calling card in the 2nd District, which is home to many veterans and several military installations and is adjacent to the nation's largest Navy base in Norfolk.\n\nThe winner will take on Congresswoman Jen Kiggans, a former Navy helicopter pilot and state senator who was elected in 2022.\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nIn the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, Navy veteran Cao prevailed over his four opponents for a chance to try to unseat Kaine, a Democrat who is seeking his third term as the state's junior U.S. senator.\n\nCao had the most money and previous campaign experience running for higher officer among the Republican primary contenders. He also had Trump's endorsement.\n\nCao defeated Scott Parkinson, a former congressional staffer for Ron DeSantis, as well as Jonathan Emord, an author and lawyer who often cites his court battles against the Food and Drug Administration. The other Republican candidates were Eddie Garcia, a U.S. Army veteran who owns a mobile app that serves veterans, and Chuck Smith, a former Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps commander and an attorney.", "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brandon Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score":

Good Locked in Tight Race With Trump-Backed Challenger", "body": "LYNCHBURG, Va. -- Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.) is locked in a tight race with Trump-backed Virginia state Sen. John McGuire.\n\nMr. Good, chair of the staunchly conservative House Freedom Caucus, risks being the first House incumbent to go down to a primary challenge this year, with the exception of one race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\n\"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help we were able to make this race too close to call,\" Mr. Good wrote\n\nThe contentious primary battle has been largely defined by loyalty to former President Trump. Mr. Good had initially endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the presidential race, before flipping to the former president after the governor dropped out.\n\nFormer President Trump and Mr. McGuire, a former Navy SEAL, have cast Mr. Good as disloyal to the presumptive Republican nominee. Former President Trump, in a Truth Social post, said that despite the House Freedom Caucus chair's subsequent endorsement, \"the damage had been done.\"\n\nWhen previously asked if he regretted endorsing Mr. DeSantis, Mr. Good said \"The time for talking about previous endorsements is over.\"\n\nHe said, following a June 7 rally on the lawn in front of a courthouse in Powhatan, Virginia, that it's time to unite behind former President Trump.\n\nIn interviews with The Epoch Times outside polling places on June 18, voters explained why they voted for either Mr. McGuire or Mr. Good.\n\nJimmy, who was wearing a Make America Great Again hat and a shirt with faces of former President Trump plastered all over, said he supported Mr. McGuire simply because \"Trump endorsed him\" even though Mr. Good \"did an alright job.\"\n\nJames said he pulled the lever for Mr. McGuire even though he did not like either candidate but in the end had to pick one. He said there needs to be a change in the U.S. government. He also cited former President Trump's endorsement of Mr. McGuire.\n\nHowever, Ray said he cast his ballot for Mr. McGuire because \"he's the better choice\" and given his experience as a Navy SEAL.\n\nDavid, on the other hand, voted for Mr. Good, he said, simply \"because he's a conservative.\"\n\nKay said she cast her ballot for Mr. Good because \"of his record,\" though she did not specify which policies she appreciates.\n\nAll interviewees declined to provide their last names.\n\nWhile Mr. Good received endorsements from a dozen or so members of the House Freedom Caucus, Mr. McGuire boasted backing from some prominent Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Ala.).\n\nOne Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), supported Mr. McGuire, calling him \"conservative and effective.\"\n\nMr. Good was one of eight Republicans to join all Democrats in ousting former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) as House Speaker in October.\n\nThe seat is likely to stay in GOP hands as Mr. Good won reelection in 2022 with 57.6 percent of the vote.", "source": {"uri":

McGuire had only a 309-vote lead and the race remains too close to call - hardly the kind of blowout that a Trump-backed candidate should enjoy, especially in an area with tons of rural, deep red pockets.\n\nIt's a suprising outcome as the odds had seemed stacked against Good. Not only was Trump against him but so was former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy whose political action committee gave $10,000 to McGuire. That money was payback for Good joining Matt Gaetz and six other Republicans in kicking out McCarthy as speaker back in October.\n\nGood should have fit the MAGA mold perfectly as he resembles many of the Tea Party hellraisers who dominated the conservative wing of the House Republican conference, even before Trump came along.\n\nHe knocked off an incumbent Republican in the 2020 election, who had presided over a same-sex wedding. A year later on the House floor, Good said: \"Nearly everything that plagues our society can be attributed to a failure to follow God's law and his rules for and definition of marriage and family.\"\n\nBut Trump turned on him after he endorsed DeSantis. Good was also caught on video last year in a private conversation saying that Trump could lose to Biden.\n\nBut the Good-McGuire contest reveals that Trump cannot always decisively smite his perceived enemies, and oust them in favor of filling Republican ranks with acolytes.\n\nIt also appears that a sizeable number of people in Good's district like that he consistently holds Republican leadership to account. Far from being punished for voting against Republican bills and causing gridlock the House, Tuesday's primary shows plenty of voters want to reward his behavior by keeping him in Washington.\n\nIf Good ultimately wins the primary, he is likely to keep the House seat for Republicans in November. The non-partisan Cook Political Report rates the seat as \"Safe Republican.\"\n\nWhile that is good news for House Republicans, a Good victory would be bad news for Trump.\n\nIf Trump wins and Republicans control the House, Good will not feel the need to fall in line if he thinks he is betraying conservative values. Good has consistently voted against Republican spending bills and even in opposition to giving aid to Israel despite Republicans' mostly unwavering support.\n\nGood values fiscal responsibility and balanced budgets - traditional conservative values.\n\nIn a potential Trump administration, Good won't fall in with the former president if he thinks Trump's spending bills will bust the budget.\n\nBut the Virginia congressman is in a dwindling number - even Republicans who once complained about debt ceiling increases, like Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, now vote debt limit increases without consequence. Their fealty to Trump inoculates them from criticism. Conservatives who did care about fiscal values, and not for Trump's grandstanding or election denial like Ken Buck in Colorado and Justin Amash in Michigan, are gone.\n\nBut Good's valiant primary fight shows there is still a constituency for this type of Republican.\n\nAnd the close contest shows that a Trump endorsement is not an automatic guarantee of victory. If Good somehow pulls off a victory in Virginia, he will have considerable leverage against Trump in a potential future administration. Now, he can always say that voters in Virginia's 5th district preferred him even after Trump anointed a challenger.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

John McGuire by 326 votes, with 98% of precincts reporting in south-central Virginia's 5th District. The number of outstanding votes can tip the contest either way.\n\nA close race doesn't automatically trigger a recount in Virginia, but the losing candidate can request one if the margin is within 1%.\n\nThe race is a test of whether the chair of the ultra-conservative group of House GOP lawmakers can withstand a Donald Trump-backed challenger and opposition from allies of ex-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\n\nGood separately angered both GOP factions by endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential primary and then voting to oust McCarthy as speaker.\n\nIf Good loses, he'll be the first Republican incumbent to go down in a contested primary this cycle after a close call for Rep. Tony Gonzales, a West Texas Republican who opposed a GOP border security bill.\n\nBoth Good and McGuire hugged Trump in the primary, but Trump made it clear he was against Good. \"He would stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me,\" he told McGuire's supporters during a tele-town hall on Monday.\n\nMcGuire declared victory Tuesday night even though he was up by fewer than 350 votes and potentially in recount territory. It might be days before the race is officially called.\n\nGood, meanwhile, thanked his supporters.\n\n\"The entire DC Swamp was aligned against us with over $10 million in attack ads, but with your help we were able to make this race too close to call,\" he posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Good", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGuire_(Virginia_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McGuire (Virginia politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia's_5th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia's 5th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Gonzales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Gonzales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/5d22bb366c9fbdc25eba5294f12a9041", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661234", "eventUri": "eng-9661234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Bob Good, R-Va., speaks to supporters at his campaign rally in Louisa, Va., on Friday, June 14, 2024. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\n\nThe only thing that matters in today's GOP is unequivocally supporting, at all times, the Republican Party's three-time nominee for president amid a criminal conviction and hundreds of millions in court judgments. You can oppose abortion, support guns, demonize immigrants -- you could even back ending the American democratic project to keep the loser of an election in the White House -- and that is still not enough: To survive, one must be truly, unflinchingly devoted to one man.\n\nRep. Bob Good, R-Va., is chair of the House Freedom Caucus, a collection of some of the most far-right lawmakers ever make it to Congress. Elected in 2020, one of his first votes was to block President Joe Biden's victory in the Electoral College; one of his staffers, district director Sandy Adams, was on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol as MAGA enthusiasts bludgeoned cops with flag poles during the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nIf you think that's sufficient, you are not Donald Trump. Good, who is up for reelection today, has been expelled from the Mar-a-Lago extended universe -- not for deviating from the Republican platform or embracing \"Critical Race Theory,\" but for the crime of once thinking that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was, as conservative media once suggested, the more competent and electorally palatable heir to Trump's political fortune.\n\n\"After I won the primary he became a big fan -- that's not good enough,\" Trump said this week at a virtual rally for state Sen. John McGuire, who is running to take Good's seat in Virginia's Fifth Congressional District, The Wall Street Journal reported. Their policy positions are close enough that the only thing voters really have to go off, in terms of differentiating the two, is whether or not Trump likes them today.\n\nMcGuire, for his part, is leaning in to the cult of personality, boasting to prospective voters that he is the \"Trump Endorsed\" candidate, a fact he wears on his sleeve.\n\n\"If you look at Trump's endorsement for me, compared to all the other endorsements he's done all year, he hit Bob harder than he's hit anybody else's opponent,\" McGuire told the Journal.\n\nRicky Pritchett, a small business owner, told the paper that's enough for him: He's voting McGuire \"because Trump supports him.\" It's also enough for several of Good's own Freedom Caucus comrades.\n\n\"We need loyalists,\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene, R-Ga., explained at a rally for McGuire. Good \"kicked Trump when he was down, and went and endorsed another candidate,\" she said, per The New York Times. Can't have that.\n\nGood does still enjoy some MAGA support, with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, set to report to prison next month for defying a congressional subpoena, using his last moments of freedom before the November election to stump for the incumbent, whose district includes Charlottesville. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, is likewise claiming it is Good who is the MAGA candidate who has been \"daring to take on the swamp\"; the swamp, in this case, being the Trump-led Republican establishment.\n\nBut the lawmaker, to survive in Trump's party, has also had to fake some of his credentials. In May, the former president sent Good a cease-and-desist letter after the congressman put up yard signs with his name just below Trump's, suggesting a vote for one was a vote for the other.\n\nTrump, in a post on his Truth Social website Monday night, made clear that a vote for Good would be \"BAD FOR VIRGINIA.\"\n\nThe former president did not identify any policy disputes nor any issues of character. Rather, he said, Good was \"fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement - But really, it was too late!\"\n\nWhoever wins Tuesday's battle will be on the ballot in November, with or without Trump's support in a district that hasn't been won by a Democrat since 2008.

Defending Main Street, the super PAC affiliated with the moderate Republican Main Street Caucus, has spent $600,000 on ads to defeat Good.\n\n\"He's a Republican in name only,\" Sarah Chamberlain, CEO of the Republican Main Street Partnership, the nonprofit organization affiliated with the caucus, said. The group does not normally work to oust incumbents, she said, calling Good \"a unique situation\" after he campaigned against moderate Republican colleagues in their primaries and voted against Republican bills on the House floor.\n\nFollowing Trump's endorsement of McGuire, Good said in a statement, \"I have never been the choice of political power brokers in Washington.\"\n\nDEMOCRATS NOMINATE CANDIDATES\n\nVirginia Democrats and Republicans will also pick candidates on Tuesday to vie for the seats currently held by Democratic U.S. Representatives Jennifer Wexton and Abigail Spanberger, both elected in 2018 when their party won control of the House for the second half of Trump's term.\n\nThe districts could also play an important role in Democrats' efforts to win back a House majority in November.\n\nIn Virginia's 7th district, Eugene Vindman, the brother of Alexander Vindman, who played an important role in Trump's first impeachment, is seeking the Democratic nomination for Spanberger's seat, which she is leaving to run for governor.\n\nDerrick Anderson, a former Green Beret, and Cameron Hamilton, a former NAVY Seal, are jostling for the Republican nomination in the competitive district where many military families live.\n\nIn Virginia's 10th district, Democratic candidates seeking to succeed the retiring Wexton include state Representative Dan Helmer, state Senator Suhas Subramanyam and Eileen Filler-Corn, former speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates. The winner of Tuesday's primary is strongly favored to win the heavily Democratic district in November.\n\nReporting by Moira Warburton in Washington, editing by Deepa Babington", "source": {"uri":

Bob Good (R-Virginia) -- one of the most influential members of the House of Representatives' Republican majority -- is in the fight of his life, with his primary election still too close to call.\n\nAccording to longtime Capitol Hill journalist Jamie Dupree, Good feels confident about his chances to maintain his seat, despite being down in a razor-thin vote count in the Republican primary for Virginia's 5th Congressional district.\n\n\"We believe we can still prevail,\" Good told Dupree, adding that the Virginia Republican was roughly 300 votes behind his opponent, Republican state senator John McGuire, who has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nREAD MORE: Why these 3 MAGA Republicans are backing far-right Freedom Caucus chair's opponent\n\nEven though Good's Republican credentials are not in dispute, given that he chairs the far-right House Freedom Caucus, he's nonetheless found himself in an intense primary contest that could force him out of Congress after two terms. The primary challenge came after Good endorsed Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis in the 2024 GOP primary -- even before DeSantis officially launched his campaign.\n\n\"\"Governor Ron DeSantis has shown through action as Florida's chief executive that confronting hard challengers delivers effective results for every man, woman and child,\" Good said in 2023. \"That strength in the face of adversity is needed more today than ever before, and it is why I am unequivocally endorsing and encouraging Governor DeSantis to run for president.\"\n\nWhile Good has since endorsed Trump after DeSantis' early exit, Trump still threw his weight behind McGuire's candidacy. Notably, the former president launched an attack on Good after the Freedom Caucus chairman traveled to Manhattan to defend Trump outside of the New York courthouse during his first criminal trial.\n\n\"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"He turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement - But really, it was too late. The damage had been done!\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'Bad for the USA': Trump unleashes on top GOP rep who defended him outside courthouse\n\nWith more than 95% of ballots counted, the New York Times has McGuire slightly ahead of Good by 321 total votes as of 1:20 PM Eastern Time. Whomever ends up winning the primary will face off against Democrat Gloria Witt in November. Republicans outnumber Democrats in the district, however, with the GOP primary drawing more than 62,000 voters in 2024 and Democrats bringing out just over 24,000.\n\nVirginia's 5th Congressional District -- which encompasses roughly two dozen counties in a swath of central Virginia between Roanoke and Richmond -- is mostly rural. The last time a Democrat held the district was Tom Perriello, who held it for just one term between 2009 and 2011.\n\nShould the thin margin remain until all ballots are counted, it would likely trigger an automatic recount, meaning the winner of the primary may not be known for several more weeks.", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors":

John McGuire in the race after Good angered Trump and his allies by supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the presidential primaries. Good has since backed Trump, but it was not enough to stop him from jumping into the race. Trump held a tele-rally for McGuire on Monday evening and appeared in a 15-second TV ad on his behalf.\n\nGood also drew the ire of McCarthy, R-Calif., as one of eight Republicans who voted to oust him as speaker last year, and the race might be McCarthy's best shot to defeat one of his detractors. GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina defeated a McCarthy-backed primary challenger last week. And just two other detractors -- Reps. Eli Crane of Arizona and Matt Gaetz of Florida -- face challengers in their coming primaries.\n\nOutside groups tied to McCarthy's allies have spent millions of dollars on ads against Good, who has also had support on the airwaves from groups tied to the conservative Club for Growth Action, the House Freedom Caucus and GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\nGood and his supporters have framed the race as a fight between the \"D.C. establishment swamp\" and the hard-right Freedom Caucus. McGuire, meanwhile, has tied himself to Trump after he attended the \"Stop the Steal\" rally and walked to the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nIn Oklahoma, GOP Rep. Tom Cole faces a primary challenger in the ruby-red 4th District from businessman Paul Bondar, who has spent millions of dollars of his own money on the race. Cole, who leads the powerful Appropriations Committee, has faced criticism from his right flank for his role in government spending.\n\nCole and his allies have targeted Bondar's loose ties to the state, accusing him of actually being a Texan, a problematic charge given the bitter rivalry between the Texas Longhorns and the Oklahoma Sooners. Bondar, who recently voted in Texas' March primaries, does own property in Oklahoma, but it is outside the 4th District.\n\nCole has Trump's endorsement, which he recently told NBC News has been \"enormously helpful.\" Cole's challenge is not just fending off Bondar but also winning more than 50% of the primary vote to avoid a Aug. 27 runoff.\n\nSetting up key general election races\n\nVirginia is also home to a handful of primaries that will set the stage for key elections this fall that could help determine which party controls the House.\n\nThe 7th District, which Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger is vacating ahead of her bid for governor next year, is hosting expensive primaries on both sides of the aisle. Democrats most likely still have the edge in the district going into November, but Republicans have a new opportunity now that Spanberger is leaving the seat open.\n\nOn the Democratic side, retired Army Col. Yevgeny \"Eugene\" Vindman's role in Trump's first impeachment has helped provide a financial windfall for his campaign.\n\nVindman, who was fired from his job in the Trump White House after he raised concerns about Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has raised more than $5 million for his bid and spent $2.2 million on ads, more than any other candidate or outside group in the race. Two outside groups have also spent more than $1 million to boost him.\n\nBut while Vindman has the cash advantage, he is running as a first-time candidate in a crowded field that includes experienced politicians -- including Prince William County Supervisors Andrea Bailey and Margaret Franklin, state Del. Briana Sewell and former state Del. Elizabeth Guzman. There are no runoffs in Virginia, so the winning candidate could end up well below a majority of the vote.\n\nOn the GOP side, Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret, and Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL, have been the top fundraisers ahead of the primary in another clash between the establishment and insurgent wings of the GOP.\n\nOn Monday, Anderson posted a video of House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., supporting him, while Hamilton posted a video framing his candidacy as a blow to the Washington establishment. American Patriots PAC, a super PAC tied to McCarthy and Republican megadonors, is spending to boost Anderson, while Protect Freedom PAC, a group affiliated with Paul, the senator from Kentucky, is aiding Hamilton.\n\nRepublicans also have a competitive primary for the Senate ahead of a tough fight against Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine. Trump is backing Hung Cao, a military veteran who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2022 and is the top GOP fundraiser in the race.\n\nCao is running against Scott Parkinson -- a longtime Republican operative who worked for DeSantis, the Republican Study Committee and the Club for Growth and has been endorsed by a handful of GOP senators, including Ted Cruz of Texas. Attorney Jonathan Emord, who has lent his campaign more than $400,000 and is endorsed by former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, is also running.\n\nTwo other Democratic House primaries will tee up potential competitive general elections against Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans and in the suburban Washington district being vacated by Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton.\n\nIn the race to face off against Kiggans, military veteran Missy Cotter Smasal is the front-runner on the Democratic side, sporting the endorsement of Gov. Ralph Northam, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and every Democratic member of the U.S. House from the state. Her opponent, attorney and former journalist Jake Denton, is backed by former Rep. Glenn Nye.\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Virginia's 2nd District by a slim margin in 2020, and Democrats are already spending big to attack Kiggans. But Kiggans toppled a Democratic incumbent in 2022 and has a significant fundraising lead over her would-be opponents.\n\nIn the 10th District, Wexton, who has been diagnosed with a rare and serious condition called progressive supranuclear palsy, is not running for re-election. Democrats are favored in the fall after Biden won the district by 18 points in 2020.\n\nThe open seat has led to a crowded field of Democrats, four of whom have raised about $1 million or more: state Del. Dan Helmer, state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, former Defense Department official Krystle Kaul and former state Assembly Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn.\n\nWexton has endorsed Subramanyam, and Helmer has been both the top fundraiser and the beneficiary of about $5.5 million in TV spending from Protect Progress, a group tied to the cryptocurrency industry, and VoteVets.\n\nGeorgia: The sequel\n\nThere are also two GOP primary runoffs for House seats in Georgia, where candidates fell short of winning majorities of the votes in the May primaries.\n\nIn the 2nd District, former banker Wayne Johnson and activist Chuck Hand, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense in connection with the attack on Jan. 6, 2021, are competing head to head.\n\nThe Republican nominee will face an uphill climb against Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop in the fall.\n\nIn the conservative 3rd District, Trump's endorsement will be put to the test as his former White House political director, Brian Jack, faces state Sen. Mike Dugan in a primary runoff. The winner will be favored to win in November to replace retiring Rep. Drew Ferguson.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_kamisar@aol.com", "name": "Ben Kamisar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri":

Bob Good (R-VA) in Virginia's Fifth Congressional District Republican primary, but the race remains too close to call two days after polls closed.\n\nAs of Thursday at 12:30 p.m. ET, McGuire had 31,342 votes (50.26 percent) against the House Freedom Caucus chairman, who had 31,113 votes (49.74 percent), according to the New York Times's unofficial results. More than 95 percent of the vote had been counted.\n\nThe race has the potential to head for a recount, as the Hill's Mychael Schnell first observed.\n\nIf the final margin is within one percentage point, as appears possible, the losing candidate can request a recount.\n\nCommonwealth law further directs that the district pay for a recount when the margin between candidates is half a percent or less; otherwise, the petitioning candidate will bear the costs. Good's current 0.52 percent deficit teeters on this threshold.\n\nMcGuire declared victory on Tuesday night, but no major agency has called the race as of yet.\n\n\"Thank you to my family, thank you to everyone who helped out on this campaign, thank you to the people who endorsed and supported me, and thank you to Donald J. Trump for believing in me,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory.\"\n\nGood emphasized Wednesday morning that the contest is \"too close to call.\"\n\n\"We are in a period where the law provides a process for evaluating the accuracy of all the vote totals from election day to ensure everyone can have full confidence in the certified results,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"Provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are also still to be counted.\"\n\n\"We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed.

Bob Good (R-Va.) is drawing outrage on social media for his vote in March against legislation closing a loophole that allowed some minors in the state of Virginia to get married.\n\nState senator John McGuire (R), a former Navy SEAL, is currently leading the right-wing House Freedom Caucus chair by just 0.5% in a cliffhanger primary contest that is testing the influence of an endorsement from former President Donald Trump.\n\nMcGuire scored the support of Trump as retaliation for Good initially backing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) for president in the 2024 Republican primary.\n\nAccording to the Virginia Department of Elections, only 311 votes separate McGuire and Good.\n\nMcGuire has claimed victory in the race but Good has yet to concede, believing uncounted provisional and mail-in ballots could put him over the edge.\n\n\"We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed,\" Good wrote on Wednesday. \"We believe we can still prevail.\"\n\nAmid the tense primary challenge, a number of social media users highlighted a decision McGuire took in March to vote down state legislation banning child marriage.\n\nThe bill, signed into law by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) in April, goes into effect in July and makes Virginia the 12th state to completely ban child marriage. The state previously allowed for certain 16 and 17-year-olds to wed.\n\nMcGuire was the only state senator to oppose the amended bill, with the 39 other senators all voting in favor. On the House side, the bill was adopted by a closer margin of 57-40.\n\nThat vote is being highlighted by both left-wing and right-wing critics of McGuire.\n\n\"This creature thinks it's perfectly NORMAL for an eight year old to marry a fifty five year old!\" blasted one conservative X user early in June before calling for voters to back Good.\n\n\"Reminder that John McGuire voted against banning child marriage,\" wrote another self-described Trump supporter. While Good bucked Trump for president, he's otherwise been a longtime MAGA supporter.\n\nThe Daily Dot has reached out to McGuire's campaign for comment.\n\nLegislation in 2016 raised the age for marriage in Virginia to 16 in certain cases. Prior to that, 16 and 17-year-olds could marry with parental consent and children even younger than that could in the case of a pregnancy.\n\nAccording to NBC 4, 27 minors have wed in Virginia since 2019.", "source": {"uri": "dailydot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Dot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_huggins@dailydot.com", "name": "Katherine Huggins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 Republican Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Good", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGuire_(Virginia_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McGuire (Virginia politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republican_(Springfield,_Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEALs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy SEALs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Youngkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Youngkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia's_5th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia's 5th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Postal voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Dot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Dot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRC-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WRC-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://uploads.dailydot.com/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-20-at-1.16.00-PM.png?auto=compress&fm=png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661234", "eventUri": "eng-9661234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

John McGuire in the race after Good angered Trump and his allies by supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the presidential primaries. Good has since backed Trump, but it was not enough to stop him from jumping into the race. Trump held a tele-rally for McGuire on Monday evening and appeared in a 15-second TV ad on his behalf.\n\nGood also drew the ire of McCarthy, R-Calif., as one of eight Republicans who voted to oust him as speaker last year, and the race might be McCarthy's best shot to defeat one of his detractors. GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina defeated a McCarthy-backed primary challenger last week. And just two other detractors -- Reps. Eli Crane of Arizona and Matt Gaetz of Florida -- face challengers in their coming primaries.\n\nOutside groups tied to McCarthy's allies have spent millions of dollars on ads against Good, who has also had support on the airwaves from groups tied to the conservative Club for Growth Action, the House Freedom Caucus and GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\nGood and his supporters have framed the race as a fight between the \"D.C. establishment swamp\" and the hard-right Freedom Caucus. McGuire, meanwhile, has tied himself to Trump after he attended the \"Stop the Steal\" rally and walked to the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nIn Oklahoma, GOP Rep. Tom Cole faces a primary challenger in the ruby-red 4th District from businessman Paul Bondar, who has spent millions of dollars of his own money on the race. Cole, who leads the powerful Appropriations Committee, has faced criticism from his right flank for his role in government spending.\n\nCole and his allies have targeted Bondar's loose ties to the state, accusing him of actually being a Texan, a problematic charge given the bitter rivalry between the Texas Longhorns and the Oklahoma Sooners. Bondar, who recently voted in Texas' March primaries, does own property in Oklahoma, but it is outside the 4th District.\n\nCole has Trump's endorsement, which he recently told NBC News has been \"enormously helpful.\" Cole's challenge is not just fending off Bondar but also winning more than 50% of the primary vote to avoid a Aug. 27 runoff.\n\nVirginia is also home to a handful of primaries that will set the stage for key elections this fall that could help determine which party controls the House.\n\nThe 7th District, which Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger is vacating ahead of her bid for governor next year, is hosting expensive primaries on both sides of the aisle. Democrats most likely still have the edge in the district going into November, but Republicans have a new opportunity now that Spanberger is leaving the seat open.\n\nOn the Democratic side, retired Army Col. Yevgeny \"Eugene\" Vindman's role in Trump's first impeachment has helped provide a financial windfall for his campaign.\n\nVindman, who was fired from his job in the Trump White House after he raised concerns about Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has raised more than $5 million for his bid and spent $2.2 million on ads, more than any other candidate or outside group in the race. Two outside groups have also spent more than $1 million to boost him.\n\nBut while Vindman has the cash advantage, he is running as a first-time candidate in a crowded field that includes experienced politicians -- including Prince William County Supervisors Andrea Bailey and Margaret Franklin, state Del. Briana Sewell and former state Del. Elizabeth Guzman. There are no runoffs in Virginia, so the winning candidate could end up well below a majority of the vote.\n\nOn the GOP side, Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret, and Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL, have been the top fundraisers ahead of the primary in another clash between the establishment and insurgent wings of the GOP.\n\nOn Monday, Anderson posted a video of House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., supporting him, while Hamilton posted a video framing his candidacy as a blow to the Washington establishment. American Patriots PAC, a super PAC tied to McCarthy and Republican megadonors, is spending to boost Anderson, while Protect Freedom PAC, a group affiliated with Paul, the senator from Kentucky, is aiding Hamilton.\n\nRepublicans also have a competitive primary for the Senate ahead of a tough fight against Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine. Trump is backing Hung Cao, a military veteran who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2022 and is the top GOP fundraiser in the race.\n\nCao is running against Scott Parkinson -- a longtime Republican operative who worked for DeSantis, the Republican Study Committee and the Club for Growth and has been endorsed by a handful of GOP senators, including Ted Cruz of Texas. Attorney Jonathan Emord, who has lent his campaign more than $400,000 and is endorsed by former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, is also running.\n\nTwo other Democratic House primaries will tee up potential competitive general elections against Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans and in the suburban Washington district being vacated by Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton.\n\nIn the race to face off against Kiggans, military veteran Missy Cotter Smasal is the front-runner on the Democratic side, sporting the endorsement of Gov. Ralph Northam, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and every Democratic member of the U.S. House from the state. Her opponent, attorney and former journalist Jake Denton, is backed by former Rep. Glenn Nye.\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Virginia's 2nd District by a slim margin in 2020, and Democrats are already spending big to attack Kiggans. But Kiggans toppled a Democratic incumbent in 2022 and has a significant fundraising lead over her would-be opponents.\n\nIn the 10th District, Wexton, who has been diagnosed with a rare and serious condition called progressive supranuclear palsy, is not running for re-election. Democrats are favored in the fall after Biden won the district by 18 points in 2020.\n\nThe open seat has led to a crowded field of Democrats, four of whom have raised about $1 million or more: state Del. Dan Helmer, state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, former Defense Department official Krystle Kaul and former state Assembly Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn.\n\nWexton has endorsed Subramanyam, and Helmer has been both the top fundraiser and the beneficiary of about $5.5 million in TV spending from Protect Progress, a group tied to the cryptocurrency industry, and VoteVets.\n\nThere are also two GOP primary runoffs for House seats in Georgia, where candidates fell short of winning majorities of the votes in the May primaries.\n\nIn the 2nd District, former banker Wayne Johnson and activist Chuck Hand, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense in connection with the attack on Jan. 6, 2021, are competing head to head.\n\nThe Republican nominee will face an uphill climb against Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop in the fall.\n\nIn the conservative 3rd District, Trump's endorsement will be put to the test as his former White House political director, Brian Jack, faces state Sen. Mike Dugan in a primary runoff. The winner will be favored to win in November to replace retiring Rep. Drew Ferguson.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 5,

Good to Newsmax: I'm Best Choice to Help Trump Win", "body": "Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., insisted Tuesday on Newsmax that he remains the best candidate to help former President Donald Trump retake the White House, even though Trump endorsed his challenger, state Sen. John McGuire, in Virginia's primary election.\n\n\"We're absolutely going to win,\" Good, who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, told \"Wake Up America,\" as voters in his state headed to the polls. \"So we're focused on that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Good said he will do all he can to help Trump win, even though Good had endorsed Trump's primary opponent, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, early in the GOP primary.\n\n\"My opponent can't help him, not a bit in that regard,\" Good said. \"I'm one of the conservative leaders, if not the conservative leader of Virginia.\"\n\nHe added that he has to get the conservatives \"disappointed\" by Trump's endorsement of McGuire to support Trump and \"get them enthusiastic.\"\n\n\"We have no choice but to elect him,\" said Good. \"After four years of [Joe] Biden, everybody is doing worse, except the illegal aliens. ... I'll continue to support President Trump and do everything I can to help him get elected and help him win Virginia.\"\n\nGood said his team is looking forward to a \"great victory\" in Tuesday's primary election.\n\n\"Many in Washington will never understand why we won,\" said Good. \"But if you do what you say you will do, if you fight and stand for the things that Republican voters want you to fight and stand for, then they're going to vote for you.\"\n\nGood added that grassroots voters, as well as county GOP leaders, support his campaign.\n\n\"My opponent has run a Biden basement strategy where he is just relying on million-dollar ads from the people in Washington who don't want you to change the status quo,\" said Good. \"They expect something in return for the millions of dollars that they have spent trying to elect someone other than me in the 5th District.\n\n\"The people who vote opposite me in Washington are behind my opponent, but I don't think the people of the 5th District are fooled by that.\"\n\nAsked if he regrets supporting DeSantis, Good insisted that he is focused on supporting Trump, and said that \"everybody needs to come behind him.\"\n\n\"Those who ran against him are supporting him,\" Good said. \"Obviously, some are rumored to be vice presidential candidates or in his Cabinet. ... I'm not focused on a year ago.\"\n\nGood also insisted that although he supported DeSantis, he \"wasn't against\" Trump and even at that time said he would enthusiastically support him if he became the nominee.\n\n\"Now we move on to the general election,\" Good said. \"We have got to fight the battle as these crooked courts try to convict [Trump] and try to put him in jail and put him in prison.\n\n\"We have got to fight that and do everything we can to expose that. This is political persecution. It's an abuse of power.

John McGuire maintains a small lead over Rep. Bob Good, the incumbent.\n\nAlmost 24 hours after the polls closed in Virginia's 5th Congressional District, Rep. Bob Good, R-Campbell County, remained locked in a tight renomination contest against a primary challenger endorsed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nAs of 5 p.m. Wednesday, Good had managed to slightly close the gap between himself and state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland County, to 309 votes out of a total of 62,445 votes cast, putting the incumbent just at the 0.5% margin that would qualify his campaign to request a recount paid for by the state.\n\nMcGuire, who was endorsed by Trump last month and who had made his campaign a referendum on which candidate is a more loyal supporter of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, ended Tuesday night up by 327 votes -- a margin of 0.52%, which prompted him to declare victory just after 11:30 p.m.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, the votes are in and the people have spoken, and it is your honor to be your Republican nominee,\" McGuire said after taking the stage at his election night celebration at the Virginian Hotel in Lynchburg, his opponent's home turf.\n\nMinutes later, his campaign fired off a press release formally claiming victory once again.\n\n\"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory,\" the statement attributed to McGuire said. \"Folks in the 5th District can rest assured that should they elect me in November, they will have an effective fighter in Congress who will get the job done for them. I look forward to working with Trump to beat Joe Biden in November and pass Trump's agenda in Congress. Trump and McGuire will Make America Great Again!\"\n\nWhile McGuire's move may have been premature, Good did not respond to it on Tuesday. Instead, he ducked out of his election night party at La Villa Italian Restaurant in Lynchburg before midnight without addressing his supporters or speaking to reporters gathered there.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Wednesday morning, Good -- who chairs the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus -- maintained that the race was still too close to call and that the electoral process needed to run its course.\n\n\"We are in a period where the law provides a process for evaluating the accuracy of all the vote totals from election day to ensure everyone can have full confidence in the certified results,\" Good said. \"Provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are also still to be counted. We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed. We believe we can still prevail.\"\n\nDiana Shores, Good's campaign manager, said in a text message that while the canvassing started Wednesday, it would take days to complete: \"Mail-in ballots must arrive at the registrars' by Friday, so there are mail-in ballots out. Provisional ballots are being reviewed as well.\"\n\nWhen asked at what point Good would concede the election to McGuire, Shores didn't respond directly. \"We are ensuring that all the votes properly cast are counted,\" she said.\n\nFor candidates running for public office with an end date in mind, having to wait for the results is a frustrating experience, said Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery County, who defeated Democrat Lily Franklin in one of the most competitive House of Delegates races west of Richmond last year.\n\n\"Every candidate hopes that Election Day is the culmination of their hard work, and it's tough when that end date gets extended after you worked so hard to get there. None of us like to sit around and wait for something that is out of our hands, because at that point all the votes have been cast,\" said Obenshain, who finalized his victory over Franklin in a very close contest after an additional six days of ballot tabulations.\n\nWhile Franklin managed to close the gap significantly -- from a margin of 943 down to 183 votes, according to data from the Virginia Department of Elections -- it wasn't enough to push her over the edge. With all votes in, Obenshain topped Franklin with 50.31% to 49.57%.\n\nWhile waiting for the ballots to be counted, he tried to go about his normal life, Obenshain said in a phone interview Wednesday.\n\n\"I went back to work the next day, and I was working that whole week. But you also have your campaign staff and people who are monitoring everything, and obviously as a candidate you are doing that as well.\"\n\nBut when it's just a matter of counting additional ballots, there's not a lot a candidate can do, Obenshain added.\n\n\"You typically want to keep an eye on the process and make sure that this is being done correctly, and that you have your people on the ground making sure that the provisional ballots are being counted correctly, as well as the absentee ballots that are coming in late, and that all these processes that we have to ensure that the integrity of the election are being followed.\"\n\nMiles Coleman, the associate editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said in an email Wednesday that it does seem like the Good campaign thinks it can still pull ahead.\n\n\"Whether they actually can is of course very up in the air, because mail-in votes will account for much of what's outstanding, and McGuire has carried the mail-ins that have already been counted,\" he said.\n\nWhile McGuire may end up being right, one could certainly argue that his declaration of victory on Election Day was premature, Coleman added.\n\n\"The cynical take would probably be that he did that intentionally, in order to lay the groundwork for any 'fraud' claims that would arise if the result is reversed, and those claims are something that the MAGA faithful eat up, even if their guy comes out on top. And it's unfortunate, considering election workers have had such a challenging stretch in the Trump era,\" Coleman said, referring to Buckingham County, where elections director Lindsey Taylor and her staff quit last year after years of unfounded accusations of wrongdoing and treason by county residents stemming from the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGood, who is seeking a third term in Congress, antagonized Trump last year by initially endorsing his presidential primary opponent, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Trump then attacked Good, whom he had once endorsed, too, by backing McGuire's primary challenge.\n\n\"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me,\" Trump said at a tele-rally for McGuire on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "cardinalnews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cardinal News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "markus_schmidt@cardinalnews.org", "name":

Schapiro\n\nFor a politician with a lot of enemies, U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Virginia, still has a lot of friends.\n\nBarely trailing for renomination in the heavily rural, deep-red 5th District, Good was viewed by some handicappers as a goner after former President Donald Trump endorsed his opponent in Tuesday's primary, state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland.\n\nTrump made the endorsement -- it was revenge for Good supporting Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination -- as the Virginian faced a torrent of attack ads tied to another pol who had it out for Good: former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nOperating through an allied political action committee, McCarthy retaliated against Good for scheming with other uber conservatives to topple the Californian as speaker last year, viewing him as too cozy with the House's Democratic minority.\n\nPeople are also reading...

'There's desire and interest and intention there.' Hanover considers ending membership with Virginia School Boards Association Henrico takes first step to fixing troubled apartment community\n\nBut Good proved durable -- testimony to four years of incumbency, a voter base in the district's more populated areas, his own big-name supporters, including Trump whisperer Steve Bannon, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, and, fellow House Freedom Caucus member Matt Gaetz, R-Florida.\n\nSchapiro: Secondary factors defining primary day\n\nAlso, because Good and McGuire share constituents through overlapping congressional and legislative districts, some may have voted to keep the two in their current offices. Perhaps, too, there were crossover votes from Democrats eager to humiliate Trump by sinking McGuire.\n\nGood, current chairman of the Freedom Caucus, rolled up big margins -- 16 percentage points and 10 percentage points, respectively -- in Lynchburg and Albemarle County, both localities that are not without consequential numbers of Democrats.\n\nBut these are also jurisdictions carried in the March Republican presidential primary by Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor. Her voters likely turned out for Good, but their numbers -- at least in Albemarle -- were about half what they were three months ago.\n\nLynchburg, beset by GOP infighting that may have diminished Good's vote, is home to Jerry Falwell-founded Liberty University, where Good worked before his election to Congress four years ago, when he defeated for renomination Trump-endorsed Denver Riggleman.\n\nAlbemarle was once a Republican stronghold, producing George Allen, a former state legislator who would become governor and a U.S. senator. Good also won the deep-blue college town of Charlottesville by 14 percentage points, but turnout there was skimpy.\n\nAnother city with its share of Democrats and comparable in size to Charlottesville, Danville -- just above the Virginia-North Carolina line and in a region Good's represented from the start -- saw a bigger turnout than Charlottesville and favored McGuire by 24 percentage points.\n\nThat was more than enough to put this race away for McGuire.\n\nSchapiro: Mayoral election emerging as a marathon\n\nThe rap on Good was that he was a product of a closed system, the members-only convention during the 2020 pandemic attended by 2,400 activists. Good showed broad strength in the primary, battling to a near-tie with McGuire in balloting in which 62,426 people showed up.\n\nDown by about 300 votes -- that's within the 0.5 percentage point spread for a state-paid recount -- Good has yet to concede. Nor is he signaling he's done with politics. That may explain speculation on social media Good might seek the GOP lieutenant governor's nomination in 2025.\n\nTrump figured prominently in two other nomination fights -- one in each party.\n\nTrump's pre-primary endorsement of Hung Cao, who emerged from a five-candidate field to win the Republican U.S. Senate nomination and a shot at two-term incumbent Tim Kaine, was clearly decisive, affixing to Cao notoriety beyond his Northern Virginia base.\n\nIt was in the Washington, D.C., suburbs that Cao ran -- and lost -- for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2020, falling to Democratic incumbent Jennifer Wexton, who is retiring this year after three terms because of advanced Parkinson's disease.\n\nResidual good will among Republicans from the 10th District contest, paired with the statewide profile generated by the Trump endorsement, lifted Cao -- a Vietnamese immigrant and retired U.S. Navy officer -- to nearly 62% of the Senate primary vote.\n\nAs J. Miles Coleman of the University of Virginia Center for Politics put it, the Trump endorsement -- it came in late May, well into the 45-day early voting period -- \"may have bumped (Cao) up from being just a favorite to a landslide winner.\"\n\nTurnout presumably might have been higher in 2024, it being a presidential year and Trump having made the Senate contest about himself.\n\nIn another Northern Virginia-anchored district, the 7th -- open because three-term Democrat Abigail Spanberger is retiring to run for governor in 2025 -- Democrats chose as their nominee a political newcomer who became a celebrity of sorts having publicly crossed Trump.\n\nEugene Vindman is a retired U.S. Army officer and former aide in the National Security Council, who -- with his twin brother, also an intelligence expert -- blew the whistle on Trump's attempt to pressure Ukraine ahead of the 2020 election to dig up dirt on then-Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nSchapiro: Rao row -- or tale of the faulty tower\n\nThe episode led to Trump's first impeachment by the House, though he was not convicted and removed from the presidency by the Senate. The Vindmans were fired from their government positions, apparently in retaliation by Trump.\n\nAs a consequence -- at least within Democratic circles -- Eugene Vindman emerged as a small-bore movie star who loomed over a seven-candidate field and raised more than $5 million, a total surpassing that of the other prospects combined.\n\nVindman pulled 49% of the vote, compared to 45% for his Republican opponent, Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret. Their vote totals were each roughly 16,000 but there were slightly more ballots -- about 1,600 -- cast in the six-candidate Republican primary.\n\nThat may augur a competitive general election, though Vindman could get a big boost from the anchor of the 7th District, majority-nonwhite Prince William County. In recent statewide and presidential races, it has favored Democrats over Republicans, roughly 60% to 40%.\n\nThe Democratic primary in the 10th District recalled an enduring feature of Northern Virginia: traffic congestion. There were 12 candidates seeking the nomination to succeed Wexton, a former state senator and prosecutor from Loudoun County. Republicans had four candidates.\n\nThe winner on the Democratic side also reflects the Washington suburbs as the modern melting pot. Suhas Subramanyam, a freshman state senator and Texas native born to Indian parents, represents Loudoun in the General Assembly.\n\nHe'll face Republican Mike Clancy, a tech executive and lawyer also from Loudoun County, which became ground zero in GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin's crusade against supposed woke-ism in public education.\n\nThe heart of the Democratic-trending 10th District, Loudoun -- demographically -- mirrors Virginia. Roughly 42% of the county and state are Black, Hispanic or Asian. This diversity has fueled the Democrats' strength and likely gave Subramanyam a lift in Loudoun.\n\nBut so, too, did Wexton's endorsement of Subramanyam. It was an acknowledgment of Loudoun as an emblem of the New Virginia. Subramanyam, who was a technology aide in the Obama White House, is first Indian-American to win a congressional primary in Virginia.\n\nSubramanyam turned back the first woman and Jewish person to become Virginia House Speaker, Eileen Filler-Corn; one of the delegates, Dan Helmer, who hatched the successful coup to remove her as Democratic leader, and another senator, Jennifer Boysko. All are from Fairfax.\n\nMore than 40,000 votes were cast in the Democratic primary; just over 20,000 in the Republican contest.\n\nThat may signal that Subramanyam, like Bob Good, has a lot of friends.\n\nBut unlike Good, Subramanyam, looks to be a winner.\n\nPHOTOS: Primary voting in the Richmond area\n\nJeff E.

John McGuire, R-Goochland, the push he needed to eke out what's now a tiny lead, political scientists say.\n\nBut the big question is what McGuire's current 315 vote, 0.5 percentage point margin signifies about the influence of an endorsement from the former president .\n\n\"Why did Good make it so close, and perhaps even prevail despite Trump's severe attacks?\" said John McGlennon, a College of William and Mary political scientist.\n\nLocal electoral boards must still complete their work of checking and doubling checking Tuesday night's preliminary tallies and count the final mail-in and provisional ballots.\n\nPeople are also reading...

'There's desire and interest and intention there.' Hanover considers ending membership with Virginia School Boards Association Good, McGuire primary in 5th District too close to call Henrico takes first step to fixing troubled apartment community\n\nThe 0.5 percentage point gap between McGuire's vote and Good's opens the path to a recount, once the boards certify results.\n\nIn a way, the question of Trump's influence comes down to 5th District voters' strong feelings about Washington, government officials and outsiders telling them what to do.\n\n\"It's useful to recognize that for many MAGA voters, Trump's appeal is his willingness to stick it to the establishment,\" McGlennon said.\n\n\"In this race, ironically, the incumbent could proudly point to the Republican establishment's attacks as a sign that he's even more Trump than Trump. Good has that grassroots support that rejects all the party leaders and elected officials ganging up on him because he won't play their game,\" he said.\n\nElections Cao wins GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, will take on Kaine From staff reports\n\nDuring the campaign, Good made a point of noting that groups close to former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy had supported McGuire.\n\n\"Even Marjorie Taylor Greene became part of the establishment. Look at the lack of turnout for McGuire and Greene on their two-day blitz,\" McGlennon said.\n\nStill, it was Trump who swung the election for McGuire, said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington.\n\n\"If the former president had not weighed in against Good, the incumbent would have been renominated in a walk. His combative brand of conservatism fits well with the preferences of Republican primary voters in the district. Of course, so too do McGuire's views, and he had the advantage of a vigorous Trump endorsement,\" Farnsworth said.\n\n\"Trump personalizes politics at every opportunity. If Good had made the politically savvy choice of backing Trump from the start, rather than endorsing DeSantis, he wouldn't be on the knife's edge of losing this renomination,\" he added.\n\nEarly voting offers a key clue, political scientists say. Good won 5,822 early votes to McGuire's 5,012, but McGuire had a 943-vote edge with Election Day ballots, according to unofficial state Department of Election tallies. All in all, once mail-in ballots already counted are included, McGuire won 31,370 votes to Good's 31,055.\n\n\"The early voting numbers demonstrated that Good's appeal remained stronger until Trump ramped up his attacks on the Republican incumbent in recent days over what Trump viewed as Good's disloyalty,\" Farnsworth said.\n\nThose attacks included the tele-rally on Monday evening during which Trump declared: \"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back sort of like he did with me.\"\n\n\"Trump can say with some justification that his election-eve tele-rally was the deciding factor, given the difference between early votes and Election Day votes,\" McGlennon said.\n\nThe primary saw some big spending, much of it from outsiders. All in all, the sums spent will likely exceed $15 million from the two campaigns themselves and outside independent committees, with more backing McGuire and attacking Good, McGlennon said.\n\nTurnout was big, as well, with more than 62,000 voting, nearly double the turnout in the busiest of Virginia's eight other House primaries.\n\n\"Turnout was huge in the 5th because you had two combative candidates who were roughly evenly matched,\" said Mary Washington's Farnsworth.\n\n\"The margin was far closer than in any of the other congressional primary contests in Virginia on Tuesday, and there was huge campaign spending dropped into this race from national Republicans,\" he said.\n\nGood beat McGuire in his Lynchburg and Campbell County home base, racking up margins as high at 56% and 59% of votes cast, and also led in Charlottesville and Albemarle County. McGuire won 60 percent-plus margins in the parts of the district nearest Richmond, including his Goochland County home as well as Louisa, Powhatan and parts of Hanover counties.\n\nState & Regional Politics Trump calls in for McGuire on eve of 5th District primary Dave Ress Elections With a week to primaries, money keeps flooding Virginia campaigns Michael Martz PHOTOS: Primary voting in the Richmond area\n\nDave Ress (804) 649-6948\n\ndress@timesdispatch.com\n\nDave Ress\n\nGrowth and Development Reporter\n\nAuthor twitter Author email Follow Dave Ress Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

But he earned the wrath of Trump when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president. He switched back to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but Trump is endorsing McGuire and portraying Good as a backstabber.\n\nTrump continued to bash Good as he campaigned for McGuire in a telephone rally Monday night.\n\n\"Unlike Bob Good, John McGuire will not let you down,\" Trump said, adding that McGuire is \"strong on the border\" and \"will always defend your under-siege Second Amendment.\"\n\nGood, for his part, says he considers Trump the best president in his lifetime and only endorsed DeSantis because Trump is constitutionally limited to only one more term.\n\nGood also alienated Republican insiders by voting to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, throwing the party into a measure of chaos.\n\nSeeking to capitalize is McGuire, a state legislator and former Navy SEAL who has echoed Trump's attacks on Good, calling him a \"never Trumper.\"\n\nGood has bashed McGuire as a serial campaigner who announced his congressional bid just one week after winning election to a four-year term in the state Senate.\n\nIf Good loses, he would be the first House incumbent to go down to a primary challenge this year, with the exception of one race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\nThe winner will face one of three Democrats: Gloria Tinsley Witt, Gary Terry or Paul Riley.\n\nThe 5th Congressional District stretches from Charlottesville in the north, past the far western suburbs of Richmond, through Lynchburg and down to Danville and the North Carolina border.\n\nHouse District 7\n\nSpanberger is giving up the seat in northern and central Virginia to run for governor in 2025. The district tilts just slightly blue, and seven Democrats are seeking the seat. Leading the field is political newcomer Eugene Vindman, a military veteran who gained a measure of fame for his role in Trump's first impeachment. Four current and former elected officials -- Briana Sewell, Margaret Franklin, Andrea Bailey and Elizabeth Guzman -- are also in the race.\n\nOn the Republican side, fundraising figures suggest the top two contenders are Derrick Anderson and Cameron Hamilton. Anderson is a former Army Green Beret and Hamilton is a former Navy SEAL.\n\nHouse District 10\n\nWexton is not seeking reelection to her northern Virginia seat after being diagnosed with a rare, incurable neurological illness. The race to succeed her has attracted a field of 12 Democrats and four Republicans in a district that now tilts toward Democrats.\n\nDemocratic candidates include former Virginia House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, state Sens. Dan Helmer, Suhas Subramanyam and Jennifer Boysko, and former Virginia Education Secretary Atif Qarni. Wexton has endorsed Subramanyam.\n\nRepublicans include Aliscia Andrews, who ran for the seat four years ago, and lawyer Mike Clancy.\n\nHouse District 2\n\nIn the congressional district that spans Virginia's coast, Missy Cotter Smasal and Jeremiah \"Jake\" Denton IV are competing for the Democratic nomination.\n\nSmasal is a Navy veteran who runs a nonprofit that honors fallen servicewomen. Denton is a constitutional law and civil rights attorney who comes from a military family. Connection to the armed forces is often a calling card in the 2nd District, which is home to many veterans and several military installations and is adjacent to the nation's largest Navy base in Norfolk.\n\nThe winner will take on Congresswoman Jen Kiggans, a former Navy helicopter pilot and state senator who was elected in 2022.\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nIn the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, Navy veteran Cao prevailed over his four opponents for a chance to try to unseat Kaine, a Democrat who is seeking his third term as the state's junior U.S. senator.\n\nCao had the most money and previous campaign experience running for higher officer among the Republican primary contenders. He also had Trump's endorsement.\n\nCao defeated Scott Parkinson, a former congressional staffer for Ron DeSantis, as well as Jonathan Emord, an author and lawyer who often cites his court battles against the Food and Drug Administration. The other Republican candidates were Eddie Garcia, a U.S. Army veteran who owns a mobile app that serves veterans, and Chuck Smith, a former Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps commander and an attorney.\n\nMatthew Barakat And Ben Finley, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "chatnewstoday.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CHAT News Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Bob Good (VA, 5th District) and state Sen. John McGuire has moved through its second day of inconclusive results, which suggests Virginia Republicans are split on the topic of MAGA. That's because former President Donald Trump endorsed McGuire over \"[o]ne of America's most conservative congressmen.\"\n\nTrump carried the district by 8.5% in the 2020 election.\n\nWhy did Trump endorse Good's opponent? Because he initially endorsed the presidential candidacy of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nIn addition, Good voted to unseat Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House of Representatives. McCarthy also endorsed McGuire. From CNN:\n\nIn more normal times, it would have been hard to imagine a conservative challenger getting to the right of Good. But in the modern GOP, the true acid test of political viability is total fealty to the presumptive nominee. And this race, which was the most expensive House GOP primary of the 2024 cycle so far, will also serve as the perfect emblem of a chaotic House majority that will be remembered far more for vicious internal fights and members trampling over one another to prove their devotion to Trump than for its legislative record (emphasis added).\n\nAs of about 9 pm Pacific on Wednesday, McGuire had a lead of 312 votes, with an unofficial count of 31,389 (50.25%) to 31,077 (49.75%).\n\nRep. Good, chair of the House Freedom Caucus, was first elected in 2020. He graduated from Liberty University in 1988 (finance) and 2010 (M.B.A.).\n\nWednesday, Juneteenth, is a holiday in Virginia. Given the probability of a recount, whether mandated or requested, we will not have an official estimate for days.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the area is extremely conservative. It was one of two Virginia districts to support Alabama Gov. George Wallace in his third party run for the presidency. The last time the district (although its boundaries have changed) voted for a Democratic presidential candidate was in 1948 with Harry S. Truman.\n\nThe district has fewer people who characterize themselves as white, 69.1%, than the national average, 75.5%. The converse is true for the district's Black population, 20.7% versus a national rate of 13.6%.\n\nThe 2017 Cook Partisan Voter Index reported that 6% more voters cast Republican votes than the national average (designated +6). \"This made Virginia's 5th Congressional District the 179th most Republican nationally.\" The United States has 3,143 counties or equivalent local government systems, such as parishes and townships.", "source": {"uri": "themoderatevoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Moderate Voice"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kathy_gill@themoderatevoice.com", "name": "Kathy Gill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Good", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGuire_(Virginia_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McGuire (Virginia politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia's_5th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia's 5th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.

Bob Good in Virginia's 5th District and for the GOP nomination against Democrat Sen. Tim Kaine.\n\nIn the Georgia-3 contest for the seat of retiring GOP Rep. Drew Ferguson, all signs point to Brian Jack, 36, former Trump White House political director, rolling up a big win over former State Senate Majority Leader Mike Dugan.\n\n\"I'm predicting Brian wins,\" InsiderAdvantage Georgia publisher Phil Kent told Newsmax, \"He did heavy TV ad buys the past few days. The Trump endorsement is big in this heavily Republican district.\"\n\nIt's a bit more complicated in Virginia-5, where the former president -- furious that Good endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over him in the presidential race -- endorsed challenger and State Sen. John McGuire.\n\n\"Bob Good is all bad,\" Trump wrote ons Truth Social while also condemning the two-term lawmaker for voting to dethrone former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who has also endorsed McGuire.\n\nIn recent days, Good has come back with ads pointing out that he now strongly supports Trump for president -- leading the Trump campaign to issue a cease-and-desist order against the embattled congressman. In addition, longtime Trump adviser Steve Bannon appeared at a Good rally and praised him for fighting the Republican establishment.\n\n\"For Republicans, Donald Trump's endorsement means a lot, and when compared to Joe Biden's endorsement among Democrats, it's great,\" said Jim Gilmore, former Virginia governor and onetime Republican National Chairman. \"But many Republicans may not see the difference between the two candidates, so we don't know what kind of impact [Trump] will have.\"\n\nRetired U.S. Navy officer and near-successful 2022 U.S. House hopeful Hung Cao is considered the front-runner among seven Republican Senate hopefuls, in large part because he has Trump's endorsement. The seven are all Trump supporters and agree on virtually every issue.\n\nBut Cao may have stumbled in the twilight days of the campaign by dismissing the Staunton News Leader newspaper \"Podunk\" that challenged his statement about his own political action committee. Cao was widely criticized in the Shenandoah Valley for his words only a week after he skipped a candidate forum in that part of Virginia.\n\nWhether any of that harms the Trump-endorsed contender remains to be seen.\n\nJohn Gizzi is chief political columnist and White House correspondent for Newsmax.

(WRIC) - The Republican head-to-head between incumbent Bob Good and John McGuire isn't just one of Virginia's most-watched -- and expensive -- congressional primaries this year but in the whole country.\n\nAnd with the two far-right conservatives having similar policy positions, experts say the endorsement of former President Donald Trump will likely shape the race.\n\nTrump endorsed state Sen. McGuire (R-Goochland) over Rep. Good (R-Va.) after the congressman backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in the GOP presidential primary over Trump before eventually endorsing Trump after DeSantis dropped out.\n\nBut despite this, both have made Trump a focal point for their campaigns, aligning themselves with the former president and invoking his name during their campaigns.\n\nRich Meagher, a political science professor at Randolph-Macon College, said not much separates the two policy-wise so getting Trump's support in a Republican primary is a big boost. But still, Meagher said, they've shown how important they feel Trump is for their political futures.\n\n\"I doubt there be any significant vote that their vote would differ on,\" Meagher told 8News Monday about Good and McGuire. \"It really is just about this kind of personal loyalty to Trump.\"\n\nMcGuire has made Trump's endorsement a central focus of his campaign, touting the former president's support in ads, signs and even his transportation. Good has also focused on Trump, including using campaign signs with Trump's name that he was asked to take down.\n\nThey both went to New York to stand in support of Trump during the former president's criminal trial.\n\nGood, the chair of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, played a major role in the ousting of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. McGuire, a former Navy SEAL, was a state delegate before joining the Virginia Senate.\n\nThey are running for the GOP nomination in a Republican-leaning district that stretches from Albemarle County to the North Carolina state line. It also includes Charlottesville, Goochland, Powhatan, Louisa and parts of Hanover County.\n\nThe odd part of the primary, Meagher noted, is that Good and McGuire are two conservatives who appear aligned on major policy issues such as guns, the economy, abortion and more, but they have tried to describe the other as too liberal.\n\n\"It just shows how much the personal brand of Trump, how much his personality overshadows the entire party's politics right now that these two men who are like identical political creatures are in this fight for the death over a congressional seat when the only difference is really their personal endorsement of or from Trump,\" Meagher said.\n\nOn Monday night, the day before Tuesday's primary, Trump took part in a tele-town hall for McGuire in which he said the state senator had his \"complete and total endorsement\" and called Good \"not good.\"\n\n\"McGuire was able to leverage Good's defection into a case on why to vote for him over someone else,\" Meagher told 8News.\n\nHowever, Meagher believes a win by Good on Tuesday isn't a referendum on Trump's sway in Virginia ahead of November. He called the matchup a \"win-win\" for Trump, saying that if Good pulls out a victory he will look to reinforce his support for Trump before the general election.\n\nThe winner between Good and McGuire will be the favorite to take Virginia's red-leaning 5th Congressional District in November against any of the three Democrats vying for the nomination Tuesday.\n\nThree candidates are running for the Democratic nomination in Virginia's 5th Congressional District: Paul Riley, Gary Terry and Gloria Witt.\n\nPaul Riley\n\nRiley, who served in the Army for over 20 years, is an intelligence solutions lead with a defense contractor, per his campaign website. Riley's website lists accountability and transparency among his top issues, saying he backs \"curtailing the lobbying industry to prevent undue influence.\"\n\nGary Terry\n\nTerry, a U.S. Military Academy at West Point graduate, has been a corporate executive, entrepreneur, and executive director for the YMCA and CEO for the Boys and Girls Clubs, per his campaign website. He considers himself \"a moderate pragmatic problem solver\" who wants a more efficient government, his campaign site states.\n\nGloria Witt\n\nWitt worked with a nuclear energy business for 32 years before becoming the founder and CEO of Define Success Coaching, which her campaign site says is \"committed to developing executives and leaders that are known for their ability to produce defined results whether in a commercial, government, non-profit, or faith-based organizations.\"\n\nPer her campaign website, Witt wants to ban assault weapons, expand voting access, \"restore reproductive rights\" and expand basic health care access.\n\nOn Election Day, polls open at 6 a.m. and close at 7 p.m. Even after polls close, voters in line by 7 p.m. can cast a ballot. Virginia does not register voters by party, so voters can vote in Republican or Democratic state primaries.\n\nVirginians not registered to vote can take advantage of same-day registration and cast a provisional ballot at their polling place. Voters need to bring an accepted form of identification - but one with a photo is not required.\n\nVoters turned away from a polling place for whatever reason - unless they are at the wrong location - should ask for a provisional ballot to vote, per the state Department of Elections.

With each update to the results, Good and McGuire traded leads that at times were as low as single digits.\n\nIt was a surprisingly strong showing for Good -- and a potential demonstration of the power of incumbency -- given the array of Republican forces that had coalesced to take him out. McGuire was backed by allies of both former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and former President Donald Trump in a race that saw more than $14.5 million in outside spending.\n\nMcGuire, a Virginia state senator, was widely seen as having the upper hand heading into Election Day because of the support that flowed to him from across the GOP's many factions. But the electorate was clearly split, and by 9:30 p.m. it was the only congressional race in the state left to call.\n\nThe primary battle has exposed deep divisions in the House GOP and the MAGA movement -- and the fault lines centered around personal beefs and petty arguments, not diverging ideologies. Several House Republicans endorsed McGuire, calling Good an inconsiderate colleague, and even a member of Good's typically rigidly unified House Freedom Caucus opposed him. Most notably, McCarthy's allies sought revenge on Good for voting to depose the former speaker, and Trump endorsed McGuire after Good initially backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the presidential primary.\n\nThe race may not be called Tuesday night if the results remain extremely close. Whatever the ultimate outcome, it is certain to reverberate across the House GOP as Good's colleagues anxiously wait to see whether the bomb-throwing lawmaker will be further emboldened to cause turmoil in the House in the final months before the fall election.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGuire_(Virginia_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McGuire (Virginia politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia's_5th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia's 5th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/f8c7eca/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/1200x800%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb2%2F46%2F875a592e4d5888b145c2dec74260%2Felection-2024-virginia-11034.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661234", "eventUri": "eng-9661234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Bob Good's seat in Virginia's 5th Congressional District. The contest had boiled over into one of the most tumultuous primaries of the cycle so far, as Donald Trump and Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) sought to make Good the first incumbent to lose to an outside challenger. But as of Tuesday night, the race was still too close to call, with Good and his rival separated by hundreds of votes.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats grappled with their own fraught primary in Virginia, while Rep. Tom Cole (R) fended off several primary challengers for the GOP nod in Oklahoma.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Tuesday night's primaries:\n\nTrump's bid for revenge ends in a nailbiter\n\nGood, the chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was seen by many as a dead man walking heading into his primary against Virginia state. Sen John McGuire on Tuesday night, especially since Good had run afoul of Trump.\n\nBut as midnight approached, the candidates were neck-and-neck, with the race too close to call. If Good ultimately wins, it would be a major upset and an embarrassing defeat for both Trump and McCarthy.\n\nThe incumbent angered Trump when he backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for the Republican presidential nomination last year. While Good later endorsed Trump when DeSantis left the race, the former president argued the backing came too late.\n\nAs a result, Trump threw his support behind McGuire, who also won the backing of McCarthy's Majority Committee PAC after Good voted to oust the former Speaker last year.\n\nIt's unclear who will ultimately prevail, with some late mail ballots and a possible recount later this week adding to the uncertainty. The results of the race might not be known for days.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that Good's primary has turned into one of the most fraught and memorable contests of the cycle so far.\n\nAn under-the-radar Senate matchup is set\n\nRet. Navy Capt. Hung Cao sailed to victory in Virginia's GOP Senate primary, easily defeating four other Republicans.\n\nCao will go on to face incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) in November, a race seen as an uphill battle for Republicans. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the seat as \"solid Democrat.\"\n\nStill, Republicans are heartened by signs of weakness for President Biden in the commonwealth, raising the possibility of a down-ballot upset as well.\n\nDefeating Kaine will be no easy feat, however. In addition to serving in the Senate since 2013, Kaine also has Virginia governor, lieutenant governor and mayor of Richmond on his resume. On top of that, he served as chair of the Democratic National Committee and was Hillary Clinton's running mate in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut Republicans are optimistic for Cao, a familiar face in Virginia politics. He challenged Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) in Virginia's 10th Congressional District 2022, but lost after the district became even more blue-leaning following redistricting.\n\nRepublicans point to recent polling coming out of Virginia showing a tighter-than-expected race between Biden and Trump. A Fox News survey released earlier this month showed the two tied at 48 percent. Additionally, The Hill's Decision Desk HQ polling average has Trump narrowly leading Biden by .2 percent.\n\nThe polling should be alarming for Democrats, who have carried Virginia at the presidential level since former President Obama won the state in 2008. But Republicans say the polls show there is opportunity for Trump, and by extension Cao, in the state.\n\nAn ugly Dem primary comes to an end\n\nVirginia state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam (D) beat out 11 other candidates in the Democratic primary to replace Wexton in Virginia's 10th Congressional District.\n\nWexton backed Subramanyam, giving him momentum going into the crowded primary. The intraparty contest featured a number of well-known Virginia Democrats, including former House of Delegates Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn (D), state Sen. Jennifer Boysko (D) and former Virginia Secretary of Education Atif Qarni.\n\nBut on Tuesday the race came down to Subramanyam and Del. Dan Helmer (D), with Subramanyam defeating Helmer 30.3 percent to 26.7 percent.\n\nThe race became particularly ugly in its final days after sexual harassment allegations emerged against Helmer. He has denied the allegations.\n\nSubramanyam will go on to face Republican Mike Clancey in November. Democrats have an advantage in the district, which includes various Washington, D.C., suburbs and exurbs. Wexton won reelection in the district by over six points in 2022 and Biden carried the district by 19 points in2020.\n\nAnother Jan. 6 candidate goes down\n\nA candidate convicted of a misdemeanor related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol went down in a Georgia runoff seen as the latest test of voters' willingness to support a candidate linked to the insurrection.\n\nChuck Hand, who pleaded guilty to illegally demonstrating in the Capitol on Jan. 6, came in second place in last month's initial primary alongside fellow Republican Wayne Johnson, a former Trump administration official.\n\nBut Johnson pulled off a comfortable double-digit win in Tuesday's top-two contest and will go head-to-head with 16-term Democrat incumbent Rep. Sanford Bishop in November.\n\nHand is one of a small handful of candidates linked to Jan. 6 who have tried for seats in Congress this cycle, more than three years after the Capitol riots -- though they've lost out in the primary races so far this cycle.\n\nStill, political experts say support for their bids -- like the 35 percent Hand pulled in on Tuesday -- signal some in the GOP are shrugging off Jan. 6 convictions, especially as Trump lauds \"J6 warriors\" along the campaign trail and dismisses his own legal battles as politically motivated.\n\nBoth parties are grappling with divisions\n\nTuesday's primaries laid bare the divisions that exist within both the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\nIn Virginia's 5th District, conservatives and Republicans were split over their support of Good and McGuire. While Trump and McCarthy were united in their quest for revenge against Good, the incumbent congressman received support from other lawmakers, including Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and even Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nVirginia Democrats also had their own contentious primary in the 10th District, which pitted Democratic figures in the state against each other. Former Gov. Ralph Northam (D) backed Filler-Corn in the race, while Wexton threw her support behind Subramanyam.\n\nBut Virginia was not the only state to see intraparty divisions. In Oklahoma, Rep. Tom Cole (R) easily defeated businessman Paul Bondar by double digits. Bondar ran to Cole's right, campaigning on impeaching Biden, tougher immigration policy and cutting financial support for Ukraine. Bondar outraised Cole during the primary, thanks to a $5 million loan he gave his campaign. Cole has held the seat for more than 20 years.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

He received a warm welcome even from Senator McConnell, who had not spoken to him since December 2020.\n\nEvery single congressional candidate endorsed by Trump has been successful so far this year, according to Ballotpedia, though one of the former president's toughest tests will come Tuesday in Virginia, where the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, Congressman Bob Good, is fighting back against a Trump-endorsed opponent.\n\nTrump announced on May 28 that he would be supporting a state senator, Navy SEAL, and conservative lawmaker of central Virginia, John McGuire. Mr. Good has an extremely conservative record as a House member, but has made enemies in Trump world who eventually led the former president to wade into the race.\n\nMr. Good endorsed Governor DeSantis for president in May 2023, when it looked like the Florida governor could pose a serious challenge to Trump. The former president stayed on the sidelines for months even as one of his most devoted House acolytes, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, urged him to endorse Mr. McGuire.\n\n\"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA,\" Trump eventually wrote on Truth Social. \"He turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement -- But really, it was too late.\"\n\nMr. McGuire has won the backing of a strange cross-section of Republicans, including Ms. Greene and Speaker McCarthy, as well as swing-district moderate members like Congresswoman Jen Kiggans. According to a recent poll by the Virginia Faith and Freedom Coalition, Mr. McGuire leads Mr. Good by 10 points in the primary election.\n\nTrump's endorsement could also prove pivotal in the fate of the chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee, Congressman Tom Cole, who is facing a wealthy, self-funding opponent. Mr. Cole has represented Oklahoma in the House for nearly 20 years.\n\nTrump endorsed him on May 7 even though his primary challenger, Paul Bondar, was portraying himself as the true Trump fighter that is needed in Congress. Mr. Bondar has given his campaign millions of dollars, but has also faced accusations of carpetbagging because he was a Texas resident as recently as 2022.\n\nMr. Cole said in a statement after a recent meeting with Trump that he was looking forward \"to working directly with President Trump to push ... strong, commonsense solutions and curb the catastrophes of the Biden Administration.\"\n\nLater this summer, Trump will try to take out a key foe who evaded the former president's wrath in 2022. Congressman Dan Newhouse is just one of two House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, and Trump has endorsed the right-wing candidate challenging Mr. Newhouse in the primary.\n\nIn April, Trump endorsed Jerrod Sessler, a staunch supporter of the former president who has gone after Mr. Newhouse over his impeachment vote. \"Jerrod Sessler is a fantastic candidate and will be a GREAT Congressman for Washington State's 4th Congressional District,\" Trump said on Truth Social. Washington State voters will go to the polls in August.\n\nWorking in coordination with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Trump has also been in lockstep with the chairman of the group, Senator Daines, about pushing pro-Trump, conservative candidates over the finish line in their respective primaries.\n\nTrump has endorsed Tim Sheehy to be the next senator from Montana, Sam Brown of Nevada, and Bernie Moreno of Ohio -- all of whom went on to win their primaries. All three candidates will face off against Democratic senators.\n\nTrump's takeover of the congressional GOP started in earnest in 2022, after loyalty to the former president became paramount amid the January 6 investigation and the clear signs Trump had sent that he would seek the 2024 GOP nomination. Eight of the 10 GOP members who voted for impeachment after January 6 either retired or were run out of the House by primary opponents backed by Trump.\n\nThat year in the Senate, Trump was able to replace allies of Mr. McConnell with his own acolytes. Senator Portman was succeeded by Senator Vance after Trump endorsed Mr. Vance during a hotly contested 2022 primary.\n\nSenator Burr was succeeded by Senator Budd after all Republicans were scared away from the 2022 North Carolina Senate race following Trump's early endorsement of the conservative then-congressman. His former staff member, Max Miller, easily won a seat in Congress representing northeast Ohio with the Trump endorsement.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

A Congressional gold medal. An international airport. Veuer's Maria Mercedes Galuppo has the story.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's attacks on Rep. Bob Good, R-5th, including an election eve tele-rally saying the conservative Congressman stabbed him in the back, gave state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, the push he needed to eke out what's now a tiny lead, political scientists say.\n\nBut the big question is what McGuire's current 315 vote, 0.5 percentage point margin signifies about the influence of an endorsement from the former president.\n\nWith that close a result, political scientists think a recount is coming.\n\n\"Why did Good make it so close, and perhaps even prevail despite Trump's severe attacks?\" said John McGlennon, a College of William and Mary political scientist.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Burton) among stars in FCA All-Star Game Follow the yellow brick road to the Gilliam Stage this summer\n\nLocal electoral boards must still complete their work of checking and double-checking Tuesday night's preliminary tallies and count the final mail-in and provisional ballots.\n\nThe 0.5 percentage point gap between McGuire's vote and Good's opens the path to a recount, once the boards certify results.\n\nIn a way, the question of Trump's influence comes down to 5th District voters' strong feelings about Washington, government officials and outsiders telling them what to do.\n\n\"It's useful to recognize that for many MAGA voters, Trump's appeal is his willingness to stick it to the establishment,\" McGlennon said.\n\n\"In this race, ironically, the incumbent could proudly point to the Republican establishment's attacks as a sign that he's even more Trump than Trump. Good has that grassroots support that rejects all the party leaders and elected officials ganging up on him because he won't play their game,\" he said.\n\nDuring the campaign, Good made a point of noting that groups close to former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy had supported McGuire.\n\n\"Even Marjorie Taylor Greene became part of the establishment. Look at the lack of turnout for McGuire and Greene on their two-day blitz,\" McGlennon said.\n\nMcGuire's narrow lead shows that that large numbers of 5th District conservatives did not believe that either McGuire or Trump offered a principled reason to abandon Good, while McCarthy allies' support for McGuire was another reason to stick to good, said longtime Virginia analyst Bob Holsworth, a former VCU dean.\n\n\"The vast majority of Good voters will cast a ballot for Trump in November. But for Trump to be competitive in Virginia, he will need a huge turnout in the parts of the district that supported Good. The open question is whether the enthusiasm level that drives turnout will be as high as he need,\" Holsworth said.\n\nRoanoke College political scientist Harry Wilson said Trump's impact is obvious.\n\n\"In an election this close, you can point to a variety of factors, but I seriously doubt McGuire would have won, assuming he does, without Trump's endorsement. Kevin McCarthy may have a fingerprint on it as well,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"Maybe some folks were tired of Good's style. Maybe folks actually like McGuire. Some may still be smarting over Good defeating [Denver] Riggelman,\" Wilson said, referring to the Republican who represented the district for one term before Good defeated him in a 2020 nominating convention, after Riggleman officiated at a same-sex marriage and drew fire for his stands on immigration and fiscal policy.\n\nStill, it was Trump who swung the election for McGuire, said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington.\n\n\"If the former president had not weighed in against Good, the incumbent would have been renominated in a walk,\" Farnsworth said.\n\n\"His combative brand of conservatism fits well with the preferences of Republican primary voters in the district,\" he said.\n\nGood's bad luck was an early endorsement last year of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' short-lived bid to challenge Trump for the GOP's presidential nomination, Farnsworth said.\n\n\"Trump personalizes politics at every opportunity. If Good had made the politically savvy choice of backing Trump from the start, rather than endorsing DeSantis, he wouldn't be on the knife's edge of losing this renomination,\" he added.\n\nEd Lynch, chair of Hollins University's global politics and societies department, said McGuire probably would not have received much more than 30% of the vote without Trump's support.\n\n\"To my mind, there is no question that the only way to put up a serious primary challenge to a rock-ribbed conservative like Bob Good was with an endorsement by Donald Trump,\" he said.\n\nEarly voting and turnout\n\nEarly voting offers a key clue to Trump's influence, political scientists say.\n\nGood won 5,822 early votes to McGuire's 5,012, but McGuire had a 943-vote edge with Election Day ballots, according to unofficial state Department of Election tallies. All in all, McGuire won 31,370 votes to Good's 31,055 of the ballots that have been counted so far.\n\n\"The early voting numbers demonstrated that Good's appeal remained stronger until Trump ramped up his attacks on the Republican incumbent in recent days over what Trump viewed as Good's disloyalty,\" Farnsworth said.\n\nThose attacks included the tele-rally on Monday evening during which Trump declared: \"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back sort of like he did with me.\"\n\nThe primary saw some big spending, much of it from outsiders. All in all, the sums spent will likely exceed $15 million from the two campaigns themselves and outside independent committees, with more backing McGuire and attacking Good, McGlennon said.\n\nTurnout was big, as well, with more than 62,000 voting, nearly double the turnout in the busiest of Virginia's eight other House primaries.\n\n\"Turnout was huge in the 5th because you had two combative candidates who were roughly evenly matched,\" said Mary Washington's Farnsworth.\n\n\"The margin was far closer than in any of the other congressional primary contests in Virginia on Tuesday, and there was huge campaign spending dropped into this race from national Republicans,\" he said.\n\nGood beat McGuire in his Lynchburg-area home base, racking up margins as high at 56% and 59% of votes cast, and also led in the Charlottesville area. McGuire won 60 percent-plus margins in the parts of the district nearest Richmond, including his Goochland County home as well as Louisa, Powhatan and parts of Hanover counties.\n\n\"I wouldn't read anything into this race carrying over to November, but the polls, including Roanoke College, suggest the general election will be much closer than 2020,\" Wilson said.\n\nThe real message from the 5th District may be how the presidential campaigns interpret the 5th, when they start allocating resources to different states, Wilson said.\n\nAnd Trump gave a clue at the McGuire tele-rally, when he said he would \"put a very heavy play on Virginia,\" adding, \"I think we're gonna win the state of Virginia.\"\n\nTrump's other big Virginia endorsement, of retired Navy Capt. Hung Cao's bid to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine, shows the former president's strength among Virginia Republicans, Hollins' Lynch said. Cao won a 5-way race by getting 62% of the votes cast.\n\n\"That race could have gone right down to the wire had Trump stayed out of it,\" Lynch said.\n\n\"I still rate the Commonwealth as safe for the Democrats in the Senate, but not solid,\" Lynch said.\n\n\"Ironically, the better Trump does in Virginia, the better for Kaine. Reluctant Trump voters, who are voting for Trump simply because they can't stand Biden, will want to balance that uncomfortable vote with a much more comfortable vote for Kaine,\" he added.\n\nCao began the race last year with an advantage from name recognition in his competitive race against Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-10th, which he lost by 6.5 percentage points.\n\nTrump's endorsement \"may have bumped him from being just a favorite to a landslide winner,\" said J. Miles Coleman at the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.\n\nThe former president \"probably knew he had a winning choice,\" said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. \"He likes to run up the number of Trump-endorsed candidates who won in order to show he had control of the party apparatus across the country.\"\n\nTrump's influence on the 7th\n\nTrump's presence was felt in the Democratic primary in Northern Virginia's 7th District, where Eugene Vindman, won a 49% plurality in a seven-way race that featured four current or former office holders in the district.\n\nIt was Vindman's first political race, but he benefited from national name recognition because of the role that he and his twin brother, Alexander, played in the first impeachment of Trump.\n\nHe ran on a message of protecting democracy that invoked Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe winner of the GOP primary, Derrick Anderson, told supporters \"Eugene Vindman is only running for revenge -- revenge against Donald Trump and revenge against Republicans.\"\n\nRep. Abigail Spanberger, D-7th, won the political swing district two years ago after a new political map moved it from the Richmond suburbs to Northern Virginia and the Fredericksburg area. Spanberger, who lives in Henrico County, is running for governor next year instead of a fourth term in Congress.\n\nIn his victory statement, Vindman tried to link Anderson to Trump's Make America Great Movement, \"who wants nothing more than to play politics with our classrooms and let politicians ban books on the Holocaust and slavery and throw them into the fire.\"\n\n\"Running as a MAGA Republican would put him at odds with the vast majority of voters in the district,\" Vindman said of Anderson. \"You don't go from Spanberger to MAGA candidate in one election cycle.\"\n\n'A geographical challenge'\n\nA political endorsement may have been decisive in Sen. Suhas Subramanyam's victory in a 12-person race in the 10th District Democratic primary, but it wasn't Trump's. Wexton, who is stepping down because of a serious medical condition, endorsed Subramanyam as her preferred successor, emphasizing his roots in Loudoun County, with more than half of the registered voters in the district.\n\nWhile other congressional races have been largely national in message, Rozell said Subramanyam's ties to Loudoun and emphasis on local issues gave him an advantage over Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, who had raised the most money in the race but lived just outside of the district.\n\n\"He had a geographical challenge,\" Rozell said.\n\nSubramanyam won the race with a 30% plurality and a margin of less than 1,500 votes over Helmer.\n\nPHOTOS: Primary voting in the Richmond area\n\nDave Ress (804) 649-6948\n\ndress@timesdispatch.com\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local

John McGuire was too close to call on Tuesday night and a recount looked to be a real possibility.\n\nAt around 10:20 p.m. with 92% of the vote in, Mr. McGuire held a razor-thin lead, garnering 50.2% of the vote compared to Mr. Good's 49.8%.\n\nThat margin was less than 300 votes and the lead had changed hands multiple times in the previous few hours.\n\nNeither man had made any public statements claiming victory.\n\nVirginia law does not provide for an automatic recount, but a candidate can ask for one if the election-night margin of victory is less than 1 percentage point.\n\nThe slim margin means that a decision and an end to the grueling primary race that pitted conservatives and establishment Republicans would likely have to wait.\n\nElsewhere in the state, Army veteran Eugene Vindman, whose twin brother Alex Vindman was a key witness in Mr. Trump's first impeachment, won the seven-candidate Democratic primary in Virginia's 7th District.\n\nMr. Vindman will attempt to keep the district in Democrats' hands and succeed Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who opted to run for governor next year instead of reelection to the House.\n\nBut Republicans are hoping to flip Virginia's 7th District.\n\nDerrick Anderson, a former Army Special Forces platoon leader who was backed by House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and other GOP leaders, won the six-way GOP primary. His closest challenger Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL, had support from Mr. Good and other Freedom Caucus members.\n\nIn the commonwealth's 10th District, state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam won a 12-way Democratic primary to run for the open seat.\n\nRep. Jennifer Wexton, Virginia Democrat, is retiring because of health complications she has faced after being diagnosed with Progressive Supra-nuclear Palsy, which has been referred to as \"Parkinson's on steroids.\"\n\nThe district used to be competitive but after redistricting leans heavily Democratic, so Mr. Subramanyam is favored to win in November.\n\nThe 5th District primary brought together differing factions within the Republican Party against Mr. Good -- from former President Donald Trump and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and his establishment allies in Congress to aggrieved current and former Freedom Caucus members Reps. Warren Davidson and Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nMr. Trump turned against Mr. Good over his support of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president, despite Mr. Good immediately flipping to endorse the former president once Mr. DeSantis dropped out.\n\n\"After I won the primaries, he became a big fan. But that's not good enough, because those are the people that they tend to leave you very quickly,\" Mr. Trump said Monday on a tele-rally boosting Mr. McGuire's candidacy.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump's claims that Mr. Good would \"stab Virginia in the back,\" he offered no specific criticisms of the Freedom Caucus chair's policy positions. Instead, he alluded to complaints from many House Republicans that Mr. Good is more focused on obstructing legislation than advancing it.\n\n\"He was against things that everybody would have wanted and always made it difficult,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He's not a very popular guy, I will tell you that.\"\n\nMr. Good has not engaged in the one-sided feud, talking up his support for the former president and touting the Freedom Caucus as the group that will fight most for Mr. Trump's policies in Congress.\n\nEven Mr. Trump acknowledged on the Monday tele-rally for Mr. McGuire that he has no current issues with Mr. Good, saying, \"he was fine the last six months, but before that he was a basic disaster.\"\n\nThe tight race also represents Mr. McCarthy's best shot at revenge against the eight lawmakers that ousted him in October.\n\nMr. McCarthy, who backed Mr. McGuire and helped funnel outside money toward his campaign, has been working to defeat those eight Republicans in primaries but hasn't had any success to date.\n\nAfter Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, one of the eight Republicans, pummeled her McCarthy-backed challenger last week, the former speaker said on Fox News that Mr. Good's contest was \"the real race\" to watch.\n\nOther House Republicans, either bitter over Mr. McCarthy's ousting or upset at Mr. Good's disruptive behavior against the House GOP's agenda since taking over as House Freedom Caucus chair, endorsed Mr. McGuire with several traveling to the district to campaign for him.\n\nEven a member of Mr. Good's Freedom Caucus, Mr. Davidson of Ohio, endorsed Mr. McGuire in the final days of the campaign.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_miller@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Alex Miller", "type": "author",

Bob Good (R-VA), the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, will lose his primary to state Sen. John McGuire, who had the endorsement of former President Donald Trump.\n\nWith very few outstanding votes, McGuire leads Good by a razor-thin margin of less than 350 votes out of more than 62,000 cast. While it is still possible for Good to prevail, the odds are not in his favor at this point. And while McGuire is well poised to become the next representative of Virginia's 5th Congressional District, the real winner in this saga is former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nGood was one of eight Republican members of the House of Representatives who voted to oust McCarthy from the speakership in October of last year. From that moment, the disgruntled former speaker has been on a warpath to oust the eight members who participated in his removal, and with Good likely headed toward a loss, he seems to have collected his first scalp.\n\nBut this chaotic charade was not necessary. In fact, it was a massive waste of money aimed at replacing one of the most conservative members of Congress for nothing more than a personal slight.\n\nIn the run-up to Election Day, McCarthy and his allies spent nearly $10 million to defeat Good, while the incumbent representative and his allies countered with more than $5 million of their own spending.

Matt Gaetz of Florida listen during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol, Feb. 13, 2024. All four were among 14 Republicans who voted against emergency defense aid for Israel. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\n(JTA) -- WASHINGTON -- The Republican Jewish Coalition is taking sides in a Virginia congressional primary race between two candidates with links to the party's hardline right -- citing their differences over Israel.\n\nThe RJC's preferred candidate in Virginia's fifth district, State Sen. John McGuire, is challenging incumbent Rep. Bob Good, who rallied a group of colleagues this year to vote against aid to Israel. The district encompasses a chunk of central Virginia, including Charlottesville. The primary is on Tuesday.\n\nThe endorsement is a departure of sorts for the RJC, which has become a standard-bearer for a type of Republican increasingly at peril: the robust foreign policy moderate. In several other primary races this year and in past elections, the group has endorsed moderate candidates against those with ties to the far right whom it describes as \"extremists,\" such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\n\nIn the Good-McGuire race, neither candidate is a moderate. Good leads the hardline Republican Freedom Caucus in the House of Representatives and voted against certifying Joe Biden's election victory on Jan. 6, 2021, the day of the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. McGuire, a former Navy SEAL, participated in the rally that led to the riot and likewise denies Biden's victory, though he says he never entered the Capitol that day.\n\nWhat is driving the RJC's backing of McGuire is another one of its priorities in intra-party fights this year: support for Israel. RJC Director Matt Brooks said in February that the group was taking aim at neo-isolationist trends in the party and has spent in races against other Freedom Caucus members.\n\nDiscussing the McGuire endorsement, Brooks said that he doesn't \"look at it through the prism\" of what took place on Jan. 6. He said McGuire's record in the Virginia legislature marked him as a team player who would not disrupt Republican legislative efforts.\n\n\"McGuire's going to be a powerful voice, a consistent voice for support for Israel,\" Brooks said in an interview. \"I'm looking at 'who's going to be value added.' You know, elections are binary choices. He's going to be a significant improvement over where we are with Bob Good.\"\n\nBrooks would not say how much the RJC is contributing to McGuire's campaign; often, an RJC endorsement functions as a spur to individual contributors to donate. The most recent disclosures show McGuire competitive in the money race with Good, raising $1.2 million to Good's $1.1 million.\n\nThe race is getting national attention, largely because Good has made enemies of prominent Republicans. Former President Donald Trump endorsed McGuire because Good supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the presidential primaries -- which Trump won. McGuire also has the backing of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy; Good played a central role in McCarthy's ouster last year.\n\nKyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, a newsletter published by the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said the Good-McGuire race was typical of a new type of internal GOP tension -- one that has less to do with ideological tensions between moderates and purists, and more to do with who is more loyal to Donald Trump.\n\n\"It's just a different kind of dynamic,\" Kondik said in an interview. \"Republicans are often trying to pledge their loyalty to Donald Trump and in this instance, the challenger is closer to him than Bob Good is, even though Good by any metric is very conservative.\"\n\nThe RJC is worried about a different evolution in the party: the growth of opposition to Israel aid. For years, there was a single GOP \"nay\" vote in the House on Israel-related bills: Thomas Massie of Kentucky. This year, in separate votes, Good rallied 14 and then 21 Republicans to vote against bills providing aid to Israel.\n\nA version of the package, which also provided aid to Ukraine and Taiwan, passed the House in April. But Republican \"no\" votes growing from one to 21 in less than a year -- and, moreover, after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel -- set off alarm bells for Jewish Republicans.\n\n\"For the pro-Israel community, this is not the first time concerns have been raised about Rep. Bob Good's undermining of U.S. support for Israel: Good also voted against passage of an Israel aid bill in February, and he opposed a defense authorization bill that included important funding for joint U.S.-Israel defense programs, including Iron Dome,\" said the April RJC announcement that it was endorsing McGuire -- which focused almost entirely on criticizing Good.\n\nFor his part, Good has told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in the past that he favors funding for Israel's defense, but wants it to come with offsets to other programs in order to ensure fiscal responsibility. That would mark a change: Foreign assistance funding has never come with offsets.\n\n\"We're heading for a fiscal reckoning in this country, and so we've got to begin to address that and some of us on the Republican side are willing to try to do so,\" Good told JTA in February after voting against an Israel aid bill.\n\nBrooks said he was aware of the risks of taking on a high-profile group like the Freedom Caucus.\n\n\"For somebody to stand up on the floor of the United States Congress and vote no on critical aid to Israel at a consequential moment in history, it goes against our values and goes against who we are, and if we alienate other members of the Freedom Caucus, so be it -- perhaps that'll encourage them to be more aware and to do better on these votes going forward,\" he said.\n\nThis is not the first time the RJC has opposed Good. In 2020, when Good was running against incumbent Rep. Denver Riggleman, the RJC endorsed the incumbent. Good, who won that race, targeted Riggleman because Riggleman had presided over a same-sex wedding.\n\nRiggleman later pushed back against the election denialism championed by McGuire and Good. He went on to advise Jewish groups on the extremism that had fueled the riot, as well as the House committee investigating Jan. 6.", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish

Bob Good's seat in Virginia's 5th Congressional District. The contest had boiled over into one of the most tumultuous primaries of the cycle so far, as Donald Trump and Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) sought to make Good the first incumbent to lose to an outside challenger. But as of Tuesday night, the race was still too close to call, with Good and his rival separated by hundreds of votes.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats grappled with their own fraught primary in Virginia, while Rep. Tom Cole (R) fended off several primary challengers for the GOP nod in Oklahoma.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Tuesday night's primaries:\n\nGood, the chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was seen by many as a dead man walking heading into his primary against Virginia state. Sen John McGuire on Tuesday night, especially since Good had run afoul of Trump.\n\nBut as midnight approached, the candidates were neck-and-neck, with the race too close to call. If Good ultimately wins, it would be a major upset and an embarrassing defeat for both Trump and McCarthy.\n\nThe incumbent angered Trump when he backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for the Republican presidential nomination last year. While Good later endorsed Trump when DeSantis left the race, the former president argued the backing came too late.\n\nAs a result, Trump threw his support behind McGuire, who also won the backing of McCarthy's Majority Committee PAC after Good voted to oust the former Speaker last year.\n\nIt's unclear who will ultimately prevail, with some late mail ballots and a possible recount later this week adding to the uncertainty. The results of the race might not be known for days.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that Good's primary has turned into one of the most fraught and memorable contests of the cycle so far.\n\nRet. Navy Capt. Hung Cao sailed to victory in Virginia's GOP Senate primary, easily defeating four other Republicans.\n\nCao will go on to face incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) in November, a race seen as an uphill battle for Republicans. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the seat as \"solid Democrat.\"\n\nStill, Republicans are heartened by signs of weakness for President Biden in the commonwealth, raising the possibility of a down-ballot upset as well.\n\nDefeating Kaine will be no easy feat, however. In addition to serving in the Senate since 2013, Kaine also has Virginia governor, lieutenant governor and mayor of Richmond on his resume. On top of that, he served as chair of the Democratic National Committee and was Hillary Clinton's running mate in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut Republicans are optimistic for Cao, a familiar face in Virginia politics. He challenged Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) in Virginia's 10th Congressional District 2022, but lost after the district became even more blue-leaning following redistricting.\n\nRepublicans point to recent polling coming out of Virginia showing a tighter-than-expected race between Biden and Trump. A Fox News survey released earlier this month showed the two tied at 48 percent. Additionally, The Hill's Decision Desk HQ polling average has Trump narrowly leading Biden by .2 percent.\n\nThe polling should be alarming for Democrats, who have carried Virginia at the presidential level since former President Obama won the state in 2008. But Republicans say the polls show there is opportunity for Trump, and by extension Cao, in the state.\n\nVirginia state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam (D) beat out 11 other candidates in the Democratic primary to replace Wexton in Virginia's 10th Congressional District.\n\nWexton backed Subramanyam, giving him momentum going into the crowded primary. The intraparty contest featured a number of well-known Virginia Democrats, including former House of Delegates Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn (D), state Sen. Jennifer Boysko (D) and former Virginia Secretary of Education Atif Qarni.\n\nBut on Tuesday the race came down to Subramanyam and Del. Dan Helmer (D), with Subramanyam defeating Helmer 30.3 percent to 26.7 percent.\n\nThe race became particularly ugly in its final days after sexual harassment allegations emerged against Helmer. He has denied the allegations.\n\nSubramanyam will go on to face Republican Mike Clancey in November. Democrats have an advantage in the district, which includes various Washington, D.C., suburbs and exurbs. Wexton won reelection in the district by over six points in 2022 and Biden carried the district by 19 points in2020.\n\nA candidate convicted of a misdemeanor related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol went down in a Georgia runoff seen as the latest test of voters' willingness to support a candidate linked to the insurrection.\n\nChuck Hand, who pleaded guilty to illegally demonstrating in the Capitol on Jan. 6, came in second place in last month's initial primary alongside fellow Republican Wayne Johnson, a former Trump administration official.\n\nBut Johnson pulled off a comfortable double-digit win in Tuesday's top-two contest and will go head-to-head with 16-term Democrat incumbent Rep. Sanford Bishop in November.\n\nHand is one of a small handful of candidates linked to Jan. 6 who have tried for seats in Congress this cycle, more than three years after the Capitol riots -- though they've lost out in the primary races so far this cycle.\n\nStill, political experts say support for their bids -- like the 35 percent Hand pulled in on Tuesday -- signal some in the GOP are shrugging off Jan. 6 convictions, especially as Trump lauds \"J6 warriors\" along the campaign trail and dismisses his own legal battles as politically motivated.\n\nTuesday's primaries laid bare the divisions that exist within both the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\nIn Virginia's 5th District, conservatives and Republicans were split over their support of Good and McGuire. While Trump and McCarthy were united in their quest for revenge against Good, the incumbent congressman received support from other lawmakers, including Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and even Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nVirginia Democrats also had their own contentious primary in the 10th District, which pitted Democratic figures in the state against each other. Former Gov. Ralph Northam (D) backed Filler-Corn in the race, while Wexton threw her support behind Subramanyam.\n\nBut Virginia was not the only state to see intraparty divisions. In Oklahoma, Rep. Tom Cole (R) easily defeated businessman Paul Bondar by double digits. Bondar ran to Cole's right, campaigning on impeaching Biden, tougher immigration policy and cutting financial support for Ukraine. Bondar outraised Cole during the primary, thanks to a $5 million loan he gave his campaign. Cole has held the seat for more than 20 years.", "source": {"uri": "wkbn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKBN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_mueller@wkbn.com", "name": "Julia Mueller", "type":

Tom Cole (R) easily defeated businessman Paul Bondar by double digits. Bondar ran to Cole's right, campaigning on impeaching Biden, tougher immigration policy and cutting financial support for Ukraine. Bondar outraised Cole during the primary, thanks to a $5 million loan he gave his campaign. Cole has held the seat for more than 20 years.", "source": {"uri": "wtaj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTAJ - www.wtaj.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_manchester@wtaj.com", "name": "Julia

John McGuire declared victory -- although his 327-vote lead over Rep. Bob Good will remain in doubt until we see how many mail ballots arrive before Friday's deadline and how they break.\n\nMathematically speaking, it seems doubtful that Good can make up that margin, but I can't imagine that Good will happily accede to that math.\n\nAt the moment, the McGuire-Good race is close enough to allow for a recount, but just outside the margin where the state bears the cost. Ditto the Republican primary for Vinton District supervisor in Roanoke County, where Supervisor Tammy Shepherd appears to have won by 17 votes over school board member Tim Greenway. (If the margin is between half a percentage point and 1 percentage point, the apparent loser can ask for a recount, but has to pay.)\n\nThere's a third race that's just outside the recount margin, but could slip back within that margin depending on late-arriving ballots -- in the epic struggle for Lynchburg's Ward IV council seat, incumbent Chris Faraldi appears to have defeated Peter Alexander by 21 votes, which works out to a margin of 1.04%. You can bet the Alexander side will be hoping some more mail ballots arrive.\n\nWith that set-up, our analysis of Tuesday's results begins with a great irony:\n\nAs the vote counting in the Good-McGuire race came down to the end Tuesday night, Good could hold onto hope that there were still a lot of early votes still uncounted -- and most of those were in counties he carried. Good did, indeed, win the early vote in many of those, but not by margins big enough to make up McGuire's lead.\n\nNow Good must wait on those mail ballots and Virginia's liberal laws that allow them to be counted as long as they're postmarked by the deadline on Election Day. (Of note: That's also how tax returns are handled; you just have to have it postmarked by tax day, but few people see that as a liberal provision. Imagine if you had to count on the post office to get your tax return to the Internal Revenue Service by April 15!)\n\nMcGuire led narrowly through most of the vote counting Tuesday night (Good pulled ahead briefly after Lynchburg reported) but saw an already narrow lead get even narrower as the night wore on. The final precincts to be counted came from Albemarle County.\n\nI'd long wondered how Albemarle and Charlottesville would go. They were some of the few localities in Virginia that Haley carried in the March presidential primary. What would Haley voters make of a choice between the head of the House Freedom Caucus, who called Trump the best president of his lifetime (Good), and a candidate endorsed by Trump (McGuire)? In some ways, we don't really know because it's unclear (at least to me) who the Republicans voting Tuesday in Albemarle were. In the March presidential primary, Albemarle saw 9,213 voters. On Tuesday, only 5,583 people in the county voted in the Republican primary, so we saw an awful lot of dropouts. My guess would be those no-shows included a lot of those Haley voters. In any case, of those Albemarle Republicans who did show up, Good won the majority of them. That helped him pull closer to McGuire, but not close enough.\n\nThere are lots of reasons why Good appears to have lost. Former President Donald Trump endorsed McGuire. His role in ousting House Speaker Kevin McCarthy drew lots of national money that was funneled to McGuire. We could go on and on. Geographically speaking, though, Good failed to establish a base in the heart of the 5 District in Danville and Pittsylvania County. McGuire took 62% of the vote in Danville, winning the city by 411 votes. In Pittsylvania, McGuire took 56% of the vote, and won the county by 697 votes.\n\nMcGuire had a slightly higher percentage in Powhatan County -- 62%. But that county is right next to his home county of Goochland County, where he took 61%. It doesn't surprise me that a candidate did well in and near his home. What's more surprising to me is how thoroughly Good was whipped in Danville and Pittsylvania County.\n\nLet's begin with home counties. McGuire took 61% in Goochland County; Good took 56% in Campbell County.\n\nMcGuire's state Senate district (which he's only represented since January) contains all or parts of 11 counties, 10 of which are in the 5 District. Chronologically, Good had a head start in all those counties. However, on Tuesday, McGuire beat Good in seven of them. In the three counties in his state Senate he lost, he only lost Appomattox County by three votes.\n\nThe record remains the 2014 primary in the 7 District where Dave Brat ousted incumbent Eric Cantor, who was on a path that might have made him speaker of the House someday. The contest drew 65,021 voters. It looks like this year's 5 District contest so far has 62,495 voters. By contrast, the second-biggest draw on the Republican side Tuesday night was in the 7 District on the edge of Northern Virginia, which saw 35,354 voters.\n\nGiven the closeness of the McGuire-Good race, it seems fair to say that without Trump's endorsement -- and it was both an enthusiastic endorsement of McGuire and a pretty vicious tear-down of Good -- that McGuire would not have won.\n\nLikewise, Trump's preferred candidate for the U.S. Senate nomination -- retired military officer Hung Cao -- rolled to a landslide win. Of course, it also helped that Cao had a lot more money than his opponents, but Trump's endorsement definitely lifted him out of the pack.\n\nHe implied that Staunton was \"podunk.\" He took 57.95% of the vote there. He said Abingdon was too far to drive for a campaign forum. He took 53.67% of the vote there. Just weeks before the election, the Pittsylvania County Republican Committee publicly posted that he still hadn't visited the county. He took 53.91% of the vote there. Moreover, nobody came close to him. Cao won every locality in the state and was never seriously threatened.\n\nThe McGuire-Good race seemed to pit two candidates from the MAGA world against each other, although maybe that's not so. I saw one conservative commentator (apologies for forgetting who) describe this as a contest between \"big government conservatives\" (McGuire/Trump) and a \"constitutional conservative\" (Good).\n\nThe conflicts were clear in two local races. Republicans on the Lynchburg City Council have been embroiled in a battle between two different factions, with council members Marty Misjuns and Jeff Helgeson on one side, and Mayor Stephanie Reed and Vice Mayor Faraldi on the other. Much of that is a matter of tone, with the former group being more hardline and the latter group being more moderate in tone, if not in politics. Faraldi won narrowly over the Misjuns-Helgeson candidate, but the narrow margin hardly seems likely to quiet the other side.\n\nIn Roanoke County, Supervisor Tammy Shepherd, who seems a more conventional conservative oriented toward economic development issues, narrowly defeated school board member Tim Greenway, who is certainly more of a culture warrior.\n\nA note about that race: About half the ballots there were cast early, which is high for a Republican primary. Shepherd had a clear lead until those came in; the early votes broke toward Greenway.\n\nRoanoke Democrats had a primary where four candidates were seeking three at-large nominations. The contest seemed to become less interesting when Jamaal Jackson announced he was dropping out -- then got more interesting once it was revealed that a) Jackson's campaign hadn't submitted enough valid signatures to qualify for the ballot, b) police are investigating allegations that his campaign used signatures from his unsuccessful independent run two years ago, and c) Jackson might have said he was quitting, but didn't officially withdraw, which meant he was still a legal candidate.\n\nThe Roanoke Times reports that Jackson finally delivered that official notice on Tuesday. In looking at the results, it seems likely that Jackson might have won one of the three nominations had he stayed in the race. The unofficial numbers: Phazhon Nash 2,646, Terry McGuire 2,439, Benjamin Woods 1,615, Jackson 1,143. If Jackson had stayed in the race, could he have picked up 473 votes to overtake Woods? That seems quite likely.\n\nTwo independents filed for the council race, including Treasurer Evelyn Powers, who has won five elections as a Democrat. She's also never faced opposition, so it's unclear what her vote-getting power is really like. However, she and fellow independent Cathy Reynolds will also be the only women on the ballot for the council. This is the first time in a decade that Roanoke Democrats haven't nominated a woman for the council. They've also now nominated three candidates who have never held office before. How much will Powers' candidacy roil things? If she winds up taking votes away from any of the Democratic candidates, that would help her -- but also potentially Republican candidates Nick Hagen and Jim Garrett.", "source": {"uri":

Tom Cole, the powerful chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, easily defeated four fellow Republicans, including a political unknown who loaned his campaign more than $5 million.\n\nCole had 68% of the vote at 8:33 p.m., when The Associated Press called the race. Cole withstood a flood of negative ads funded by businessman Paul Bondar, who had about 21% of the vote and faced questions about his residency. He owns a home outside Dallas, holds a Texas driver's license and voted in the Texas primary on March 5, according to a report on KFOR.\n\nThe race also drew the attention of outside groups backing Cole. Americans 4 Security PAC spent $3.1 million and Defending Main Street SuperPAC Inc. spent $346,000 against Bondar. On top of that, those two groups and five others, including the National Association of Realtors and the National Rifle Association, spent another $299,000 supporting Cole.\n\nThe race in the 4th District, which includes parts of Oklahoma City and much of south-central Oklahoma, is rated Solid Republican by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Trump, who endorsed Cole, won the district by more than 31 percentage points in 2020.\n\nNo call yet in Good battle with McGuire\n\nRep. Bob Good and state Sen. John McGuire were locked in a tight race Tuesday for the Republican nomination in Virginia's 5th District that saw some of Good's House GOP colleagues campaigning on both sides.\n\nNo call had been made in the race at 10 p.m., when less than 200 votes separated the two candidates and an estimated 88% of the vote had been counted, according to the AP.\n\nMcGuire announced his run not long after Good was one of eight Republicans who voted to oust California Rep. Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's chair last year. Good's endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the presidential primaries was also a factor in Trump endorsing McGuire, even though Good backed Trump after DeSantis dropped out.\n\nGood had support from his colleagues on the House Freedom Caucus, which he chairs, and several traveled to the district to campaign with him. But one Freedom Caucus member, Ohio Rep. Warren Davidson, bucked the group's leader and endorsed McGuire.\n\nEx-Trump aide backed for open Georgia seat\n\nBrian Jack, who served as White House political director under Trump and had his endorsement, secured the Republican nomination to an open seat in Georgia's 3rd District.\n\nJack finished first in the five-candidate field in the May 21 primary but did not clear the 50% threshold to avoid a runoff with second-place finisher, state Sen. Mike Dugan.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jack had 66% of the vote at 7:50 p.m., when the AP called the race. The largely rural district in western Georgia is represented by Republican Drew Ferguson, who announced in December that he would not seek reelection.\n\nVindman, Anderson win in Virginia's 7th\n\nEugene Vindman, a former National Security Council official whose twin brother testified during Trump's first impeachment hearings, won the Democratic nomination in Virginia's 7th District and will seek to succeed Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor in 2025.\n\nVindman had 51% of the vote in the seven-candidate field when the AP called the race at 8:06 p.m., just over an hour after polls closed. Former state Del. Elizabeth Guzman, was running second, followed by state Del. Briana Sewell and Prince William County Supervisor Andrea Bailey. The other candidates got less than 10% of the vote.\n\nVindman's national profile brought a national focus to the race and helped him dominate fundraising by raising more than $5 million. Local Democrats, meanwhile, failed to coalesce around one candidate to make it a true two-person race.\n\nThe district is likely to be competitive in November, with a race rated Tilt Democratic by Inside Elections.\n\nVindman will face Republican Derrick Anderson, a retired Green Beret who was the preferred pick of national Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nAnderson had 46% in the six-candidate field when the AP called the race at 8:58 p.m. Cameron Hamilton, a retired Navy SEAL backed by some in the party's more conservative wing, had 37%.\n\nSmasal to take on Kiggans in Virginia's 2nd\n\nMissy Cotter Smasal won the Democratic primary to challenge GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans, a freshman who flipped a Virginia Beach-area seat two years ago.\n\nSmasal was leading civil rights attorney Jeremiah Denton 68% to 32% when the AP called the race at 8:04 p.m. Smasal served in the Navy, as Kiggans did, and she currently is the executive director of a nonprofit focused on service women.\n\nKiggans has a strong fundraising advantage heading into the general election, though. She had $1.8 million on hand as of May 29, while Smasal had $368,000.\n\nThe race is rated Tilt Republican by Inside Elections.\n\nMatchup set for Wexton's seat in 10th\n\nState Sen. Suhas Subramanyam and attorney Mike Clancy won their parties' nominations in Virginia's 10th District to succeed Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton , who is retiring because of health issues.\n\nSubramanyam won a 12-way Democratic primary, besting state Del. Dan Helmer, who was the top fundraiser in the race. When the AP called the race at 9:15 p.m., Subramanyam had 30%, followed by Helmer's 27%.\n\nClancy won a four-way Republican primary, and had 61% of the vote when the AP called the race at 7:41 p.m. Marine veteran Aliscia Andrews was running second with 23%.\n\nThe race is rated Likely Democratic by Inside Elections.\n\nCao to face Kaine for Senate in Virginia\n\nRepublican Hung Cao, a Navy veteran, will challenge Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in November for a Virginia Senate seat.\n\nCao was leading the Republican primary with 68% of the vote in a five-candidate field that included Scott Parkinson, a Club for Growth vice president, when the AP called the race at 7:23 p.m.\n\nCao had Trump's support and led the Republican field in fundraising, although he'll begin the general election significantly trailing Kaine's cash on hand. Kaine had $8.6 million on hand as of May 29, dwarfing Cao's $203,000. Cao lost a House race to Rep. Jennifer Wexton in 2022.\n\nThe race is rated Solid Democratic by Inside Elections.", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island Packet"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It didn't quite go as planned.", "body": "The biggest race of Tuesday still doesn't have a winner.\n\nRep. Bob Good (R-Va.) squared off with a primary challenger backed by former President Donald Trump and has faced millions in negative ads. But it wasn't the blowout that one would expect when a candidate has nearly every major player in his party against him. Hours after the polls closed on Tuesday, the contentious battle between Good, the rabble-rousing House Freedom Caucus chair, and state Sen. John McGuire in Virginia's 5th District was far closer than widely anticipated, with a winner potentially not coming for days.\n\nAnother high-profile challenge to an incumbent in Oklahoma also fumbled, and a handful of battleground matchups were set in Virginia, setting the stage for high-dollar contests over the next five months.\n\nHere's what happened in Tuesday's busy primaries:\n\nThe coalition assembled against Good included everyone from former Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Trump, to a sitting member of the House Freedom Caucus that Good chairs. But that still wasn't enough for a decisive victory, with McGuire only narrowly leading as of early Wednesday morning, with the race too close to call.\n\nIt was a somewhat surprising result. McGuire was better-funded and had the all-powerful Trump endorsement. His struggles suggest the power of incumbency remains strong.\n\nAnd if Good does survive, he will return to Congress even more emboldened to hijack the GOP leadership's legislative agenda and endorse the primary rivals of his House colleagues.\n\nElsewhere, another GOP incumbent cruised by his challenger. Longtime Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, a major establishment figure in the House Republican conference and chair of the House Appropriations Committee, easily won reelection against his self-funding challenger Paul Bondar, clearing the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff.\n\nCole, who's been in office for more than two decades and had Trump's backing, is expected to win in this deep-red district come the fall, despite being outraised and outspent in this primary.\n\nBondar's loss is just the latest flashpoint of how challengers running to the right in safe red districts continue to falter this cycle as major GOP forces -- Trump sometimes included -- line up to block rabble-rousers who could further disrupt the caucus.\n\nIn addition to Bondar's defeat, the GOP establishment continued its winning streak, batting away potential troublemakers.\n\nIn Virginia's battleground 7th District -- which Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger is leaving to run for governor next year -- Republican Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret who unsuccessfully ran for the seat in the midterms, prevailed in a crowded GOP primary. He was the clear establishment favorite: He earned Speaker Mike Johnson's backing -- one of around two dozen challengers who earned his support this year -- and the House GOP leadership-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund spent more than $100,000 boosting him in the primary.\n\nMeanwhile, his most prominent challenger, former Navy SEAL Cameron Hamilton, had the backing of members of the Freedom Caucus. He came in second place.\n\nNational Republicans are working to ensure that they avoid the candidate quality issue they encountered in the midterms -- especially in battlegrounds, where candidates further to the right may struggle in the general election -- and have been mostly successful.\n\nBut there are future tests on the horizon, as soon as next week. The Congressional Leadership Fund this week began spending in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, a red-leaning seat, to block Ron Hanks, a Republican candidate with a controversial past who could put what might otherwise be an uncompetitive seat into play for Democrats. Democrat Adam Frisch, who gained national attention after almost flipping the seat from Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert in the midterms, is running for the district again, and national Democrats have tried to boost Hanks.\n\nTrump, who has largely been on the same page with party leadership when it comes to endorsing candidates, notched another clout-boosting win with Hung Cao, who will be facing Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in Virginia in the fall. (Trump has had a mostly strong endorsement record, despite a few losses in recent weeks.) Kaine is the early favorite, but Trump has contended the state will be competitive in the fall.\n\nAnd Trump's candidate of choice -- his former aide, Brian Jack -- was also victorious in the runoff for Georgia's 3rd District, a deep-red seat that almost assuredly guarantees he'll join the Republican ranks.\n\nBut it wasn't just the Republican establishment that had a good night.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's candidate of choice, veteran Missy Cotter Smasal, overwhelmingly won the Democratic primary in Virginia's swingy 2nd District to take on Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans, one of the handful of Republicans who represent a district that President Joe Biden won in 2020. Kiggans begins the general election with a strong financial advantage.\n\nAnd in Virginia's 10th District, a blue seat, outgoing Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton's candidate of choice -- state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam -- won, defeating a busy field. He'll be the favorite when he faces Republican tech executive Mike Clancy in the fall.\n\nEugene Vindman, a former national security official and Trump-era whistleblower who helped spark the former president's first impeachment, clinched the Democratic nod in Virginia's 7th District and will face Anderson.\n\nVindman is one of the nation's top fundraisers, appealing to party donors -- largely from outside of the state, which is a rarity for a first-time candidate -- with his story of upholding democracy during the Trump era. Throughout his campaign, he noted that he \"sacrificed his military career\" to take on Trump.\n\nVindman's win -- and national appeal -- is a reassuring sign for Democrats who are continuing to rely on democracy messaging and are wondering about its salience more than three years after the Capitol riot. Biden's campaign is heavily leaning into such messaging, just last week attacking Trump over the riot and accusing him of wanting to \"burn\" democracy down.\n\nVindman wasn't the only down-ballot Democratic candidate who centered democracy messaging. Earlier this year, former Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, who gained prominence after testifying before the Jan. 6 select committee, lost his bid in Maryland's 3rd District. Still, Biden's campaign is using Dunn as a surrogate out on the trail, demonstrating how the president's team views this as a core message.\n\nVindman earned just under a majority of the vote with a half-dozen other candidates on the ballot, including former state Del. Elizabeth Guzm\u00e1n, state Del. Briana Sewell and county supervisors Margaret Franklin and Andrea Bailey -- all women of color.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Bob Good's seat in Virginia's 5th Congressional District. The contest had boiled over into one of the most tumultuous primaries of the cycle so far, as Donald Trump and Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) sought to make Good the first incumbent to lose to an outside challenger. But as of Tuesday night, the race was still too close to call, with Good and his rival separated by hundreds of votes.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats grappled with their own fraught primary in Virginia, while Rep. Tom Cole (R) fended off several primary challengers for the GOP nod in Oklahoma.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Tuesday night's primaries:\n\nTrump's bid for revenge ends in a nailbiter\n\nGood, the chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was seen by many as a dead man walking heading into his primary against Virginia state. Sen John McGuire on Tuesday night, especially since Good had run afoul of Trump.\n\nBut as midnight approached, the candidates were neck-and-neck, with the race too close to call. If Good ultimately wins, it would be a major upset and an embarrassing defeat for both Trump and McCarthy.\n\nThe incumbent angered Trump when he backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for the Republican presidential nomination last year. While Good later endorsed Trump when DeSantis left the race, the former president argued the backing came too late.\n\nAs a result, Trump threw his support behind McGuire, who also won the backing of McCarthy's Majority Committee PAC after Good voted to oust the former Speaker last year.\n\nIt's unclear who will ultimately prevail, with some late mail ballots and a possible recount later this week adding to the uncertainty. The results of the race might not be known for days.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that Good's primary has turned into one of the most fraught and memorable contests of the cycle so far.\n\nAn under-the-radar Senate matchup is set\n\nRet. Navy Capt. Hung Cao sailed to victory in Virginia's GOP Senate primary, easily defeating four other Republicans.\n\nCao will go on to face incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) in November, a race seen as an uphill battle for Republicans. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the seat as \"solid Democrat.\"\n\nStill, Republicans are heartened by signs of weakness for President Biden in the commonwealth, raising the possibility of a down-ballot upset as well.\n\nDefeating Kaine will be no easy feat, however. In addition to serving in the Senate since 2013, Kaine also has Virginia governor, lieutenant governor and mayor of Richmond on his resume. On top of that, he served as chair of the Democratic National Committee and was Hillary Clinton's running mate in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut Republicans are optimistic for Cao, a familiar face in Virginia politics. He challenged Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) in Virginia's 10th Congressional District 2022, but lost after the district became even more blue-leaning following redistricting.\n\nRepublicans point to recent polling coming out of Virginia showing a tighter-than-expected race between Biden and Trump. A Fox News survey released earlier this month showed the two tied at 48 percent. Additionally, The Hill's Decision Desk HQ polling average has Trump narrowly leading Biden by .2 percent.\n\nThe polling should be alarming for Democrats, who have carried Virginia at the presidential level since former President Obama won the state in 2008. But Republicans say the polls show there is opportunity for Trump, and by extension Cao, in the state.\n\nAn ugly Dem primary comes to an end\n\nVirginia state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam (D) beat out 11 other candidates in the Democratic primary to replace Wexton in Virginia's 10th Congressional District.\n\nWexton backed Subramanyam, giving him momentum going into the crowded primary. The intraparty contest featured a number of well-known Virginia Democrats, including former House of Delegates Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn (D), state Sen. Jennifer Boysko (D) and former Virginia Secretary of Education Atif Qarni.\n\nBut on Tuesday the race came down to Subramanyam and Del. Dan Helmer (D), with Subramanyam defeating Helmer 30.3 percent to 26.7 percent.\n\nThe race became particularly ugly in its final days after sexual harassment allegations emerged against Helmer. He has denied the allegations.\n\nSubramanyam will go on to face Republican Mike Clancey in November. Democrats have an advantage in the district, which includes various Washington, D.C., suburbs and exurbs. Wexton won reelection in the district by over six points in 2022 and Biden carried the district by 19 points in2020.\n\nAnother Jan. 6 candidate goes down\n\nA candidate convicted of a misdemeanor related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol went down in a Georgia runoff seen as the latest test of voters' willingness to support a candidate linked to the insurrection.\n\nChuck Hand, who pleaded guilty to illegally demonstrating in the Capitol on Jan. 6, came in second place in last month's initial primary alongside fellow Republican Wayne Johnson, a former Trump administration official.\n\nBut Johnson pulled off a comfortable double-digit win in Tuesday's top-two contest and will go head-to-head with 16-term Democrat incumbent Rep. Sanford Bishop in November.\n\nHand is one of a small handful of candidates linked to Jan. 6 who have tried for seats in Congress this cycle, more than three years after the Capitol riots -- though they've lost out in the primary races so far this cycle.\n\nStill, political experts say support for their bids -- like the 35 percent Hand pulled in on Tuesday -- signal some in the GOP are shrugging off Jan. 6 convictions, especially as Trump lauds \"J6 warriors\" along the campaign trail and dismisses his own legal battles as politically motivated.\n\nBoth parties are grappling with divisions\n\nTuesday's primaries laid bare the divisions that exist within both the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\nIn Virginia's 5th District, conservatives and Republicans were split over their support of Good and McGuire. While Trump and McCarthy were united in their quest for revenge against Good, the incumbent congressman received support from other lawmakers, including Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and even Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nVirginia Democrats also had their own contentious primary in the 10th District, which pitted Democratic figures in the state against each other. Former Gov. Ralph Northam (D) backed Filler-Corn in the race, while Wexton threw her support behind Subramanyam.\n\nBut Virginia was not the only state to see intraparty divisions. In Oklahoma, Rep. Tom Cole (R) easily defeated businessman Paul Bondar by double digits. Bondar ran to Cole's right, campaigning on impeaching Biden, tougher immigration policy and cutting financial support for Ukraine. Bondar outraised Cole during the primary, thanks to a $5 million loan he gave his campaign. Cole has held the seat for more than 20 years.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

Bob Good could be the first big loser.", "body": "Incumbents have had a strong showing so far this cycle. That could change this week.\n\nTwo House Republicans from different ends of the ideological spectrum face primary challenges Tuesday: one, Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, is a longtime establishment figure, while the other, Virginia Rep. Bob Good, leads the party's rabble-rousing faction. And with millions of dollars poured into the efforts to oust them, either could become the first member of Congress this year to be kicked out by an outside challenger.\n\nGood's race has drawn the most national attention and attracted about $15 million in spending. It's stop No. 2 on former Speaker Kevin McCarthy's revenge tour, which stumbled out of the gate last week when his deep-pocketed operation was unable to take down Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.). Both she and Good were among the eight Republicans who voted to strip McCarthy of his gavel, and he has been working to boost their primary opponents.\n\nCongressional battlegrounds will also be set in Virginia, and a trio of Georgia House primary runoffs are taking place.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump endorsed his opponent, state Sen. John McGuire (and held a tele-town hall for him Monday), primarily as payback for Good's initial endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the presidential primary. One member of the Freedom Caucus, which Good chairs, backed McGuire, too. And other members of the GOP conference are actively campaigning against the incumbent -- a response to him endorsing primary challengers to his colleagues.\n\nHe's getting outraised and outspent on the airwaves, and he has McCarthy hounding him as revenge for his vote to remove him from the speakership. In all, McGuire and anti-Good groups have spent around $9 million on advertisements, according to ad tracker AdImpact. Meanwhile, Good, who has been boosted by the Club for Growth and the Freedom Caucus' political arm, has benefited from more than $5 million in outside spending.\n\nGood has never faced a primary before the broader electorate in his congressional career. When he defeated then-Rep. Denver Riggleman for the GOP nomination in 2020, that was in a nominating convention with tuned-in party activists. A convention was held for the 2022 primary, as well.\n\nStill, this cycle has proved that it is extremely difficult to oust an incumbent. No outside challenger has defeated a sitting member of Congress in a primary so far this year. (The only incumbent to lose so far has been Rep. Jerry Carl (R-Ala.), who was ousted by fellow Republican Rep. Barry Moore in a rare member-on-member primary.) But this is the first case where so many forces -- including Trump, one of the biggest GOP influences -- are against the incumbent, creating an unprecedented dynamic.\n\nThe general election matchup for two battleground seats will also be set.\n\nThe 7th District, which Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger is leaving to run for governor next year, would have gone for President Joe Biden by around 6 points in 2020. Eugene Vindman, a former national security official and Trump-era whistleblower who helped spark the former president's first impeachment, has pulled ahead of the crowded Democratic primary on the fundraising front, thanks in part to his appeal to party donors with his democracy-focused messaging. He's facing Andrea Bailey, a county supervisor, and former state Del. Elizabeth Guzman, among others.\n\nA handful of Republicans are running in the GOP primary, including Speaker Mike Johnson-backed Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret who came in second place in the GOP primary for the seat in the midterms. But as in many GOP primaries this cycle, there is an intraparty divide; Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL, has the backing of members of the Freedom Caucus, as well as Sen. Rand Paul's (R-Ky.) super PAC.\n\nAnd in the 2nd District, another battleground seat, Democrats Missy Cotter Smasal, a veteran, and Jake Denton, an attorney, are competing to take on GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans, one of the handful of Republicans representing a district that Biden would have won in 2020. Cotter Smasal has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nOver in the 10th District, it's a Democratic free-for-all in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton. Biden would have won the seat by close to 20 points in 2020.\n\nWexton is backing state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, who's up against a crowded field including state Del. Dan Helmer, former Department of Defense official Krystle Kaul, former state House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn and state Sen. Jennifer Boysko.\n\nHelmer has benefited the most from outside spending. But a woman accused him in the closing days of the race of groping her at an event six years ago -- which he denies -- and other candidates called on him to drop out of the race.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine will also find out his general election competitor. Republican Hung Cao, Spanberger's unsuccessful 2022 foe, far outpaces his primary opponents in fundraising and has Trump's backing. Although Kaine is the favorite in November, the top-of-ticket could have an impact, as Trump has claimed that he'll be competitive in the state.\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m. EST.\n\nAn insurgent candidate is betting big -- more than $5 million -- on his campaign to unseat Cole in this safe GOP district.\n\nBusinessperson Paul Bondar has loaned himself a massive sum amid his primary effort, and has spent $4.6 million on advertisements ahead of the primary. Bondar has gone after Cole, the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, for being a \"career politician\" and not being conservative enough, pointing in part to his support of Ukraine aid.\n\nCole and his allies have pushed back, primarily with attacks regarding Bondar's residency and his ties to Texas. Cole and Americans 4 Security PAC, an outside group supporting him, have spent around $5.6 million combined on advertisements.\n\nComplicating Bondar's path to victory is the coveted Trump endorsement, which Cole claimed. If no candidate earns a majority of the vote (three other candidates are on the ballot), a runoff primary election will be held in August.\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m. EST.\n\nA Republican primary runoff in a safe-red seat will all but determine one of the newest members of the GOP ranks.\n\nIn Georgia's 3rd District, a seat that Trump would have won by 30 points in 2020, Brian Jack, a former Trump staffer who has the backing of the former president, is facing off against former state Sen. Mike Dugan to replace retiring Republican Rep. Drew Ferguson.

Ron DeSantis for president, and he's on McCarthy's radar as one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust the former speaker late last year.\n\nMillions of dollars in ads have blanketed the 5th District airwaves, with McCarthy allies targeting Good. The two-term incumbent, meanwhile, has gotten boosts from outside groups tied to the Freedom Caucus, Club for Growth Action and Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nOklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole is also on defense Tuesday, with his chief primary opponent, businessman Paul Bondar, spending millions of dollars of his own money on the race. Cole and his allies have accused Bondar, who owns property in Oklahoma but not in the district, of actually being a Texan, leveraging the bitter rivalry between the Texas Longhorns and the Oklahoma Sooners.\n\nTuesday's primaries will also set key matchups in a handful of competitive seats in Virginia: Democrats are picking a candidate to take on Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans in the 2nd District, and both parties are picking their nominees in the open 7th and 10th Districts.\n\nGeorgia will also hold its primary runoffs in races where no candidate won a majority of the primary vote back in March.\n\nIn the Democratic-leaning 2nd District, activist Chuck Hand, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense in connection with the attack on Jan. 6, 2021, is competing for the GOP nod. And Trump's former White House political director, Brian Jack, is looking to win the GOP runoff in the ruby red 3rd District.\n\nPolls close in Georgia and Virginia at 7 p.m. ET and at 8 p.m. ET in

John McGuire, R-Goochland, eked out a narrow 315 vote lead over Rep. Bob Good, R-5th.\n\nWith all Election Day, early voting and mail-in ballots counted, McGuire has a 0.5 percentage point lead, which is the point where a recount if requested is paid for by the state.\n\nMcGuire won 31,370 votes to Good's 31,055, according to the state Department of Election's unofficial count.\n\nIn Virginia, candidates can ask for recounts when the gap is 1 percentage point or less, but the candidate must pick up the cost when the gap is between 0.5 and 1 percentage point.\n\nOver the next few days, local Electoral Boards will check and double check Tuesday night's unofficial results, while ballots mailed by Election Day but not yet arrived as well as provisional ballots - typically those cast by voters who did not have proper ID or who showed up at the wrong precinct - are still to be counted. The boards are supposed to certify results by Friday.\n\n\"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory,\" McGuire said in a statement several hours after the polls closed.\n\n\"I look forward to working with Trump to beat Joe Biden in November and pass Trump's agenda in Congress. Trump and McGuire will Make America Great Again.\"\n\n\"Right now, we're still waiting on the final election results of today's primary,\" Good said in a message to supporters last night.\n\n\"We implemented the best early voting operation that the 5th District has ever seen, and we are still waiting for the results of mail-in ballots and provisional ballots. We are doing what we can to ensure we have teams of observers and legal counsel to ensure all the votes are properly counted in the coming days,\" he said.\n\nGood beat McGuire in his Lynchburg and Campbell County home base, racking up margins as high at 56% and 59% of votes cast, and also led in Charlottesville and Albemarle county. McGuire won 60 percent-plus margins in the parts of the district nearest Richmond, including his Goochland County home as well as Louisa, Powhatan and parts of Hanover counties.\n\nEarly voters gave Good 5,800 to 5,000 edge over McGuire, who won about 1,000 votes more on Election Day. Trump's endorsement came late last month.\n\n\"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back sort of like he did with me,\" Trump told a tele-rally for McGuire on the eve of the primary.\n\nTurnout in the 5th District, at more than 62,000 votes, dwarfed voting Virginia's the other House primary races, where turnout was mostly under 30,000 votes cast.", "source": {"uri":

Tom Cole (R) faces a primary challenge from the right. In Georgia, a candidate convicted of a misdemeanor for illegally demonstrating inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, made it through to the runoff.\n\nRaces across the three states will test incumbents' staying power and the potency behind former President Trump's endorsement as they set up critical November match-ups.\n\nHere are five things to watch.\n\nA contentious primary in Virginia could see the first House incumbent loss to a primary challenger this year as Good fights to hold on to his 5th Congressional District seat.\n\nRep. Jerry Carl (R-Ala.) was the first House lawmaker to lose his reelection bid when he lost to Rep. Barry Moore (R-Ala.) in an incumbent-on-incumbent primary prompted by redistricting in Alabama, but House incumbents have otherwise been on a winning streak in their primaries so far.\n\nBut that may change Tuesday night with Good's race. The conservative lawmaker drew the former president's ire when he initially endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in the GOP White House primary. Though he backed Trump after DeSantis left the presidential race, Trump argued the support came \"too late.\"\n\nGood's rival, state Sen. John McGuire (R), now heads into Tuesday with Trump's endorsement, plus support from former Speaker Kevin McCarthy's (R-Calif.) Majority Committee PAC. The incumbent got on the ex-Speaker's bad side when he joined seven other Republicans and all Democrats to remove McCarthy from his top House leadership role last year.\n\nMost recently, a member of the Freedom Caucus that Good chairs, Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), backed McGuire, a stunning move that underscores the political danger the Virginia Republican is.\n\nStill, Good has some high-profile backers of his own, including Trump's on-again, off-again ally Steve Bannon, who stumped for the incumbent in Virginia earlier this month.\n\nWith so many knives out for Good, it seems possible he could become the first lawmaker to lose to a nonincumbent this cycle.\n\nThe presidential primaries have wrapped up, but the presumptive White House nominees loom large as contests continue to test their endorsement power.\n\nWhile Trump is behind McGuire in Virginia, he's backing incumbent Cole in Oklahoma. Cole, an 11-term incumbent and the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, faces a competitive challenge from well-funded businessman Paul Bondar.\n\nIn Georgia's 3rd Congressional District, former Trump White House political director Brian Jack is running against former state Senate Majority Leader Mike Dugan to replace retiring Rep. Drew Ferguson (R).\n\nJack boasts Trump's endorsement, but failed to cross the 50-point mark to avoid a runoff in last month's primary. The winner of Tuesday's runoff will go up against Democrat Maura Keller in November.\n\nTuesday's races will again gauge whether the former president's backing is enough to get his picks over the primary finish line.\n\nA primary runoff in Georgia's 2nd Congressional District will be the latest test of whether voters are willing to back a candidate involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Sanford Bishop, a 16-term incumbent, is set to face off in the fall against either Wayne Johnson, a former Trump administration official, or Chuck Hand, who was convicted of a misdemeanor for illegally demonstrating inside the Capitol during the riots.\n\nJohnson emerged from last month's Republican primary with roughly 44 percent of the vote, under the 50-point mark needed to avoid a runoff. Hand notched 32 percent, and though strategists say Bishop is positioned to hold on to his historically blue seat in November, experts say Hand's support is a notable metric about voter sentiments toward Jan. 6.\n\nPolling indicates Republican disapproval of the riots is waning, and Trump has praised \"J6 warriors\" along the campaign trail. As the former president decries his own legal battles as politically motivated, some in the GOP may be willing to look past a Jan. 6 conviction.\n\nThe contested primaries across the three states voting on Tuesday could come down to the wire, and even prompt runoff races in Oklahoma.\n\nOklahoma, like Georgia, has a majority threshold to win the primary. In competitive races like Cole's in the 4th Congressional District -- where five candidates are competing for the GOP nomination -- the contest could be pushed into an August runoff.\n\nA recent survey of Good's primary, conducted by the Virginia Faith and Freedom Coalition, found McGuire with a 10-point lead, according to local outlet WSET, but another 30 percent of voters were still undecided.\n\nAlso in Virginia, candidates surged into the races to replace two outgoing congresswomen, setting up competitive primaries on both sides of the aisle. Half a dozen Republicans and seven Democrats are vying to succeed Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D), who is running for governor. The contest for retiring Rep. Jennifer Wexton's (D) seat, meanwhile, has drawn a dozen Democratic candidates and four competitors on the GOP side.\n\nThe margins in these contested primaries could offer clues as to how divided both parties are heading into November.\n\nOklahoma and Virginia both held their presidential primaries on Super Tuesday back in March, and low turnout for the White House contest in both states has raised concerns for the rest of the election year.\n\nThe Sooner State saw Super Tuesday turnout down from 2020, with a significant drop among Democrats, according to The Oklahoman, falling from more than 300,000 blue voters in last cycle's primary to roughly 91,000 this spring.\n\nIn Virginia, turnout was at just 6 percent among Democrats and 11 percent among Republicans during the state's Super Tuesday primary, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project.\n\nBut the White House primary race was an unusual one, with Biden and Trump both long seen as the inevitable nominees for their respective parties, which could be a positive sign for nonpresidential primaries.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) said last month that the Peach State saw higher turnout in its congressional contests last month than in its presidential primaries in May. Experts said Tuesday's runoff turnout, however, isn't expected to break any records.\n\nIn states with highly competitive races, turnout will be key to tipping the scales up and down the ballot. How many voters turn out in both the Democratic and GOP primaries could offer insight into how much voters enthusiasm there is ahead of the fall.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Bob Good could be the first big loser.", "body": "Good's race has drawn the most national attention and attracted about $15 million in spending. It's stop No. 2 on former Speaker Kevin McCarthy's revenge tour, which stumbled out of the gate last week when his deep-pocketed operation was unable to take down Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.). Both she and Good were among the eight Republicans who voted to strip McCarthy of his gavel, and he has been working to boost their primary opponents.\n\nCongressional battlegrounds will also be set in Virginia, and a trio of Georgia House primary runoffs are taking place.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump endorsed his opponent, state Sen. John McGuire (and held a tele-town hall for him Monday), primarily as payback for Good's initial endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the presidential primary. One member of the Freedom Caucus, which Good chairs, backed McGuire, too. And other members of the GOP conference are actively campaigning against the incumbent -- a response to him endorsing primary challengers to his colleagues.\n\nHe's getting outraised and outspent on the airwaves, and he has McCarthy hounding him as revenge for his vote to remove him from the speakership. In all, McGuire and anti-Good groups have spent around $9 million on advertisements, according to ad tracker AdImpact. Meanwhile, Good, who has been boosted by the Club for Growth and the Freedom Caucus' political arm, has benefited from more than $5 million in outside spending.\n\nGood has never faced a primary before the broader electorate in his congressional career. When he defeated then-Rep. Denver Riggleman for the GOP nomination in 2020, that was in a nominating convention with tuned-in party activists. A convention was held for the 2022 primary, as well.\n\nStill, this cycle has proved that it is extremely difficult to oust an incumbent. No outside challenger has defeated a sitting member of Congress in a primary so far this year. (The only incumbent to lose so far has been Rep. Jerry Carl (R-Ala.), who was ousted by fellow Republican Rep. Barry Moore in a rare member-on-member primary.) But this is the first case where so many forces -- including Trump, one of the biggest GOP influences -- are against the incumbent, creating an unprecedented dynamic.\n\nThe general election matchup for two battleground seats will also be set.\n\nThe 7th District, which Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger is leaving to run for governor next year, would have gone for President Joe Biden by around 6 points in 2020. Eugene Vindman, a former national security official and Trump-era whistleblower who helped spark the former president's first impeachment, has pulled ahead of the crowded Democratic primary on the fundraising front, thanks in part to his appeal to party donors with his democracy-focused messaging. He's facing Andrea Bailey, a county supervisor, and former state Del. Elizabeth Guzman, among others.\n\nA handful of Republicans are running in the GOP primary, including Speaker Mike Johnson-backed Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret who came in second place in the GOP primary for the seat in the midterms. But as in many GOP primaries this cycle, there is an intraparty divide; Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL, has the backing of members of the Freedom Caucus, as well as Sen. Rand Paul's (R-Ky.) super PAC.\n\nAnd in the 2nd District, another battleground seat, Democrats Missy Cotter Smasal, a veteran, and Jake Denton, an attorney, are competing to take on GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans, one of the handful of Republicans representing a district that Biden would have won in 2020. Cotter Smasal has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nOver in the 10th District, it's a Democratic free-for-all in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton. Biden would have won the seat by close to 20 points in 2020.\n\nWexton is backing state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, who's up against a crowded field including state Del. Dan Helmer, former Department of Defense official Krystle Kaul, former state House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn and state Sen. Jennifer Boysko.\n\nHelmer has benefited the most from outside spending. But a woman accused him in the closing days of the race of groping her at an event six years ago -- which he denies -- and other candidates called on him to drop out of the race.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine will also find out his general election competitor. Republican Hung Cao, Spanberger's unsuccessful 2022 foe, far outpaces his primary opponents in fundraising and has Trump's backing. Although Kaine is the favorite in November, the top-of-ticket could have an impact, as Trump has claimed that he'll be competitive in the state.\n\nAn insurgent candidate is betting big -- more than $5 million -- on his campaign to unseat Cole in this safe GOP district.\n\nBusinessperson Paul Bondar has loaned himself a massive sum amid his primary effort, and has spent $4.6 million on advertisements ahead of the primary. Bondar has gone after Cole, the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, for being a \"career politician\" and not being conservative enough, pointing in part to his support of Ukraine aid.\n\nCole and his allies have pushed back, primarily with attacks regarding Bondar's residency and his ties to Texas. Cole and Americans 4 Security PAC, an outside group supporting him, have spent around $5.6 million combined on advertisements.\n\nComplicating Bondar's path to victory is the coveted Trump endorsement, which Cole claimed. If no candidate earns a majority of the vote (three other candidates are on the ballot), a runoff primary election will be held in August.\n\nA Republican primary runoff in a safe-red seat will all but determine one of the newest members of the GOP ranks.\n\nIn Georgia's 3rd District, a seat that Trump would have won by 30 points in 2020, Brian Jack, a former Trump staffer who has the backing of the former president, is facing off against former state Sen. Mike Dugan to replace retiring Republican Rep. Drew Ferguson. Jack finished more than 20 points ahead of Dugan in last month's primary but was a couple points shy of hitting the 50 percent threshold to win outright and avoid a runoff.\n\nTwo other primary runoffs are taking place, although the eventual winners of the GOP runoff in the blue 2nd District and Democratic runoff in GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's red 14th District aren't likely to win in the fall.\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m. EST.\n\nA version of this story first appeared in POLITICO Pro's Morning Score newsletter.

John McGuire, is backed by some of Good's own House colleagues as well as Trump and McCarthy.\n\nGood drew Trump's ire by endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president, and he's on McCarthy's radar as one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust the former speaker late last year.\n\nMillions of dollars in ads have blanketed the 5th District airwaves, with McCarthy allies targeting Good. The two-term incumbent, meanwhile, has gotten boosts from outside groups tied to the Freedom Caucus, Club for Growth Action and Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nOklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole is also on defense Tuesday, with his chief primary opponent, businessman Paul Bondar, spending millions of dollars of his own money on the race. Cole and his allies have accused Bondar, who owns property in Oklahoma but not in the district, of actually being a Texan, leveraging the bitter rivalry between the Texas Longhorns and the Oklahoma Sooners.\n\nTuesday's primaries will also set key matchups in a handful of competitive seats in Virginia: Democrats are picking a candidate to take on Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans in the 2nd District, and both parties are picking their nominees in the open 7th and 10th Districts.\n\nGeorgia will also hold its primary runoffs in races where no candidate won a majority of the primary vote back in March.\n\nIn the Democratic-leaning 2nd District, activist Chuck Hand, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense in connection with the attack on Jan. 6, 2021, is competing for the GOP nod. And Trump's former White House political director, Brian Jack, is looking to win the GOP runoff in the ruby red 3rd District.\n\nPolls close in Georgia and Virginia at 7 p.m. ET and at 8 p.m. ET in Oklahoma.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Good", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

Polls close in Virginia and Georgia at 7 p.m. ET and 8 p.m. ET in Oklahoma.\n\nThe most closely watched battle Tuesday figures to be in Virginia, where incumbent Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, is facing a strong and bitter challenge from state Sen. John McGuire, who has the endorsement of former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Unlike Bob Good, John McGuire will not let you down,\" Trump said in an 11th hour robocall Monday night, adding McGuire is \"strong on the border\" and \"will always defend your under-siege Second Amendment.\"\n\nGood got sideways with Trump by endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential primary, only endorsing Trump once DeSantis suspended his campaign; however, Good has myriad endorsements of his own, including former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.\n\nPolling on the contest has been erratic; WPA Intelligence showed McGuire with a 41% to 31% lead, and Neighborhood Research and Media gave Good a 39%-30% lead.\n\nThe district is rated solid Republican.\n\nIn Virginia's 7th, incumbent Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., opted against reelection for a run at governor in 2025. Seven Democrats are in the running for the seat rated slightly blue, led by political newcomer Eugene Vindman, the former National Security Council adviser whose twin brother, Alex, heard Trump's July 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the basis for the former president's first impeachment.\n\nVindman is polling at 43% and expected to prevail.\n\nThere are six Republicans vying for the nod in Tuesday's primary, though just two have had significant fundraising -- Derrick Anderson and Cameron Hamilton. Republicans see this seat as one they can flip behind either Anderson or Hamilton.\n\nDown in Georgia, the 3rd Congressional District features a GOP runoff between Trump adviser Brian Jack and former state Senate Majority Leader Mike Dugan to replace outgoing four-term Rep. Drew Ferguson, R-Ga. Jack worked on Trump's campaign in 2016 and was his political director in the White House for four years.\n\nJack got 46.7% of the vote in the primary, prompting the runoff against Dugan, who earned 32% in the primary. The winner will take on Maura Keller in November in the \"safe Republican\" district.\n\nAbout NEWSMAX TV:\n\nNEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America!\n\nFind Newsmax channel in your home via cable and satellite systems - More Info Here Watch Newsmax+ on your home TV app or smartphone and watch it anywhere!

John McGuire, R-Goochland, eked out a narrow 315 vote lead over Rep. Bob Good, R-5th.\n\nWith all Election Day, early voting and mail-in ballots counted, McGuire has a 0.5 percentage point lead, which is the point where a recount if requested is paid for by the state.\n\nMcGuire won 31,370 votes to Good's 31,055, according to the state Department of Election's unofficial count.\n\nIn Virginia, candidates can ask for recounts when the gap is 1 percentage point or less, but the candidate must pick up the cost when the gap is between 0.5 and 1 percentage point.\n\nOver the next few days, local Electoral Boards will check and double check Tuesday night's unofficial results, while ballots mailed by Election Day but not yet arrived as well as provisional ballots - typically those cast by voters who did not have proper ID or who showed up at the wrong precinct - are still to be counted. The boards are supposed to certify results by Friday.\n\n\"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory,\" McGuire said in a statement several hours after the polls closed.\n\n\"I look forward to working with Trump to beat Joe Biden in November and pass Trump's agenda in Congress. Trump and McGuire will Make America Great Again.\"\n\n\"Right now, we're still waiting on the final election results of today's primary,\" Good said in a message to supporters last night.\n\n\"We implemented the best early voting operation that the 5th District has ever seen, and we are still waiting for the results of mail-in ballots and provisional ballots. We are doing what we can to ensure we have teams of observers and legal counsel to ensure all the votes are properly counted in the coming days,\" he said.\n\nGood beat McGuire in his Lynchburg and Campbell County home base, racking up margins as high at 56% and 59% of votes cast, and also led in Charlottesville and Albemarle county. McGuire won 60 percent-plus margins in the parts of the district nearest Richmond, including his Goochland County home as well as Louisa, Powhatan and parts of Hanover counties.\n\nEarly voters gave Good 5,800 to 5,000 edge over McGuire, who won about 1,000 votes more on Election Day. Trump's endorsement came late last month.\n\n\"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back sort of like he did with me,\" Trump told a tele-rally for McGuire on the eve of the primary.\n\nTurnout in the 5th District, at more than 62,000 votes, dwarfed voting Virginia's the other House primary races, where turnout was mostly under 30,000 votes cast.\n\nDave Ress (804)

John McGuire as the vote-counting stretched into the late hours.\n\nElsewhere, voters in Virginia, Oklahoma, and Georgia helped set fall matchups with a series of primaries in both competitive and safe House districts.\n\nHere are the Washington Examiner's top takeaways from Tuesday's primaries.\n\nBob Good endures nail-biter election\n\nThe embattled Good, who faced opposition from Trump but also an unorthodox coalition of House lawmakers, traded the lead with McGuire as results trickled in on Tuesday night. With less than a half point separating the two candidates around midnight, the race could be headed to a recount.\n\nAccording to Virginia law, a recount can be requested if the final tally is within 1 percentage point.\n\n\"No matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right. Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now,\" Good wrote on X as the race was still being decided.\n\nTrump has held a grudge against Good for endorsing his GOP presidential rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL). Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy also sought to oust the Freedom Caucus chairman after he was one of eight Republicans who voted to remove him from the speakership.\n\nMcGuire appeared to declare victory at his watch party in Virginia, saying \"it is an honor to be your Republican nominee,\" but no outlets have yet to declare the race for either candidate.\n\nOklahoma incumbents win their primaries\n\nCole, a longtime House member, defeated self-funding businessman Paul Bondar and three other candidates. Bondar, a political novice, invested $5 million of his fortune to unseat Cole, who has spent $3.1 million on the campaign.\n\nBut it wasn't nearly enough to take down Cole, who won 65% of the vote with 87% of ballots counted, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIncumbent Rep. Frank Lucas (R-OK) comfortably defeated two Republican challengers in Oklahoma's 3rd District Tuesday night. The Associated Press called the race for Lucas, who won nearly 73.1% with 88% of votes counted, less than 20 minutes after polls closed.\n\nRobin Carder and Darren Hamilton were hoping to unseat Lucas, who has been in Congress since 1994 and is chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.\n\nIncumbent Rep. Kevin Hern (R-OK) also easily defeated a Republican challenger in Oklahoma's 1st District. The Associated Press called the race for Hern, who won 86.7% with 54% of votes counted, also nearly 20 minutes after polls closed.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene gets a Democratic challenger\n\nDemocrats in Georgia's 14th District selected Shawn \"General\" Harris as the candidate who will face Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) in November.\n\nThe Associated Press called the primary runoff for Harris roughly 20 minutes after polls closed at 7 p.m. Eastern. Harris won 69% of the vote compared to Democrat Clarence Blalock's 31%, with 98% of votes counted.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nHarris faces a steep climb in unseating Greene during the general election. The Cook Political Report rates the seat R+22.\n\nShowdowns set in competitive Virginia House races\n\nArmy veteran Eugene Vindman won the Democratic primary in Virginia's 7th Congressional District to succeed outgoing Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA).\n\nSpanberger is stepping down from Congress to run for governor, but the swing district is a top seat House Republicans are hoping to flip in November.\n\nVindman, who won 49.3% with 92% of the vote counted, will face Republican Derrick Anderson in November. The army veteran is perhaps best known, along with his twin brother Alexander Vindman, for reporting a 2019 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to Trump's first impeachment.\n\nElsewhere, Navy veteran Missy Cotter Smasal won the Democratic primary for Virginia's 2nd District, defeating fellow Democrat Jeremiah Denton.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race at 8:04 p.m., with Smasal winning nearly 70% of the vote compared to Denton's 29.9% with 61% of votes counted.\n\nSmasal, who is supported by former Democratic Govs. Ralph Northam and Terry McAuliffe, seeks to unseat Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) in a district that President Joe Biden narrowly won in 2022.\n\nIn the Old Dominion's 10th District, state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam won the Democratic primary to succeed outgoing Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-VA).\n\nSubramanyam won 30.3% of the vote with 93% of ballots counted, per the Associated Press. Wexton's Parkinson's disease has severely curtailed her ability to speak and led to the congresswoman deciding against another term. She had supported Subramanyam in the primary that featured 12 candidates in total.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine to face Republican Hung Cao\n\nNavy veteran Hung Cao easily won a Republican Senate primary in Virginia featuring five candidates on Tuesday, setting up a battle with Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) in the fall.\n\nCao won nearly 62.1% of the vote with 93% of the ballots counted, according to the Associated Press. The nearest competitor, Edward Garcia, won roughly 11% of the vote.\n\nTrump supported Cao in his Senate bid after he lost a congressional campaign against Wexton in 2022 by more than 6 percentage points.\n\nIn a state Biden won by 10 percentage points in 2020, it'll be hard for Cao to unseat Kaine. The Cook Political Report rates the Senate race as \"solid Democrat.\"\n\nTrump endorsements hold sway despite Good question mark\n\nTrump's endorsement continues to hold weight within the GOP as Trump-backed candidates won their primaries, even as the Good primary remains too close to call.\n\nGeorgia Republican Brian Jack, Trump's former political director, won his election, defeating former state Senate Majority Leader Mike Dugan in the runoff for the Peach State's 3rd District.\n\nAmong other candidates, Trump also backed Cole, who fended off Bondar, the self-funding challenger.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Conservative U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., is asking for \"patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks\" as he hopes the final ballot count from Tuesday's primary will allow him to fend off a challenger endorsed by former president Donald Trump.\n\nGood, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, currently trails state Sen. John McGuire by a little over 300 votes as elections officials finalize their vote counts and mail-in ballots continue to trickle in.\n\nThe Associated Press has not yet called the race for either candidate.\n\nIf Good loses, he would be the first House incumbent to lose a primary challenge this year, with the exception of one race in which two incumbents faced off due to redistricting.\n\nAs one of the most conservative congressmen in the country, Good might be impervious to a primary challenge under normal circumstances. But he earned Trump's wrath when he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president. He switched back to Trump after DeSantis dropped out, but Trump endorsed McGuire and called Good a backstabber.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Once the results are certified, Virginia law allows for a recount if the margin of victory is less than a percentage point. If it's within half a percentage point, the recount can be conducted at the state's expense.\n\nIn a social media post Wednesday, Good said the race remains too close to call.\n\n\"Provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are also still to be counted. We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved,\" he said.\n\nBoth Good and McGuire are among Republicans who have raised concerns about election integrity in the wake of Trump's false claims of voter fraud in his 2020 reelection defeat. Good was among more than 100 GOP House members who voted in January 2021 to object to the Electoral College count from states that Trump disputed.\n\nIn a pre-election telephone rally with Trump on Monday, McGuire urged supporters to deliver him a margin of victory \"too big to rig.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

John McGuire, R-Goochland, eked out a narrow 315 vote lead over Rep. Bob Good, R-5th.\n\nWith all Election Day, early voting and mail-in ballots counted, McGuire has a 0.5 percentage point lead, which is the point where a recount if requested is paid for by the state.\n\nMcGuire won 31,370 votes to Good's 31,055, according to the state Department of Election's unofficial count.\n\nIn Virginia, candidates can ask for recounts when the gap is 1 percentage point or less, but the candidate must pick up the cost when the gap is between 0.5 and 1 percentage point.\n\nOver the next few days, local Electoral Boards will check and double check Tuesday night's unofficial results, while ballots mailed by Election Day but not yet arrived as well as provisional ballots - typically those cast by voters who did not have proper ID or who showed up at the wrong precinct - are still to be counted. The boards are supposed to certify results by Friday.\n\n\"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory,\" McGuire said in a statement several hours after the polls closed.\n\n\"I look forward to working with Trump to beat Joe Biden in November and pass Trump's agenda in Congress. Trump and McGuire will Make America Great Again.\"\n\n\"Right now, we're still waiting on the final election results of today's primary,\" Good said in a message to supporters last night.\n\n\"We implemented the best early voting operation that the 5th District has ever seen, and we are still waiting for the results of mail-in ballots and provisional ballots. We are doing what we can to ensure we have teams of observers and legal counsel to ensure all the votes are properly counted in the coming days,\" he said.\n\nCao wins GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, will take on Kaine\n\nGood beat McGuire in his Lynchburg and Campbell County home base, racking up margins as high at 56% and 59% of votes cast, and also led in Charlottesville and Albemarle county. McGuire won 60 percent-plus margins in the parts of the district nearest Richmond, including his Goochland County home as well as Louisa, Powhatan and parts of Hanover counties.\n\nEarly voters gave Good 5,800 to 5,000 edge over McGuire, who won about 1,000 votes more on Election Day. Trump's endorsement came late last month.\n\n\"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back sort of like he did with me,\" Trump told a tele-rally for McGuire on the eve of the primary.\n\nTurnout in the 5th District, at more than 62,000 votes, dwarfed voting Virginia's the other House primary races, where turnout was mostly under 30,000 votes cast.\n\nDems nominate Vindman

Tom Cole, the powerful chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, easily defeated four fellow Republicans, including a political unknown who loaned his campaign more than $5 million.\n\nCole had 68 percent of the vote at 8:33 p.m., when The Associated Press called the race. Cole withstood a flood of negative ads funded by businessman Paul Bondar, who had about 21 percent of the vote and faced questions about his residency. He owns a home outside Dallas, holds a Texas driver's license and voted in the Texas primary on March 5, according to a report on KFOR.\n\nThe race also drew the attention of outside groups backing Cole. Americans 4 Security PAC spent $3.1 million and Defending Main Street SuperPAC Inc. spent $346,000 against Bondar. On top of that, those two groups and five others, including the National Association of Realtors and the National Rifle Association, spent another $299,000 supporting Cole.\n\nThe race in the 4th District, which includes parts of Oklahoma City and much of south-central Oklahoma, is rated Solid Republican by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Trump, who endorsed Cole, won the district by more than 31 percentage points in 2020.\n\nRep. Bob Good and state Sen. John McGuire were locked in a tight race Tuesday for the Republican nomination in Virginia's 5th District that saw some of Good's House GOP colleagues campaigning on both sides.\n\nNo call had been made in the race at 10 p.m., when less than 200 votes separated the two candidates and an estimated 88 percent of the vote had been counted, according to the AP.\n\nMcGuire announced his run not long after Good was one of eight Republicans who voted to oust California Rep. Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's chair last year. Good's endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the presidential primaries was also a factor in Trump endorsing McGuire, even though Good backed Trump after DeSantis dropped out.\n\nGood had support from his colleagues on the House Freedom Caucus, which he chairs, and several traveled to the district to campaign with him. But one Freedom Caucus member, Ohio Rep. Warren Davidson, bucked the group's leader and endorsed McGuire.\n\nBrian Jack, who served as White House political director under Trump and had his endorsement, secured the Republican nomination to an open seat in Georgia's 3rd District.\n\nJack finished first in the five-candidate field in the May 21 primary but did not clear the 50 percent threshold to avoid a runoff with second-place finisher, state Sen. Mike Dugan.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jack had 66 percent of the vote at 7:50 p.m., when the AP called the race. The largely rural district in western Georgia is represented by Republican Drew Ferguson, who announced in December that he would not seek reelection.\n\nEugene Vindman, a former National Security Council official whose twin brother testified during Trump's first impeachment hearings, won the Democratic nomination in Virginia's 7th District and will seek to succeed Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor in 2025.\n\nVindman had 51 percent of the vote in the seven-candidate field when the AP called the race at 8:06 p.m., just over an hour after polls closed. Former state Del. Elizabeth Guzman, was running second, followed by state Del. Briana Sewell and Prince William County Supervisor Andrea Bailey. The other candidates got less than 10 percent of the vote.\n\nVindman's national profile brought a national focus to the race and helped him dominate fundraising by raising more than $5 million. Local Democrats, meanwhile, failed to coalesce around one candidate to make it a true two-person race.\n\nThe district is likely to be competitive in November, with a race rated Tilt Democratic by Inside Elections.\n\nVindman will face Republican Derrick Anderson, a retired Green Beret who was the preferred pick of national Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nAnderson had 46 percent in the six-candidate field when the AP called the race at 8:58 p.m. Cameron Hamilton, a retired Navy SEAL backed by some in the party's more conservative wing, had 37 percent.\n\nMissy Cotter Smasal won the Democratic primary to challenge GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans, a freshman who flipped a Virginia Beach-area seat two years ago.\n\nSmasal was leading civil rights attorney Jeremiah Denton 68 percent to 32 percent when the AP called the race at 8:04 p.m. Smasal served in the Navy, as Kiggans did, and she currently is the executive director of a nonprofit focused on service women.\n\nKiggans has a strong fundraising advantage heading into the general election, though. She had $1.8 million on hand as of May 29, while Smasal had $368,000.\n\nThe race is rated Tilt Republican by Inside Elections.\n\nState Sen. Suhas Subramanyam and attorney Mike Clancy won their parties' nominations in Virginia's 10th District to succeed Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton , who is retiring because of health issues.\n\nSubramanyam won a 12-way Democratic primary, besting state Del. Dan Helmer, who was the top fundraiser in the race. When the AP called the race at 9:15 p.m., Subramanyam had 30 percent, followed by Helmer's 27 percent.\n\nClancy won a four-way Republican primary, and had 61 percent of the vote when the AP called the race at 7:41 p.m. Marine veteran Aliscia Andrews was running second with 23 percent.\n\nThe race is rated Likely Democratic by Inside Elections.\n\nRepublican Hung Cao, a Navy veteran, will challenge Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in November for a Virginia Senate seat.\n\nCao was leading the Republican primary with 68 percent of the vote in a five-candidate field that included Scott Parkinson, a Club for Growth vice president, when the AP called the race at 7:23 p.m.\n\nCao had Trump's support and led the Republican field in fundraising, although he'll begin the general election significantly trailing Kaine's cash on hand. Kaine had $8.6 million on hand as of May 29, dwarfing Cao's $203,000. Cao lost a House race to Rep. Jennifer Wexton in 2022.\n\nThe race is rated Solid Democratic by Inside Elections.", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Suhas Subramanyam and military officer Eugene Vindman were the victors in two closely watched Democratic primaries Tuesday in two competitive Northern Virginia districts.\n\nBut the most high-profile contest in Virginia -- the intra-GOP brawl between incumbent Rep. Bob Good and state Sen. John McGuire -- was too close to call as of 10 p.m Tuesday evening, three hours after the polls closed.\n\nWhat to watch in Virginia's congressional primaries this week\n\nAs Navy veteran Hung Cao won a lopsided victory in a Republican primary to take on Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in November, several competitive House of Representatives districts saw hard-fought battles for both parties.\n\nSubramanyam, D-Loudoun, bested 11 other Democratic candidates to win the party's nomination in the blue-leaning but competitive 10th District based in Northern Virginia.\n\nSubramanyam, a lawyer and former White House technology advisor in the Obama administration, has served in the Virginia General Assembly since 2020. He was endorsed for the 10th District seat by incumbent Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun, who is stepping down from public service after being diagnosed with a severe neurological disorder.\n\nThe runner-up in the Democratic contest was Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax. Former Virginia Education Secretary Atif Qarni finished in third place, followed by former House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn in fourth and Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, in fifth.\n\nIn the Republican contest, attorney and technology executive Mike Clancy easily defeated three other GOP contenders. Clancy will likely face an uphill battle in a district Wexton won by 6 percentage points in 2022.\n\nEugene Vindman, a military officer who rose to national fame by helping his twin brother blow the whistle on former President Donald Trump's conduct in office, won the Democratic nomination for the competitive 7th District seat being vacated by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William.\n\nVindman's anti-Trump profile helped him crush his Democratic rivals in fundraising and helped him win around 50% of the vote in a seven-person primary. Early results showed Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, finishing second.\n\nFormer Green Beret turned lawyer Derrick Anderson won the GOP nomination in the district, defeating fellow military veteran Cameron Hamilton. Four other Republican candidates were in the running, but the results reflected what was essentially a two-person race between Anderson and Hamilton.\n\nSpanberger is running for governor in 2025 instead of seeking reelection to Congress.\n\nBased largely in Prince William, Spotsylvania and Stafford counties, the district also covers rural bits of central Virginia and has been seen as in play for Republicans as they seek to hold their majority in the House. In 2022, Spanberger defended her seat by 4.6 percentage points against Prince William supervisor Yesli Vega.\n\nOver in Virginia Beach, a Democratic primary set the stage for a general election that will likely draw national attention. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee-backed Navy veteran Missy Cotter Smasal topped Democratic challenger attorney Jake Denton.\n\nDenton trailed in fundraising, as Cotter Smasal had notched big endorsements from U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries -- who stands likely to become Speaker of the House if Democrats regain that chamber -- along with all six of Virginia's Democratic representatives and former governors Ralph Northam and Terry McAuliffe.\n\nIncumbent Rep. Jenn Kiggans' seat is among vulnerable Republicans that Democratic national groups are targeting ahead of November for potential to flip. Kiggans is a Navy veteran and nurse who previously served in Virginia's state senate. She defeated fellow Navy veteran Elaine Luria in 2022 by 3.4 percentage points. The Virginia Beach-anchored district has oscillated between Democratic and Republican control over the years and is expected to be very competitive for both women by November.\n\nAttorney Leslie Mehta, who formerly worked for the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, handily beat former New Kent County treasurer Herb Jones in a two-way Democratic primary.\n\nShe'll now take on Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, in a Republican-leaning district.\n\nMehta received a high-profile endorsement from Spanberger in the primary.\n\nThe results of the 5th District congressional primary contest weren't solidified hours after voting ended, with Good and McGuire each pulling nearly 50% of all counted ballots Tuesday night.\n\nVirginia's largest congressional district attracted a national audience as GOP heavyweights campaigned with both men.\n\nOn election eve, once-and-possibly-future president Donald Trump had a virtual rally for McGuire, while Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga stumped for McGuire at multiple events and posted videos on social media in the weeks leading up to the election.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene calls Bob Good a 'liar' and John McGuire a 'loyalist' at rally\n\nMeanwhile, Good had reinforcements from Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and Texas congressman Chip Roy. Good was also joined by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon (weeks before he's due in federal prison for denying a subpoena related to a congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021).\n\nAt a June 7 event in Powhatan, Bannon said \"prison is not gonna be that bad\" and compared his upcoming sentence to his Navy service. \"It's just serving my country in a different way.\"\n\nHe also praised Good for his service as an elected official and chair of the House Freedom Caucus, congress' most conservative group.\n\nWhile he had a high profile former Trump strategist backing him, he lacked the support of Trump himself.\n\nThough both candidates share conservative Republican policy stances and have expressed admiration for Trump, it's Good's brief endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that has haunted him. Trump's team also sent a cease and desist letter to Good's campaign for using signs with his name that implied an endorsement he doesn't have.", "source": {"uri": "virginiamercury.com", "dataType":

Tom Cole, the powerful chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, easily defeated four fellow Republicans, including a political unknown who loaned his campaign more than $5 million.\n\nCole had 68% of the vote at 8:33 p.m., when The Associated Press called the race. Cole withstood a flood of negative ads funded by businessman Paul Bondar, who had about 21% of the vote and faced questions about his residency. He owns a home outside Dallas, holds a Texas driver's license and voted in the Texas primary on March 5, according to a report on KFOR.\n\nThe race also drew the attention of outside groups backing Cole. Americans 4 Security PAC spent $3.1 million and Defending Main Street SuperPAC Inc. spent $346,000 against Bondar. On top of that, those two groups and five others, including the National Association of Realtors and the National Rifle Association, spent another $299,000 supporting Cole.\n\nThe race in the 4th District, which includes parts of Oklahoma City and much of south-central Oklahoma, is rated Solid Republican by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Trump, who endorsed Cole, won the district by more than 31 percentage points in 2020.\n\nRep. Bob Good and state Sen. John McGuire were locked in a tight race Tuesday for the Republican nomination in Virginia's 5th District that saw some of Good's House GOP colleagues campaigning on both sides.\n\nNo call had been made in the race at 10 p.m., when less than 200 votes separated the two candidates and an estimated 88% of the vote had been counted, according to the AP.\n\nMcGuire announced his run not long after Good was one of eight Republicans who voted to oust California Rep. Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's chair last year. Good's endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the presidential primaries was also a factor in Trump endorsing McGuire, even though Good backed Trump after DeSantis dropped out.\n\nGood had support from his colleagues on the House Freedom Caucus, which he chairs, and several traveled to the district to campaign with him. But one Freedom Caucus member, Ohio Rep. Warren Davidson, bucked the group's leader and endorsed McGuire.\n\nBrian Jack, who served as White House political director under Trump and had his endorsement, secured the Republican nomination to an open seat in Georgia's 3rd District.\n\nJack finished first in the five-candidate field in the May 21 primary but did not clear the 50% threshold to avoid a runoff with second-place finisher, state Sen. Mike Dugan.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jack had 66% of the vote at 7:50 p.m., when the AP called the race. The largely rural district in western Georgia is represented by Republican Drew Ferguson, who announced in December that he would not seek reelection.\n\nEugene Vindman, a former National Security Council official whose twin brother testified during Trump's first impeachment hearings, won the Democratic nomination in Virginia's 7th District and will seek to succeed Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor in 2025.\n\nVindman had 51% of the vote in the seven-candidate field when the AP called the race at 8:06 p.m., just over an hour after polls closed. Former state Del. Elizabeth Guzman, was running second, followed by state Del. Briana Sewell and Prince William County Supervisor Andrea Bailey. The other candidates got less than 10% of the vote.\n\nVindman's national profile brought a national focus to the race and helped him dominate fundraising by raising more than $5 million. Local Democrats, meanwhile, failed to coalesce around one candidate to make it a true two-person race.\n\nThe district is likely to be competitive in November, with a race rated Tilt Democratic by Inside Elections.\n\nVindman will face Republican Derrick Anderson, a retired Green Beret who was the preferred pick of national Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nAnderson had 46% in the six-candidate field when the AP called the race at 8:58 p.m. Cameron Hamilton, a retired Navy SEAL backed by some in the party's more conservative wing, had 37%.\n\nMissy Cotter Smasal won the Democratic primary to challenge GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans, a freshman who flipped a Virginia Beach-area seat two years ago.\n\nSmasal was leading civil rights attorney Jeremiah Denton 68% to 32% when the AP called the race at 8:04 p.m. Smasal served in the Navy, as Kiggans did, and she currently is the executive director of a nonprofit focused on service women.\n\nKiggans has a strong fundraising advantage heading into the general election, though. She had $1.8 million on hand as of May 29, while Smasal had $368,000.\n\nThe race is rated Tilt Republican by Inside Elections.\n\nState Sen. Suhas Subramanyam and attorney Mike Clancy won their parties' nominations in Virginia's 10th District to succeed Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton , who is retiring because of health issues.\n\nSubramanyam won a 12-way Democratic primary, besting state Del. Dan Helmer, who was the top fundraiser in the race. When the AP called the race at 9:15 p.m., Subramanyam had 30%, followed by Helmer's 27%.\n\nClancy won a four-way Republican primary, and had 61% of the vote when the AP called the race at 7:41 p.m. Marine veteran Aliscia Andrews was running second with 23%.\n\nThe race is rated Likely Democratic by Inside Elections.\n\nRepublican Hung Cao, a Navy veteran, will challenge Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in November for a Virginia Senate seat.\n\nCao was leading the Republican primary with 68% of the vote in a five-candidate field that included Scott Parkinson, a Club for Growth vice president, when the AP called the race at 7:23 p.m.\n\nCao had Trump's support and led the Republican field in fundraising, although he'll begin the general election significantly trailing Kaine's cash on hand. Kaine had $8.6 million on hand as of May 29, dwarfing Cao's $203,000. Cao lost a House race to Rep. Jennifer Wexton in 2022.\n\nThe race is rated Solid Democratic by Inside Elections.", "source": {"uri": "thenewsherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Tim Kaine, there are congressional primaries in nine of the Commonwealth's U.S. House districts.\n\nTrump-endorsed Hung Cao proved to be a fundraising juggernaut bringing in a more than $2 million haul so far and is favored to win the GOP primary for U.S. Senate.\n\nIn the House primaries, both parties have some contentious contests playing out on Tuesday. Among the races to watch is the Democrat primary for the Seventh Congressional District where Eugene Vindman -- who played a significant role in the first impeachment of then-President Trump -- is seeking his party's nomination after incumbent Democrat Rep. Abigail Spanberger decided not to seek re-election in order to run for governor in 2025. The crowded GOP primary for the 7th CD includes two military veterans with ties to the Trump administration -- Derrick Anderson and Cameron Hamilton -- battling it out along with three other candidates.\n\nMany Republican eyes are on the Fifth Congressional District GOP primary where incumbent Republican Rep. Bob Good -- who chairs the House Freedom Caucus -- faces a challenge from Trump-endorsed John McGuire, currently a state senator. Good, who voted to boot then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy but initially backed Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) in the GOP presidential primary, is hoping to hold on to his seat and has out-raised his challenger. McGuire has been endorsed, in addition to Trump, by a handful of Good's colleagues including Reps. Ryan Zinke and Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nPeach State voters will finalize the field in three congressional runoff elections on Tuesday with Republicans in the Second and Third Congressional Districts

Trump remained too close to call.\n\nThe contest between two election deniers, which has turned ugly and personal, was potentially headed for a recount that could drag on for weeks. With more than 95 percent of the votes counted, John J. McGuire, a little-known state senator and former Navy SEAL who attended the \"Stop the Steal\" rally outside the White House on Jan. 6, 2021, had a lead over Mr. Good of a little more than 300 votes, according to The Associated Press. Mail-in votes were still being counted, and Mr. Good said he could still prevail.\n\nBut that did not stop Mr. McGuire, who has pitched himself to voters as the true Trump loyalist and criticized Mr. Good for his vote to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, from declaring victory on Tuesday night before the final votes were counted.\n\nVirginia does not have a requirement for an automatic recount, but if the winner is ahead by less than 1 percent, either candidate can request one. It was a rare instance in which both candidates in a photo-finish race had promoted the lie that Mr. Trump won the 2020 presidential election, raising questions about whether either would accept an adverse outcome in his own contest.\n\n\"The law provides a process for evaluating the accuracy of all the vote totals from Election Day to ensure everyone can have full confidence in the certified results,\" Mr. Good wrote on social media. \"Provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are also still to be counted. We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed.\"\n\nThe state of play raised resting heart rates among Mr. McGuire's powerful supporters, who had been projecting confidence about a decisive, double-digit victory, and assuring Mr. Trump of such an outcome. Mr. Trump's endorsement proved powerful enough to propel the little-known state senator to a virtual tie with the well-known incumbent. But it also demonstrated the limits of the former president's power, as his support failed to clinch a decisive win for Mr. McGuire.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Good", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEALs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy SEALs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Postal voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/20/multimedia/20dc-good-khwm/20dc-good-khwm-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661234", "eventUri": "eng-9661234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Virginia Republicans think so.", "body": "Tuesday's GOP primary in the commonwealth will be a test of just how powerful the former president's endorsement really is\n\nRamona Christian believes an endorsement by former President Donald Trump is vital to the campaign of Republican candidates in 2024.\n\n\"I feel like it is one of the most important aspects of a campaign: President Trump's endorsement,\" Christian, chairwoman of the Buckingham County Republican Committee, told the News Virginian. She said it is also a matter of respect to Trump, who will be officially nominated as the Republican candidate for president next month.\n\nPolitics A blow to Bob: Trump endorsement could tilt 5th District GOP primary in John McGuire's favor Jason Armesto\n\nShe said the United States \"is in a mess,'' and that Republicans \"need to respect his [Trump's] decisions and the people he wants to support him.\"\n\nSo far in 2024, Trump is doing well with endorsements, according to J. Miles Coleman, the associate editor of Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball, the official election forecaster at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, which Sabato leads. Coleman reports that the only primary loss by a Trump-backed candidate happened in New Jersey, where U.S. Senate candidate Christine Serrano Glassner was defeated in a primary battle earlier this month.\n\n\"The Trump endorsement is the hottest commodity these days,\" Coleman told the News Virginian. He said the former president appears strategic in when he issues his endorsements. A recent example is the race in Virginia's 5th Congressional District. Trump has endorsed state Sen. John McGuire over incumbent Rep. Bob Good in the primary battle for the Republican nomination.\n\n\"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on May 28. \"John McGuire has my Complete and Total Endorsement!\"\n\nBut, Coleman said he issued his endorsement late in May, when McGuire had mounted a nearly 2-to-1 fundraising advantage over Good. \"He [Trump] does not want to back a loser,\" Coleman said. \"Maybe he had some internal intelligence.\"\n\nThat \"internal intelligence\" was Christian, at least according to Christian herself.\n\nChristian told The Daily Progress she spoke with the former president in Washington the weekend before he endorsed McGuire while Trump was attending the Libertarian Party's nominating convention. Trump was in front of a hostile crowd, and Christian said she attended to offer the former president some support.\n\nIt gave her an opportunity to speak with Trump for several minutes, and the presumptive Republican nominee wanted to know about the race in the 5th District.\n\n\"'Tell me about this John McGuire guy,'\" Christian remembers Trump saying.\n\nShe vouched for McGuire, whom she considers a good friend, and when Trump asked how he's polling, Christian cited a poll released by the McGuire campaign which shows him leading by 14 points. Good, for the record, has called the poll \"ridiculous.\"\n\nAccording to Christian, Trump was heartened by the poll, \"because Good hadn't be very good for the past three years and now all of a sudden he's trying to warm up to Trump.\"\n\n\"My response was, 'You know why he's doing that.' And he said, 'Oh, I know,'\" Christian recalls.\n\n\"He said, 'I can't endorse anyone that might lose.' I said, 'Well sir, if you endorse Senator McGuire, I promise he's going to win and I promise he'll never betray you and he'll do whatever you need him to do to save the country,\" said Christian. \"He shook my hand, patted me on the shoulder and said, 'I think you're going to be very happy.'\"\n\nShe said she waited anxiously for two days, hoping to see the endorsement come, and was ecstatic to see the May 28 post on Truth Social.\n\nChris Saxman is a former Republican Virginia General Assembly member from the Shenandoah Valley who is the executive director of Virginia Free, an organization that provides nonpartisan political information to businesses in the commonwealth. He said Trump has done \"a good job'' of picking candidates who will win. And while Saxman told the News Virginian an endorsement would not overcome candidate quality, organization and fundraising, a Trump endorsement is important.\n\n\"His endorsement is absolutely massive,\" said Saxman, who said the current Republican Party is \"his party, no buts about it.\"\n\nMarshall Pattie, the central region vice chairman for the 6th District Republican Committee, said the Trump endorsement's value depends on the type of voter involved.\n\n\"For the voters who go to events and want to meet and talk to candidates, the Trump endorsement is less important,\" he told the News Virginian. \"For the low-information people who are big Trump supporters, the endorsement means a lot.\"\n\nJim Wood, Waynesboro's vice mayor and chairman of the local Republican committee, said Republican U.S. Senate candidate Hung Cao has capitalized on Trump's endorsement, using it in a barrage of television advertisements before Tuesday's Virginia GOP primary.\n\nBut Wood said Cao has not made much of an effort to campaign in the Shenandoah Valley. While the Trump endorsement helps, Wood said \"people who pay attention see who comes to visit. Hung Cao has not made much of an effort to come and visit.\" Like Pattie, Wood thinks the hardcore Trump supporters will pay attention to his endorsement of Cao.\n\nChristian said one recent incident she witnessed told her all about the power of a Trump endorsement.\n\n\"A friend of mine runs a Trump store in Farmville,\" she said. \"Fifteen people came in that day and asked, 'Who is President Trump endorsing?'\" Christian said when these voters, principally older voters, learned whom Trump was backing, they wrote down the names.\n\nChristian said if Trump is returned to the White House, he must have as many allies as possible to accomplish a second-term agenda.\n\n\"It will take all of us fighting. He can't do it alone,\" she said. \"We must give him the best tools he can have to accomplish the goals. He has a big agenda on his plate.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyprogress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Progress"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_armesto@dailyprogress.com", "name": "Jason

Virginia does not register voters by party.\n\nThe Republican ballot includes the two candidates for the 5th Congressional District and the five candidates seeking the Republican nomination to run against two-term incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who is not facing a primary challenge from another Democrat. The Democratic ballot includes the three candidates seeking the 5th district nomination to challenge either incumbent Bob Good or state Sen. John McGuire.\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nIn the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, five candidates are on the ballot seeking the nomination to run against Tim Kaine: Hung Cao, Eddie Garcia, Jonathan Emord, Chuck Smith and Scott Thomas Parkinson.\n\nKaine, former governor of Virginia, has served as the junior senator of Virginia since 2013. None of the candidates seeking the Republican nomination to run against Kaine has ever held public office.\n\nHung Cao, a Navy veteran who lives in Loudoun County, previously ran for the 10th Congressional District of Virginia, losing to incumbent Democratic Rep. Jennifer Weston 53.2% to 46.7% in 2022. Cao has received the endorsement of former President Donald Trump.\n\nEddie Garcia, a U.S. Army veteran who lives in Arlington, earned a graduate degree from George Washington University in 2019.\n\nJonathan Emord, a lawyer who has received the endorsement of former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, also seeks the Republican nomination for Senate. Emord, who earlier in his career worked for the Federal Communications Commission during the Reagan administration, lives in Fairfax County.\n\nAnother Republican candidate, Virginia Beach attorney and Marine Corps veteran Chuck Smith, ran against Rep. Bobby Scott for the 3rd Congressional District but lost. Smith has received the endorsement of former state Sen. Amanda Chase, R-Chesterfield.\n\nRounding out the Republican nominees is Arlington resident Scott Parkinson, who is a former adviser to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the vice president of government affairs at the Club for Growth, a conservative economic policy advocacy group. Among Parkinson's endorsements from elected Republican lawmakers is Good.\n\n5th Congressional District\n\nGood is facing a strong challenge from McGuire in what has been a bitter, contentious fight during the Republican primary campaign. McGuire's campaign received a big boost last month when former President Donald Trump announced his endorsement of the former Navy SEAL.\n\nGood is the chair of the House Freedom Caucus and has the backing of many Republican Party leaders across the 5th District. John Ruff, chair of the Amherst County Republican Committee, joined in sending a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider endorsing McGuire. Amherst resident Vance Wilkins, former Virgnia Speaker of the House, strongly backs Good and said he admires his courage and the stand he takes on conservative issues.\n\nClaudia Tucker, vice chair of the Amherst County Board of Supervisors, recently endorsed McGuire. On her Facebook page, she wrote she feels McGuire will do more to represent Amherst County.\n\nAt a June 3 campaign event in Lynchburg, where he was joined by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Good told his supporters that he is running a \"tough, \"hard\" and \"strong\" campaign.\n\n\"The grass roots are behind us,\" Good said. \"The local elected officials are behind us. The county GOP leaders are behind us.\"\n\nIn a campaign visit to Lynchburg on June 8, McGuire, where he was joined by former Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who served as interior secretary under Trump, said one of his top priorities if elected to Congress would be public safety.\n\n\"As a Navy SEAL and as a veteran, that's my No. 1 priority in Congress is to keep you safe and make sure you have a better future for your children,\" McGuire said.\n\nOn the Democratic side, three candidates -- Paul Riley, a retired Army officer who works as a defense contractor, Gary Terry, a West Point graduate who serves as CEO of the Boys and Girls Clubs in Danville, and Gloria Witt, a business and nonprofit leader and president of the NAACP Amherst Branch -- are seeking the Democratic nomination for the 5th Congressional District.\n\nThe Democratic race has been a relatively friendly affair compared to the rough-and-tumble primary on the Republican side.\n\nThe three candidates have vowed to work on protecting a woman's right to abortion if elected to Congress in November.\n\nThey also expressed concerns about the future of democracy if Trumps wins a second presidential term and Republicans take control of both the Senate and the House.\n\nRiley, who lives in Crozet, argued at a recent candidates' forum that the nation is at a crossroads with its democracy.\n\n\"We can choose to go right and take us back to 1953, when Brown v. Board of Education was brought before the Supreme Court. Or we can go left and keep us going down the road of the 21st century and protect our democracy from the assault that is being unwaveringly put against us every single day,\" Riley said.\n\nTerry, who graduated from West Point in 1982, said at the same forum that while at the U.S. Military Academy, he took an oath that I would protect our Constitution and our democracy from all enemies, foreign and domestic.\"\n\n\"I see our rights under attack. Trust me, after four years at West Point and five years in the Army, I know an enemy when I see it,\" he said.\n\nWitt, who lives in Madison Heights, says on her campaign website that \"our rights and fundamental freedoms are under attack and I want to use my voice to energize dissatisfied voters, break down walls and build bridges to advance legislation for 'we the people' that upholds democracy, strengthens families, rethinks education, and spurs smart economic growth.\"\n\nReach Hand at mhand@newsadvance.com.

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)\n\nState Sen. Suhas Subramanyam and military officer Eugene Vindman were the victors in two closely watched Democratic primaries Tuesday in two competitive Northern Virginia districts.\n\nBut the most high-profile contest in Virginia -- the intra-GOP brawl between incumbent Rep. Bob Good and state Sen. John McGuire -- was too close to call as of 10 p.m Tuesday evening, three hours after the polls closed.\n\nAs Navy veteran Hung Cao won a lopsided victory in a Republican primary to take on Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in November, several competitive House of Representatives districts saw hard-fought battles for both parties.\n\nHere are the primary results so far:\n\nSubramanyam, D-Loudoun, bested 11 other Democratic candidates to win the party's nomination in the blue-leaning but competitive 10th District based in Northern Virginia.\n\nSubramanyam, a lawyer and former White House technology advisor in the Obama administration, has served in the Virginia General Assembly since 2020. He was endorsed for the 10th District seat by incumbent Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun, who is stepping down from public service after being diagnosed with a severe neurological disorder.\n\nThe runner-up in the Democratic contest was Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax. Former Virginia Education Secretary Atif Qarni finished in third place, followed by former House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn in fourth and Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, in fifth.\n\nIn the Republican contest, attorney and technology executive Mike Clancy easily defeated three other GOP contenders. Clancy will likely face an uphill battle in a district Wexton won by 6 percentage points in 2022.\n\nEugene Vindman, a military officer who rose to national fame by helping his twin brother blow the whistle on former President Donald Trump's conduct in office, won the Democratic nomination for the competitive 7th District seat being vacated by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William.\n\nVindman's anti-Trump profile helped him crush his Democratic rivals in fundraising and helped him win around 50% of the vote in a seven-person primary. Early results showed Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, finishing second.\n\nFormer Green Beret turned lawyer Derrick Anderson won the GOP nomination in the district, defeating fellow military veteran Cameron Hamilton. Four other Republican candidates were in the running, but the results reflected what was essentially a two-person race between Anderson and Hamilton.\n\nSpanberger is running for governor in 2025 instead of seeking reelection to Congress.\n\nBased largely in Prince William, Spotsylvania and Stafford counties, the district also covers rural bits of central Virginia and has been seen as in play for Republicans as they seek to hold their majority in the House. In 2022, Spanberger defended her seat by 4.6 percentage points against Prince William supervisor Yesli Vega.\n\nOver in Virginia Beach, a Democratic primary set the stage for a general election that will likely draw national attention. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee-backed Navy veteran Missy Cotter Smasal topped Democratic challenger attorney Jake Denton.\n\nDenton trailed in fundraising, as Cotter Smasal had notched big endorsements from U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries -- who stands likely to become Speaker of the House if Democrats regain that chamber -- along with all six of Virginia's Democratic representatives and former governors Ralph Northam and Terry McAuliffe.\n\nIncumbent Rep. Jenn Kiggans' seat is among vulnerable Republicans that Democratic national groups are targeting ahead of November for potential to flip. Kiggans is a Navy veteran and nurse who previously served in Virginia's state senate. She defeated fellow Navy veteran Elaine Luria in 2022 by 3.4 percentage points. The Virginia Beach-anchored district has oscillated between Democratic and Republican control over the years and is expected to be very competitive for both women by November.\n\nAttorney Leslie Mehta, who formerly worked for the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, handily beat former New Kent County treasurer Herb Jones in a two-way Democratic primary.\n\nShe'll now take on Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, in a Republican-leaning district.\n\nMehta received a high-profile endorsement from Spanberger in the primary.\n\nThe results of the 5th District congressional primary contest weren't solidified hours after voting ended, with Good and McGuire each pulling nearly 50% of all counted ballots Tuesday night.\n\nVirginia's largest congressional district attracted a national audience as GOP heavyweights campaigned with both men.\n\nOn election eve, once-and-possibly-future president Donald Trump had a virtual rally for McGuire, while Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga stumped for McGuire at multiple events and posted videos on social media in the weeks leading up to the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Good had reinforcements from Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and Texas congressman Chip Roy. Good was also joined by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon (weeks before he's due in federal prison for denying a subpoena related to a congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021).\n\nAt a June 7 event in Powhatan, Bannon said \"prison is not gonna be that bad\" and compared his upcoming sentence to his Navy service. \"It's just serving my country in a different way.\"\n\nHe also praised Good for his service as an elected official and chair of the House Freedom Caucus, congress' most conservative group.\n\nWhile he had a high profile former Trump strategist backing him, he lacked the support of Trump himself.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

John McGuire as the vote-counting stretched into the late hours.\n\nElsewhere, voters in Virginia, Oklahoma, and Georgia helped set fall matchups with a series of primaries in both competitive and safe House districts.\n\nHere are the Washington Examiner's top takeaways from Tuesday's primaries.\n\nThe embattled Good, who faced opposition from Trump but also an unorthodox coalition of House lawmakers, traded the lead with McGuire as results trickled in on Tuesday night. With less than a half point separating the two candidates around midnight, the race could be headed to a recount.\n\nAccording to Virginia law, a recount can be requested if the final tally is within 1 percentage point.\n\n\"No matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right. Keep the faith and don't stop fighting now,\" Good wrote on X as the race was still being decided.\n\nTrump has held a grudge against Good for endorsing his GOP presidential rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL). Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy also sought to oust the Freedom Caucus chairman after he was one of eight Republicans who voted to remove him from the speakership.\n\nMcGuire appeared to declare victory at his watch party in Virginia, saying \"it is an honor to be your Republican nominee,\" but no outlets have yet to declare the race for either candidate.\n\nCole, a longtime House member, defeated self-funding businessman Paul Bondar and three other candidates. Bondar, a political novice, invested $5 million of his fortune to unseat Cole, who has spent $3.1 million on the campaign.\n\nBut it wasn't nearly enough to take down Cole, who won 65% of the vote with 87% of ballots counted, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIncumbent Rep. Frank Lucas (R-OK) comfortably defeated two Republican challengers in Oklahoma's 3rd District Tuesday night. The Associated Press called the race for Lucas, who won nearly 73.1% with 88% of votes counted, less than 20 minutes after polls closed.\n\nRobin Carder and Darren Hamilton were hoping to unseat Lucas, who has been in Congress since 1994 and is chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.\n\nIncumbent Rep. Kevin Hern (R-OK) also easily defeated a Republican challenger in Oklahoma's 1st District. The Associated Press called the race for Hern, who won 86.7% with 54% of votes counted, also nearly 20 minutes after polls closed.\n\nDemocrats in Georgia's 14th District selected Shawn \"General\" Harris as the candidate who will face Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) in November.\n\nThe Associated Press called the primary runoff for Harris roughly 20 minutes after polls closed at 7 p.m. Eastern. Harris won 69% of the vote compared to Democrat Clarence Blalock's 31%, with 98% of votes counted.\n\nHarris faces a steep climb in unseating Greene during the general election. The Cook Political Report rates the seat R+22.\n\nArmy veteran Eugene Vindman won the Democratic primary in Virginia's 7th Congressional District to succeed outgoing Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA).\n\nSpanberger is stepping down from Congress to run for governor, but the swing district is a top seat House Republicans are hoping to flip in November.\n\nVindman, who won 49.3% with 92% of the vote counted, will face Republican Derrick Anderson in November. The army veteran is perhaps best known, along with his twin brother Alexander Vindman, for reporting a 2019 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to Trump's first impeachment.\n\nElsewhere, Navy veteran Missy Cotter Smasal won the Democratic primary for Virginia's 2nd District, defeating fellow Democrat Jeremiah Denton.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race at 8:04 p.m., with Smasal winning nearly 70% of the vote compared to Denton's 29.9% with 61% of votes counted.\n\nSmasal, who is supported by former Democratic Govs. Ralph Northam and Terry McAuliffe, seeks to unseat Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) in a district that President Joe Biden narrowly won in 2022.\n\nIn the Old Dominion's 10th District, state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam won the Democratic primary to succeed outgoing Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-VA).\n\nSubramanyam won 30.3% of the vote with 93% of ballots counted, per the Associated Press. Wexton's Parkinson's disease has severely curtailed her ability to speak and led to the congresswoman deciding against another term. She had supported Subramanyam in the primary that featured 12 candidates in total.\n\nNavy veteran Hung Cao easily won a Republican Senate primary in Virginia featuring five candidates on Tuesday, setting up a battle with Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) in the fall.\n\nCao won nearly 62.1% of the vote with 93% of the ballots counted, according to the Associated Press. The nearest competitor, Edward Garcia, won roughly 11% of the vote.\n\nTrump supported Cao in his Senate bid after he lost a congressional campaign against Wexton in 2022 by more than 6 percentage points.\n\nIn a state Biden won by 10 percentage points in 2020, it'll be hard for Cao to unseat Kaine. The Cook Political Report rates the Senate race as \"solid Democrat.\"\n\nTrump's endorsement continues to hold weight within the GOP as Trump-backed candidates won their primaries, even as the Good primary remains too close to call.\n\nGeorgia Republican Brian Jack, Trump's former political director, won his election, defeating former state Senate Majority Leader Mike Dugan in the runoff for the Peach State's 3rd District.\n\nAmong other candidates, Trump also backed Cole, who fended off Bondar, the self-funding challenger.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news",

While the race was too close to call and votes will not be counted on Wednesday due to a federal holiday, that did not stop Good's MAGA opponent from quickly declaring victory.\n\nCNN's John Berman covered the news, reporting, \"Virginia congressman who helped oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, could be on the verge of losing his own seat. House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good. He's less than a point behind his challenger, state Senator John McGuire. If I can see that right now, it's like 342 votes, forget the point 342 votes, that is remarkable. Here now. CNN senior political analyst Mark Preston. Still a lot of votes to be counted here. Mark, what's going on in this race?\"\n\n\"Well, John, you know, we always talk about your vote really counts. Make sure you get out there and vote. This is a perfect example. What you're seeing right now, as you noted, we have just a few hundred votes that separate these two Republicans who fought in this incredibly expensive primary race that pitted Donald Trump against the incumbent, Bob Good,\" Preston began, adding:\n\nIn fact, Donald Trump went out and not only did campaign events for John McGuire, but he got his allies to do things as well. Kevin McCarthy allied himself with Donald Trump because, as you noted, Bob Good try to knock him out and was successful, helped lead the effort to knock him out as speaker.\n\nSo as we speak right now, we're still waiting to see when the votes come in. You know, John, if you had postmarked your vote, you lived in this congressional district. You postmarked your vote by Election Day. If it arrives by Friday, it is going to be counted.

It didn't quite go as planned.", "body": "Another high-profile challenge to an incumbent in Oklahoma also fumbled, and a handful of battleground matchups were set in Virginia, setting the stage for high-dollar contests over the next five months.\n\nThe coalition assembled against Good included everyone from former Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Trump, to a sitting member of the House Freedom Caucus that Good chairs. But that still wasn't enough for a decisive victory, with McGuire only narrowly leading as of early Wednesday morning, with the race too close to call.\n\nIt was a somewhat surprising result. McGuire was better-funded and had the all-powerful Trump endorsement. His struggles suggest the power of incumbency remains strong.\n\nAnd if Good does survive, he will return to Congress even more emboldened to hijack the GOP leadership's legislative agenda and endorse the primary rivals of his House colleagues.\n\nElsewhere, another GOP incumbent cruised by his challenger. Longtime Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, a major establishment figure in the House Republican conference and chair of the House Appropriations Committee, easily won reelection against his self-funding challenger Paul Bondar, clearing the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff.\n\nCole, who's been in office for more than two decades and had Trump's backing, is expected to win in this deep-red district come the fall, despite being outraised and outspent in this primary.\n\nBondar's loss is just the latest flashpoint of how challengers running to the right in safe red districts continue to falter this cycle as major GOP forces -- Trump sometimes included -- line up to block rabble-rousers who could further disrupt the caucus.\n\nAn otherwise good night for the establishment\n\nIn addition to Bondar's defeat, the GOP establishment continued its winning streak, batting away potential troublemakers.\n\nIn Virginia's battleground 7th District -- which Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger is leaving to run for governor next year -- Republican Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret who unsuccessfully ran for the seat in the midterms, prevailed in a crowded GOP primary. He was the clear establishment favorite: He earned Speaker Mike Johnson's backing -- one of around two dozen challengers who earned his support this year -- and the House GOP leadership-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund spent more than $100,000 boosting him in the primary.\n\nMeanwhile, his most prominent challenger, former Navy SEAL Cameron Hamilton, had the backing of members of the Freedom Caucus. He came in second place.\n\nNational Republicans are working to ensure that they avoid the candidate quality issue they encountered in the midterms -- especially in battlegrounds, where candidates further to the right may struggle in the general election -- and have been mostly successful.\n\nBut there are future tests on the horizon, as soon as next week. The Congressional Leadership Fund this week began spending in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, a red-leaning seat, to block Ron Hanks, a Republican candidate with a controversial past who could put what might otherwise be an uncompetitive seat into play for Democrats. Democrat Adam Frisch, who gained national attention after almost flipping the seat from Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert in the midterms, is running for the district again, and national Democrats have tried to boost Hanks.\n\nTrump, who has largely been on the same page with party leadership when it comes to endorsing candidates, notched another clout-boosting win with Hung Cao, who will be facing Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in Virginia in the fall. (Trump has had a mostly strong endorsement record, despite a few losses in recent weeks.) Kaine is the early favorite, but Trump has contended the state will be competitive in the fall.\n\nAnd Trump's candidate of choice -- his former aide, Brian Jack -- was also victorious in the runoff for Georgia's 3rd District, a deep-red seat that almost assuredly guarantees he'll join the Republican ranks.\n\nBut it wasn't just the Republican establishment that had a good night.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's candidate of choice, veteran Missy Cotter Smasal, overwhelmingly won the Democratic primary in Virginia's swingy 2nd District to take on Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans, one of the handful of Republicans who represent a district that President Joe Biden won in 2020. Kiggans begins the general election with a strong financial advantage.\n\nAnd in Virginia's 10th District, a blue seat, outgoing Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton's candidate of choice -- state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam -- won, defeating a busy field. He'll be the favorite when he faces Republican tech executive Mike Clancy in the fall.\n\nDemocracy is front and center\n\nEugene Vindman, a former national security official and Trump-era whistleblower who helped spark the former president's first impeachment, clinched the Democratic nod in Virginia's 7th District and will face Anderson.\n\nVindman is one of the nation's top fundraisers, appealing to party donors -- largely from outside of the state, which is a rarity for a first-time candidate -- with his story of upholding democracy during the Trump era. Throughout his campaign, he noted that he \"sacrificed his military career\" to take on Trump.\n\nVindman's win -- and national appeal -- is a reassuring sign for Democrats who are continuing to rely on democracy messaging and are wondering about its salience more than three years after the Capitol riot. Biden's campaign is heavily leaning into such messaging, just last week attacking Trump over the riot and accusing him of wanting to \"burn\" democracy down.\n\nVindman wasn't the only down-ballot Democratic candidate who centered democracy messaging. Earlier this year, former Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, who gained prominence after testifying before the Jan. 6 select committee, lost his bid in Maryland's 3rd District. Still, Biden's campaign is using Dunn as a surrogate out on the trail, demonstrating how the president's team views this as a core message.\n\nVindman earned just under a majority of the vote with a half-dozen other candidates on the ballot, including former state Del. Elizabeth Guzm\u00e1n, state Del. Briana Sewell and county supervisors Margaret Franklin and Andrea Bailey -- all women of color.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Kathleen is a proud alumna of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. Here's a shocker; she is from New York City.\n\nAlt-right Freedom Caucus chair Rep. Bob Good took a surprising jab at former President Donald Trump ahead of a Virginia primary that has more resting on it than his own claim to power, according to a new report.\n\nGood -- who will find out Tuesday how his staunch Trump support matches up against a political outsider who has the former president's endorsement in Virginia's 5th Congressional district -- shared his views on a cease and desist letter he received from the former president over campaign signs.\n\n\"I'm not talking about stupid topics,\" Good told Politico Tuesday. \"That's a stupid topic.\"\n\nGood's opinion stands in contrast to Trump's, who ordered his lawyers late last month to take action against the Virginia Republican he has declared is \"bad.\"\n\nALSO READ: EXCLUSIVE: House Republicans subpoena ex-Capitol Police intel head for Jan. 6 inquiry\n\nAt question was Good's usage of Trump's name on his campaign yard signs, despite the former president's endorsement of former Navy SEAL John McGuire.\n\n\"That is a fraud on the donors,\" lawyers told Good.\n\nGood has maintained his support for Trump notwithstanding and created what one political analyst described as a civil war within Trumpworld, pitting MAGA bigwigs such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Steve Bannon against each other.\n\nPolitico's Olivia Beavers argued the conclusion of Tuesday's primary could reverberate beyond Virginia and signal a dark future for the MAGA movement as a whole.\n\n\"If Rep. Bob Good were to lose, he would be the first sitting chair in the Freedom Caucus' nearly decade-long history to be defeated -- a loss that would embolden critics of the increasingly fractious bloc,\" she wrote.\n\n\"If he wins, he'll have done it despite strong opposition from former (and possibly future) President Donald Trump and only mild backing from Republican leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson -- signaling friction ahead.\"", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia",

Trump backed two candidates in the hours after their meeting.\n\nBut not everyone is happy with Trump's decision to align himself with the GOP establishment. His decision to put himself at odds with certain conservative candidates has drawn the ire of some lawmakers, including members of the House Freedom Caucus, who say the Republicans he is supporting will not be loyal to him if he wins a second term.\n\nTrump chooses establishment picks\n\nThe former president has mostly stayed in sync with both the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee when it comes to primary endorsements.\n\nJust hours after his meeting with Johnson and NRCC Chairman Richard Hudson (R-NC) in Florida, Trump rolled out endorsements in two tight GOP primaries in Alaska and Utah. Trump backed Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom in Alaska and Rep. Celeste Maloy (R-UT). His endorsement of Maloy, in particular, places him at odds with Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), who endorsed Colby Jenkins, the congresswoman's challenger.\n\nJohnson has publicly backed Maloy in her race, so Trump's subsequent endorsement suggests his attempts to curry Trump's favor are paying dividends as the speaker seeks to expand his razor-thin majority in the lower chamber. The trip to Mar-a-Lago followed Trump's visit to Washington last week, where he huddled with House and Senate Republicans in separate meetings.\n\n\"It was great to meet with President Trump today at Mar-a-Lago,\" Johnson said in a post to X following his meeting in Florida. \"Our Party is united, and working together, I am confident we will send President Trump back to the White House, win back the Senate, and grow our House Republican majority!\"\n\nBurying old hatchets\n\nOn the Senate side, Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) put aside their yearslong rivalry last week when the former president met with Senate Republicans to strategize about the GOP's 2024 playbook.\n\nThe two men sat next to each other, at one point even fist-bumping, at what was described as a cordial meeting with a \"gracious\" Trump, according to other Republican senators in attendance.\n\nTrump allies said the former president was subdued and respectful, even to his outspoken foes, during the Senate GOP meeting, a tone Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) told the Washington Examiner was \"frankly surprising.\"\n\n\"[Trump] was very encouraging, affirming,\" Hawley said. \"I didn't detect any kind of underhanded little barbs or 'Some of you were wrong about me.' There was none of that, like, zero. It was extremely gracious.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"We have great unity,\" Trump said during the press conference with several GOP senators. \"We have great common sense, a lot of very smart people in this room.\"\n\nSeveral of Trump's chosen Senate candidates last cycle, such as Gen. Don Bolduc in New Hampshire or Herschel Walker in Georgia, performed poorly during the general election, allowing Democrats to keep a hold of their majority in the upper chamber.\n\nAhead of last week's primary, Trump threw out a last-minute endorsement to Army veteran Sam Brown in Nevada, whom the NRSC wholly supported -- displaying another moment of harmony between the former president and Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), NRSC chairman, as they both look to avoid perceived mistakes made in the midterm elections.\n\nRepublicans are hopeful that Brown will be able to oust Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) this year after he lost the Republican Senate primary in 2022 to Adam Laxalt. Laxalt went on to lose to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) that year.\n\nNot all House conservatives on board\n\nSome of Trump's endorsements, however, have frustrated an unlikely group: The House Freedom Caucus. Made up of hard-line conservatives, the GOP lawmakers rarely disagree with the former president on anything.\n\nIn particular, Trump made headlines for his decision to oppose caucus Chairman Bob Good (R-VA), who faces Republican Virginia Sen. John McGuire in a competitive primary contest Tuesday night. Good and Trump's relationship turned sour and then outright icy after the Virginia congressman endorsed Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) over Trump in the Republican presidential primaries.\n\nTrump's endorsements of Rep. William Timmons (R-SC) and Rep. Austin Scott (R-GA) also drew the ire of Freedom Caucus members, as the two congressmen have been critical of the caucus in the past.\n\n\"A lot of people he endorsed, though, in South Carolina are working against him,\" Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) said. \"I think that hurts him. But he's a free agent, we all are, and his track record is pretty good.\"\n\nIn Senate races, Trump has endorsed the NRSC's preferred candidates like former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers and Tim Sheehy in Montana.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"He is endorsing moderates in most races if there's a conservative in the race,\" Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) told Punchbowl News. \"We can't send the swamp any people that are just going to keep funding the status quo.\"\n\nRep. Chip Roy (R-TX) told NOTUS that should Trump win the White House, \"I think he will learn to regret having chosen some of the people he endorsed.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

Virginia does not register voters by party.\n\nThe Republican ballot includes the two candidates for the 5th Congressional District and the five candidates seeking the Republican nomination to run against two-term incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who is not facing a primary challenge from another Democrat. The Democratic ballot includes the three candidates seeking the 5th district nomination to challenge either incumbent Bob Good or state Sen. John McGuire.\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nIn the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, five candidates are on the ballot seeking the nomination to run against Tim Kaine: Hung Cao, Eddie Garcia, Jonathan Emord, Chuck Smith and Scott Thomas Parkinson.\n\nKaine, former governor of Virginia, has served as the junior senator of Virginia since 2013. None of the candidates seeking the Republican nomination to run against Kaine has ever held public office.\n\nHung Cao, a Navy veteran who lives in Loudoun County, previously ran for the 10th Congressional District of Virginia, losing to incumbent Democratic Rep. Jennifer Weston 53.2% to 46.7% in 2022. Cao has received the endorsement of former President Donald Trump.\n\nEddie Garcia, a U.S. Army veteran who lives in Arlington, earned a graduate degree from George Washington University in 2019.\n\nJonathan Emord, a lawyer who has received the endorsement of former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, also seeks the Republican nomination for Senate. Emord, who earlier in his career worked for the Federal Communications Commission during the Reagan administration, lives in Fairfax County.\n\nAnother Republican candidate, Virginia Beach attorney and Marine Corps veteran Chuck Smith, ran against Rep. Bobby Scott for the 3rd Congressional District but lost. Smith has received the endorsement of former state Sen. Amanda Chase, R-Chesterfield.\n\nRounding out the Republican nominees is Arlington resident Scott Parkinson, who is a former adviser to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the vice president of government affairs at the Club for Growth, a conservative economic policy advocacy group. Among Parkinson's endorsements from elected Republican lawmakers is Good.\n\n5th Congressional District\n\nGood is facing a strong challenge from McGuire in what has been a bitter, contentious fight during the Republican primary campaign. McGuire's campaign received a big boost last month when former President Donald Trump announced his endorsement of the former Navy SEAL.\n\nGood is the chair of the House Freedom Caucus and has the backing of many Republican Party leaders across the 5th District. Carlton Ballowe, chair of the Nelson County Republican Committee, joined in sending a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider endorsing McGuire.\n\nAt a June 3 campaign event in Lynchburg, where he was joined by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Good told his supporters that he is running a \"tough, \"hard\" and \"strong\" campaign.\n\n\"The grass roots are behind us,\" Good said. \"The local elected officials are behind us. The county GOP leaders are behind us.\"\n\nIn a campaign visit to Lynchburg on June 8, McGuire, where he was joined by former Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who served as interior secretary under Trump, said one of his top priorities if elected to Congress would be public safety.\n\n\"As a Navy SEAL and as a veteran, that's my No. 1 priority in Congress is to keep you safe and make sure you have a better future for your children,\" McGuire said.\n\nOn the Democratic side, three candidates -- Paul Riley, a retired Army officer who works as a defense contractor, Gary Terry, a West Point graduate who serves as CEO of the Boys and Girls Clubs in Danville, and Gloria Witt, a business and nonprofit leader and president of the NAACP Amherst Branch -- are seeking the Democratic nomination for the 5th Congressional District.\n\nThe Democratic race has been a relatively friendly affair compared to the rough-and-tumble primary on the Republican side.\n\nThe three candidates have vowed to work on protecting a woman's right to abortion if elected to Congress in November.\n\nThey also expressed concerns about the future of democracy if Trumps wins a second presidential term and Republicans take control of both the Senate and the House.\n\nRiley, who lives in Crozet, argued at a recent candidates' forum that the nation is at a crossroads with its democracy.\n\n\"We can choose to go right and take us back to 1953, when Brown v. Board of Education was brought before the Supreme Court. Or we can go left and keep us going down the road of the 21st century and protect our democracy from the assault that is being unwaveringly put against us every single day,\" Riley said.\n\nTerry, who graduated from West Point in 1982, said at the same forum that while at the U.S. Military Academy, he took an oath that I would protect our Constitution and our democracy from all enemies, foreign and domestic.\"\n\n\"I see our rights under attack. Trust me, after four years at West Point and five years in the Army, I know an enemy when I see it,\" he said.\n\nWitt, who lives in Madison Heights, says on her campaign website that \"our rights and fundamental freedoms are under attack and I want to use my voice to energize dissatisfied voters, break down walls and build bridges to advance legislation for 'we the people' that upholds democracy, strengthens families, rethinks education, and spurs smart economic growth.\"\n\nReach Hand at mhand@newsadvance.com.

This week, we're watching races in Virginia, Oklahoma, and Georgia. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET in Virginia and Georgia. Oklahoma's polls close at 7 p.m. Central (8 ET).\n\nGeorgia has three congressional runoffs, the most interesting of which is the Democratic GA-14 race. It pits Clarence Blalock against Shawn Harris. The winner will run against Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene in November. Greene won the Republican primary unopposed.\n\nIn the Virginia GOP Senate primary, Hung Cao, a retired navy captain who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia, has Trump's endorsement and a huge fundraising advantage. Cao, who came to the United States as a (LEGAL) refugee from Vietnam when he was a child, faces Jonathan Emord (a PJ Media contributor), Scott Parkinson, Edward Garcia Jr., and C.L. Smith.\n\nAlso, keep an eye on the VA-05 GOP primary. Incumbent Bob Good is up against State Senator John McGuire. Good ran afoul of the MAGA base when he endorsed Ron DeSantis for president. But McGuire, a former Navy SEAL who has Trump's endorsement, has had trouble fundraising -- $520,000 to Good's $744,000. Will money talk?\n\nThe same could be asked of VA-07, where Never-Trump darling Eugene Vindman is expected to prevail in the Democrat primary. Vindman and his twin brother Alexander gained fame (and fortune) as whistleblowers in Trump's impeachment trials. He's reeled in nearly $4 million throughout his campaign.\n\nThe winner of the Democrat primary will face either a Navy SEAL or a Green Beret, both of whom have given Trump their full-throated support. Derrick Anderson (the Green Beret) has a large fundraising advantage over Cameron Hamilton (the SEAL). While Trump has not endorsed a candidate in the 7th District, Anderson has the support of House Speaker Mike Johnson. Cameron is endorsed by Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Bob Good. The race represents a huge opportunity to flip a blue district as Democrat Rep. Abigail Spawnberger leaves the House to run for governor.\n\nWe're also watching a pair of primaries in Oklahoma's District 1.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ

John McGuire, R-Goochland, eked out a narrow 315 vote lead over Rep. Bob Good, R-5th.\n\nWith all Election Day, early voting and mail-in ballots counted, McGuire has a 0.5 percentage point lead, which is the point where a recount if requested is paid for by the state.\n\nMcGuire won 31,370 votes to Good's 31,055, according to the state Department of Election's unofficial count.\n\nIn Virginia, candidates can ask for recounts when the gap is 1 percentage point or less, but the candidate must pick up the cost when the gap is between 0.5 and 1 percentage point.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The boards are supposed to certify results by Friday.\n\n\"There are still a few votes left to count, but it's clear that all paths end with a victory,\" McGuire said in a statement several hours after the polls closed.\n\n\"I look forward to working with Trump to beat Joe Biden in November and pass Trump's agenda in Congress. Trump and McGuire will Make America Great Again.\"\n\n\"Right now, we're still waiting on the final election results of today's primary,\" Good said in a message to supporters last night.\n\n\"We implemented the best early voting operation that the 5th District has ever seen, and we are still waiting for the results of mail-in ballots and provisional ballots. We are doing what we can to ensure we have teams of observers and legal counsel to ensure all the votes are properly counted in the coming days,\" he said.\n\nGood beat McGuire in his Lynchburg and Campbell County home base, racking up margins as high at 56% and 59% of votes cast, and also led in Charlottesville and Albemarle county. McGuire won 60 percent-plus margins in the parts of the district nearest Richmond, including his Goochland County home as well as Louisa, Powhatan and parts of Hanover counties.\n\nEarly voters gave Good 5,800 to 5,000 edge over McGuire, who won about 1,000 votes more on Election Day. Trump's endorsement came late last month.\n\n\"If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back sort of like he did with me,\" Trump told a tele-rally for McGuire on the eve of the primary.\n\nTurnout in the 5th District, at more than 62,000 votes, dwarfed voting Virginia's the other House primary races, where turnout was mostly under 30,000 votes cast.\n\nPHOTOS: Primary voting

Just two years ago, he chairs the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus. And yet, he may be on the verge of getting a pink slip from Republican constituents in his ruby red district. Now, why have they turned against him? It could have something to do with this,\" began anchor Dana Bash before showing a clip of Goode's floor speech voting to oust McCarthy last October.\n\n\"That was Good speaking about Kevin McCarthy, just before he joined seven other Republicans in ousting the now former speaker. But it could go back even further to this decision from last spring,\" Bash continued, introducing another clip.\n\n\"Just want to congratulate and thank Governor Ron DeSantis. America is hungry for courageous conservative leadership, and that's on display nowhere else like it is in the state of Florida,\" Good says in the clip.\n\n\"Now. Donald Trump endorsed Good's challenger, John McGuire, and campaigned for Maguire last night in a tell-a rally just ahead of today's primary,\" Bash added, before playing a clip of Trump bashing Good:\n\nYeah, if he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me. As you probably know, he was against me for numerous years. And then, after I won the primaries, he became a big fan. But, that's not good enough, because those are the people that they tend to leave you very quickly.\n\nBash then turned to Nichols for his take who joked about them both wearing tan suites and added:\n\nLook, this is so clear what's happening. For those of us that follow politics and, are interested in it, there's such a personal dynamic here. And, I suppose I should do the throw-clearing and say, well, let voters decide. But, boy, we all know what this is about. It's about Donald Trump. And his, lots of it is revenge. And it's a revenge tour!\n\n\"And Kevin McCarthy and Kevin McCarthy. Yeah, yeah,\" joked the rest of the panel.\n\nCNN's Lauren Fox added, \"Yeah. He picked to be on the wrong side of multiple people here. Right. And Donald Trump it's so interesting because he endorsed DeSantis.

Trump backed two candidates in the hours after their meeting.\n\nBut not everyone is happy with Trump's decision to align himself with the GOP establishment. His decision to put himself at odds with certain conservative candidates has drawn the ire of some lawmakers, including members of the House Freedom Caucus, who say the Republicans he is supporting will not be loyal to him if he wins a second term.\n\nThe former president has mostly stayed in sync with both the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee when it comes to primary endorsements.\n\nJust hours after his meeting with Johnson and NRCC Chairman Richard Hudson (R-NC) in Florida, Trump rolled out endorsements in two tight GOP primaries in Alaska and Utah. Trump backed Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom in Alaska and Rep. Celeste Maloy (R-UT). His endorsement of Maloy, in particular, places him at odds with Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), who endorsed Colby Jenkins, the congresswoman's challenger.\n\nJohnson has publicly backed Maloy in her race, so Trump's subsequent endorsement suggests his attempts to curry Trump's favor is paying dividends as the speaker seeks to expand his razor-thin majority in the lower chamber. The trip to Mar-a-Lago followed Trump's visit to Washington last week, where he huddled with House and Senate Republicans in separate meetings.\n\n\"It was great to meet with President Trump today at Mar-a-Lago,\" Johnson said in a post to X following his meeting in Florida. \"Our Party is united, and working together, I am confident we will send President Trump back to the White House, win back the Senate, and grow our House Republican majority!\"\n\nOn the Senate side, Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) put aside their yearslong rivalry last week when the former president met with Senate Republicans to strategize about the GOP's 2024 playbook.\n\nThe two men sat next to one another, at one point even fist-bumping, at what was described as a cordial meeting with a \"gracious\" Trump, according to other Republican senators in attendance.\n\nTrump allies said the former president was subdued and respectful, even to his outspoken foes, during the Senate GOP meeting, a tone Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) told the Washington Examiner was \"frankly surprising.\"\n\n\"[Trump] was very encouraging, affirming,\" Hawley said. \"I didn't detect any kind of underhanded little barbs or 'Some of you were wrong about me.' There was none of that, like, zero. It was extremely gracious.\"\n\n\"We have great unity,\" Trump said during the press conference with several GOP senators. \"We have great common sense, a lot of very smart people in this room.\"\n\nSeveral of Trump's chosen Senate candidates last cycle, like Don Bolduc in New Hampshire or Herschel Walker in Georgia, performed poorly during the general election, allowing for Democrats to keep a hold of their majority in the upper chamber.\n\nAhead of last week's primary, Trump threw out a last-minute endorsement to Army veteran Sam Brown in Nevada, whom the NRSC wholly supported -- displaying another moment of harmony between the former president and Chairman Steve Daines (R-MT) as they both look to avoid perceived mistakes made in the midterm elections.\n\nRepublicans are hopeful that Brown will be able to oust Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) this year after he lost the Republican Senate primary in 2022 to Adam Laxalt. Laxalt went on to lose to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) that year.\n\nSome of Trump's endorsements, however, have frustrated an unlikely group: the House Freedom Caucus. Made up of hard-line conservatives, the GOP lawmakers rarely disagree with the former president on anything.\n\nIn particular, Trump made headlines for his decision to oppose caucus Chairman Bob Good (R-VA), who faces state Sen. John McGuire in a competitive primary contest on Tuesday night. Good and Trump's relationship turned sour and then outright icy after the Virginia congressman endorsed Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) over Trump in the Republican presidential primaries.\n\nTrump's endorsements of William Timmons (R-SC) and Rep. Austin Scott (R-GA) also drew the ire of Freedom Caucus members, as the two congressmen have been critical of the caucus in the past.\n\n\"A lot of people he endorsed, though, in South Carolina are working against him,\" Rep. Ralph Norman said (R-SC). \"And I think that hurts him. But he's a free agent -- we all are -- and his track record is pretty good.\"\n\nIn Senate races, the former president has endorsed the NRSC's preferred candidates like former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers and Tim Sheehy in Montana.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"He is endorsing moderates in most races if there's a conservative in the race,\" Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) told Punchbowl News. \"We can't send the swamp any people that are just going to keep funding the status quo.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news",

Matt Gaetz is under active investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegedly engaging in sexual misconduct, using illegal drugs, accepting improper gifts, giving favors to people personally connected to him, and obstructing investigations into his actions, the committee said in a letter released Tuesday. Gaetz, who has denied all allegations, said on X the committee was \"opening new frivolous investigations\" in order to \"avoid the obvious fact that every investigation into me ends the same way: my exoneration.\" In 2023, the Department of Justice closed an investigation into alleged sex trafficking by the congressman, bringing no charges, but the ethics committee did not close its probe, which began in 2021. Gaetz in his post blamed former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy for the new action by the committee, over a month after McCarthy endorsed his opponent in Florida's August 20 primary, following Gaetz's successful motion to vacate McCarthy's office.\n\nFormer first lady Melania Trump will headline a fundraiser next month in New York's Trump Tower for the Log Cabin Republicans, an LGBT group, Politico reported Tuesday. The event -- proceeds from which will benefit a Log Cabin Republicans program to turn out voters for former President Donald Trump and other Republican candidates -- represents Melania Trump's second fundraiser with the group this election cycle after she hosted one in April at Mar-a-Lago. The news comes at a time when Trump is under pressure to strike language from the Republican Party platform opposing same-sex marriage, as Dispatch Politics previously reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Biden administration announced a plan to give lawful permanent residence to certain unauthorized immigrants who are spouses or children of American citizens. For spouses to be eligible, they must be married to a citizen and have lived in America for at least 10 years. \"These actions will promote family unity and strengthen our economy, providing a significant benefit to the country and helping U.S. citizens and their noncitizen family members stay together,\" reads a fact sheet from the White House. The announcement comes as Biden attempts to navigate an issue that has proven an electoral liability for him, signing an executive order earlier this month to curb illegal border crossings.\n\nMitch McConnell will step down from his position as Senate Republican leader this November, but he is actively planning his party's legislative agenda for a potential GOP sweep in the November elections, The Hill reported Tuesday. He is said to be putting together a budget reconciliation package that would extend tax cuts Republicans passed in 2017 under Trump and boost defense spending. McConnell could also end up holding the top spot on the chamber's Appropriations Committee or Defense Appropriations Subcommittee at the start of next year. Reports of McConnell's plans for 2025 come after he had a positive meeting with Trump and other Senate Republicans last week.\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin will appear at a fundraiser later this month for Huntington Mayor Steve Williams, the state's Democratic nominee for governor, per a local reporter. Manchin's appearance at the fundraiser suggests it is unlikely that he will make an independent gubernatorial run -- after another West Virginia outlet reported that Republicans in West Virginia dissatisfied with Attorney General Patrick Morrisey being the GOP nominee encouraged Manchin to consider a bid for the office.\n\nNew Jersey prosecutors on Monday charged George Norcross, a businessman considered a kingmaker in the state's Democratic Party, with racketeering. Norcross, who maintains his innocence, arrived uninvited to New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin's press conference, sitting in the front row with his attorneys behind him as Platkin unveiled the charges. Despite having never held elected office, Norcross has the status of an influential power broker among New Jersey Democrats whose support and fundraising ability substantially helps his preferred candidates. Norcross' indictment comes as Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, another prominent New Jersey politician, is on trial on unrelated federal bribery charges.\n\nJohn McGuire Holds Narrow Lead Over Bob Good in Virginia's 5th District\n\nVoters in Virginia and Oklahoma participated in multiple closely watched and consequential Republican primaries Tuesday night -- with the most intriguing race still too close to call as of Wednesday morning.\n\nThat marquee matchup was in Virginia's 5th Congressional District, where Republican Rep. Bob Good, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, attempted to fend off a challenge from state Sen. John McGuire, whom former President Donald Trump has endorsed. Early Wednesday morning, the Associated Press had McGuire up by fewer than 400 votes with 98 percent counted, noting that Virginia observes the Juneteenth federal holiday, meaning the state's poll workers are not likely to count votes. The Virginia Public Access Project, which also shows election results in the state, said that the result of the race probably will not be official until Friday, given that officials have yet to count provisional ballots and eligible mail-in votes that will arrive between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nNevertheless, McGuire declared victory at his campaign's watch party late Tuesday night, saying it is \"an honor to be your Republican nominee.\" Meanwhile, Good's campaign said around the same time that it was still awaiting the final count. \"We implemented the best early voting operation that the 5th District has ever seen, and we are still waiting for the results of mail-in ballots and provisional ballots,\" the campaign posted on X, also telling supporters: \"No matter the outcome, you've shown the DC Swamp that you won't back down from standing for what's right.\" In a later post, the campaign said it believed it can \"still prevail.\"\n\nThe campaign in the district -- which encompasses a vast area stretching from Charlottesville to Lynchburg to Danville -- perhaps best illustrates the strange alliances in the GOP's Trump era.\n\nIn the lead-up to Tuesday's primary, Trump endorsed McGuire, in large part because Good backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis instead of Trump for the presidential nomination. And House leadership's support for the incumbent has been tepid. Good, who voted to eject former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy from his office last fall, has battled with Speaker Mike Johnson over such issues as aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"Mike Johnson has done nothing to help me in my race,\" Good told Politico in an interview last week. Good has, however, received support from Freedom Caucus members -- including Reps. Chip Roy, Byron Donalds, and Matt Gaetz.\n\nBut McGuire, a retired Navy SEAL, has found allies across party factions. Although he earned support from some mainstream Republicans such as House Armed Services Committee Chair Rep. Mike Rogers, he also welcomed firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to his district to campaign for him earlier this month. Freedom Caucus member Rep. Warren Davidson also supported him. While there's no dedicated issues page on his campaign website, McGuire summarizes his political philosophy there as \"Pro-Life. Pro-Gun. Pro-Trump,\" and the site features prominently the Truth Social post in which Trump endorsed him.\n\nElsewhere in Virginia, the Republican primary in the state's 7th Congressional District saw the Johnson-endorsed Derrick Anderson defeat Cameron Hamilton -- who touted the support of Good, as well as other Freedom Caucus members, including Reps. Chip Roy and Byron Donalds -- by almost 9 points.\n\nAs Dispatch Politics previously reported, Anderson and Hamilton, both veterans, fought for the GOP nomination to replace Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who will retire at the end of her third term to run for governor. The swing district is one of the top targets for Republicans this cycle, and the GOP has become more bullish about its chances without Spanberger on the ballot.\n\nIn Oklahoma, Rep. Tom Cole, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, handily defeated deep-pocketed right-wing challenger Paul Bondar and three other challengers in the state's 5th Congressional District. The Trump-endorsed Cole told Dispatch Politics last week that he felt comfortable about his prospects leading up to the primary election given that Bondar had few ties to the Oklahoma district. Still, he took the challenge seriously due to the large amount of money Bondar was able to spend.\n\nCole was one of several incumbent House Republicans to face a primary challenge from the right this cycle. Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas eked out a runoff win in late May by about 400 votes against a primary challenger who attacked him over his vote for a gun control package that President Joe Biden supported. In Iowa's primaries a week later, Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Randy Feenstra defeated their challengers by 12 points and about 20 points, respectively. Cole had little difficulty defeating his top challenger, winning by nearly 40 points.\n\nWhat's Driving Larry Hogan's Senate Run?\n\nWhy is Larry Hogan, the purest example today of a moderate Republican, running for Senate when so many like him -- practical problem solvers who prefer more civil discourse -- are fleeing the Trumpified GOP conferences in Congress? Our colleague John McCormack spent some time recently with the Republican nominee in Maryland, who is trying to become the first of his party to win a Senate seat from that deep-blue state since 1980. Here's an excerpt from his article on the website:\n\nAn executive at heart, Hogan had rebuffed pleas from Republicans to run for Senate for years because he said he viewed the job as \"arguing all day and getting nothing done.\" But days before Maryland's February 9 Senate filing deadline, he was in a meeting in New York City with officials from No Labels, the centrist political group that had hoped to field a presidential ticket this year. They were \"asking me to be their candidate for president, and were showing me polls and modeling and whatnot that showed we could run a pretty good race,\" Hogan said of the meeting. \"I think I started at 23 percent with Biden and Trump in the high 20s.\"\n\nThe pitch was tempting, but while he was still in New York, he received an influential call from former President George W. Bush. \"I just don't think you can win,\" Bush said of a potential No Labels presidential bid, according to Hogan. \"I think you can't get to 270 [electoral votes].\"\n\nBut the former Republican president urged Hogan to consider a bid for the Senate. \"You can make a bigger difference than you think,\" Hogan remembers Bush saying. \"I never really wanted to be a senator. I know you don't want to be one either, but I think the party needs you and the country needs you. You've got an important voice. I think it'll give you a platform for that voice.\"\n\nHogan said he doubted he could accomplish much, but Bush disagreed: \"I think you're going to be the guy in the middle of every deal. You're going to be like a Joe Manchin or a John McCain.\"\n\nBut Democrats are working hard to paint Hogan as a stooge for Trump, despite the two-term former governor being one of the more prominent Republican critics of the former president. Hogan's opposition to Trump is one big hurdle for him winning his race against the Democratic nominee, Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, since he'll need nearly every Marylander voting for Trump to also vote for him. But Hogan will also need to win over some of the Democrats and independents that helped him win two races for governor, which means highlighting some of the moderate positions he has that puts him at odds with the GOP base:\n\nOn social issues, Hogan is running as a liberal and trying hard to differentiate himself from almost all congressional Republicans by endorsing a federal bill to codify Roe v. Wade. Yet even there he has also drawn a contrast with Alsobrooks. Shortly after the primary concluded on May 14, Hogan told the New York Times he backs federal abortion legislation to codify Roe sponsored by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine but does not support the Women's Health Protection Act, legislation backed by Alsobrooks and every Senate Democrat except Joe Manchin of West Virginia, because it would prohibit even modest state limits on abortion allowed under Roe.\n\nAsked if he had any tests for Supreme Court nominees, Hogan told The Dispatch: \"I don't believe in litmus tests, but I have more experience appointing judges than anybody in the Senate.\" Hogan said that as governor, he appointed nearly 200 judges, \"including six out of the seven members of our Supreme Court. Three of them I appointed were women, two of them African American women.\"\n\n\"I took every one of [the judicial nominations] completely seriously,\" he added. \"I never asked someone to prejudge -- tell me how you might decide on this future case that might come before you.\"\n\n\"Willie Mays wasn't just a singular athlete, blessed with an unmatched combination of grace, skill and power. He was also a wonderfully warm and generous person -- and an inspiration to an entire generation. I'm lucky to have spent time with him over the years, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family.\"\n\nRead more at The Dispatch", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

McGuire is challenging House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Bob Good.\n\nEditor's Note: Douglas Heye, who served as the deputy chief of staff to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, is a GOP strategist. Follow him on Twitter @dougheye. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nIn theory, no one can be more ideologically pure -- more \"Trumpy\" as it were -- than the leader of the House Freedom Caucus. The group counts among their members some of former President Donald Trump's most fervent acolytes, who generally trip over themselves to stay in his good graces.\n\nBut as chairman of the Freedom Caucus Rep. Bob Good has learned, Trump doesn't give points; he only takes them away.\n\nDouglas Heye\n\nJeremy Freeman\n\nAs fervent a Trumpist as any, Good faces possible ouster from his Virginia congressional seat after Tuesday's primary. His Republican challenger, John McGuire, had what may prove to be an insurmountable advantage -- a Trump endorsement.\n\nGood endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis instead of Trump early in the presidential campaign. It was just one mistake, but a potentially career-ending one for him. It doesn't matter that other than a brief period of allegiance to DeSantis, he was as loyal a foot soldier as Trump could have asked for. With his primary too close to call, Good's predicament speaks to the misplaced values of the Caucus since its founding more than a decade ago.\n\nWho wants to be 'part of a team'?\n\nGood's primary goes to the very heart of what it means to be a conservative in the age of Trump. And the seeds of the problem were there from the very inception of the Freedom Caucus. His experience mirrors, in many ways, the recent history of House Republicans.\n\n\"I didn't come to Washington to be part of a team.\" Those were words spoken in 2011 by then-newly sworn-in Republican Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho, as documented by journalist Robert Draper in his book, \"Do Not Ask What Good We Do\" -- and they tell us a lot about the recent fractious history of House Republicans.\n\nWhile not yet formalized with a name, those were the nascent days of the House Freedom Caucus. Labrador's words made clear that for some, being a member of the House Republican Conference and mulling policy and proposing legislation was not nearly good enough. Being in power meant the ability to wield leverage and influence. Actual legislative accomplishments were secondary.\n\nOne example of this came in December 2012, 11 months into the \"Tea Party Congress,\" over the imminent expiration of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts. By law, taxes would rise if Congress did not act, and the only place Republicans were in control was the House. The Senate and White House were held by Democrats.\n\nAt the time, I was deputy chief of staff for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. It was the first of many times I heard Speaker John Boehner remind his colleagues they were \"one-half of one-third of the government.\" Getting even part of what we wanted would require compromise -- and reasonable expectations.\n\nThe Republican leadership proposed what it boldly called \"Plan B.\" Marginal tax rates would remain the same for anyone making less than $1 million a year -- which was the overwhelming majority of Americans -- with some increases on those earning above that amount. By acting first, before the law changed, we felt we could jam Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama's White House, winning both politically and legislatively.\n\nMost conservatives, notably including Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform, supported the move. But there were some cracks. During what we called \"DMM\" (the \"Daily Management Meeting\" of top leadership members and limited staff), House Republican Conference chair Jeb Hensarling, acutely aware of the calendar but failing to take into account political reality, said, \"I can't vote 'yes' now. That would be raising taxes. But in early January, I'd be voting to cut taxes!\"\n\n\"Uh-oh,\" I thought. \"We're in trouble.\"\n\nTorpedoed by their own ideological purity\n\nIn the end, we didn't have the votes to do the politically smart thing that coincided with what we believed our principles were. \"Plan B\" blew up in our faces. Taxes went up. We jammed ourselves. Not for the last time, a solution that would have been achievable and pragmatic was torpedoed by ideological purity.\n\nThis played out time and again. The year 2013 became what Republicans touted as the \"Defund Obamacare\" year -- a legislative impossibility given that Obama was never going to agree to defunding his signature piece of legislation, and we had no leverage to force its repeal. (Once again, Boehner's \"one-half of one-third\" maxim was at work.)\n\nBut in this politicized universe, accomplishments are secondary to performance -- and demonstrating a willingness to fight. The minority within the majority did have the ability to bring things to a screeching halt.\n\nThus, we had what became widely known as \"the Meadows Letter,\" sent to Republican leadership by a new member of Congress, Rep. Mark Meadows (who years later would become Trump's loyal chief of staff in the White House), urging them to defund Obamacare through any appropriations bill, including what's known as a continuing resolution -- a temporary measure keeping the government operational.\n\nIt did not matter that Meadows was asking for something that was legislatively impossible. He and others in the House who supported him were egged on by a few senators who had gotten into the mix, led by Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nCruz had begun meeting with this small group of GOP rebels, soon to be the Freedom Caucus. Eventually, Republican House leadership gave in. We decided to let our members \"touch the stove,\" and learn in the process that they can get burned.\n\nA press release from Cruz, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida praised the House for fighting hard and not giving in, but their statement essentially told lawmakers in the lower chamber \"way to go House, but, gosh, there's nothing WE can do in the Senate.\"\n\nThat's what sent House Republicans into a frenzy. Internecine fighting among Republicans broke out. Normally serene Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers of Washington state waved the Meadows letter in front of hard-core conservative lawmaker Louie Gohmert of Texas, yelling, \"They told you to jump off a cliff and then abandoned you!\" referring to the Senate Republican allies. Similar scenes played throughout the back of the House chamber.\n\nBut it was Republican infighting with no legislative purpose. It seemed that the only priority was to see who could be the most ideologically pure as a conservative. The great unraveling included a 16-day government shutdown. A continued downward spiral brought about by the fracturing of the party included Rep. Cantor's primary loss, then Boehner's ouster, then Paul Ryan's. All for no coherent reason.\n\nThe lessons I've learned from those experiences is that the incentive structure had changed. To be a conservative \"star\" -- to get on TV, invited to CPAC, to raise money and ultimately invited to Mar-a-Lago -- means your incentives are to always push for more, regardless of how extreme or impossible. For a lot of these Freedom Caucus members, it's not that nothing is ever good enough. It's that nothing can ever be good enough. And everyone else is a sell-out.\n\nThere's always a reason to hold out. Even -- or especially -- if it means causing multiple rounds of votes for a speaker and eventually voting to oust him. Notions of what conservatives mean have become blurred since the rise of Donald Trump. But adherence to all-things Trump is a cornerstone of what led to the fracturing of our party.\n\nGet Our Free Weekly Newsletter\n\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nTrump is all-in for Good's challenger, as anyone who's seen McGuire's \"Trump endorsed\" yard signs can attest (having been in the district in recent weeks, I can confirm that they are everywhere). Freedom Caucus member Rep. Warren Davidson has endorsed McGuire over his own caucus chairman. That just doesn't happen. But it does in Trump's Republican party.\n\nIn a CNN appearance on Tuesday, McGuire hit back on the tactic-first, accomplishment-maybe orientation of Good (and much of the Freedom Caucus). It was almost as if Labrador's rebellion of 13 years ago had come full-circle. \"He's never passed a bill, never passed an amendment,\" McGuire said in his very first sentence. Tellingly, McGuire then used the word \"team\" seven times in the first two and a half minutes of the interview.\n\nThis primary is being called a \"MAGA civil war,\" one that could have a seismic impact on both the Freedom Caucus and the House GOP. It is unclear if a House Freedom Caucus divided amongst itself can stand. Clearly, though, there are deep cracks in its foundation.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But likely not for much longer!\n\nIf you forgot about Bob, he is head of the House Freedom Caucus, and voted to overturn the 2020 election even after the January 6 insurrection. When Herr VonShitzinpants was on trial in New York, Bob used his constituents' bucks to play hooky from work to help Trump violate his gag order, regurgitating lies about Justice Juan Merchan's daughter making a million gazillion dollars and CROOKED RIGGED SHAM TRIAL.\n\nFat lotta good it did him! Bob made the unforgivable choice to endorse Rhonda Sandtits back in the primary, which got him a flamethrower in the face of Trump's wrath. After ol' kinky boots dropped out, Bob rushed back to endorse Trump again as fast as his little Tweetin' fingers could carry him, but hell hath no fury like a Trump scorned. None of Bob's frenetic buttkissery or tongue-callousing levels of bootlickery would ever prove enough to get him back in the sunshine of Trump's love.\n\n\"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA!\" Trump griped on his failing website. \"He turned his back on our incredible Movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave me a warm and 'loving' Endorsement -- But really, it was too late! The damage had been done.\" Trump is very sensitive!\n\nThe thin-skinned felon switched his endorsement to Virginia state Sen. John McGuire III, bitching in a video to Virginia voters that Good \"will stab you in the back sort of like he did with me.\" And now after Tuesday's primary Bob is teetering on the verge of being the first Republican incumbent to lose their race this cycle (not counting two incumbents facing off against each other after a redistricting), trailing McGuire by 327 votes as of Thursday morning.\n\nGood also pissed off other Republicans and his fellow Freedom Caucus members by voting last October to oust Kevin McCarthy. \"This is the Kevin McCarthy revenge tour,\" Good fumed to NBC News last Friday at an event in Goochland, Virginia (tee hee, Goochland), while Marge Taylor Greene dragged Bob to reporters in another corner of the parking lot. \"We need loyalists,\" she fumed. Bob \"kicked Trump when he was down, and went and endorsed another candidate.\"\n\nWith the margin so slim, Bob can request a state-funded recount, and it could potentially be months before there's a victor in the primary. Two \"stop the stealers\" complaining about being stollen from, that sounds fun! The winner will go against Democrat Gloria Witt, though it's a seat where Republicans have an 8.5-point advantage.

Bob Good, R-Va., speaks during a news conference at near Manhattan criminal court on May 16, in New York. Frank Franklin II / AP\n\nWelcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team's latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.\n\nIn today's edition, national political reporter Bridget Bowman breaks down how Trump's influence has charted the course of this year's down-ballot GOP primaries. Plus, campaign embed Nnamdi Egwuonwu reports on the former president's efforts to recruit rappers as surrogates on the trail.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\nIt's still not clear whether House Freedom Caucus chairman Bob Good has lost his GOP primary in Virginia, with mail-in and provisional ballots still to be counted and a potential recount looming.\n\nStill, the extremely tight margin underscores two truths and one lie about this year's House Republican primaries. The truths? It's really, really hard to beat an incumbent. And it really, really helps to have Trump on your side.\n\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\n\nThe lie? That Trump's endorsement is the end-all, be-all in a GOP primary. Good only trails state Sen. John McGuire by a few hundred votes, an eyebrow-raising result for those who thought Trump's seal of approval would help McGuire sail to victory.\n\nBut the fact that Good is so close to becoming the first member of Congress to lose to a primary challenger this cycle tells you that the former president remains a dominant force in GOP contests.\n\nSeveral other Republican incumbents have navigated tricky primaries over the past few weeks with a hand from Trump. On Tuesday, Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma easily avoided a runoff and defeated a wealthy challenger who had spent millions on the race. Cole told me last week that Trump's endorsement had been \"enormously helpful.\"\n\nTrump's support also helped two South Carolina Republicans -- Reps. Nancy Mace and William Timmons -- win bitter primary battles earlier this month.\n\nWhile many insurgent primary challengers have attempted to align themselves with the MAGA movement, the vast majority of Trump's nearly 170 House endorsements this cycle -- around 85% -- have gone to incumbents, much to the delight of party leadership. And most of those lawmakers aren't facing competitive primaries.\n\nTrump has so far only backed two primary challengers against sitting members: McGuire and Jerrod Sessler, a Navy veteran taking on GOP Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington, one of two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\nThat gets us back to the first truth: Incumbents are tough to beat, in part because they have built-in advantages in name ID, fundraising and a ground game. Newhouse, helped by his state's top-two primary system, defeated a Trump-backed primary challenger in 2022. We'll find out Aug. 6 whether Newhouse will be able to do it again.\n\nAt Donald Trump's Black voter outreach event at a Detroit church last weekend, a pastor and several prominent Black Republicans joined the former president onstage. So did another unlikelier figure: rapper Casada Sorrell, better known as Sada Baby.\n\nMost Republican voters may not be familiar with Sada Baby, but there's a good chance their kids are. In 2020, he went viral with his single \"Whole Lotta Choppas,\" a pandemic mainstay on TikTok that was among the first viral records on the app.\n\nYears later, he sat onstage inches from Trump and said, \"He might be the first person to make me vote,\" fueled in part by the mere fact that Trump's team reached out to him.\n\n\"Him reaching out showed me, like, some type of effort that another candidate hadn't shown ever,\" Sorrell said, noting that Trump could have pursued a bigger Detroit name like rapper Eminem (a notorious critic of him). \"I'm trying to act like it doesn't mean too much, but it means a lot.\"\n\nAnd it's not a one-off move. As Trump works to court young voters of color, one strategy his campaign has pursued is to turn rap stars into surrogates, pursuing not only nationally renowned names but also smaller acts prominent in their local communities.\n\nThe campaign hopes the outreach will create a permission structure for undecided voters in communities with little history of supporting Republicans to at least consider Trump's message. And Trump is embracing rappers -- and they are embracing him -- as polling data suggests this election may feature a generational split among Black voters, with younger members of the community showing much more openness to the former president.\n\nIcewear Vezzo, another Detroit-based rapper who was at Trump's event in Michigan, encouraged his fans to consider Trump after receiving backlash for posing with him after the roundtable discussion.\n\n\"Why can't we respectfully disagree no more,\" Vezzo said in a post to his 1 million Instagram followers. \"You know what's built great companies and great civilizations? They all went and got a team of people who think differently from them.\"\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

Here are some of the things. This is TPM's Morning Memo. Sign up for the email version.\n\nIn the VA-05 grudge match over who is Trumpy enough, House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good (R) is trailing state Sen. John J. McGuire III (R) by a mere 327 votes in the GOP primary, with 97.8% of the votes counted.\n\nWith today's holiday, the final tally may not be known until tomorrow at the earliest.\n\nYou know the backstory here, but to recap briefly: Good is as far to the right as anyone in the House GOP conference. You don't get to be Freedom Caucus chair otherwise. But he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in the GOP primary over Donald Trump and is now paying the piper. Good made it clear he would return the Trump fold as soon as DeSantis withdrew from the race and then did exactly that, but McGuire seized on the opening and attacked Good from the farther right in a seat that is safely Republican.\n\nThe coverage going into Election Day had largely come to see Good as doomed by Trump's endorsement of McGuire. But as the results came in last night, it became clear that Good, while in trouble, was putting up a real fight.\n\nEven once the final official tally comes in, a recount is likely in this very close race. I'm not sure it changes the underlying narrative though. Good was seen as safely ensconced in his seat until he crossed Trump, Trump is making him pay a price for it, and it's a steep price, even if Good pulls out a win in the end.\n\nMessage sent. Message received.\n\nA new report out this morning from ABC News alleges that one woman told the House Ethics Committee that Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) paid her to have sex with him. The ABC News report comes a day after the Ethics Committee issued a written update on the Gaetz case that suggested its investigation had expanded to include obstruction of government investigations.\n\nThe allegations the committee is still investigating in the Gaetz matter, according to its statement, are that he:\n\nThe committee has deemed it not worth pursuing further allegations that Gaetz:\n\nGaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAn Alabama pleaded guilty to making threatening phone calls to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and Sheriff Patrick Labat over the criminal investigation into Donald Trump.\n\nNew York's highest court dismissed Donald Trump's appeal of the gag order imposed on him in his Manhattan hush money trial.\n\nLeah Litman: Something's Rotten About the Justices Taking So Long on Trump's Immunity Case\n\nIn his first public comments about the upheaval at the WaPo, owner Jeff Bezos sent an email to newsroom leaders that was obtained by Politico:\n\nTeam -- I know you've already heard this from Will, but I wanted to also weigh in directly: the journalistic standards and ethics at The Post will not change. ... You have my full commitment on maintaining the quality, ethics, and standards we all believe in.\n\nNvidia, the 31-year-old company that has exploded in value on the back of its AI chips, became the largest company in the world Tuesday, measured by market capitalization.\n\n\"It marks the first time a company other than Microsoft or Apple has held the title of largest company since February 2019 when Amazon.com briefly topped the list, the WSJ reported.\n\nNvidia's recent run has been astonishing: It wasn't among the top 20 largest companies even five years ago.\n\nIf you're not a baseball fan, it's hard to convey how outsized Willie Mays was. He connected the ancient and modern versions of the game. He spanned both coasts at a time that meant something, playing for the Giants in New York and San Francisco. His death yesterday at 93 warranted two curse words in a George Will column.\n\nThe above photo was taken of the eventual all-time great in May 1951, his first month in the majors. It was one of the earliest dated photos I could find of Mays in our archive. The other thing I found in sifting through the old photos were some angles on the The Catch, the most famous play in baseball history, that I had never seen before. You can easily find the video on YouTube and you'll probably see it a dozen times this week as the memorials for Mays flood in, but there's something about these stills that make it feel even more

We are in a period where the law provides a process for evaluating the accuracy of all the vote totals from election day to ensure everyone can have full confidence in the certified results. Provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are also still to be counted. We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed. We believe we can still prevail,\" Good tweeted.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, had endorsed McGuire and claimed that Good is \"BAD\" for the state and the nation.\n\nBlaze Media's Daniel Horowitz tweeted on Wednesday morning, \"How do we 'Drain the swamp' and 'down with the uniparty' if we crown someone king and refuse to gently rebuke that king when he not only protects every uniparty dude but now goes after the few who aren't? What is the point of this?\"\n\n\"Trump is king. He is king of the Republican Party. He is more than a powerful politician. He literally reigns over this motley crew,\" BlazeTV host Steve Deace said in a post on X. \"And thus his subjects' behavior simply reflect his will. Good fell out of favor with the king, and since Trump is king it does not matter the merit of those reasons they just are, hence his court will now go and do likewise.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia's_5th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virginia's 5th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Good", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGuire_(Virginia_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McGuire (Virginia politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drain_the_swamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drain the swamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Postal voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaze_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blaze Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=52476716&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C171", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661234", "eventUri": "eng-9661234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

Bob Good, R-Campbell County, or state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland County. Their bitterly fought contest -- one of the most watched and expensive primary battles nationwide this year -- has not been called at the time of this story's publication. McGuire had made his campaign a referendum on which candidate is a more loyal supporter of former President Donald Trump.\n\nMoving into the fall, Witt's campaign will face an uphill battle in the heavily Republican district, said David Richards, a political scientist with the University of Lynchburg.\n\n\"Good won the last time by double digits and going into the fall with Trump on the ballot as well, the GOP should easily clinch the election in the 5th. Democrats' only hope is that this primary was so bruising that Republicans stay home, but I do not see that happening,\" Richards said.\n\nThe 5th District encompasses the majority of Southside, including Danville, and also takes in the cities of Charlottesville and Lynchburg. It has been mostly Republican since 2002, when former Democrat-turned-independent Rep. Virgil Goode joined the GOP. Donald Trump won the district with 53% in both 2016 and 2020, and in the 2021 gubernatorial election, Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe with 60% to 39.4% of the vote.\n\nThe only Democrat to hold the district's congressional seat in recent years was Tom Perriello, who in 2008 defeated Goode with significant Democratic down-ballot coattails from Barack Obama's successful presidential bid. Perriello lost to Republican Robert Hurt two years later.\n\nBut the viciously fought Republican primary, which forced both candidates to tap deeply into their war chests and made Trump a central figure, has Democrats hoping that election fatigue among some GOP voters and independents will tilt the contest in their favor -- despite Good's decisive 15-point victory against Democrat Josh Throneburg almost two years ago.\n\nWitt said in a recent interview that the often nasty exchanges between Good and McGuire in the GOP primary will help Democrats win over voters who might be on the fence.\n\n\"When I win on June 18, I just can't wait to debate their winner, because they are showing up poorly as they unveil the viciousness that they are both contributing to,\" Witt said, referring to the two Republicans.\n\nBut if given a choice, Witt said she'd much rather face Good in the general election.\n\n\"He has made so many unconscionable decisions,\" Witt said of Good. \"The people that I interact with, including my conservative friends, are embarrassed to have him as our representative. He would be a wonderful challenger, because there's evidence of how bad he is. In corporate America, if you don't perform, you go home.\"\n\nBorn and raised in Amherst County, Gloria Witt has always considered herself a country girl. But she is also a businesswoman with a 32-year career with global energy leader Framatome (formerly AREVA), and a mother and grandmother. She serves the community as a board member of several organizations, including as president of the NAACP Amherst County branch and as a board member with the Virginia Center for Inclusive Communities.\n\nWitt's experience as a community organizer and businesswoman, including as the founder and CEO of Define Success Coaching, a company committed to developing the next generation of executives and leaders, makes her a suitable candidate to take on her Republican opponent, she said in the interview.", "source": {"uri": "cardinalnews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cardinal

The group counts among their members some of former President Donald Trump's most fervent acolytes, who generally trip over themselves to stay in his good graces.\n\nBut as chairman of the Freedom Caucus Rep. Bob Good has learned, Trump doesn't give points; he only takes them away.\n\nAs fervent a Trumpist as any, Good faces possible ouster from his Virginia congressional seat after Tuesday's primary. His Republican challenger, John McGuire, had what may prove to be an insurmountable advantage -- a Trump endorsement.\n\nGood endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis instead of Trump early in the presidential campaign. It was just one mistake, but a potentially career-ending one for him. It doesn't matter that other than a brief period of allegiance to DeSantis, he was as loyal a foot soldier as Trump could have asked for. With his primary too close to call, Good's predicament speaks to the misplaced values of the Caucus since its founding more than a decade ago.\n\nWho wants to be 'part of a team'?\n\nGood's primary goes to the very heart of what it means to be a conservative in the age of Trump. And the seeds of the problem were there from the very inception of the Freedom Caucus. His experience mirrors, in many ways, the recent history of House Republicans.\n\n\"I didn't come to Washington to be part of a team.\" Those were words spoken in 2011 by then-newly sworn-in Republican Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho, as documented by journalist Robert Draper in his book, \"Do Not Ask What Good We Do\" -- and they tell us a lot about the recent fractious history of House Republicans.\n\nWhile not yet formalized with a name, those were the nascent days of the House Freedom Caucus. Labrador's words made clear that for some, being a member of the House Republican Conference and mulling policy and proposing legislation was not nearly good enough. Being in power meant the ability to wield leverage and influence. Actual legislative accomplishments were secondary.\n\nOne example of this came in December 2012, 11 months into the \"Tea Party Congress,\" over the imminent expiration of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts. By law, taxes would rise if Congress did not act, and the only place Republicans were in control was the House. The Senate and White House were held by Democrats.\n\nAt the time, I was deputy chief of staff for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. It was the first of many times I heard Speaker John Boehner remind his colleagues they were \"one-half of one-third of the government.\" Getting even part of what we wanted would require compromise -- and reasonable expectations.\n\nThe Republican leadership proposed what it boldly called \"Plan B.\" Marginal tax rates would remain the same for anyone making less than $1 million a year -- which was the overwhelming majority of Americans -- with some increases on those earning above that amount. By acting first, before the law changed, we felt we could jam Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama's White House, winning both politically and legislatively.\n\nMost conservatives, notably including Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform, supported the move. But there were some cracks. During what we called \"DMM\" (the \"Daily Management Meeting\" of top leadership members and limited staff), House Republican Conference chair Jeb Hensarling, acutely aware of the calendar but failing to take into account political reality, said, \"I can't vote 'yes' now. That would be raising taxes. But in early January, I'd be voting to cut taxes!\"\n\nIn the end, we didn't have the votes to do the politically smart thing that coincided with what we believed our principles were. \"Plan B\" blew up in our faces. Taxes went up. We jammed ourselves. Not for the last time, a solution that would have been achievable and pragmatic was torpedoed by ideological purity.\n\nThis played out time and again. The year 2013 became what Republicans touted as the \"Defund Obamacare\" year -- a legislative impossibility given that Obama was never going to agree to defunding his signature piece of legislation, and we had no leverage to force its repeal. (Once again, Boehner's \"one-half of one-third\" maxim was at work.)\n\nBut in this politicized universe, accomplishments are secondary to performance -- and demonstrating a willingness to fight. The minority within the majority did have the ability to bring things to a screeching halt.\n\nThus, we had what became widely known as \"the Meadows Letter,\" sent to Republican leadership by a new member of Congress, Rep. Mark Meadows (who years later would become Trump's loyal chief of staff in the White House), urging them to defund Obamacare through any appropriations bill, including what's known as a continuing resolution -- a temporary measure keeping the government operational.\n\nIt did not matter that Meadows was asking for something that was legislatively impossible. He and others in the House who supported him were egged on by a few senators who had gotten into the mix, led by Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nCruz had begun meeting with this small group of GOP rebels, soon to be the Freedom Caucus. Eventually, Republican House leadership gave in. We decided to let our members \"touch the stove,\" and learn in the process that they can get burned.\n\nA press release from Cruz, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida praised the House for fighting hard and not giving in, but their statement essentially told lawmakers in the lower chamber \"way to go House, but, gosh, there's nothing WE can do in the Senate.\"\n\nThat's what sent House Republicans into a frenzy. Internecine fighting among Republicans broke out. Normally serene Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers of Washington state waved the Meadows letter in front of hard-core conservative lawmaker Louie Gohmert of Texas, yelling, \"They told you to jump off a cliff and then abandoned you!\" referring to the Senate Republican allies. Similar scenes played throughout the back of the House chamber.\n\nBut it was Republican infighting with no legislative purpose. It seemed that the only priority was to see who could be the most ideologically pure as a conservative. The great unraveling included a 16-day government shutdown. A continued downward spiral brought about by the fracturing of the party included Rep. Cantor's primary loss, then Boehner's ouster, then Paul Ryan's. All for no coherent reason.\n\nThe lessons I've learned from those experiences is that the incentive structure had changed. To be a conservative \"star\" -- to get on TV, invited to CPAC, to raise money and ultimately invited to Mar-a-Lago -- means your incentives are to always push for more, regardless of how extreme or impossible. For a lot of these Freedom Caucus members, it's not that nothing is ever good enough. It's that nothing can ever be good enough. And everyone else is a sell-out.\n\nThere's always a reason to hold out. Even -- or especially -- if it means causing multiple rounds of votes for a speaker and eventually voting to oust him. Notions of what conservatives mean have become blurred since the rise of Donald Trump. But adherence to all-things Trump is a cornerstone of what led to the fracturing of our party.\n\nTrump is all-in for Good's challenger, as anyone who's seen McGuire's \"Trump endorsed\" yard signs can attest (having been in the district in recent weeks, I can confirm that they are everywhere). Freedom Caucus member Rep. Warren Davidson has endorsed McGuire over his own caucus chairman. That just doesn't happen. But it does in Trump's Republican party.\n\nIn a CNN appearance on Tuesday, McGuire hit back on the tactic-first, accomplishment-maybe orientation of Good (and much of the Freedom Caucus). It was almost as if Labrador's rebellion of 13 years ago had come full-circle. \"He's never passed a bill, never passed an amendment,\" McGuire said in his very first sentence. Tellingly, McGuire then used the word \"team\" seven times in the first two and a half minutes of the interview.\n\nThis primary is being called a \"MAGA civil war,\" one that could have a seismic impact on both the Freedom Caucus and the House GOP. It is unclear if a House Freedom Caucus divided amongst itself can stand. Clearly, though, there are deep cracks in its foundation.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Follow him on Twitter @dougheye. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nIn theory, no one can be more ideologically pure -- more \"Trumpy\" as it were -- than the leader of the House Freedom Caucus. The group counts among their members some of former President Donald Trump's most fervent acolytes, who generally trip over themselves to stay in his good graces.\n\nBut as chairman of the Freedom Caucus Rep. Bob Good has learned, Trump doesn't give points; he only takes them away.\n\nAs fervent a Trumpist as any, Good faces possible ouster from his Virginia congressional seat after Tuesday's primary. His Republican challenger, John McGuire, had what may prove to be an insurmountable advantage -- a Trump endorsement.\n\nGood endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis instead of Trump early in the presidential campaign. It was just one mistake, but a potentially career-ending one for him. It doesn't matter that other than a brief period of allegiance to DeSantis, he was as loyal a foot soldier as Trump could have asked for. With his primary too close to call, Good's predicament speaks to the misplaced values of the Caucus since its founding more than a decade ago.\n\nWho wants to be 'part of a team'?\n\nGood's primary goes to the very heart of what it means to be a conservative in the age of Trump. And the seeds of the problem were there from the very inception of the Freedom Caucus. His experience mirrors, in many ways, the recent history of House Republicans.\n\n\"I didn't come to Washington to be part of a team.\" Those were words spoken in 2011 by then-newly sworn-in Republican Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho, as documented by journalist Robert Draper in his book, \"Do Not Ask What Good We Do\" -- and they tell us a lot about the recent fractious history of House Republicans.\n\nWhile not yet formalized with a name, those were the nascent days of the House Freedom Caucus. Labrador's words made clear that for some, being a member of the House Republican Conference and mulling policy and proposing legislation was not nearly good enough. Being in power meant the ability to wield leverage and influence. Actual legislative accomplishments were secondary.\n\nOne example of this came in December 2012, 11 months into the \"Tea Party Congress,\" over the imminent expiration of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts. By law, taxes would rise if Congress did not act, and the only place Republicans were in control was the House. The Senate and White House were held by Democrats.\n\nAt the time, I was deputy chief of staff for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. It was the first of many times I heard Speaker John Boehner remind his colleagues they were \"one-half of one-third of the government.\" Getting even part of what we wanted would require compromise -- and reasonable expectations.\n\nThe Republican leadership proposed what it boldly called \"Plan B.\" Marginal tax rates would remain the same for anyone making less than $1 million a year -- which was the overwhelming majority of Americans -- with some increases on those earning above that amount. By acting first, before the law changed, we felt we could jam Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama's White House, winning both politically and legislatively.\n\nMost conservatives, notably including Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform, supported the move. But there were some cracks. During what we called \"DMM\" (the \"Daily Management Meeting\" of top leadership members and limited staff), House Republican Conference chair Jeb Hensarling, acutely aware of the calendar but failing to take into account political reality, said, \"I can't vote 'yes' now. That would be raising taxes. But in early January, I'd be voting to cut taxes!\"\n\n\"Uh-oh,\" I thought. \"We're in trouble.\"\n\nTorpedoed by their own ideological purity\n\nIn the end, we didn't have the votes to do the politically smart thing that coincided with what we believed our principles were. \"Plan B\" blew up in our faces. Taxes went up. We jammed ourselves. Not for the last time, a solution that would have been achievable and pragmatic was torpedoed by ideological purity.\n\nThis played out time and again. The year 2013 became what Republicans touted as the \"Defund Obamacare\" year -- a legislative impossibility given that Obama was never going to agree to defunding his signature piece of legislation, and we had no leverage to force its repeal. (Once again, Boehner's \"one-half of one-third\" maxim was at work.)\n\nBut in this politicized universe, accomplishments are secondary to performance -- and demonstrating a willingness to fight. The minority within the majority did have the ability to bring things to a screeching halt.\n\nThus, we had what became widely known as \"the Meadows Letter,\" sent to Republican leadership by a new member of Congress, Rep. Mark Meadows (who years later would become Trump's loyal chief of staff in the White House), urging them to defund Obamacare through any appropriations bill, including what's known as a continuing resolution -- a temporary measure keeping the government operational.\n\nIt did not matter that Meadows was asking for something that was legislatively impossible. He and others in the House who supported him were egged on by a few senators who had gotten into the mix, led by Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nCruz had begun meeting with this small group of GOP rebels, soon to be the Freedom Caucus. Eventually, Republican House leadership gave in. We decided to let our members \"touch the stove,\" and learn in the process that they can get burned.\n\nA press release from Cruz, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida praised the House for fighting hard and not giving in, but their statement essentially told lawmakers in the lower chamber \"way to go House, but, gosh, there's nothing WE can do in the Senate.\"\n\nThat's what sent House Republicans into a frenzy. Internecine fighting among Republicans broke out. Normally serene Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers of Washington state waved the Meadows letter in front of hard-core conservative lawmaker Louie Gohmert of Texas, yelling, \"They told you to jump off a cliff and then abandoned you!\" referring to the Senate Republican allies. Similar scenes played throughout the back of the House chamber.\n\nBut it was Republican infighting with no legislative purpose. It seemed that the only priority was to see who could be the most ideologically pure as a conservative. The great unraveling included a 16-day government shutdown. A continued downward spiral brought about by the fracturing of the party included Rep. Cantor's primary loss, then Boehner's ouster, then Paul Ryan's. All for no coherent reason.\n\nThe lessons I've learned from those experiences is that the incentive structure had changed. To be a conservative \"star\" -- to get on TV, invited to CPAC, to raise money and ultimately invited to Mar-a-Lago -- means your incentives are to always push for more, regardless of how extreme or impossible. For a lot of these Freedom Caucus members, it's not that nothing is ever good enough. It's that nothing can ever be good enough. And everyone else is a sell-out.\n\nThere's always a reason to hold out. Even -- or especially -- if it means causing multiple rounds of votes for a speaker and eventually voting to oust him. Notions of what conservatives mean have become blurred since the rise of Donald Trump. But adherence to all-things Trump is a cornerstone of what led to the fracturing of our party.\n\nTrump is all-in for Good's challenger, as anyone who's seen McGuire's \"Trump endorsed\" yard signs can attest (having been in the district in recent weeks, I can confirm that they are everywhere). Freedom Caucus member Rep. Warren Davidson has endorsed McGuire over his own caucus chairman. That just doesn't happen. But it does in Trump's Republican party.\n\nIn a CNN appearance on Tuesday, McGuire hit back on the tactic-first, accomplishment-maybe orientation of Good (and much of the Freedom Caucus). It was almost as if Labrador's rebellion of 13 years ago had come full-circle. \"He's never passed a bill, never passed an amendment,\" McGuire said in his very first sentence. Tellingly, McGuire then used the word \"team\" seven times in the first two and a half minutes of the interview.\n\nThis primary is being called a \"MAGA civil war,\" one that could have a seismic impact on both the Freedom Caucus and the House GOP. It is unclear if a House Freedom Caucus divided amongst itself can stand. Clearly, though, there are deep cracks in its foundation.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"},

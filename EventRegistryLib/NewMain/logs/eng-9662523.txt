This announcement comes after Mbappe sustained a significant injury during France's Euro 2024 opener against Austria.\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events during France's 1-0 victory over Austria, Mbappe collided with Austrian defender Kevin Danso, resulting in a fractured nose for the French skipper. The injury occurred late in the match, and Mbappe was quickly taken to the hospital for immediate medical attention. Initially, the French Football Federation indicated that surgery might not be necessary. However, further developments have changed that prognosis.\n\nDeschamps provides update on Mbappe\n\nFrance's head coach, Didier Deschamps, has now provided a critical update on Mbappe's condition. According to Deschamps, more tests are scheduled for Wednesday to assess the extent of the injury and to plan the next steps. While surgery is inevitable, there is a possibility that it may be postponed until after the tournament.\n\nDeschamps said:\n\n\"This Wednesday there will be more tests to see his evolution. It was a major shock. The medical staff did everything necessary to reduce it as much as possible, after the tests. Even if there is not surgery immediately, he will have to do it after the tournament. This morning he was already a little better, so we will see. We will follow it closely every day.\"\n\nAccording to RTL France, Mbappe is expected to be sidelined for at least 15 days. This timeline suggests that he might miss the group stage matches but could return by the quarter-finals if France advances. Despite the severity of the injury, Mbappe's participation in the tournament is not entirely ruled out. The French Football Federation plans to fit him with a custom mask to protect his nose, potentially allowing him to play in upcoming matches.\n\nFrance's next challenge in Euro 2024 is against the Netherlands on Friday. The absence of Mbappe would be a significant blow to the team, given his pivotal role and leadership on the field. However, the French squad is hopeful that with the custom mask, Mbappe might still make an appearance, although it will depend on his recovery and comfort levels.\n\nWhat's next for Mbappe and France\n\nMbappe's injury and potential absence come at a crucial time for France. As one of the most influential players in the squad, his ability to change the game's dynamics is unparalleled. His speed, skill, and goal-scoring prowess have been instrumental in France's recent successes, including their World Cup victory in 2018.\n\nWithout Mbappe, Deschamps will need to adjust his strategies and possibly rely more on other key players such as Antoine Griezmann, Olivier Giroud, and the emerging talents in the squad. The team's depth will be tested, and how well they adapt to this challenge could determine their success in the tournament.\n\nFans around the world have expressed their support for Mbappe, hoping for his speedy recovery. Social media has been flooded with messages of encouragement, and there is a collective anticipation for his return. The possibility of seeing Mbappe play with a protective mask has also generated considerable interest and speculation.\n\nAs the tournament progresses, all eyes will be on Mbappe's recovery and France's performance without their star player. The upcoming matches will be crucial in determining their path in Euro 2024. With or without Mbappe, France remains a formidable team, but his presence could be the difference between a good run and championship glory.\n\nWhile Kylian Mbappe faces a challenging time with his injury, the resilience of the French team and the player's determination could still see them through this tough phase. Fans and teammates alike are eagerly awaiting updates, hoping to see their captain back in action soon.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fremont_farkas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fremont Farkas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Deschamps", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Didier Deschamps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Danso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Danso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Griezmann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antoine Griezmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Giroud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olivier Giroud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kylian-Mbappe-gets-worrying-update-on-broken-nose-at-Euro-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662523", "eventUri": "eng-9662523", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

should they make it out of their group - is expected to be on Monday July 1 or Tuesday July 2.\n\nMORE : Alan Shearer reveals the two changes England must make to their team against Denmark\n\nMORE : Frank Lampard urges Gareth Southgate to make one change to England line-up vs Denmark", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_goldman@metro.co.uk", "name": "James Goldman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Deschamps", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Didier Deschamps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00fcsseldorf", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Danso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Danso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Lampard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Surgery", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Surgery", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2157489598.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C146px%2C1022px%2C538px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662523", "eventUri": "eng-9662523", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 2917, "textEnd": 2923}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 2935, "textEnd": 2941}], "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

During the Group D fixture, Mbappe had a brutal collision with opposition defender Kevin Danso. The French superstar immediately collapsed on the ground. His injury looked so severe that many felt that France would miss the services of Mbappe for the rest of the Euro 2024 campaign. Quashing those rumours, Mbappe appeared in a training session in Paderborn on Wednesday. He was spotted wearing a protection around his wounded nose. After France notched a 1-0 win over Austria, Mbappe dropped a couple of pictures from the match on Instagram. He wrote, \"Without risks, there are no victories.\" One day later, the former Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) footballer shared a post where he could be seen juggling a ball at the training facilities in Paderborn, Germany.\n\nAccording to a report by the Independent, Mbappe did not take part in the team practice. He trained alone away from the rest of the French squad before going through some shooting drills. Many assumed that Mbappe might need to go under the knife immediately for his nose injury. Though he has not required surgery, the French team management remains doubtful about his availability in the upcoming Euro 2024 game against the Netherlands, scheduled to be played on June 22.\n\nMbappe's teammates, however, are hopeful about the Real Madrid star's availability in the upcoming matches of the European Championship. Speaking to the media at a conference, French midfielder Adrien Rabiot said, \"A fractured nose isn't the end of the world and Kylian should be with us pretty soon,\" as quoted by the Independent.\n\nGiving logic to his remark, Rabiot referred to his Juventus teammate Wojciech Szczesny, who broke his nose during a match against Torino in April. The Poland goalkeeper underwent surgery and needed only a week to get back on his feet.\n\nSpeaking about Mbappe's condition, French defender William Saliba said, as per Independent, \"I saw him this morning, he was a bit better. I think he was off to do more tests. I don't know anything more. But when I saw him this morning, he was a bit better.\"\n\nDespite enduring a nose injury, Mbappe spent a few minutes on the pitch before Olivier Giroud came in as his replacement against Austria. After the game was over in Dusseldorf, Mbappe was seen leaving the stadium in an ambulance. After getting the better of Austria, France now hold the second position in Group D.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Danso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Danso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paderborn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paderborn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paderborn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien_Rabiot", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrien Rabiot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Saliba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Saliba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torino_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torino F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Giroud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olivier Giroud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00fcsseldorf", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Education and Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Education and Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Training", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/06/copy-of-sports-23-2024-06-320069cbdf6c2f9d0b06f5d325cf461b-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662523", "eventUri": "eng-9662523", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 1534, "textEnd": 1541}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Manager Didier Deschamps provided an update on Mbappe's situation, with the 25-year-old set to undergo tests on Wednesday.\n\nAfter battling to win the ball from a set-piece, Mbappe saw his follow-through motion take him directly into the shoulder of Kevin Danso. The former PSG talisman left the field covered in blood in the closing stages of France's win over Austria, with his fitness in doubt.\n\nDeschamps has revealed that surgery will be required for his star striker following the tournament, but his condition has already improved. Mbappe will be given a protective mask in order to make a swift return to the pitch.\n\nSpeaking to the press, France boss Deschamps said: \"This Wednesday there will be more tests to see his evolution. It was a major shock. The medical staff did everything necessary to reduce it as much as possible, after the tests.\n\n\"Even if there is not surgery immediately, he will have to do it after the tournament. This morning he was already a little better, so we will see. We will follow it closely every day.\"\n\nAfter initial concerns that his tournament could be in doubt, the French Football Federation were reassured after Mbappe's trip to the hospital. The forward will return to the tournament but his status for France's match against Netherlands was not confirmed.\n\nThe statement released by the FFF said: \"Kylian Mbappe returns to the base camp of the French national team. Kylian Mbappe suffered a broken nose during the second part of the Austria-France held this Monday in Dusseldorf.\n\n\"The captain of France was treated first by the medical staff and Dr. Franck Le Gall, who diagnosed him with a nose fracture.

It was a major shock. The medical staff did everything necessary to reduce it as much as possible, after the tests.\n\n\"Even if there is not surgery immediately, he will have to do it after the tournament. This morning he was already a little better, so we will see. We will follow it closely every day.\"\n\nWhile a report in L'Equipe has claimed that Mbappe still has hopes of featuring against Netherlands on Friday, it remains to be seen whether that is realistic.\n\nRamifications for France and Real Madrid?\n\nFrance supporters will be encouraged to hear that their talisman will almost certainly play a part in the rest of the tournament, even if his next outing may not come until June 25 against Poland.\n\nIf Les Bleus finish in the top two of Group D, they will not play their last-16 tie until the start of July, handing Mbappe more recovery time.\n\nFrom Real Madrid's perspective, Mbappe undergoing surgery shortly before starting pre-season training is far from ideal, yet their new signing will be able to go through several weeks of rehabilitation before he even links up with his teammates.\n\nWith La Liga beginning just over a month after the Euro 2024 final, Mbappe may be deemed fit to feature in their opening fixture in the middle of August.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darren_plant@amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Darren Plant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Deschamps", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Didier Deschamps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Danso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Danso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'\u00c9quipe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "L'\u00c9quipe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Surgery", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Surgery", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Oral_Surgery", "label": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Oral Surgery", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Surgery", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Surgery", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Transition", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Transition", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/20/31/sm-favicon-2020-v2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662523", "eventUri": "eng-9662523", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 2175, "textEnd": 2182}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

It was a heavy collision that he had, but he was able to come out and train yesterday and take part in some activities,\" Deschamps told reporters in Leipzig on the eve of the Group D encounter.\n\n\"That will be the case this evening too. Things are progressing in the right direction enough for us to try to have him available tomorrow.\n\n\"We will do what we can to have him available.\"\n\nA short while after Deschamps spoke to reporters, Mbappe took part in the French team's training session wearing a striking protective face mask in the French colours of blue, white and red.\n\nThe 25-year-old France skipper suffered the injury in an accidental collision with Austria defender Kevin Danso late on in his team's 1-0 win in their opening game at the tournament in Duesseldorf on Monday.\n\nMbappe trained apart from his teammates on Wednesday while wearing a plaster on his nose and did not appear to be overly hindered by the injury.\n\nThe French Football Federation said following the Austria game that Mbappe would not require an operation and would be able to return to the pitch once he had been fitted with a mask.\n\nMbappe's teammate Antoine Griezmann insisted the new Real Madrid signing was \"doing really well\".\n\n\"The nose is a bit less swollen. We will wait until the last moment and see how he is feeling,\" Griezmann told reporters.\n\nNetherlands coach Ronald Koeman said his team's preparation would not be heavily influenced by the Mbappe situation.\n\n\"Deschamps will know if Mbappe will play or not, we will just have to wait and see,\" said the Dutch coach.\n\n\"France is such a strong team -- even if Mbappe is not playing his replacement will be a great player as well.\n\n\"We can't influence this, all we can do is influence our team and do the best that we can, and not everything depends on whether Mbappe is there or not.\n\n\"We know that he can be a game changer.\"\n\nThe Netherlands came from behind to beat Poland 2-1 in their opening match and Koeman was confident his team could step up a level against France.\n\n\"I can't predict everything but I have a good feeling, this match is a challenge,\" continued Koeman.\n\n\"Three points against Poland give us a bit of breathing space, we can be calm now.\n\n\"We want to get a good result, it's a challenge for us now and we need to be good.

So that will have an impact, but we have an exceptional squad,\" midfielder Adrien Rabiot said on Wednesday.\n\n\"I am not going to complain given the lads we have on the bench. We have more than enough options to replace Kylian. I have total confidence in the guys on the bench and the quality we have.\"\n\nMbappe is his country's third-top scorer of all time with 47 goals from 80 caps, behind only Giroud and Thierry Henry.\n\nHe has only scored once in France's last six matches, and that was in a pre-tournament friendly against Luxembourg.\n\nHowever, he had an outsize impact on their performances at the last World Cup, scoring eight goals -- half the team's total -- including an astonishing hat-trick in the final against Argentina.\n\nFrance met the Netherlands twice in Euro 2024 qualifying, and Mbappe scored a brace on each occasion, in a 4-0 win in Paris and in a 2-1 victory in Amsterdam.\n\nAbove all, it is worth considering how France have done in recent games without the player who has just ended a prolific seven-year spell at Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nDeschamps' team lost 2-1 in a friendly in Germany last September when Mbappe was left on the bench. They also laboured to a 0-0 draw against Canada in their final pre-tournament friendly when he only appeared as a late substitute.\n\n- Giroud's chance? -\n\nTheir goal threat is obviously not the same without Mbappe, even if he has still never scored at the European Championship.\n\nAt the last Euros three years ago, Mbappe failed to find the net and missed the crucial spot-kick in a last-16 loss on penalties to Switzerland.\n\nAgainst Austria, he squandered one golden chance when clean through with just the goalkeeper to beat.\n\nThe obvious option for Deschamps when it comes to replacing Mbappe would be to start Giroud, even if the big centre-forward is a very different player.\n\nGiroud, who will move to MLS after the tournament, is 37 now and has also been nursing a minor groin injury.\n\nHe ended up playing a key role in Qatar, and in similar circumstances -- Karim Benzema would have been ahead of him only to pull out injured at the last minute.\n\n\"My mindset is always the same, to bring something to the team when the coach gives me the chance,\" Giroud said after the Austria game.\n\n\"Everyone knows I think about the collective before I think about myself.\"\n\nAnother option for Deschamps is to move Marcus Thuram in from the left wing and to a central role.\n\nThuram, though, has only scored twice for his country in 20 caps, and one of them came against Gibraltar.\n\nThen there is Randal Kolo Muani, but he appears low on confidence after a difficult season in Mbappe's shadow at PSG.\n\nOne thing is for sure, France's performance against Austria -- with the returning N'Golo Kante outstanding shielding an impressive defence -- indicated they do at least look solid enough to shut most opponents out as they wait for Mbappe to return.",

So that will have an impact, but we have an exceptional squad,\" midfielder Adrien Rabiot said on Wednesday.\n\n\"I am not going to complain given the lads we have on the bench. We have more than enough options to replace Kylian. I have total confidence in the guys on the bench and the quality we have.\"\n\nMbappe is his country's third-top scorer of all time with 47 goals from 80 caps, behind only Giroud and Thierry Henry.\n\nHe has only scored once in France's last six matches, and that was in a pre-tournament friendly against Luxembourg.\n\nHowever, he had an outsize impact on their performances at the last World Cup, scoring eight goals -- half the team's total -- including an astonishing hat-trick in the final against Argentina.\n\nFrance met the Netherlands twice in Euro 2024 qualifying, and Mbappe scored a brace on each occasion, in a 4-0 win in Paris and in a 2-1 victory in Amsterdam.\n\nAbove all, it is worth considering how France have done in recent games without the player who has just ended a prolific seven-year spell at Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nDeschamps' team lost 2-1 in a friendly in Germany last September when Mbappe was left on the bench. They also laboured to a 0-0 draw against Canada in their final pre-tournament friendly when he only appeared as a late substitute.\n\nTheir goal threat is obviously not the same without Mbappe, even if he has still never scored at the European Championship.\n\nAt the last Euros three years ago, Mbappe failed to find the net and missed the crucial spot-kick in a last-16 loss on penalties to Switzerland.\n\nAgainst Austria, he squandered one golden chance when clean through with just the goalkeeper to beat.\n\nThe obvious option for Deschamps when it comes to replacing Mbappe would be to start Giroud, even if the big centre-forward is a very different player.\n\nGiroud, who will move to MLS after the tournament, is 37 now and has also been nursing a minor groin injury.\n\nHe ended up playing a key role in Qatar, and in similar circumstances -- Karim Benzema would have been ahead of him only to pull out injured at the last minute.\n\n\"My mindset is always the same, to bring something to the team when the coach gives me the chance,\" Giroud said after the Austria game.\n\n\"Everyone knows I think about the collective before I think about myself.\"\n\nAnother option for Deschamps is to move Marcus Thuram in from the left wing and to a central role.\n\nThuram, though, has only scored twice for his country in 20 caps, and one of them came against Gibraltar.\n\nThen there is Randal Kolo Muani, but he appears low on confidence after a difficult season in Mbappe's shadow at PSG.\n\nOne thing is for sure, France's performance against Austria -- with the returning N'Golo Kante outstanding shielding an impressive defence -- indicated they do at least look solid enough to shut most opponents out as they wait for Mbappe to return.", "source": {"uri":

Vierno Center Brooklyn residents prep for a week of scorching hot temperatures - Giroud's chance? -\n\nTheir goal threat is obviously not the same without Mbappe, even if he has still never scored at the European Championship.\n\nAt the last Euros three years ago, Mbappe failed to find the net and missed the crucial spot-kick in a last-16 loss on penalties to Switzerland.\n\nAgainst Austria, he squandered one golden chance when clean through with just the goalkeeper to beat.\n\nThe obvious option for Deschamps when it comes to replacing Mbappe would be to start Giroud, even if the big centre-forward is a very different player.\n\nGiroud, who will move to MLS after the tournament, is 37 now and has also been nursing a minor groin injury.\n\nHe ended up playing a key role in Qatar, and in similar circumstances -- Karim Benzema would have been ahead of him only to pull out injured at the last minute.\n\n\"My mindset is always the same, to bring something to the team when the coach gives me the chance,\" Giroud said after the Austria game.\n\n\"Everyone knows I think about the collective before I think about myself.\"\n\nAnother option for Deschamps is to move Marcus Thuram in from the left wing and to a central role.\n\nThuram, though, has only scored twice for his country in 20 caps, and one of them came against Gibraltar.\n\nThen there is Randal Kolo Muani, but he appears low on confidence after a difficult season in Mbappe's shadow at PSG.\n\nOne thing is for sure, France's performance against Austria -- with the returning N'Golo Kante outstanding shielding an impressive defence -- indicated they do at least look solid enough to shut most opponents out as they wait for Mbappe to return.\n\nas-eba/td", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news",

I have total confidence in the guys on the bench and the quality we have.\"\n\nMbappe is his country's third-top scorer of all time with 47 goals from 80 caps, behind only Giroud and Thierry Henry.\n\nHe has only scored once in France's last six matches, and that was in a pre-tournament friendly against Luxembourg.\n\nHowever, he had an outsize impact on their performances at the last World Cup, scoring eight goals -- half the team's total -- including an astonishing hat-trick in the final against Argentina.\n\nFrance met the Netherlands twice in Euro 2024 qualifying, and Mbappe scored a brace on each occasion, in a 4-0 win in Paris and in a 2-1 victory in Amsterdam.\n\nAbove all, it is worth considering how France have done in recent games without the player who has just ended a prolific seven-year spell at Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nDeschamps' team lost 2-1 in a friendly in Germany last September when Mbappe was left on the bench. They also laboured to a 0-0 draw against Canada in their final pre-tournament friendly when he only appeared as a late substitute.\n\n- Giroud's chance? -\n\nTheir goal threat is obviously not the same without Mbappe, even if he has still never scored at the European Championship.\n\nAt the last Euros three years ago, Mbappe failed to find the net and missed the crucial spot-kick in a last-16 loss on penalties to Switzerland.\n\nAgainst Austria, he squandered one golden chance when clean through with just the goalkeeper to beat.\n\nThe obvious option for Deschamps when it comes to replacing Mbappe would be to start Giroud, even if the big centre-forward is a very different player.\n\nGiroud, who will move to MLS after the tournament, is 37 now and has also been nursing a minor groin injury.\n\nHe ended up playing a key role in Qatar, and in similar circumstances -- Karim Benzema would have been ahead of him only to pull out injured at the last minute.\n\n\"My mindset is always the same, to bring something to the team when the coach gives me the chance,\" Giroud said after the Austria game.\n\n\"Everyone knows I think about the collective before I think about myself.\"\n\nAnother option for Deschamps is to move Marcus Thuram in from the left wing and to a central role.\n\nThuram, though, has only scored twice for his country in 20 caps, and one of them came against Gibraltar.\n\nThen there is Randal Kolo Muani, but he appears low on confidence after a difficult season in Mbappe's shadow at PSG.\n\nOne thing is for sure, France's performance against Austria -- with the returning N'Golo Kante outstanding shielding an impressive defence -- indicated they do at least look solid enough to shut most opponents out as they wait for Mbappe to return.\n\nas-eba/td\n\nMore from this section\n\nLuvme Hair PartingMax Glueless Wig Voted Best Quality and Versatility Award for the First Half of 2024\n\nOver 75 million people in the US are under heat alerts.

He had to be taken off the pitch and will eventually require surgery. France plans to play him the whole competition, though. Nonetheless, L'Equipe claims that Real Madrid is worried about how their new signing looks.\n\nThe biggest concern for Real Madrid is the summertime Mbappe presentation. He will get surgery following Euro 2024 and then be presented at Santiago Bernabeu on July 16, 2024. Officials at the club are worried that the event may be lessened by media attention to Mbappe's fractured and bruised nose.\n\nAt this European Championship, Mbappe has not scored yet.

The Real Madrid-bound superstar has hinted at his return, fueling anticipation among fans and teammates.\n\nMbappe sustained the injury during France's 1-0 victory over Austria, following a collision with defender Kevin Danso. This unfortunate incident left the French captain with a fractured nose. After the game, he was quickly taken to the hospital for evaluation. Initially, it was announced that surgery wouldn't be immediately necessary. However, further tests were conducted on Wednesday to assess the severity of his condition. Didier Deschamps, the French manager, had mentioned that surgery might be required eventually, but the timeline remained uncertain.\n\nDespite the injury, Mbappe returned to training on Wednesday. According to L'Equipe, he participated in an individual routine separate from the main squad. Both Mbappe and the official French national team stirred excitement on social media with hints of his potential return. Mbappe posted two pictures on Instagram with the caption, \"Without risks, there are no victories,\" suggesting his determination to play. The French national team's Twitter account also posted a photo of Mbappe on the pitch with an hourglass emoji, indicating that his return might be imminent.\n\nOther injury concerns for France\n\nWhile Mbappe's potential return is a positive sign, France faces other injury worries ahead of their crucial match against the Netherlands.\n\nTheo Hernandez, AC Milan's 26-year-old left-back, missed Wednesday's training due to muscle pain in his gluteal region. He has been focusing on fitness through individual bike workouts. If Hernandez is unable to recover in time, Deschamps has a couple of options: Ferland Mendy from Real Madrid or Eduardo Camavinga, who, despite being a midfielder, has occasionally played at left-back.\n\nFurther complicating France's preparations are the fitness issues of key defenders William Saliba and Dayot Upamecano. Both players, who were instrumental in France's win over Austria, missed training due to muscular pain. Saliba, a crucial component of the French defense, and Upamecano's absence could significantly impact the team's backline stability. Deschamps might need to rethink his defensive strategy if these players remain unavailable.\n\nFrance's injury concerns extend beyond just Mbappe and Hernandez. The potential absence of Saliba and Upamecano adds to the challenges Deschamps faces in maintaining a solid defense. Balancing the squad's dynamics while integrating possible replacements will be crucial for France's success in their next match.\n\nIn a piece of positive news, veteran striker Olivier Giroud has returned to training after missing Tuesday's session due to a minor injury. His presence adds experience and firepower to the French attack, providing Deschamps with a reliable option up front.\n\nWhat's next for Kylian Mbappe\n\nAs France prepares to face the Netherlands, managing the fitness of key players like Mbappe, Hernandez, Saliba, and Upamecano will be paramount. Deschamps needs to ensure that any lineup adjustments do not disrupt the team's balance and cohesion. With a win, France can secure their place in the knockout stages of Euro 2024, making this match crucial for their campaign.\n\nThe potential return of Mbappe has undoubtedly raised hopes among French supporters. His presence on the field could provide the necessary boost for Les Bleus as they aim to overcome Ronald Koeman's Dutch side. Fans and analysts alike will be eagerly watching to see if Mbappe can defy the odds and lead France to another crucial victory at Euro 2024.\n\nWhile France faces significant injury challenges, the resilience and determination shown by players like Mbappe offer a glimmer of hope. The upcoming match against the Netherlands will be a true test of their depth and adaptability as they strive to advance in the tournament.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fremont_farkas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fremont Farkas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Deschamps", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Didier Deschamps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th\u00e9o_Hernandez", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Th\u00e9o Hernandez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Saliba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Saliba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Danso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Danso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayot_Upamecano", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dayot Upamecano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Camavinga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Camavinga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferland_Mendy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ferland Mendy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'\u00c9quipe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "L'\u00c9quipe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

The French captain suffered the injury during his team's 1-0 victory over Austria on Monday. The 25-year-old forward was spotted at France's training base in Paderborn on Wednesday, sporting a protective covering over his nose. Initially, he trained separately from the rest of the squad but later joined them for shooting drills. By Thursday, Mbappe was training with a new mask adorned in the tricolore colors of the French flag. However, UEFA regulations require any protective mask to be a single uniform color, potentially necessitating a redesign for future matches.\n\nAlthough Mbappe's injury does not require immediate surgery, the French team is closely monitoring his condition and has refrained from providing a specific timeline for his return. With Friday's crucial match against the Netherlands fast approaching, the new mask hints that Mbappe could make a swift return to the lineup. Teammates have been optimistic about his recovery. Midfielder Adrien Rabiot expressed confidence in Mbappe's quick comeback during a press conference in Paderborn. \"A fractured nose isn't the end of the world,\" Rabiot stated through a translator, adding, \"Kylian should be with us pretty soon.\"\n\nDefender William Saliba also provided an update, saying he had spoken to Mbappe, who was feeling \"a bit better\" following the injury. Mbappe's nose was broken during a collision with Austria defender Kevin Danso, resulting in heavy bleeding that stained parts of his white France jersey red. \"I saw him this morning, he was a bit better,\" Saliba shared. \"I think he was off to do more tests. I don't know anything more. But when I saw him this morning, he was a bit better.\" Rabiot drew a comparison to a similar injury suffered by Juventus teammate Wojciech Szczesny, who broke his nose in April, underwent surgery, and returned to play the following week.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paderborn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paderborn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paderborn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien_Rabiot", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrien Rabiot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Saliba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Saliba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Danso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Danso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Surgery", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Surgery", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Tooling_and_Consumables", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Tooling and Consumables", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/mbappe-wears-a-protective-mask-202452547-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=Lto_uGPREdVJ92TgI9zHsGikp0mthVm8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662523", "eventUri": "eng-9662523", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

You didn't need to be a doctor to see that the Real Madrid star had broken his nose, with blood streaming from his nostrils.\n\nFrench supporters have been left sweating on Mbappe's fitness in the days since, with a crucial clash against the Netherlands coming up this Friday. Without their talisman, Les Bleus will be a little nervous coming up against the 1988 European champions.\n\nSo, will Mbappe be passed fit for France's clash with the Netherlands?\n\nIt was swiftly confirmed that Mbappe had indeed broken his noise after he was taken to Dusseldorf hospital. He has since returned to France's training camp and has been pictured alongside his teammates as they arrive in Leipzig for Friday's match with the Netherlands.\n\nFor now, however, he remains a significant fitness concern for manager Didier Deschamps, with his participation against the Dutch in doubt. Fortunately, he doesn't need surgery and will feature again at Euro 2024 providing his injury doesn't get any worse, but he will need to wear a protective face mask for the remainder of his time in Germany. It's feared he could miss the rest of the group stage.\n\nMbappe would be an enormous absentee for the French on Friday evening, with the 25-year-old having scored four goals in two Euro 2024 qualifying matches against the Netherlands. Up against a stern defence that contains the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Nathan Ake, Mbappe's unavailability could prove costly.\n\nDeschamps provided an update on Mbappe's health shortly after the final whistle against Austria, suggesting things didn't look good for his skipper.\n\n\"A broken nose? Apparently yes,\" admitted Deschamps. \"His nose is not right at all. We'll see. Obviously, it's tonight's negative. It's only a nose, but it's very bothering for us.\"\n\nDeschamps added: \"I don't have the elements in my hands. He didn't get off lightly. It is still to be seen. I cannot at this stage give the answer. He's not doing well. He's with the medical staff.\n\n\"His nose got badly hit that's for sure. We need to check, but it seems quite complicated, which is really unfortunate for us tonight.\"\n\nHowever, Mbappe's French teammate Adrien Rabiot has offered a slightly positive update on his situation.\n\n\"When we talk about Kylian Mbappe's broken nose, I do not think it is the end of the world. He can recover very fast. I also understand that he is not officially ruled out. So, things are not yet confirmed,\" stated Juventus midfielder Rabiot.\n\n\"We have an exceptional group of players, so I am not going to complain.

So that will have an impact, but we have an exceptional squad,\" midfielder Adrien Rabiot said on Wednesday.\n\n\"I am not going to complain given the lads we have on the bench. We have more than enough options to replace Kylian. I have total confidence in the guys on the bench and the quality we have.\"\n\nMbappe is his country's third-top scorer of all time with 47 goals from 80 caps, behind only Giroud and Thierry Henry.\n\nHowever, he had an outsize impact on their performances at the last World Cup, scoring eight goals -- half the team's total -- including an astonishing hat-trick in the final against Argentina.\n\nFrance met the Netherlands twice in Euro 2024 qualifying, and Mbappe scored a brace on each occasion, in a 4-0 win in Paris and in a 2-1 victory in Amsterdam.\n\nAbove all, it is worth considering how France have done in recent games without the player who has just ended a prolific seven-year spell at Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nDeschamps' team lost 2-1 in a friendly in Germany last September when Mbappe was left on the bench. They also laboured to a 0-0 draw against Canada in their final pre-tournament friendly when he only appeared as a late substitute.\n\n- Giroud's chance? -\n\nTheir goal threat is obviously not the same without Mbappe, even if he has still never scored at the European Championship.\n\nAt the last Euros three years ago, Mbappe failed to find the net and missed the crucial spot-kick in a last-16 loss on penalties to Switzerland.\n\nThe obvious option for Deschamps when it comes to replacing Mbappe would be to start Giroud, even if the big centre-forward is a very different player.\n\nGiroud, who will move to MLS after the tournament, is 37 now and has also been nursing a minor groin injury.\n\nHe ended up playing a key role in Qatar, and in similar circumstances -- Karim Benzema would have been ahead of him only to pull out injured at the last minute.\n\n\"My mindset is always the same, to bring something to the team when the coach gives me the chance,\" Giroud said after the Austria game.\n\nAnother option for Deschamps is to move Marcus Thuram in from the left wing and to a central role.\n\nThuram, though, has only scored twice for his country in 20 caps, and one of them came against Gibraltar.\n\nThen there is Randal Kolo Muani, but he appears low on confidence after a difficult season in Mbappe's shadow at PSG.\n\nOne thing is for sure, France's performance against Austria -- with the returning N'Golo Kante outstanding shielding an impressive defence -- indicated they do at least look solid enough to shut most opponents out as they wait for Mbappe to return.",

Head coach Didier Deschamps confirmed in a news conference on Thursday that France will \"make sure\" Mbappe is available and confirmed the soon-to-be Real Madrid man will wear a mask for the Netherlands game.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mbappe teased the prospect of him taking part in France's second game of the group stage with a cryptic message on social message. \"Without risks, there are no victories,\" he wrote on Instagram, sparking speculation he would be available for Friday's match.\n\n\"Everything's going in the right direction,\" Deschamps then said on Thursday. \"After this major shock that he's had, with the consequences of course. \"Yesterday, as you saw, he was able to go out and do a bit of activity.

If Mbappe is passed fit to return to action during the tournament, he will have to wear a protective mask whenever he plays. Other players to have worn a protective mask in the past include Harry Kane, John Terry and Robert Lewandowski.\n\nKylian Mbappe suffered a gruesome facial injury in France's Euro 2024 opener against Austria on Monday night as he broke his nose when colliding with opposing defender Kevin Danso. Pictures from the collision quickly circulated on social media which showed Mbappe's nose looking markedly different to how it usually does.\n\nReal Madrid's new signing attempted to play on after treatment but that was clearly not possible and he was withdrawn, with many fans left wondering when they would see him again during the tournament. Mbappe has achieved plenty during his career but one thing he is yet to do is score at a European Championship, and if he does check that milestone off his list over the next few weeks, he will do so while wearing a mask. Check out his mask below:\n\nWhy Some Footballers Wear Masks They are nothing new in the game\n\nDuring the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, a number of players, including Josko Gvardiol and Son Heung-min, sported facial masks to protect pre-existing facial injuries. If and when Mbappe returns to the pitch during this summer's tournament, he will don a similar mask to prevent further damage to his nose.\n\nThe masks are typically made from materials like polycarbonate and, for top athletes, are generally 3D-printed in order to fit their faces as well as possible. Tottenham forward Son was protecting a fractured eye socket when he wore a mask at the last World Cup and said of it: \"[The mask is] more comfortable than I thought. It's made of good material. It's light, hard when worn on the face, and it's a good material that can protect against impact. I was surprised that it was considerably lighter than I thought.\"\n\nRelated The 10 Greatest French Players in Football History [Ranked]\n\nFrance have produced so many icons over the years with Theirry Henry and Zinedine Zidane all making this list of the best French players of all time.\n\nOther notable players to have played in masks during their career are Paul Gascoigne, John Terry, Fernando Torres, Robert Lewandowski, Harry Kane, Victor Osimhen, Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas.\n\nFormer England midfielder Gascoigne sported a mask in a World Cup qualifier against Poland in 1993 after fracturing his cheekbone several days earlier in another qualifier against the Netherlands, while compatriots Terry and Kane did so after sustaining a broken cheekbone and a broken nose respectively.\n\nFormer Spain maestro and current Euro 2024 pundit for the BBC, Fabregas, wore a mask while playing for Chelsea in the Premier League in 2015 after breaking his nose in a previous game against Stoke. That same year, Poland legend Lewandowski was also forced to wear a mask after fracturing both his nose and his jaw during a Bundesliga match against former club Borussia Dortmund.\n\nMbappe Update Unclear if and when star will return\n\nIt is reported that Mbappe will likely require reconstructive surgery on his nose given the severity of the break, but that any operation will be delayed until after the tournament in order to give him the best possible chance of playing again during the tournament. Philippe Diallo, the president of the France Football Federation, refused to confirm whether Mbappe will definitely be able to play for France again this summer.\n\n\"The first responses were quite positive as there is no surgery planned for the moment,\" Diallo said. \"Now it is too soon to know if he will be able to play for the remainder of the tournament, or to provide a schedule for his situation.\n\nRelated Ranking the 15 Worst Injuries in Football History\n\nThe 15 worst injuries in football history have been listed by GIVEMESPORT, including Arsenal, Liverpool & Man Utd.\n\n\"Obviously there were some medical examinations performed on site to know more about Kylian Mbappe's nose and they made some conclusions pretty quickly. They tried to reduce the aftermath of his fracture, for him to be able to remain in the tournament. As I said, there is no surgery planned for the moment and we are still waiting for things to evolve later in order to know more about the conditions of his participation in the remainder of the tournament.\"\n\nMeanwhile, France manager Didier Deschamps said: \"The medical staff did what was necessary to reduce it as much as possible. Even if it will not be immediately, he will have to undergo surgery. Already this morning (Tuesday) he was a little better, so we will see that and monitor it closely every day.\"", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"},

Yesterday, he was able to go out and do a little activity. It's moving in the right direction to ensure that it can be available tomorrow.\"\n\nMbappe trained on the pitch in Leipzig with his team-mates on Thursday evening, wearing his newly-made protective mask.\n\nIt is a remarkable U-turn from Deschamps, who had insisted on Wednesday that he would not be risked. But the power Mbappe boasts in his homeland and within the squad may well have persuaded him to wait until the very last second before deciding his starting lineup.\n\n\"I try to have discussions with the players, those who are starting, those who aren't,\" added the France boss. \"This includes Kylian. I have to manage the group and I will manage the group.\"\n\nMbappe has made clear ever since the incident with Austria defender Kevin Danso that he wanted to return as soon as possible. Leaving hospital at 1am on Tuesday morning he took to social media asking \"any ideas for masks\".\n\nThat was a sign of his desire to return to a tournament which he is desperate to win. But discussions back at the French base camp had appeared to lead to the decision that he would sit it out.\n\nHowever, having taken part in a light session wearing his mask on Wednesday night, and with the swelling having gone down considerably, more conversations were held. Afterwards, he had taken to social media again to declare: \"Without risks, there are no victories.\"\n\nTeam-mate Antoine Griezmann admitted: \"Kylian is doing very well, his nose is less swollen. We will see how he is doing until the end. His feeling will be the deciding factor.\"\n\nThe Atletico Madrid star also insisted whatever the decision, France will adapt. \"I think the entire team will have to adapt. I really don't know if he's going to be playing,\" he added.\n\n\"Having one of the best players in the world, or not, definitely changes things. We'll see how it goes.

want to fast-track Kylian Mbappe's surgery for broken nose", "body": "Real Madrid have reportedly told the French camp that they want Kylian Mbappe to undergo surgery as soon as possible.\n\nReal Madrid are closely monitoring the development of Kylian Mbappe's injury while on international duty.\n\nHowever, an injury for star player Kylian Mbappe in the closing moments of the Austria match put a shadow over the win for France.\n\nMbappe broke his nose after a collision with Austria's Kevin Danso, concerning the leadership of Real Madrid who signed the forward earlier this month.\n\nWhile it was initially believed that the 25-year-old would not require surgery on his nose, France manager Didier Deschamps confirmed on Tuesday that this was not the case, saying that the forward will need to undergo an operation but 'not immediately.'\n\nAccording to L'Equipe, this concerned Madrid, who told the French camp that they hope Mbappe will get the required surgery as soon as possible to shorten healing times and have him looking his best in his presentation next month.\n\nMbappe's official reveal at the Santiago-Bernabeu is scheduled for July 16 but will be postponed if Madrid believe the bruises from the surgery will ruin the appearance of their star signing at the presentation.\n\nAlthough the Madrid doctors inquired about the injury, they are legally unable to do anything as the Frenchman remains under contract with Paris Saint-Germain and will not officially join the Spanish champions until July 1.\n\nAdditionally, the decision on his surgery date ultimately rests with the player, and while he is with his national team, his recovery remains the responsibility of the French Federation.\n\nHowever, Madrid have made their feelings clear, saying that they do not want their superstar to play in Friday's match against the Netherlands or Tuesday's against Poland.\n\nMbappe is expected to make his debut for Real Madrid in the European Super Cup final against Atalanta Bergamo on August 14.\n\nBut if France go far at Euro 2024, further delaying Mbappe's surgery, this is likely to be delayed until after the start of the La Liga season, allowing the forward to fully recover.", "source": {"uri": "sportbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.sportbible.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki",

If he sits out Friday's game, the Netherlands will be relieved not to have to face the French forward again.\n\nIn the Euro qualifying phase, the two nations were also drawn in the same group, with the French coming out on top in both meetings, in which Mbappe scored four goals.\n\nThe Dutch are, in fact, his favourite opponent, having netted five times in six games against them, and the first of his 47 international goals also came against the Netherlands back in 2017.\n\n\"Obviously, the French team with or without him, this is not the same thing. I hope he can be there,\" Deschamps said after the Austria game.\n\nFor Mbappe, the setback is yet more Euro heartbreak. He has never scored at a Euro finals tournament, and in 2021, Mbappe's penalty was saved in the shootout with Switzerland which saw France exit at the last 16 stage.\n\nMbappe may yet get the chance to put things right in Germany, but for now, if France manager Didier Deschamps does need to do without his most creative and dangerous player, he may turn to a man with plenty of tournament experience.\n\nOlivier Giroud replaced Mbappe on Monday, as he did in their last friendly game against Canada, but the striker is struggling with an adductor injury which kept him out of training on Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm not thinking about myself in that moment. I'm thinking of Kylian, of the team,\" Giroud said after the Austria game.\n\n\"In any case, we don't know what will happen for the next match.\"\n\nThis is Giroud's seventh major tournament with France, and the team's all-time leading scorer would dearly love to go out on a high having said that this would be his last.\n\nThe Netherlands is well aware of the strength of this French squad - with or without Mbappe - but given his record against it, his probable absence would only be seen as a positive.\n\nRonald Koeman's side also won its opening game, but had to come from behind to defeat Poland 2-1. and was guilty of missing an array of chances. It will need be more clinical in front of goal when it gets the opportunity against France.\n\nThe Dutch will try to ignore recent history and instead look to the spirit of 1988, when the Netherlands won the Euros in West Germany, its only major title.\n\nLatest on SportstarIND vs AFG Dream11 Prediction, T20 World Cup 2024 Super 8: India vs Afghanistan predicted playing XI, fantasy team, squads Team SportstarIND vs AFG pitch report, T20 World Cup 2024 Super 8: Kensington Oval ground conditions, toss factor, stats and recordsTeam SportstarNED vs FRA, Euro 2024: France aims to continue recent superiority over Dutch, with or without Mbappe ReutersIndia vs Afghanistan Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: IND and AFG kick off their Super 8 campaigns;

with midfielder Adrien Rabiot backing those lower down the pecking order to step up.\n\nHe said: \"A fractured nose isn't the end of the world so he should be with us pretty soon.\n\n\"Playing without Kylian could be tough, he is a very important player, the captain.\n\n\"It will have an impact on us but for the opponents it will be a different way for them to play their game.\n\n\"We definitely want him to play but looking at who we have on the bench we have what it takes to replace Kylian.\n\n\"We have to count on the group.\n\n\"If he is not there then it is going to be more tough but I trust the great players we have on the team.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gary_stonehouse@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Gary Stonehouse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jack_rosser@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Jack Rosser", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Danso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Danso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Deschamps", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Didier Deschamps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien_Rabiot", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrien Rabiot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Fantasy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MM-OFF-PLATFORM-mbappe.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662523", "eventUri": "eng-9662523", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

This decision comes after the star forward suffered a painful broken nose during France's 1-0 victory over Austria on Monday.\n\nInitially, reports indicated that Mbappe might require surgery, which would have sidelined him for the next two matches. However, in a surprising turn of events, photos surfaced on social media on Thursday showing the 25-year-old participating in training sessions while wearing the specially designed mask, suggesting his readiness to play against the Dutch.\n\nIn a press conference earlier on Thursday, France's head coach Didier Deschamps provided an encouraging update on Mbappe's condition.\n\n\"Everything was going in the right direction yesterday. He was able to go out and do activities like he did this evening, things are moving in the right direction so that he can be available tomorrow,\" the Frenchman said.\n\nThe protective mask, emblazoned with the French national colors, is designed to safeguard Mbappe's injured nose while allowing him to participate fully in the match. The team's medical staff has been closely monitoring his recovery, ensuring that he remains fit to play without risking further injury.\n\nMbappe's presence on the field is a significant boost for France as they prepare to face a strong Netherlands side. His leadership and scoring ability will be crucial for Les Bleus throughout the tournament, and his potential return is expected to bolster the team's chances of advancing further in the competition.\n\nFans and teammates alike are eagerly anticipating Mbappe's performance, with hopes that the mask will not hinder his agility or effectiveness on the pitch. The sight of the French captain donning the patriotic mask is likely to inspire his team and fans, symbolizing resilience and determination.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Deschamps", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Didier Deschamps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French people"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01j0vagwxkaq300h34n2zn0v66/capture.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662523", "eventUri": "eng-9662523", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Medics had initially estimated he could be sidelined for at least ten days.\n\n\"Ultimately if he can breathe it is not a functional injury,\" London-based NHS plastics surgeon Mark Mikhail told MailOnline. Dr. Mikhail noted that while Mbappe might not need immediate surgery for his facial trauma, any cosmetic adjustments should be made within three weeks to avoid undesirable results.\n\nHe suggests that Mbappe's nose may have been realigned shortly after the match, potentially eliminating the need for immediate surgery.\n\n\"When a break is really fresh like that because he is playing football and there is loads of adrenaline, they may have had enough mobility to nudge his nose back in place,\" he said. \"The surgery for a broken nose is often just done a few days later with a local anesthetic, rather than full-blown surgery and they just nudge it back into place,\" he added.\n\nJournalist Julien Laurens reported early Tuesday that Mbappe will not require surgery on his nose. French outlet L'Equipe confirmed he left a D\u00fcsseldorf hospital late Monday after various tests. The French Football Federation stated the tests were reassuring, indicating no need for surgery.\n\nThe French Football Federation also said he has returned to France's team hotel, where he will be closely monitored by medical staff over the next few days.\n\nIn a statement, the federation said: \"Kylian Mbappe suffered a broken nose during the second part of the Austria-France held this Monday in Dusseldorf.\n\n\"The captain of France was treated first by the medical staff and Dr. Franck Le Gall, who diagnosed him with a nose fracture. Mbappe will receive treatment in the next few days, but he will not undergo surgery in the immediate future.\n\n\"A mask will be made for him so that the number 10 of the French national team can prepare for his return to the competition after a period dedicated to treatment.\"\n\nThe NHS recommends avoiding sports for at least six weeks if there's a risk of facial impact. However, athletes might opt to wear specialized plastic face and nose guards to return to play sooner while minimizing further injury, according to Dr. Mikhail.\n\n\"If the nasal bones are broken, then it will obviously be fragile. Even if the bone is sat in the right place you want to keep it there, so you will want to protect it from further injury,\" Dr Mikhail said.\n\n\"[A mask] is slightly different to a post operative splint, which is trying to hold it in place, instead this would just try and protect the nose,' he added.\n\nIn most cases, surgery doesn't happen immediately after a break because the face is very swollen.\n\n\"You generally wait for the swelling to settle down before assessing it and seeing if anything needs to be done,\" Dr Mikhail said.\n\n\"After the swelling has died down you can also work out whether there is a breathing problem or a deviation that will have a significant cosmetic outcome.\"", "source": {"uri": "face2faceafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Face2Face Africa"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_nartey@face2faceafrica.com", "name": "Stephen Nartey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00fcsseldorf", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Danso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Danso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facial trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrenaline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthetic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local anesthetic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'\u00c9quipe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "L'\u00c9quipe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cosmetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasal bone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Surgery", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Surgery", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Oral_Surgery", "label": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Oral Surgery", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Transition", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Transition", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://face2faceafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mbappe-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662523", "eventUri": "eng-9662523", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

The FFF will need to ask UEFA and clear whatever mask he chooses to wear.\n\nMbappe has a number of masks prepared, all of a single colour, which will work inside UEFA's regulations, the FFF has confirmed to The Athletic.\n\nThe FFF knew of the guidance that must be followed before getting the masks made. He also has different sizes prepared.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mbappe teased the prospect of him taking part in France's second game of the group stage with a cryptic message on social message.\n\n\"Without risks, there are no victories,\" he wrote on Instagram, sparking speculation he would be available.\n\n\"Everything's going in the right direction,\" Didier Deschamps then said at his news conference on Thursday.\n\n\"After this major shock that he's had, with the consequences of course. \"Yesterday, as you saw, he was able to go out and do a bit of activity. And that'll be the case tonight too.\n\n\"So things are moving in the right direction so that he can be available tomorrow. We'll make sure he's available, I repeat.\"\n\nUEFA regulations require teams to confirm their teams at least an hour before kick-off of each game.\n\nFrance face Netherlands at 8pm BST (3pm ET) in Leipzig on Friday.\n\nA win will see them progress to the next phase of the tournament.

The prospect of missing such a significant fixture was a blow to both the team and supporters. However, recent developments have injected a sense of optimism into the camp. Mbappe's presence in training, albeit limited, hints at the possibility of his participation in the upcoming clash.

It also witnessed the unveiling of a tricolore mask to protect Kylian Mbappe's fractured nose, although we won't be seeing it in Friday's game between France and the Netherlands, even if Mbappe does feature in the game.\n\nEngland's underwhelming tournament continued, with Gareth Southgate's side only able to draw 1-1 with Denmark in Frankfurt. As they did against Serbia, England took the lead -- via Harry Kane's 13th career goal at a tournament -- but ceded control of the match almost immediately. Denmark's subsequent equaliser from a Morten Hjulmand long shot was as good as it was inevitable. That match was preceded by another Group C 1-1 draw, Serbia equalising in the 95th minute against Slovenia to leave all four teams with a chance to progress in the final games on Tuesday.\n\nAnd if Denmark provided us with the day's long-range goal, the customary own goal came in the Spain vs Italy game, with Riccardo Calafiori becoming the fifth player to put through his own net at Euro 2024. Victory sees Spain progress to the knockout stage as group winners, while for Italy it's all to play for against Croatia on Monday.\n\nOur writers run you through the highlights of the day.\n\nDespite the opening goal, this was not a classic Harry Kane performance.\n\nHe started the game in the best possible way, slotting in Kyle Walker's cross to put England 1-0 up in the 18th minute. It felt like an important goal for a man who has made a habit of starting the last two tournaments slowly before finding his best form during the knockout phase. That made this the first goal he had scored in a group stage since his hat-trick against Panama in Nizhny Novgorod almost six years ago.\n\nBut just as Kane was criticised for not doing enough in the build-up against Serbia, today he was criticised for not doing enough as a conventional No 9. He didn't press, didn't run in behind and never looked at 100 per cent.\n\nThe Bayern Munich striker missed final two games of the Bundesliga season due to a back issue. He then came on as a substitute during England's first pre-tournament friendly against Bosnia & Herzegovina, before starting and playing 65 minutes in the 1-0 loss against Iceland a few days later.\n\nBut Southgate appeared to play down any injury fears for England's captain after the Denmark game.\n\n\"We needed energy,\" Southgate said when asked about Kane's withdrawal. \"We've had two games in a short turnaround -- we needed fresh legs, we needed energy to press and at that stage of the game. I think Harry only had the one 90 minutes in over a month, that was the decision that we took.\"\n\nAnd while it's true that Kane often doesn't play 90 minutes in games for England in the early stages of tournaments, it raises questions going into the Slovenia game, just as there have been in group stages in the past.\n\nJack Pitt-Brooke\n\nWhat we do know: Kylian Mbappe will wear a mask when he returns to play at Euro 2024.\n\nWhat we still don't know: what it will look like.\n\nThe France captain, 25, fractured his nose in their first game of the tournament. He avoided surgery but, following medical assessment, it has been determined he must wear protective equipment to safely return to the field.\n\nMbappe was pictured in a mask with the French national colours of red, white and blue -- the tricolore -- and the French Football Federation (FFF) logo on it during training on Thursday.\n\nBut Mbappe will not be allowed to wear it in a game -- UEFA has very specific rules on clothing and other equipment worn while playing.\n\nIt reads: \"Medical equipment (e.g. head protection, face-masks, casts, kneepads or knee braces, elbow pads): Medical equipment worn on the field of play must be a single colour and free of team and manufacturer identification.\n\n\"Items worn on legs and arms should be the same colour as the corresponding playing attire item (e.g. elbow pads or tape used on the arm the same colour as shirt sleeves and kneepads the same colour as shorts).\"\n\nAny equipment has to be approved by UEFA so it is not possible for Mbappe to take the field wearing a mask that does not adhere to those regulations. The FFF will need to ask UEFA and clear whatever mask he chooses to wear.\n\nMbappe has a number of masks prepared, all of a single colour, which will work inside UEFA's regulations, the FFF has confirmed to The Athletic.\n\nThe FFF knew of the guidance that must be followed before getting the masks made. He has also had different sizes prepared.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mbappe teased the prospect of him taking part in France's second game of the group stage with a cryptic message on social media.\n\n\"Without risks, there are no victories,\" he wrote on Instagram, sparking speculation he would be available.\n\n\"Everything's going in the right direction,\" Didier Deschamps then said at his news conference on Thursday.\n\n\"After this major shock that he's had, with the consequences of course. Yesterday, as you saw, he was able to go out and do a bit of activity. And that'll be the case tonight too.\n\n\"So things are moving in the right direction so that he can be available tomorrow. We'll make sure he's available, I repeat.\"\n\nCharlotte Harpur\n\nThis was definitely the best that Spain have played since Luis de la Fuente became national coach in December 2022, and arguably their best display since the Euro 2020 semi-final against Italy, or maybe even the Euro 2012 final, against Italy too.\n\nDe la Fuente's side went on the attack from the first whistle, mixing direct running wingers Nico Williams and Lamine Yamal, with incisive passing from midfield trio Pedri, Rodri and Fabian Ruiz. Williams' dribbling especially was causing havoc every time he got on the ball, and everything seemed to be clicking perfectly for his team.\n\nSpain had nine shots -- four on target -- before Italy managed their first effort at goal, a wild effort from Federico Chiesa just before the break.\n\nThe one-way traffic continued after half-time, and Spain got to 11 efforts at goal without finding the net. Persistence paid off though. when Williams once again drove at right-back Giovanni Di Lorenzo, and they deserved the good fortune which saw slight touches from both Alvaro Morata and Gianluigi Donnarumma before Calafiori could not help but knock the ball into his own goal.\n\nThe Spanish fans in Gelsenkirchen were loving it, with 'Ole' cheers breaking around the stands. The only slight concern was having so many shots and only scoring once. But with qualification for the next round secured already, De La Fuente and his team were very satisfied with their night's work.\n\nThe main themes from the first seven days of Euro 2024 have largely been positive. We've seen high-tempo, high-scoring games, excellent atmospheres and the underdogs being competitive. But perhaps the most notable aspect has been the number of long-range goals.\n\nAt a time when many believe that shooting from distance is being discouraged in top-level club football, this European Championship has provided something of a contrast. But is this all true? And if so, what is the reason for the number of successful long-range strikes?\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge that this is a relatively small sample size. Only 18 games have been played over the tournament's opening seven days.\n\nSecond, let's be realistic about the nature of the goals from outside the box.\n\nYes, there have been some crackers. But both Cody Gakpo's equaliser for the Netherlands against Poland and Erik Janza's equaliser for Slovenia against Denmark took heavy deflections on their way in. Kerem Akturkoglu's clinching goal in Turkey's thrilling 3-1 win against Georgia in the 97th minute was into an empty net after the goalkeeper went up to try to score an equaliser, so can hardly be considered a proper long-range strike. And two of Germany's goals in the 5-1 win over Scotland were struck from outside the box, certainly, but also were from within the 'D', from 19 and 22 yards respectively, so barely qualify as long-range shots.\n\nBut there have been some excellent long-range goals, including two for Romania in their 3-0 win against Ukraine, and the other two goals Turkey scored. And the interesting thing is the trajectory of the ball.\n\nThe long-range strikes have not, by and large, been absolutely thumped in, flying along in a straight line. They have instead curled or bent towards the goal astutely. And this kind of trajectory depends on the ball moving properly in the air, which is something we've probably come to take for granted.\n\nThe Euro 2024 ball is not a major outlier from other balls of the current era, although it appears fast through the air. But the key is that it moves in the correct manner. And, thus far, we've had great examples of the four different ways players can -- deliberately -- get a ball to move.\n\nYou can curl it conventionally with your instep, getting around the ball and moving it on a smooth trajectory. Or you can bend the ball by cutting across it, connecting with either the top or outside of your foot, bringing more dramatic movement.\n\nAnd then, in terms of direction, you can apply movement to take it away from the goalkeeper and towards the corner, or you can start the ball outside the post and bring it back inside.\n\nNicolae Stanciu's goal for Romania came from a ball laid back to him. He used the spin on the ball in his favour, getting under and around it and sending it curling away from the goalkeeper into the far corner.\n\nArda Guler's stunner against Georgia came from a broadly similar technique -- albeit left-footed -- but he was getting around the ball to start it outside the post and bring the shot into the goal.\n\nBut we've also seen players getting reverse movement by cutting across the ball. Mert Muldur's opener that day for Turkey saw him slicing across -- and slightly underneath -- the ball to make it fade away from the goalkeeper into the top corner.\n\nMeanwhile, Nicolo Barella's technique for Italy against Albania was broadly similar -- note the standing foot, almost facing towards the near side rather than towards goal -- but that was bringing the ball back in towards goal.\n\nWhat we don't see these days is the ball moving unpredictably, moving up and down unexpectedly, or moving left and right in quick succession. That period probably explains the 2006-08 rise in long-range goals. Equally, we haven't seen anything like World Cup 2010, where the lack of drag on the ball meant players struggled to get dip or movement, and it essentially carried on flying after it was struck (usually over the crossbar).\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this trend of long-range strikes will continue throughout Euro 2024. But it seems clear that great technique is being rewarded with great goals.\n\nMichael Cox\n\nFriday is the penultimate day at Euro 2024 to contain a game in the early timeslot -- so make the most of

You saw in the qualifiers, we were full of belief, trust, we were going for every ball. Maybe on Friday we played with a little fear and that has to change, said Robertson ahead of tonight's huge clash against Switzerland.\n\n\"We know, and the whole country knows, we should have done better. We want to show this tournament what Scotland is about.\n\n\"We have to get back to being ourselves. We haven't been ourselves, well, we weren't on Friday. We have to remember what we were good at before. We have to get back to trusting ourselves and whoever's next to us on the pitch.\"\n\nFrench football president Philippe Diallo says it's too early to confirm whether or not Kylian Mbappe will be ruled out of the rest of Euro 2024 after suffering a broken nose in their opening win over Austria.\n\nLes Blues are next in action against the Netherlands on Friday while they face Poland next Tuesday, but the federation's president insists no decision has been made on the forward's involvement yet with France one of the favorites to go all the way.\n\n\"The first responses were quite positive as there is no surgery planned for the moment,\" said Diallo.\n\n\"Now it is too soon to know if he will be able to play for the remainder of the tournament, or to provide a schedule for his situation. Obviously there were some medical examinations performed on site to know more about Kylian Mbappe's nose and they made some conclusions pretty quickly.\n\n\"They tried to reduce the aftermath of his fracture, for him to be able to remain in the tournament. As I said, there is no surgery planned for the moment and we are still waiting for things to evolve later in order to know more about the conditions of his participation in the remainder of the tournament.\"\n\n\"Even if it will not be immediately, he will have to undergo surgery,\" added France boss Didier Deschamps. \"This morning he was a little bit better, so we will see that and monitor it closely every day.\"\n\nDaniel McDonnell took in yesterday's wild group stage clash between Turkey and Georgia in Dortmund and you can read his piece on a game for the ages here.\n\nHow Portugal's unexpected decision with Cristiano Ronaldo has made them huge Euro 2024 contenders, writes Miguel Delaney.\n\nI spent a week in Croatia earlier this month to find out why coaching numbers are the biggest difference between Ireland and the Balkan nation, who have qualified for 13 out of the last 15 major tournaments.\n\nAidan Fitzmaurice spoke to four League of Ireland players who recalled their days alongside some of those who will feature in Germany this month.\n\n\"I think maybe it would be better this time not to speak too much and put the action on the pitch and show everyone what we can do. You've got to bounce back and show what you're made of in the next game. My emotions are fine,\" Scotland boss Steve Clarke didn't give too much away in an interview with the BBC last night, ahead of his side's crucial clash against Switzerland tonight.\n\nPrize money of \u20ac331m will be distributed to all 24 teams based on their performances at this summer's finals, but should a country win every match in Germany and lift the trophy, they would be in line for a \u20ac28m reward.\n\nHosts Germany (1972, 1980, 1996) and Spain (1964, 2008, 2012) both lead the way in tournament wins with three each.

Thousands of jobs were also added statewide.\n\nIn May, the unemployment rate was at 4.3%, and it dropped 0.4% to become 3.9% in June, the latest labor report shows. The national average in June is 4.1%.\n\nThe report shows Connecticut employers added approximately 3,300 jobs in June. This continues the six-month job growth trend of employers adding an average of 3,000 jobs per month. Connecticut's labor force participation rate is at 64.6%, which is higher than the 62.6% national average, according to the press release.\n\nCTDOL's Commissioner Dant\u00e9 Bartolomeo said, \"The state's economy remains steady and stable with sustainable growth across a broad range of industries, a low unemployment rate, and good opportunities for job seekers.\"\n\n\"Inflation has slowed, which is welcome news for Connecticut workers, and if the national economy remains in good shape, economists expect 2024 to be another growth year,\" Bartolomeo added.\n\nThe press release highlighted seasonal adjustment is a factor in this report. It's a process that smooths out normal economic patterns in the retail, warehousing and transportation industry during the holidays. It also happens to education jobs in the fall.\n\nIt says, \"While seasonally adjusted numbers show a slight drop in June, jobs increased according to not seasonally adjusted data.\" For the third time since 2008, added construction jobs are above 65,000.\n\nThe report compares today's economy to how it looked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Connecticut has recovered 105.2% of payroll jobs lost during the pandemic. As well as 105.7% of private sector jobs, a record high, according to the report.\n\nWhile people are getting more jobs, temporary jobs like the Administrative and Support Services is declining. The reason for this is not mentioned in the press release nor the report.\n\nRELATED: 'Solid job growth' in 2023 jobs report by Connecticut labor department\n\nRELATED: Connecticut launches new unemployment system\n\nEmily McGlynn is a producer at FOX61 News.

Iowa Workforce Development (IWD) says the state's labor force participation rate decreased to 66.5 percent from 66.7 percent in May, primarily due to a rise in retirements.\n\nThe number of unemployed Iowans decreased to 46,600 in June from 46,900 in May. The total number of working Iowans fell to 1,641,400 in June. This figure is 3,200 lower than May and 21,400 lower than one year ago.\n\n\"Despite ongoing economic challenges, Iowa's workforce held steady during June as private industries advanced by 1,500 jobs,\" says Beth Townsend, Executive Director of Iowa Workforce Development. \"Iowa's economy has shown great resilience and employers continue to hire. IowaWORKS.gov includes over 58,000 open jobs and our team is ready to help Iowans find their next new opportunity.\"\n\nIWD says while the state experienced strong gains in February and March, payrolls have been relatively flat over the last three months. Private industry gains in June were most evident in health care and social assistance along with professional and business services. On the other hand, losses in manufacturing led to a small drop in goods-producing industries.\n\nCompared to June 2023, Iowa establishments have added 20,900 jobs. IWD says health care and social assistance gained the most jobs during that span (+7,100). Leisure and hospitality industries also showed strong signs of hiring, adding 5,900 jobs over the last twelve months.

Think again", "body": "Think job numbers are improving? Think again\n\nBoth May and April figures were revised down nearly 100,000\n\nThe Biden administration's latest jobs report is another example of how all that glitters is not gold. What looked like 206,000 jobs added to the economy were actually less than half that, with terrible internal dynamics. All while the labor market ominously flashed a recession warning sign with a perfect 50-year track record.\n\nMore than half the payrolls that businesses allegedly added in June were simply replacing jobs we thought we already had but didn't: Both May and April jobs numbers were revised down by nearly 100,000, making June's growth anemic.\n\nWorse, fully one-third of the jobs added in June were in government -- within spitting distance to Soviet levels of employment composition. Considering it takes many private sector jobs to support a government worker -- who produces nothing -- a 2-to-1 ratio is nowhere near enough.\n\nFor that matter, even if 10 times as many private sector jobs were added, it still wouldn't create enough tax revenue to support the number of public sector jobs being added, making the current job market trend unsustainable.\n\nOf course, those are just direct hires by the government, not all the new jobs paid for by taxpayer dollars -- the \"welfare-Industrial complex.\" To illustrate, when the government gives money to a hospital for migrant care that hires a nurse, this new job is also taxpayer-funded. Adding these indirect hires to the direct government hires shows that about 60% of new jobs are paid for by you, the taxpayer.\n\nIt worsens when we look at the composition of full-time and part-time jobs. June saw 30,000 full-time jobs evaporate, replaced by part-time work. This is not a new phenomenon but an ongoing trend: In the last year, the economy has hemorrhaged 1.6 million full-time jobs, replacing them with 1.8 million part-time ones.\n\nThis matters because part-time jobs are overwhelmingly for economic reasons. People would rather work a full-time, stable job. But when those aren't available, they'll take what they can get, replacing a 9-to-5 job with two or more part-time gigs. A consistent income stream has been replaced by several volatile ones.\n\nThis helps explain why the number of payrolls has continued to rise substantially while the number of people employed has not. Employment has fallen by 667,000 since last November, which has caused the unemployment rate to rise from 3.7% to 4.1%, nearly triggering the dreaded Sahm Rule, which indicates a recession has likely begun.\n\nThis indicator is not to be taken lightly. It hasn't had a false positive since 1976 and has signaled the start of every recession since 1970.\n\nEven that's sugarcoating it. The unemployment rate is still artificially low because millions of Americans are missing from the labor market. The reason: When the government imposed draconian lockdowns in 2020, millions of people dropped out of work, and many never returned.\n\nEven though these people didn't have jobs, they weren't counted as unemployed since they were not actively looking for one. That reduced the unemployment rate without creating a single job.\n\nThe number of missing workers today is between 4.9 million and 7.3 million. If these people -- who don't have jobs -- were accounted for, then the unemployment rate would jump from 4.1% to between 6.8% and 8.1%. That's deep recession territory.\n\nLast, if there's any doubt that the American labor market isn't working for Americans, consider that literally all the net job growth over the last year went to foreign-born workers. While native-born Americans lost over 900,000 jobs. Fewer people are employed today than before the pandemic, while their inflation-adjusted earnings are down almost 4% on average.\n\nAs Congress' big spenders keep fueling inflation and crowding out the productive private sector, the infamous stagflation of the 1970s is about to rear its ugly head -- and that means more job losses are to come.\n\nIn short, the radical left has turned the American labor market into a temp agency for foreigners while creating a record number of government jobs.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Working time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973\u20131975_recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1973\u20131975 recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowding_out_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crowding out (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real versus nominal value (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temporary work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Employment", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals/Employment", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/07/17/B1_Antoni1_c0-467-1400-1283_s1770x1032.jpg?c6a1e6ace1a2c7d02c3f33929c2b9877542152f0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744736", "eventUri": "eng-9744736", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The estimated number of people out of work remained at 361,000 in June.\n\nJimmy Heckman, the department's chief of workforce statistics and economic research, attributed the decrease in the labor force primarily to retirements, while saying workforce participation remains strong among people ages 25 to 54.\n\n\"We've looked at things like discouraged workers, workers that feel like there's no opportunities out there for them. Those numbers have remained really, really low over the past 12 months,\" Heckman said during a conference call with reporters.\n\nIn June, the largest employment drop was in the category of leisure and hospitality, which lost 14,700 positions. The majority lost involved jobs in hotels and food services.\n\nHeckman said Orlando, which typically adds hospitality jobs in June, posted a reduction for the month, while coastal areas of the Panhandle were slower in hiring than usual.\n\n\"Despite the drop-off in June over the year, we're still seeing there are more jobs in that sector in Florida than there were in June last year,\" Heckman said. \"So, that point is still a little bit of a washout in terms of what we've seen over the past year.\"\n\nThe leisure-and-hospitality category in June was up 16,700 positions from a year earlier.

The decline was due entirely to a drop in resident employment which also was down from a record high in May.

Financial activities and leisure & hospitality both also reached record high levels in June.\n\nOver the year, total nonfarm jobs were up 98,100 with gains in seven of the 11 supersectors.

Government, for example, saw a decrease of 1,500 jobs over June, and Professional and Business Services saw a decrease of 1,400.\n\nHowever, a gain of about 3,500 jobs in the Leisure and Hospitality industry, and growth in the construction sector, counteracted many of those losses.\n\n\"Construction employment rose significantly, growing by more than 11% over the year while wholesale and retail trade each were down by about 1%,\" Schmidt said.\n\nMost of the June job losses were centered in the Las Vegas metro area, which experienced a decrease equivalent to 2,000 jobs in June. Nevada's capital, Carson City, also saw a decrease of about 100 jobs. Meanwhile, the Reno metro area saw an increase of 600 jobs.\n\nThe rise in unemployment is a reverse of job gains made in May, when Nevada's oft-held title as the state with the worst unemployment rate in the nation was snatched by California's 5.3% unemployment rate. National state comparisons unemployment comparisons for June are not yet available.\n\nStill, Nevada has seen steady monthly job growth since pandemic closures helped Nevada go from having its lowest recorded unemployment rate of 3.6% in February 2020 to having the highest unemployment rate in the nation at 30%.\n\n\"Hourly wages rose at a slightly faster pace this month while average hours worked held steady.

Ahead of Nevada were Alaska and South Carolina, both at 3.5%.\n\nThe rise in unemployment also led to an increase in unemployment claims in the state. Unemployment insurance claims filed in Nevada rose by 6.8%, from 10,924 in May to 11,663 in June. The state also saw an increase of 16.3% in the number of weeks unemployment was claimed.

The state's current job count stands at 1,766,500.\n\nJune's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is estimated at 3.0%, up a tenth of a percent over May and a half a percent since May 2023. About 54,300 Utahns are unemployed. The June national unemployment rate increased one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.1%.\n\n\"The unemployment rate's creep higher reflects a softening labor market but 3% is still low territory, historically speaking,\" said Ben Crabb, chief economist at the Utah Department of Workforce Services.\n\nThe June numbers show another month of robust jobs growth , Crabb said.\n\n\"For the last year, job expansion has been concentrated in construction, private education and health services and the public sector. Public sector hiring is now starting to cool and the unemployment rate, while low, has been slowly ticking upward. With inflation trending in the right direction, an interest rate cut later this year is not out of the question and would stimulate continued job growth in the state,\" he said.\n\nUtah's June private sector employment recorded a year-over-year expansion of 2.1%, an increase of 31,300 jobs. Seven of the 10 major private-sector industry groups posted net year-over-year job gains. The overall gains are led by education and health services (13,000 jobs), professional and business services (7,900 jobs) and construction (5,700 jobs).

The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics reports show prices grew just 3% over the past year, beating analysts' expectations and bringing the Fed closer to the 2% target rate it hopes to attain.\n\n\"Lower interest rates would be welcome news for the state's economy as it would help stimulate job growth to keep the expansion of the last few years humming along for a while to come,\" Crabb said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Payroll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Unemployment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Unemployment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/deseret_news_992/2f9240de2d5ae6298fd2de76616b95ed", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744736", "eventUri": "eng-9744736", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The estimated number of people out of work remained at 361,000 in June.\n\nJimmy Heckman, the department's chief of workforce statistics and economic research, attributed the decrease in the labor force primarily to retirements, while saying workforce participation remains strong among people ages 25 to 54.\n\n\"We've looked at things like discouraged workers, workers that feel like there's no opportunities out there for them. Those numbers have remained really, really low over the past 12 months,\" Heckman said during a conference call with reporters.\n\nDonations for dummies.

The majority lost involved jobs in hotels and food services.\n\nHeckman said Orlando, which typically adds hospitality jobs in June, posted a reduction for the month, while coastal areas of the Panhandle were slower in hiring than usual.\n\n\"Despite the drop-off in June over the year, we're still seeing there are more jobs in that sector in Florida than there were in June last year,\" Heckman said. \"So, that point is still a little bit of a washout in terms of what we've seen over the past year.\"\n\nThe leisure-and-hospitality category in June was up 16,700 positions from a year earlier. The overall labor force grew by 66,000 people from June 2023.\n\nWith the national unemployment rate in June at 4.1 percent, Florida was one of 41 states where rates did not change from May.

In doing so, that sector posted the first year-over-year increase in payroll growth since January 2023.\n\n\"It's a good sign for the Inland Empire,\" said Manfred Keil, an economics professor at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, referring to the large number of warehouses and distribution centers that blanket parts of the counties east of Los Angeles.\n\nHe noted that the ports of L.A. and Long Beach have been busier this year, in part because of the diversion of cargo to the West Coast from the drought-stricken Panama Canal. That's provided a lift to the region's logistics industry, which Keil said has been coming back after a long period of pandemic-related ups and downs. \"The adjustment is over,\" he said.\n\nSouthern California also saw a glimmer of hope in the latest jobs data for the film industry.\n\nEmployment in the motion picture and sound recording industries rose by 3,000 jobs last month, to 121,200 statewide. While that number isn't adjusted for seasonal variations, the data in recent months suggest employment may be improving after sharp declines over much of the last two years amid the industry's labor strikes, streaming wars and other challenges.\n\nOverall, California's job growth in June was led by the combined trade and transportation sector, government, and information, which includes jobs in entertainment, according to the EDD.\n\nHealthcare and social assistance, which have long been the strongest job creators in the state and nation, took a bit of a pause in June.\n\nPayrolls at hotels and restaurants, as well as the entire grouping of leisure and hospitality businesses, were flat.\n\nAnd there were outright losses in the state's construction and manufacturing industries, which have been cutting jobs for most of the year.\n\nIn addition, tech sector employment remains lackluster.\n\nStatewide payrolls at computer systems and design firms, for example, were down in June on an year-over-over basis for the 16th straight month. And the recent announcement by Elon Musk that he plans to relocate SpaceX and X to Texas won't help.\n\nIf he follows through with it, Musk's move would complete \"the hollowing out of the once vibrant tech hub in the mid-Market area of San Francisco,\" said Michael Bernick, an employment attorney at Duane Morris in San Francisco. \" X's exit completes the exodus started by Uber in 2019, followed by Block (formerly Square) in 2022 and Reddit in 2023,\" he said.\n\nFor all industries, California's total payroll jobs rose 224,000 in June, or 1.3%, from a year ago. That compares with a growth rate of 1.7% for the nation as a whole, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_Development_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Employment Development Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claremont_McKenna_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claremont McKenna College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Empire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inland Empire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panama Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claremont,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claremont, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Claremont, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_S._Bernick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael S.

Department of Commerce reported on Friday.\n\nThe jobless rate has been in the 3.3% to 3.6% range over the past 13 months, including at 3.5% during January through April.\n\nAt 3.3%, the rate is near a 23-year low of 3%. The state rate also has been slightly below the national rate each of the past 16 months.\n\nSince the last time the state's jobless rate exceeded 4% in October 2021, some economists are questioning whether it's time to reassess whether a 5% unemployment rate still signifies full employment or could be lowered to 3.5% to 4%.\n\nAccording to Mark Vitner, a chief economist with Piedmont Crescent Capital, \"the economy is a little softer than the employment data suggests because the mix is now weighted toward more lower-paying jobs and income growth has slowed.\"\n\nAs has been the pattern for most of the past 18 months, there was notable churn among the 10 private-sector categories during June.\n\nIn the employer survey, there was an overall 23,100-job month-over-month net gain, representing 5,200 jobs in the private sector and 17,900 in government.\n\nLeading the private-sector net gains were 5,500 in education and health services, 3,200 in the lower-wage leisure/hospitality sector and 1,100 in financial activities.\n\nNearly offsetting those gains was a 6,800 decline in professional and business services jobs.\n\nThe sizable government jobs increase runs counter to the typical June monthly report in which there typically a decrease as public school teacher annual contracts expire. Teachers are counted as jobless until the next year's contract begins.\n\nYear-over-year, the state had a net increase of 51,100 private-sector jobs (up 1.2%) and 28,500 government jobs (up 3.8%).\n\nIn the household survey, there was a net gain of just 2,065 individuals in the labor force from May to June, representing 924 fewer employed North Carolinians and 2,989 listed as newly unemployed and looking for work.\n\nTaking a year-over-year look, the state's labor force is up 0.6% -- or by 32,860. That represents a net gain of 18,096 people listed as employed and an increase of 14,764 of those considered unemployed and looking for work.\n\n\"The fact that statewide labor market conditions held relatively steady over the past year arguably is a good thing given how the general aim of federal monetary policy has been to slow the labor market and increase unemployment as a way of countering inflation,\" said John Quinterno, principal with South by North Strategies Ltd., a Chapel Hill research company specializing in economic and social policy.\n\nYet, Quinterno said the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a lingering impact over the state's labor market.\n\nrcraver@wsjournal.com\n\n336-727-7376\n\n@rcraverWSJ\n\nThe business news you need\n\nGet the latest local business news delivered FREE to your inbox weekly.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

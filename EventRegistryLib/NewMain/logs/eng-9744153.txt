The IPO proceeds will provide capital to fund growth in Ardent Health's existing markets and acquire hospital groups in new markets with above-average population growth. The company had net income of $129 million on revenue of $5.4 billion in 2023, compared with net income of $265 million on revenue of $5.1 billion a year earlier.\n\nEquity Group Investments, the firm founded by Sam Zell, partnered with healthcare real estate investment trust Ventas to acquire Ardent in 2015. Ventas took ownership of Ardent's real estate, and EGI, along with several capital partners, acquired Ardent's operations and entered into a long-term master lease with Ventas. The offering was led by JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Morgan Stanley (MS). The company's shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ARDT.\n\nChief Executive Officer Marty Bonick emphasized that the IPO proceeds would support Ardent Health's expansion plans and acquisitions in high-growth markets. Despite the initial dip, Bonick remains optimistic about the company's prospects, noting the strategic advantage of operating in smaller markets with significant population movement from major metropolitan areas.", "source": {"uri": "quiverquant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "quiverquant.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Zell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Zell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privately held company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_investment_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate investment trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "None", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744153", "eventUri": "eng-9744153", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Ballard.\n\nIn essence, it is about the ephemeral nature of beauty - perhaps a weighty theme to press on the luminaries attending this year's gala.\n\nFor sheer drama, co-host Zendaya dominated the green and cream carpet in her first appearance at the Met Gala since 2019.\n\nREAD | From Water to sand: Tyla stole the show at the Met Gala and needed four male models to carry her\n\nThe 27-year-old star made a highly-anticipated appearance early on wreathed in jewel-toned lame, organza and satin designed by John Galliano, with vines crawling up her duchess corset and arms - and what appeared to be a hummingbird nestled into her neck.\n\nHours later she made a surprise second appearance - this time in dramatic, Mexican Gothic-inspired black, her two outfits bookending the fashion parade and underscoring the transience of beauty.\n\nMost attendees chose to evoke awakenings and life - and perhaps defied the theme by demonstrating the immortality of fashion through the centuries, with many 17th and 18th century flourishes.\n\nSome - such as singer Lana del Rey - emphasised decay, with stark sculptural twigs rising from her gown to hold a veil of tulle like a canopy over her head.\n\nSouth African singer Tyla's strapless Balmain gown evoking the sands of time - right down to the hourglass purse - was sculpted so tightly to her body that she had to be carried up the steps at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nPuerto Rican singer Bad Bunny evoked a kind of Tudor matador with a sweeping hat and a black bouquet, with the only pop of colour his bright red inseam and the patent shine of his cloven shoes.\n\nCardi B was resplendent in funereal black, with a train so expansive it required nine tuxedoed men to lift it up the stairs.\n\nCelebrity interpretations of Met Gala themes have been wide-ranging and often sparked social media debate - but attendees this year appeared to shrug off the pressure.\n\n\"I don't even think there's pressure at all; I think it's more of an opportunity,\" actor Colman Domingo, who carried a bouquet in a lily-coloured caped jacket and wide-leg trousers, told journalists.\n\nThe theme parallels the exhibit \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" which focuses on the most fragile pieces of the Costume Institute's vast collection.\n\nThe show, which will be on view for the public from 10 May through 2 September, features clothing so delicate it cannot be displayed on mannequins.\n\nThe Costume Institute relies on the blockbuster Met Gala to fund its work, including exhibitions and acquisitions.\n\nThe gala was first held in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society. Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, the high priestess of US fashion, took over the show in the 1990s, transforming the party into a catwalk for the rich and famous.\n\nThis year, a ticket cost a cool $75 000, with tables starting at $350 000. The 2023 gala - which celebrated the late designer Karl Lagerfeld - raised nearly $22 million, a record sum.\n\nBut what exactly goes on inside is an enduring mystery.\n\n\"Something mysterious, I'm sure and unexpected,\" actor Jeff Goldblum told journalists on the red carpet, dressed as a count swathed in Tiffany jewels.\n\nGuests are likely to peruse the exhibit, and stars such as Rihanna - whose command of the red carpet is usually unparalleled but who did not appear at this year's gala - have performed in the past.\n\nThe spectacle is social media catnip for celebrity watchers - and once again this year, both the gala and the exhibit are co-sponsored by TikTok.\n\nThe tech world joined luminaries of music, film, politics and sports on the carpet, with TikTok CEO Shou Chew, also an honorary co-chair, in attendance.\n\nOutside the event, several hundred protesters against the war in Gaza demonstrated nearby, with security tight and several arrests made as stars walked the red carpet.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hummingbird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The extravaganza's dress code this year is \"The Garden of Time\" -- which draws inspiration from the 1962 short story of the same name, written by English writer J.G. Ballard.\n\nIn essence, it is about the ephemeral nature of beauty - perhaps a weighty theme to press on the luminaries attending this year's gala. For sheer drama, co-host Zendaya dominated the green and cream carpet in her first appearance at the Met Gala since 2019.\n\nThe 27-year-old star made a highly-anticipated appearance early on wreathed in jewel-toned lame, organza and satin designed by John Galliano, with vines crawling up her duchess corset and arms - and what appeared to be a hummingbird nestled into her neck.\n\nHours later she made a surprise second appearance - this time in dramatic, Mexican Gothic-inspired black, her two outfits bookending the fashion parade and underscoring the transience of beauty.\n\nMost attendees chose to evoke awakenings and life - and perhaps defied the theme by demonstrating the immortality of fashion through the centuries, with many 17th and 18th century flourishes. Some - such as singer Lana del Rey - emphasized decay, with stark sculptural twigs rising from her gown to hold a veil of tulle like a canopy over her head.\n\nSouth African singer Tyla's strapless Balmain gown evoking the sands of time - right down to the hourglass purse - was sculpted so tightly to her body that she had to be carried up the steps at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nPuerto Rican singer Bad Bunny evoked a kind of Tudor matador with a sweeping hat and a black bouquet, with the only pop of color his bright red inseam and the patent shine of his cloven shoes.\n\nCardi B was resplendent in funereal black, with a train so expansive it required nine tuxedoed men to lift it up the stairs.\n\n\"It's a black rose,\" she told journalists.\n\nMysterious and unexpected\n\nCelebrity interpretation of Met Gala themes have been wide-ranging and often sparked social media debate - but attendees this year appeared to shrug off the pressure.\n\n\"I don't even think there's pressure at all, I think it's more of an opportunity,\" actor Colman Domingo, who carried a bouquet in a lily-colored caped jacket and wide-leg trousers, told journalists. The theme parallels the exhibit \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" which focuses on the most fragile pieces of the Costume Institute's vast collection.\n\nThe show, which will be on view for the public from May 10 through September 2, features clothing so delicate it cannot be displayed on mannequins. The Costume Institute relies on the blockbuster Met Gala to fund its work, including exhibitions and acquisitions.\n\nThe gala was first held in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society. Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, the high priestess of US fashion, took over the show in the 1990s, transforming the party into a catwalk for the rich and famous.\n\nThis year, a ticket cost a cool $75,000, with tables starting at $350,000. The 2023 gala - which celebrated the late designer Karl Lagerfeld - raised nearly $22 million, a record sum.\n\nBut what exactly goes on inside is an enduring mystery. \"Something mysterious, I'm sure, and unexpected,\" actor Jeff Goldblum told journalists on the red carpet, dressed as a count swathed in Tiffany jewels.\n\nGuests are likely to peruse the exhibit, and stars such as Rihanna -- whose command of the red carpet is usually unparalleled, but who did not appear at this year's gala -- have performed in the past.\n\nSocial media frenzy\n\nThe spectacle is social media catnip for celebrity watchers -- and once again this year, both the gala and the exhibit are co-sponsored by TikTok. The tech world joined luminaries of music, film, politics and sports on the carpet, with TikTok CEO Shou Chew, also an honorary co-chair, in attendance.

Florals, animals and vintage couture abounded at the so-called Oscars of the East Coast, a mammoth fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute.\n\nThe extravaganza's dress code this year was \"The Garden of Time\" - which draws inspiration from the 1962 short story of the same name, written by English writer J.G. Ballard. In essence, it is about the ephemeral nature of beauty - perhaps a weighty theme to press on the luminaries attending this year's gala.\n\nFor sheer drama, co-host Zendaya dominated the green and cream carpet in her first appearance at the Met Gala since 2019. The 27-year-old star made a highly-anticipated appearance early on wreathed in jewel-toned lame, organza and satin designed by John Galliano, with vines crawling up her duchess corset and arms - and what appeared to be a hummingbird nestled into her neck.\n\nHours later she made a surprise second appearance - this time in dramatic, Mexican Gothic-inspired black, her two outfits bookending the fashion parade and underscoring the transience of beauty.\n\nMost attendees chose to evoke awakenings and life - and perhaps defied the theme by demonstrating the immortality of fashion through the centuries, with many 17 and 18century flourishes.\n\nSome - such as singer Lana del Rey - emphasized decay, with stark sculptural twigs rising from her gown to hold a veil of tulle like a canopy over her head.\n\nSouth African singer Tyla's strapless Balmain gown evoking the sands of time - right down to the hourglass purse - was sculpted so tightly to her body that she had to be carried up the steps at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nPuerto Rican singer Bad Bunny evoked a kind of Tudor matador with a sweeping hat and a black bouquet, with the only pop of color being his bright red inseam and the patent shine of his cloven shoes.\n\nCardi B was resplendent in funereal black, with a train so expansive it required nine tuxedoed men to lift it up the stairs. \"It's a black rose,\" she told journalists.\n\nCelebrity interpretations of Met Gala themes have been wide-ranging and often sparked social media debate - but attendees this year appeared to shrug off the pressure. \"I don't even think there's pressure at all, I think it's more of an opportunity,\" actor Colman Domingo, who carried a bouquet in a lily-colored caped jacket and wide-leg trousers, told journalists.\n\nThe theme parallels the exhibit \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" which focuses on the most fragile pieces of the Costume Institute's vast collection. The show, which will be on view for the public from May 10 through September 2, features clothing so delicate it cannot be displayed on mannequins. The Costume Institute relies on the blockbuster Met Gala to fund its work, including exhibitions and acquisitions.\n\nThe gala was first held in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society. Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, the high priestess of US fashion, took over the show in the 1990s, transforming the party into a catwalk for the rich and famous.\n\nThis year, a ticket cost a cool $75,000, with tables starting at $350,000. The 2023 gala - which celebrated the late designer Karl Lagerfeld - raised nearly $22 million, a record sum. But what exactly goes on inside is an enduring mystery.\n\n\"Something mysterious, I'm sure, and unexpected,\" actor Jeff Goldblum told journalists on the red carpet, dressed as a count swathed in Tiffany jewels.\n\nGuests are likely to peruse the exhibit, and stars such as Rihanna - whose command of the red carpet is usually unparalleled, but who did not appear at this year's gala - have performed in the past.\n\nThe spectacle is social media catnip for celebrity watchers - and once again this year, both the gala and the exhibit are co-sponsored by TikTok. The tech world joined luminaries of music, film, politics and sports on the carpet, with TikTok CEO Shou Chew, also an honorary co-chair, in attendance.\n\nOutside the event, several hundred protesters against the war in Gaza demonstrated nearby, with security tight and several arrests made as stars walked the red carpet.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hummingbird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, the high priestess of fashion, took over the show in the 1990s, transforming the party into a catwalk for the rich and famous.\n\nThis year, a ticket costs a cool $75,000, with tables starting at $350,000. The 2023 gala - which celebrated the late Karl Lagerfeld - raised nearly $22 million, a record sum.\n\nBut what exactly goes on inside is an enduring mystery.\n\n\"Something mysterious, I'm sure, and unexpected,\" actor Jeff Goldblum told journalists on the red carpet.\n\nGuests are likely to peruse the exhibit, and stars such as Rihanna - whose command of the red carpet is usually unparalleled - have performed in the past.\n\nSocial media frenzy\n\nThe spectacle is social media catnip for celebrity watchers - and once again, both the gala and the exhibit are co-sponsored by TikTok.\n\nThe tech world joined luminaries of music, film, politics and sports on the carpet, with TikTok CEO Shou Chew, also an honorary co-chair, in attendance.\n\nThe 41-year-old's appearance comes as the future of TikTok in the United States teeters on thin ice, just after President Joe Biden signed a bill demanding that ByteDance - the Chinese company behind the wildly popular video-sharing app - sell it off or go dark stateside.\n\nPreparation for this year's Met Gala also included turmoil within, as workers at Conde Nast - which publishes Vogue, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, among other titles - threatened to walk off the job on the fete's eve as they bargained for a new contract.\n\nMore From HollyWood William Shatner on potential return to 'Star Trek' 'Titanic' actor Bernard Hill dies aged 79 Tony-Winning producer Edgar Lansbury dies Top 10 Hollywood, Bollywood movies and series to watch", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@gulfnews.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hummingbird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

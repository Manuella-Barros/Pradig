{"id": 232012562, "title": "Ham on Wry: Warning: This column may cause a case of the giggles", "text": "I was watching an old rerun of that popular sitcom called \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" but I\u2019m sure I would have enjoyed it a lot more had I not been subjected to all those commercials. Out of curiosity, I checked the Internet and discovered that the average 30-minute TV show contains roughly 16 ads. I didn\u2019t think that was the case for the show I was watching, believing it had to be an amount significantly greater. So I replayed the program in order to tally the actual number. I did that not out of some sort of obsessive exercise, but because of my penchant to provide responsible investigative reporting. Turns out there were 41 commercials. Forty-one! A great number of them promoted a variety of medications. I assume that dominance was due to the fact that the typical viewer, considering the show was popular some three decades ago, probably tends to be of an age similar to mine and likely to require such remedies. But what got to me was the added alerts about the side effects associated with those medications. Apparently, those warnings are declarations required by the Federal Communications Commission. I wouldn\u2019t have been that concerned if those contraindications were rather minimal, such as a headache or fatigue. Those afflictions were, in fact, included in that sizable account, but along with such marginal outcomes was also a reference to more serious possible consequences. Like death. \u201cDeath!\u201d I repeated to my friend who was watching along with me. But he insisted I was overreacting and that I should be discounting such extravagant precautions. \u201cIt says, possible,\u201d he reassured. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say death is likely. Or even probable.\u201d If you\u2019re assuming my friend might fall under a classification one can describe as \u201cmoron,\u201d I'd have to agree. \u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying,\u201d I declared, \u201cbut according to the dictionary, 'possible' means that it actually could happen. It\u2019s the same reason I don\u2019t walk on railroad tracks or in the middle of the freeway.\u201d I\u2019m not sure my friend bought my argument, but I\u2019m of the opinion that if my present status reflects the fact that I\u2019m in a classification termed \u201calive,\u201d why would I consider taking something that could alter that standing? Furthermore, according to those ads, death is apparently just one of the possible side effects. If you\u2019re fortunate enough to avoid expiration, there\u2019s also the chance of blood clots, stroke, seizures or coma. I should add here that the commercial I\u2019m referring to was for a medication to target agitation. Agitation! Thankfully, that\u2019s not a condition I suffer from. At least not until I saw that ad. There\u2019s something wrong with an ad that plugs a product that treats a condition you never had until you saw the commercial. Why isn\u2019t the FCC on top of that scam? That\u2019s like a surgeon who makes a habit of stabbing people then giving them a business card recommending his services. But if agitation is my disorder, and the doctor says he has a medicine he can prescribe that can alleviate such a condition, only I might obtain blood clots, a stroke, a coma, seizures, or perhaps expire, I\u2019m quite certain I\u2019d opt to stick with the agitation. But my friend reiterated that the chance of suffering one of the extreme consequences mentioned is only a small probability versus the strong likelihood I\u2019d be relieved of my problem. Weighing those odds, and remembering that I was arguing with a possible moron, I chose agitation over the chance of death. Even a small chance. Erdos is a freelance humor columnist.

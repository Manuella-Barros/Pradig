Defending champion Keegan Bradley is part of a loaded 2024 Travelers Championship field that also includes proven winners like Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy, Xander Schauffele, and Jordan Spieth. With a victory this week, Bradley would become the first golfer to go back-to-back at the Travelers Championship since Phil Mickelson (2001-02).\n\nAccording to the latest 2024 Travelers Championship odds, Scheffler is going off as the 4-1 favorite, followed by McIlroy (8-1), Schauffele (15-2), Ludvig Aberg (16-1) and Collin Morikawa (16-1). Should your 2024 Travelers Championship bets include backing one of the favorites, or should you target Bradley, who's among the intriguing longshots at 55-1 on the PGA odds board? Before locking in your 2024 Travelers Championship picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nOur proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up nearly $9,500 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters -- its third Masters in a row -- and this year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow with the Travelers Championship 2024 field locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 Travelers Championship predictions\n\nOne major surprise the model is calling for at the 2024 Travelers Championship: Xander Schauffele, the 2022 champion of this event and one of the top favorites, stumbles and barely cracks the top five. Schauffele won his first major at the PGA Championship in May and he's had success at TPC River Highlands in his career. He also enters this week's event full of confidence having finished T-8 or better in each of his last four starts on the PGA Tour.\n\nHowever, Schauffele has recorded just one win in his last 42 starts on tour and he enters the Travelers Championship ranked outside the top 30 in both driving accuracy (67.17%) and one-putt percentage (42.37%). He also ranks 168th in approaches from 50-125 yards (22'9) this season, which doesn't bode well for Schauffele's chances to finish on top of the leaderboard this week. See who else to fade here.\n\nAnother surprise: Tony Finau, a 35-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday.\n\nFinau is a long ball hitter who's averaging 308.2 yards per drive this season, which ranks 25th on the PGA Tour. Finau also ranks third in strokes gained: approach to green (0.875) and 19th in greens in regulation percentage (68.32%), which bodes well at a course like TPC River Highlands. He's been extremely consistent in recent weeks as well, finishing T-8 or better in each of his last two starts. If he's able to drain some putts this week, he'll have a great shot at being in contention at the 2024 Travelers Championship. See who else to back here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Travelers Championship picks\n\nThe model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of 25-1 or longer to make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.\n\nWho will win the 2024 Travelers Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

Check out our PGA Tour odds series as we hand out a Travelers Championship prediction and pick. We will also let you know how to watch the event.\n\nWe are fresh off the U.S. Open, and despite the tough course, it was an extremely entertaining Sunday. Bryson DeChambeau was able to comeback in the last few holes and beat Rory McIlroy. The PGA Tour and LIV Tour will once again go their separate ways as the PGA heads to TPC River Highlands.\n\nLast year, Keegan Bradley was able to come away with the win as he shot 23-under par. This is a much easier course than Pinehurst No. 2, so expect the winner to be around that same score this season. TPC River Highlands features just 6,835 yards, and comes in at par-70. That is almost 1,000 yards shorter than Pinehurst No. 2. Golfers will need to be solid with their short irons more than anything this weekend if they want to come out on top.\n\nScottie Scheffler: Every golf post will have Scottie Scheffler in the favorite section. He is the best golfer in the world, and it has shown on tour. Lately, he is not playing as well as he should be, but this course should get him back to normal. He leads the tour in strokes gained, and he has the highest birdie average. His irons are usually rock solid, so Scheffler just has to hit his putts. However, if he just plays like Scottie Scheffler, he will win.\n\nXander Schauffele: Schauffele won the PGA Championship, and he finished T7 at the U.S. Open. On the season as a whole, Schauffele has finished in the top-10 11 times. He is virtually a lock to finish in the top-10. Schauffele is showing no signs of slowing down his play, either. He hits his fairways and greens, nails his putts, and makes his birdies. Schauffele can easily give Scheffler a run for his money in this event.\n\nCollin Morikawa: Morikawa is the world number seven, and fourth in the FedEx Cup standings. He is on a hot streak, but has not yet won this season. However, he is due for one with how well he has been playing. Morikawa will hit his fairways almost 90 percent of the time, and his putting is lights out. He has not played well at this course in the past, but watch out for him this week.\n\nTravelers Championship sleeper picks\n\nTony Finau: Finau is the hot hand right now. He is coming off a T3 finish at the U.S. Open. He has also finished in the top-20 in four straight events. Along with that, Finau has only missed on cut this season. As mentioned earlier, golfers have to be good with their short irons in this event. Finau is third in strokes gained: approach to green. He is playing well right now, and I would not be surprised to see him at the top of the leaderboard at the Travelers Championship.\n\nSahith Theegala: Theegala finished second at the Travelers Championship a few years ago, so he has some success at the course. He is seventh in strokes gained, 20th in birdie average, and he nails his putts. Theegala also hits plenty of greens in regulation, so he will have plenty of opportunities to make some birdies. If he is at his best, I expect to see him at the top of the leaderboard.\n\nTravelers Championship final prediction and pick\n\nIt is very easy to pick Scottie Scheffler to win a golf tournament. He is the best golfer in the world right now, but he is coming back down to earth a little bit lately. I full expect to see him in the top-5, but I do not think he will win this event. As for the winner, I will take Collin Morikawa to win it all. I love the way he has been playing lately, and I think he gets rewarded this weekend at the Travelers Championship.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_zunkel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Cameron Zunkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahith_Theegala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sahith Theegala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Travelers-Championship-prediction-and-pick-as-Keegan-Bradley-aims-to-repeat.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

This week's tournament at TPC River Highlands is the eighth and final signature event, meaning there's a limited field, more FedEx Cup Points and a drastic increase in prize money. Superstars like Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, Ludvig Aberg and Tony Finau headline a 71-man field competing for their share of the $20 million purse.\n\nUnlike last weekend's U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2, golfers will need to go low to win the Travelers. The average winning score since 2010 is 16-under par, which includes Keegan Bradley's course record of 23-under par in 2023. Keep that in mind as we dive into the latest betting odds and five of our favorite picks for the Travelers Championship.\n\n2024 Travelers Championship Odds\n\nDespite an uneven performance and a disappointing T41 finish at Pinehurst, Scottie Scheffler is the runaway favorite at TPC River Highlands. The world's top-ranked golfer has won three signature events this season -- the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March, the RBC Heritage in April and the Memorial Tournament just two weeks ago.\n\nXander Schauffele is the clear-cut favorite after Scheffler. The 30-year-old won the PGA Championship last month and finished 19-under par to win the 2022 Travelers Championship. Schauffele sits just ahead of Ludvig Aberg, Patrick Cantlay, Viktor Hovland and several other elite golfers.\n\nTravelers Championship Betting Picks\n\nTPC River Highlands is a short par-70 course that demands accuracy off the tee. Players who avoid the penal rough, hit excellent approach shots and capitalize on as many birdie chances as possible will have success this week. Bettors should prioritize driving accuracy, total strokes gained and Par 4 scoring when picking golfers to win the Travelers Championship.\n\nHere are five golfers I'm taking a flier on at TPC River Highlands:\n\nLudvig Aberg (+1400)\n\nThe 24-year-old Aberg was in contention at Pinehurst last weekend before back-to-back 73s dropped him to T12. However, the talented Swede has a great shot to win his second professional tournament.\n\nAberg has high rankings in all of the most important stats. The second-year pro is fifth on the PGA Tour in total strokes gained per round, 11th in strokes gained on approach shots and 16th in driving accuracy. He's also eighth in Par 4 birdie percentage, a critical stat given that TPC River Highlands only has two Par 5s.\n\nAberg finished 13-under in last year's Travelers Championship, good for a T24 finish. Look for the talented youngster to put up a better display this week.\n\nTony Finau (+3300)\n\nA Sunday 67 gave Finau a T3 finish at the U.S. Open. It was his second straight top-10 result, a testament to the quality of the golf the 34-year-old has played in recent weeks.\n\nFinau heads to Connecticut sitting 11th in total strokes gained. While his putting is inconsistent, he ranks third on the Tour in strokes gained on approach shots. He's also in the top 10 in average birdies per round, as fans have watched him put up low scores at top-tier events throughout the years.\n\nFinau is like Scheffler-lite in terms of having an elite iron game to counteract a shaky putter. It wouldn't surprise anyone to see Finau get his first win of the 2024 season.\n\nRussell Henley (+3300)\n\nHenley delivered a T7 performance at the U.S. Open, his fourth top-10 finish in nine tournaments. But momentum isn't the only thing the 35-year-old has on his side heading into the Travelers Championship.\n\nThe stats prove that Henley is among the sport's elite players. The Georgia native is eighth in total strokes gained, fifth in driving accuracy, 20th in Par 4 scoring and 21st in putting. Henley particularly excels on short Par 4s, which works for a course where nine of the 12 Par 4s are 445 yards or shorter.\n\nOddsmakers originally underrated Henley but have since wisened up. However, there's still enough value to make him an intriguing play this week.\n\nTom Kim (+4500)\n\nOn the surface, Kim has had a disappointing season. But there are reasons to be encouraged by the 21-year-old phenom heading into his second appearance at TPC River Highlands.\n\nAlthough Kim ranks 78th in SG: Approach, he's eighth in approach shots from 125-150 yards out. He's also 17th in driving accuracy and a solid performer on Par 4s. This is one of those courses perfectly tailored to Kim's playing ability, even if he's only had one top-10 finish this season.\n\nKim is a bit inconsistent, but he has the iron play and overall talent to rack up his fourth career win on Sunday.\n\nKeegan Bradley (+5500)\n\nGiven his pedestrian 2024 campaign, it's easy to overlook Bradley. But who better to take a flier on than the person who put up the best four-day score in the 40-year history of this tournament?\n\nThe 38-year-old Bradley finished at 23-under par at the 2023 Travelers Championship to win by three strokes. It was his third top-10 finish at TPC Riverlands since 2017, which also includes a T2 result in 2019. Bradley has found success due to his approach game, which currently ranks fifth from 150-175 yards out, and his consistency off the tee.\n\nSeven golfers have won the Travelers Championship more than once, with Phil Mickelson serving as the lone back-to-back champ. Maybe Bradley can join them if he channels last year's magic.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_van_straten@newsweek.com", "name": "Tim Van Straten", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer_Invitational", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer Invitational"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Henley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Henley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kim", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Kim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_Players_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tournament Players Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2413104/travelers-championship-picks.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The Travelers Championship at TPC River Highlands will serve as the final signature event of the season, which means this will be the last time we see the majority of the PGA Tour's best at the same event until next month's British Open.\n\nIf you want to get in on the action and place a few bets, you've come to the right place. I'm going to power rank the top 10 golfers who I feel are the best bets to win this week, based on a mix of my opinion and the betting odds.\n\nThis may be too low in most people's opinions, but Viktor Hovland's play around the greens has been horrific this season and until he can learn how to chip again, his betting value will be at an all-time low.\n\n9. Brian Harman +4000\n\nBrian Harman has had a fantastic history at TPC River Highlands, finishing T8 or better in five of his last six starts at this event. Some golfers have too good of a history at a course to ignore and Harman at this tournament is one of those examples. He has played some consistent, but not elite, golf of late but now is a great time for him to get back to contending on a Sunday.\n\n8. Russell Henley +3500\n\nFresh off a T7 finish at the U.S. Open, Russell Henley is aiming to lurk around a leaderboard once again. He has four top 20 finishes at the Travelers Championship the last six times he's teed it up here and now he gets to enter the tournament in peak form. He's a solid bet at 35-1.\n\n7. Tony Finau +3500\n\nSpeaking of rounding into form, no golfer fits that bill better than Tony Finau. His last five finishes are T52, T18, T17, T8 and T3, with the latter coming at last week's U.S. Open. His length off the tee gives him an advantage at TPC River Highlands and if his irons remain as sharp as they were last week, he's going to absolutely be worth a look at 35-1 to win this week.\n\n6. Hideki Matsuyama +3000\n\n2023 was the first time Hideki Matsuyama had teed it up at the Travelers Championship and he posted a solid T13 result. Now he returns to TPC River Highlands off a T8 finish at the Memorial Tournament and a solo sixth at the U.S. Open. He's a much better bet at 30-1 than some names with shorter odds, like Viktor Hovland at 20-1.\n\n5. Patrick Cantlay +2200\n\nPatrick Cantlay has finished T15 or better in six straight starts at the Travelers Championship and is coming off his best performance of 2024, a T3 finish at the U.S. Open. I wish we were getting some better value than 22-1 on a golfer who hasn't won in almost two years, but I wouldn't argue against anyone who decides to pick him this week.\n\n4. Ludvig Aberg +1400\n\nLudvig Aberg is everything you want in a golfer and he proved last week that his knee injury shouldn't be a concern to any bettors. Instead, it's his chipping that causes him issues at times. That may not hold him back at the Travelers Championship, but even if it does his ball striking alone makes him a top option this week.\n\n3. Collin Morikawa +1200\n\nCollin Morikawa is quietly returning to peak form. With that being said, I need to see him deliver in crunch time on a Sunday before I'm back to fully trusting him. Still, his metrics alone put him in the conversation as a top-three golfer this week.\n\n2. Scottie Scheffler +400\n\nMaybe I shouldn't look too much into one bad tournament by the world No. 1, but Scottie Scheffler recording only four birdies the entire U.S. Open is concerning. Until it's proven that last week's performance was a blip on the radar, I would recommend staying far away from him this week at 4-1. He's still the best golfer in the field, but he may be finally hitting a slump for the first time in two years.\n\n1. Xander Schauffele +800\n\nXander Schauffele's approach game was dialed in last week but an uncharacteristically bad week putting kept him from truly contending for a second straight major on Sunday. Now he returns to an event he won just two short years ago. He checks every single box you want to be checked when attempting to predict a winner. I think he's the best bet on the board this week.\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nYou can check out all of Iain's bets here!\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Travelers Championship Power Rankings Based on Betting Odds: 10 Best to Bet at TPC River Highlands.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "iain_macmillan@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Iain MacMillan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Harman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brian Harman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Henley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russell Henley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/tyln78/picture289348205/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/5305290b-8410-44bb-9bc5-f3ba1e62d071", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

It's the final \"signature event\" of the 2024 season. Reigning Travelers champion, and New England native, Keegan Bradley defends his title in a field with most of the top 50 in the FedExCup standings.\n\nThis field features World No. 1, and 2024 Masters champion, Scottie Scheffler and PGA champion Xander Schauffele. Xander won the 2022 Travelers, Harris English won two years ago, LIV Tour defector Dustin Johnson in 2020, and Chez Reavie in 2019. The Travelers is a birdie fest with an average winning score of -18 over the last five years.\n\nIt is the second-most attended tournament on the PGA TOUR annually, behind the Waste Management Phoenix Open. Fellow OutKick writer, golf bettor, and Connecticut resident, Dan Zaksheske will be at TPC River Highlands this weekend to heckle the golfers he faded (just kidding).\n\nGolfers will leave their drivers in the bag because TPC River Highlands is the fourth-shortest course on TOUR. This is a Pete Dye-designed par-70 with narrow fairways and small Bentgrass/Poa greens playing to roughly 6,835 yards.\n\nLast week, I failed to capture my \"North America Trifecta\" by not accurately picking the U.S. Open winner. That said, I cashed four of seven finishing position bets and scraped out a +0.44 units (u) win at the U.S. Open. As a result, my PGA TOUR 2024 balance is -39.98u. But, I cannot make my money back by quitting, so let's get into the betting card for the 2024 Travelers Championship.\n\nStats courtesy of Bet The Number from the Tour Junkies, Pay Mayo's Fantasy National, and the PGA Tour.\n\nThe odds chosen are the best available at legal U.S. sportsbooks as of noon ET Tuesday, June 18th.\n\nWe see \u00c5berg dominate on his first visit to these courses since it's his rookie season. But, Ludvig became a full-time PGA TOUR pro in June 2023 after finishing first at last year's PGA TOUR University. His second start last season was the Travelers and tied for 24th with a -13 score despite losing strokes with his irons, per Bet The Number.\n\nThe Swede gained strokes tee-to-green, off-the-tee (OTT), around-the-green, and putting at the 2023 Travelers though. I'm giving Ludvig the benefit of the doubt about last year's performance with his irons in the Travelers. This season, \u00c5berg ranks 15th in Strokes Gained (SG): Approach (APP) on TOUR.\n\n\u00c5berg is already one of the best in the world OTT. And you'd think because TPC River Highlands isn't a \"bomber's paradise\", \u00c5berg's prowess OTT won't help him much this week. However, 2020 Travelers champion, Johnson, three-time Travelers champion, and fellow LIV Tour Defector, Bubba Watson were excellent OTT in their primes.\n\nFurthermore, \u00c5berg can just overpower these small courses. Ludvig's effortless swing helps him gain strokes on the field OTT when pulling less than driver. His power makes it easy for \u00c5berg to hit the green after clubbing down with his tee shot. Ludvig's only career win on The RSM Classic with a -29 score during the 2023 FedExCup Fall schedule.\n\nThe RSM is at the Sea Island Golf Club's Seaside Course, another small, birdie fest par-70 course (7,005 yards). Granted, the Travelers has a much tougher field. Yet, I trust \u00c5berg's skill set to score more birdies at TPC River Highlands this year. More importantly, Ludvig has contended in several \"signature events\" and is ready to win one of these.\n\n_____________________________\n\nThis is a \"course history\" bet. Cantlay leads this field in total SG over the last Travelers Championships, per Fantasy National. He's finished inside the top 15 in his last six starts at TPC River Highlands with a career-best T4 in 2023. Cantlay had the second-best odds (+1000) at the 2023 Travelers, tied with Jon Rahm and Rory McIlroy, and third-best odds (+1200) in 2022.\n\nThe eight-time PGA TOUR champion is having a down year. He showed glimpses of his old self in the U.S. Open last week. Cantlay was leading the U.S. Open after the first round and finished T3. Moreover, his \"bad\" ain't that bad and we are getting good odds.\n\nCantlay tied for 11th at Pebble Beach (a crossover course with TPC River Highlands), T4 at The Genesis Invitational, and T3 at the RBC Heritage (played at another comp course to River Highlands), and all three were \"signature events\".\n\nAlso, when Cantlay is on his game, he's one of the best drivers of the golf ball in the world. He's not quite the \"bomber\" of DJ and Bubba. Nonetheless, last season, Cantlay was fourth in SG: OTT on TOUR, 17th in 2021-22, and 12th in 2020-21.\n\nThe American Ryder Cup team member is equal parts long and accurate with his driver. For TPC River Highlands, accuracy is handy for Cantlay since the course's only defense is narrow fairways and small greens.\n\nWhen playing well, Cantlay is good throughout the bag, which makes me confident in betting him at a birdie fest. Finally, he's gained strokes OTT, ARG, APP, and putting in four consecutive Travelers Championships.\n\n_____________________________\n\nBurns has true \"win equity\" and has quietly been playing well recently. He was T13 at the Wells Fargo Championship (\"signature event\"), T10 at the RBC Canadian Open, T15 at the Memorial Tournament (\"signature event\"), and T9 at last week's U.S. Open.\n\nHe won back-to-back Valspar Championships in 2021-22 at Innisbrook, a comp course to TPC River Highlands. Last year, Burns won the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play at another Dye course, Austin Country Club. He was T6 at The American Express at Dye's Stadium Course and the Charles Schwab Challenge at Colonial, and won last year's Charles Schwab.\n\nThe biggest concern with betting Burns is his driving accuracy. Yet, per DataGolf.com, Burns has been more accurate than the field in six of his last seven starts, including three \"signature events\" and two majors. The Travelers can be a putting contest and Burns is one of the best putters on TOUR.\n\nBezuidenhout has three top 10s this year and ranks 13th on TOUR in total SG. His top 10s include a second at The AmEx, T9 at the Valspar, and fourth at the Memorial. He tied for 20th at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am (\"signature event\") and T13 at THE PLAYERS.\n\nThe South African is 40th in the Official World Golf Rankings and 16th in DataGolf.com's rankings, which I trust more. Bezuidenhout ranks eighth in this field for total SG on crossover courses to TPC River Highlands, according to Bet The Number.\n\n_____________________________\n\nAt these odds, I can overlook Perez's missed cut at last week's U.S. Open. It's a major and Pinehurst's No. 2 course is the toughest on TOUR this season. Perez tied for 12th two weeks ago at the Memorial Tournament and finished third at the RBC Canadian Open three starts prior.\n\nMuirfield Village (host of the Memorial) and Hamilton Golf & Country Club (host of the Canadian Open) have Bentgrass/Poa greens like TPC River Highlands. The Frenchman picked up nearly a half-stroke on the greens at the Memorial and more than nine strokes putting at the Canadian Open.\n\nPerez rookie is 16th in SG: APP this season, the most important stat for the Travelers. The PGA TOUR rookie has proven he can go low; he shot -14 at the Canadian Open, -18 in a T3 at the Puerto Rico Open, and -11 in a T16 at the Cognizant Classic.\n\n_____________________________\n\nMake placement bets at BetMGM since that's the only sportsbook that isn't applying \"dead heat\" rules to the Travelers Championship.\n\nDespite his putting woes, Conners ranks fifth in my 40-round model at Bet The Number. The Canadian is 15th in total SG on TOUR this season, second in SG: APP and 19th in driving accuracy. He finished sixth in the RBC Canadian Open, which is effectively a major for him, and T9 at the U.S. Open.\n\nConners gained strokes putting in both the Canadian and U.S. Opens. The host course for the Canadian Open has a similar layout to TPC River Highlands and the same putting surface (Bentgrass/Poa greens). Conners was T9 at the 2023 Travelers and has made the cut in all 17 starts this season.\n\nMy fellow St. John's 2008 classmate finished T2 at the Charles Schwab and Sony Open this year. Both of those tournaments are played at comp courses to TPC River Highlands, where he is the defending champion. Bradley plays well in New England and has three top 10s in his last seven Travelers.\n\nKeegan is usually dialed in with the irons but has gained strokes on the greens in six of his last seven starts. This includes two \"signature events\" and all three majors. According to Bet The Number, Bradley is fifth in this field for SG: Putting on Bentgrass/Poa over the last 24 rounds.\n\nJust because I don't have an outright bet on him doesn't mean I'm completely removing McCarthy from my 2024 Travelers betting card. He is nasty at putting and doesn't have to worry about driving the ball far at TPC River Highlands.\n\nMcCarthy is second on TOUR this season in SG: Putting and tied for seventh at the 2023 Travelers while gaining more than five strokes on the greens. His driving accuracy has been inconsistent this year. However, he's been more accurate OTT than the field and gained strokes with his irons in four of his five career Travelers.\n\n_____________________________\n\nThe wheels are falling off in my 2024 Mayo Cup One-And-Done league. I went with Cam Smith for the 2024 U.S. Open, and he added a measly $110,894 to my season-long balance. After 22 tournaments, I've accrued $10,594,771, putting me in 1,512th place. Since I have no faith Cantlay can win a major, I need to use him at the Travelers.\n\nWith that in mind, this is a tournament Cantlay wins. He's won the BMW Championship (second round of the FedExCup Playoffs) and Memorial twice each. Cantlay comes into the Travelers with some momentum after outperforming his odds at the 2024 U.S. Open. I'm worried about his popularity in this pool, but I need a win more than anything.\n\n_____________________________\n\nFollow me on X (or Twitter, whatever) @Geoffery-Clark and check out my OutKick Bets Podcast for more betting content and random rants.

The second of two signature events to sandwich the third major championship of the year, the Travelers Championship will welcome at field of 71 players to TPC River Highlands.\n\nNotably absent is Rory McIlroy, who fresh off his agonizing defeat at the U.S. Open has decided to take some time away from the game before his defense at the Scottish Open in three weeks. McIlroy's omission will leave the door open for others to possibly claim the title with the elephant in the room still being world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nScheffler experienced his worst result of the season at last week's U.S. Open carding only four birdies across four rounds and was unable to break par once. He should return to his usual self this week as he performed well last year en route to a top-10 finish and seeks his sixth victory of the season.\n\nSomeone who has won at this golf course already in his career is world No. 2 Xander Schauffele. The PGA Championship winner notched a top-10 finish at the U.S. Open, making it eight straight top 15s to start his career in that specific championship. Perhaps the most well-rounded player in the game, Schauffele has eyes on his second victory at TPC River Highlands after outlasting Sahith Theegala in 2022.\n\nLudvig \u00c5berg, Collin Morikawa, Viktor Hovland and Patrick Cantlay are among those in fine form aiming to capture their first trophies of the year, while major champions like Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas and Wyndham Clark round out a star-studded cast set to take the stage in New England.\n\n2024 Travelers Championship schedule\n\nDates: June 20-23\n\nLocation: TPC River Highlands -- Cromwell, Connecticut\n\nPar: 70 | Yardage: 6,852\n\nPurse: $20,000,000\n\n2024 Travelers Championship field, oddsScottie Scheffler (7/2): The world No. 1 experienced a number of professional firsts at Pinehurst. He carded four straight over-par rounds for the first time in 120 professional starts and averaged just one birdie per round on top of that. The level of concern is still a zero as Scheffler hit the ball like he normally does but was fooled on the putting surfaces. Getting off slick Bermuda grass should be a welcomed sight and allow him to continue his love affair with his mallet putter that had gained him strokes in seven straight tournaments before the U.S. Open.Xander Schauffele (7-1): Schauffele has now rattled off four straight top-10 finishes dating back to the Wells Fargo Championship, and the most recent two have come without his best stuff. Struggling with the driver at Pinehurst and hitting just about 50% of the fairways, Schauffele did well to skirt his way inside the top 10 by week's end. It would surprise no one if he does much better this week and actually plays himself into contention over the weekend as he has four top 20s in five appearances including that win two years ago.Ludvig \u00c5berg (12-1)Collin Morikawa (12-1)Viktor Hovland (18-1)Patrick Cantlay (20-1): Cantlay appeared to have turned the corner at the U.S. Open where he notched his third top-five finish of the season. Coming close to nabbing the victory, the former FedEx Cup champion found something in his iron play that we had not seen in quite some time. If there is ever a place for Cantlay to continue this upward trend it is TPC River Highlands where he has finished inside the top 15 in his last six appearanecs.Hideki Matsuyama (25-1)Russell Henley (28-1): Henley's high floor was matched with a high-ceiling performance at the U.S. Open where he raced through the finish line and into the top 10 by tournament's end. He now quietly has three top 15s in his last four U.S. Opens, and his ability to split fairways consistently and hole putts with confidence should come in handy at TPC River Highlands. Finishing inside the top 20 in his last two trips up to Connecticut, the Georgia Bulldog should love his chances this week given his form, the fit and the confidence with which he is playing.Sam Burns (30-1)Tony Finau (30-1): Finau has found his groove. A top-three finish at the U.S. Open marked his fourth straight top 20 and his second straight top 10 as he arrived in Pinehurst off a nice result at Jack's place. He continues to drive the ball much better and hit his irons as well as anyone, but the reason for the uptick lies in the short-game department. Finau has now gained strokes on the greens in back-to-back starts for the first time since March and will threaten for the title if he makes that three in a row this week.Tommy Fleetwood (30-1)2024 Travelers Championship expert picks\n\nTommy Fleetwood Winner (30-1): The Englishman has yet to win on the PGA Tour, but a small field at a course like TPC River Highlands feels like the correct landing spot for him. Fleetwood had a great final round at the U.S. Open to climb inside the top 20 marking his third in his last five starts. He's been doing everything well so far in 2024, but Fleetwood has yet to experience that spike week throughout the bag. If it happens in Connecticut, he should threaten the winner's circle.\n\nJordan Spieth Contender (45-1): I know what you're thinking, and I totally agree, but Spieth showed promise at Pinehurst. He gained nearly eight strokes on approach (his best of the season) and continued to drive the golf ball great only to make nothing on the greens. Spieth should continue to put the ball in play off the tee, and the number of wedge opportunities at TPC River Highlands may actually relieve some of that stress on that wrist. If it does and the approach numbers continue to shine, Spieth has shown before he can get the job done here.\n\nSepp Straka Sleeper (50-1): The big Austrian is playing like a top-10 player on the PGA Tour at the moment with four top 10s in his last six individual outings including top fives in signature events like the RBC Heritage and Memorial. Straka is surging with his approach play, gaining massively on the field in that department, and that will be huge for his chances this week. He's great off the tee, has improved his short game and can win on these types of golf courses as shown by his John Deere Classic victory last summer.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType":

The Travelers Championship at TPC River Highlands will serve as the final signature event of the season, which means this will be the last time we see the majority of the PGA Tour's best at the same event until next month's British Open.\n\nIf you want to get in on the action and place a few bets, you've come to the right place. I'm going to power rank the top 10 golfers who I feel are the best bets to win this week, based on a mix of my opinion and the betting odds.\n\nAll odds listed below are via FanDuel Sportsbook\n\nThis may be too low in most people's opinions, but Viktor Hovland's play around the greens has been horrific this season and until he can learn how to chip again, his betting value will be at an all-time low.\n\nBrian Harman has had a fantastic history at TPC River Highlands, finishing T8 or better in five of his last six starts at this event. Some golfers have too good of a history at a course to ignore and Harman at this tournament is one of those examples. He has played some consistent, but not elite, golf of late but now is a great time for him to get back to contending on a Sunday.\n\nFresh off a T7 finish at the U.S. Open, Russell Henley is aiming to lurk around a leaderboard once again. He has four top 20 finishes at the Travelers Championship the last six times he's teed it up here and now he gets to enter the tournament in peak form. He's a solid bet at 35-1.\n\nSpeaking of rounding into form, no golfer fits that bill better than Tony Finau. His last five finishes are T52, T18, T17, T8 and T3, with the latter coming at last week's U.S. Open. His length off the tee gives him an advantage at TPC River Highlands and if his irons remain as sharp as they were last week, he's going to absolutely be worth a look at 35-1 to win this week.\n\n2023 was the first time Hideki Matsuyama had teed it up at the Travelers Championship and he posted a solid T13 result. Now he returns to TPC River Highlands off a T8 finish at the Memorial Tournament and a solo sixth at the U.S. Open. He's a much better bet at 30-1 than some names with shorter odds, like Viktor Hovland at 20-1.\n\nPatrick Cantlay has finished T15 or better in six straight starts at the Travelers Championship and is coming off his best performance of 2024, a T3 finish at the U.S. Open. I wish we were getting some better value than 22-1 on a golfer who hasn't won in almost two years, but I wouldn't argue against anyone who decides to pick him this week.\n\nLudvig Aberg is everything you want in a golfer and he proved last week that his knee injury shouldn't be a concern to any bettors. Instead, it's his chipping that causes him issues at times. That may not hold him back at the Travelers Championship, but even if it does his ball striking alone makes him a top option this week.\n\nCollin Morikawa is quietly returning to peak form. With that being said, I need to see him deliver in crunch time on a Sunday before I'm back to fully trusting him. Still, his metrics alone put him in the conversation as a top-three golfer this week.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't look too much into one bad tournament by the world No. 1, but Scottie Scheffler recording only four birdies the entire U.S. Open is concerning. Until it's proven that last week's performance was a blip on the radar, I would recommend staying far away from him this week at 4-1. He's still the best golfer in the field, but he may be finally hitting a slump for the first time in two years.\n\nXander Schauffele's approach game was dialed in last week but an uncharacteristically bad week putting kept him from truly contending for a second straight major on Sunday. Now he returns to an event he won just two short years ago. He checks every single box you want to be checked when attempting to predict a winner.

Bradley will have to stave off several serious contenders if he wants to rewrite the history books. Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, and Collin Morikawa are among the experienced players looking to dethrone Bradley and win the Travelers Championship 2024.\n\nPlay gets underway from TPC River Highlands on Thursday, June 20. Scheffler enters this week's event as the 4-1 favorite according to the latest 2024 Travelers Championship odds. He's followed by Schauffele (15-2), Ludvig Aberg (16-1) and Morikawa (16-1) on the PGA odds board. Should your 2024 Travelers Championship bets include backing one of the favorites, or should you target Bradley, who's among the intriguing longshots at 55-1? Before locking in any 2024 Travelers Championship picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nOur proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up nearly $9,500 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters -- its third Masters in a row -- and this year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow with the Travelers Championship 2024 field locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 Travelers Championship predictions\n\nOne major surprise the model is calling for at the 2024 Travelers Championship: Schauffele, the 2022 champion of this event and one of the top favorites, stumbles and barely cracks the top five. Schauffele won his first major at the PGA Championship in May and he's had success at TPC River Highlands in his career. He also enters this week's event full of confidence having finished T-8 or better in each of his last four starts on the PGA Tour.\n\nHowever, Schauffele has recorded just one win in his last 42 starts on tour and he enters the Travelers Championship ranked outside the top 30 in both driving accuracy (67.17%) and one-putt percentage (42.37%). He also ranks 168th in approaches from 50-125 yards (22'9) this season, which doesn't bode well for Schauffele's chances to finish on top of the leaderboard this week. See who else to fade here.\n\nAnother surprise: Hideki Matsuyama, a 28-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday.\n\nMatsuyama certainly has the game to finish near the top of the leaderboard this week. The 32-year-old has played well this season, securing one win and five top-10 finishes. He recorded his ninth career victory on the PGA Tour at The Genesis Invitational in February and is coming off a sixth-place showing at the U.S. Open at Pinehurst. Matsuyama remains one of the best ball strikers on tour, ranking fourth in strokes gained: total (1.405) and 15th in strokes gained: approach to green (0.503). Those impressive stats, plus his long odds, make him a strong value pick for your 2024 Travelers Championship bets. See who else to back here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Travelers Championship picks\n\nThe model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of 25-1 or longer to make a strong run at the title, and McClure is targeting a massive triple-digit longshot in his best bets. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.\n\nWho will win the 2024 Travelers Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

Instead of McIlroy's fifth major championship -- and his first in 10 years -- Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up.\" He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the following week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nWithout him, there will be 71 players teeing off on Thursday in the limited field, no-cut signature event at the TPC River Highlands. McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we're going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I'm looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley's Boston Celtics beat Scheffler's Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher on Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, \"Do I have to answer that question?\" Scheffler said he hasn't heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n\"I don't blame him,\" Bradley said. \"I wouldn't want to either if I was a Dallas fan.\"\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway's wooden seats at the tournament's media day in April.\n\n\"It's one of the coolest gifts I've ever gotten -- probably the coolest gift I've ever gotten in my life,\" he said. \"To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.\"\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n\"There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,\" said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. \"Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they're going to do you all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it's our event, it's our own individual event.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean there's no patriotism involved.\n\n\"I'm not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,\" said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn't really thought about it. \"We're trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.\"\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years. It returned in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, making this the third go-round.\n\nScheffler said he is excited to be a part of the Summer Games and check out other sports, including basketball and tennis. He also wanted to make a trip to the Olympic Village to watch the other athletes train.\n\n\"I grew up playing a ton of sports, and so to be able to see the best in the world at their craft would be pretty special,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "courant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hartfort Courant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@courant.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

The best players in the world have already boarded their flights to Cromwell, Connecticut to tee it up in another Signature Event for the Travelers Championship. They'll play this coming week at TPC River Highlands, a familiar stop on the PGA Tour summer schedule but it's a test that will be the polar opposite from Pinehurst No. 2 in terms of course conditions and setup.\n\nWhile TPC River Highlands does not require the patience and fortitude that was needed at Pinehurst, but you would have to imagine that players will show some fatigue at the tail end of a brutally tough stretch. A shortened field with guaranteed payday should ease the pain and this has always been one of the most well-attended and supported events annually on Tour. Several big names had the weekend off in North Carolina and will come in more rested and motivated to win the final Signature Event of the 2024 season.\n\nAs always with this article, my primary goal is to provide a place to start your research and preparation for the incoming week. I have carefully evaluated the field-to-project course fits and past results in team golf formats. This will give you a glimpse at how my brain operates when it comes to handicapping this unique event. Here are my top 10 players to watch out for and a brief write-up of my reasons why. Enjoy the Travelers Championship, and here are the players you need to watch out for!\n\nYou can pretty much pencil in Brian Harman for a Top-10 finish every year at the Travelers Championship and that is exactly what I am doing in my power rankings this week. Harman has a ridiculous four Top-8 finishes in the last five years at TPC River Highlands which includes a tie for 2nd place in 2023. He's been quietly coming back into form lately which is a welcome sight for Harman who is now less than a month away from defending the Claret Jug at the Open Championship.\n\nA short, positional course that requires better-than-average short game and putting is just the type of test that Brian Harman passes regularly with flying colors. His noted improvement in his approach play, particularly at the PGA Championship and Charles Schwab Challenge where he gained 5+ strokes in each tournament. Harman hung around tough at the US Open which should facilitate his confidence heading to Cromwell!\n\nKeegan Bradley has been dismantling courses with his ability to drive the ball long and straight off the tee. He'll need to improve moderately with his irons if he wants to repeat as champion of the Travelers. In 2023, he gained 7+ strokes on Approach AND putting which was plenty enough to propel him back into the winner's circle. Bradley also has a T2 finish in 2019 and T19 in 2022 to further cement himself as a true horse for the course at TPC River Highlands.\n\nThe main defense of the course is the thick rough and difficult bunkers. It makes sense why Bradley has had so much success here because he is great at handling those elements, ranking 3rd on Tour at scrambling out of thick rough and greenside bunkers. It was an emotional win for Bradley, who seemed certain that victory had earned him a spot on the Ryder Cup team at the time. It was hard to see him get snubbed in the end, but remembering the week that was should put the Northeast native back in a comfort zone and ready to play well.\n\nSomewhat predictably, Viktor Hovland struggled to deal with the tightly mown short grass Around-The-Greens at Pinehurst No. 2. The thick greenside rough at TPC River Highlands should be a welcome sight for Hovland whose statistical numbers dramatically improve with this type of course setup. Hovland gained 1.4 strokes Around-The-Green at the PGA Championship at Valhalla which has similar rough to TPC River Highlands. For reference, Hovland lost nearly three strokes on the short grass at Pinehurst in round one alone.\n\nHe's been driving it much better recently as well. When Hovland is playing his best and primed to win, he's as dominant of a player from tee to green as we have on the PGA Tour. He's definitely looking for a spark to get the ball rolling on another summer like he had in 2023, and this will be a great opportunity for him to finally earn himself a victory in the 2024 season. His best finish to date at the Travelers Championship is a T11 in 2020.\n\nSahith Theegala has started to break the mold in terms of being a player that you could only be confident in on certain courses that suit his game best. His 2023 game has traveled everywhere and is set for redemption at the Travelers Championship. It does feel like his game profiles best on these shorter layouts that allow position and strategy to take place on the tee box. I do have concerns again about his Around-The-Green game but I'm hopeful that he can rely on his putter to make up for any deficiencies.\n\nHe grinded his way through the cut and played his best golf on the weekend at Pinehurst. His shotmaking ability should translate well to a course like TPC River Highlands, and we have seen him come so close here before. I'll never forget when he got aggressive with this bunker shot as a younger, less-established touring pro. 2024 may be his time, and we'll have to see if he has learned from his past mistakes down the stretch. You just can't double bogey the last hole.\n\nI'm genuinely not sure how he is going to recover from what just happened. I'm still in shock, nearly an hour after he missed a gimme on 18 at Pinehurst No. 2. I simply have to put him inside my Power Rankings, as he played the U.S. Open better than any other player on the PGA Tour. No stats, course history, or form could make me come anywhere close to betting on McIlroy this week. I'll give him a sympathy #6 ranking, but I would not be surprised one bit if he withdrew. Enough said here.\n\nThere was arguably more than one disappointing collapse down the stretch of the U.S. Open besides McIlroy. Ludvig Aberg held the lead for much of the tournament. He never let his signature charming smile leave his face despite an untimely triple bogey that ejected him quickly from the competition down the stretch. Only one player in the field gained more strokes Off-The-Tee at Pinehurst than Aberg.\n\nIt's part of the reason I don't love him at TPC River Highlands because the course somewhat deemphasizes his biggest strength as a player which is his hyper-elite ability with Driver. Aberg tends to struggle from time to time around the greens. This all said, I'm optimistic because his ceiling is so astronomically high and we have seen him win on a course previously that was positional and did not require a ton of Drivers. It'll be his second time playing the Travelers, and he's looking to build on last season's T24.\n\nI said this in last week's article, but Collin Morikawa being one of the best Ballstrikers on the planet is once again a thing. He looked destined to miss the cut at the U.S. Open, but continued to fight and earned himself a Top-10 finish. The numbers would indicate that the resurgence is real. On paper, TPC River Highlands would appear to be a perfect course setup for a player like Morikawa who consistently hits fairways and flushes his mid-irons with elite precision.\n\nThat hasn't exactly been the case. In his last three starts at the Travelers Championship, Morikawa has missed the cut twice and his best finishing result was a mediocre T36 in 2019. It's possible that the course may have his number and doesn't fit his eye. It's just hard to ignore the consistent uptick in performance he receives on this type of course. It should be right in his wheelhouse to get himself another PGA Tour victory. It's been way too long for a player with his talent.\n\nThe award for \"Player who proved he is still really good at golf\" at Pinehurst went to none other than Patrick Cantlay. I went into the week confident that Cantlay had zero chance, but I'm willing to admit that I was dead wrong. He's still unflappable. He's going to play his game, slowly, but he possesses all the tools to win big-time events on the PGA Tour.\n\nCantlay's irons had been terrible all year, but he put in a new set of clubs ahead of the U.S. Open which paid major championship dividends. Cantlay ranked 3rd in SG: Approach at the U.S. Open and also finished inside the top-10 in putting. He's a closer, and while it did not happen at the U.S. Open, I do believe it could come soon. Here are his results in the last 5 years at the Travelers: T4, T13, T13, T11, and T15. He's been right there, now it's time to prove that you are a closer sir!\n\nDo you know which player had the 2nd most strokes gained on Approach for the week at Pinehurst No. 2? Well, it was none other than Xander Schauffele, who we mysteriously barely saw anything from on the weekend coverage. Schauffele fired a final round 68 to slide in the backdoor of another Top-10 result at the U.S. Open. He has now finished inside the Top-15 in all eight of his appearances at the U.S. Open throughout his career which is quite unbelievable.\n\nIn my opinion, he's the clear 2nd best player in the world at the moment on the PGA Tour. He played alongside his closest friend in the final pairing at the Travelers Championship two years ago and touched Cantlay to win the 2022 event. Schauffele has also finished inside the top 20 in both of his other appearances at TPC River Highlands over the past five years. His consistency is what makes him great and should set him up for another week, at a familiar course, in which we will see Xander Schauffele in contention down the stretch on Sunday.\n\nIs it time to start worrying about Scottie Scheffler? I'm not. Despite finishing T41 at the U.S. Open, it felt like Pinehurst No. 2 just introduced a randomness variable to many of the missed fairways that essentially disadvantaged a player like Scottie Scheffler. He also never got comfortable on the Bermuda greens at Pinehurst which were lightning fast and continued to firm up as the tournament went on.\n\nScheffler failed to finish inside the Top-50 in the field in strokes gained putting in all four rounds played at Pinehurst. Now, am I expecting him to light the world on fire on the greens at TPC River Highlands? No, but it probably doesn't matter. He'll be back to dismantling the field with his Tee-To-Green game and crushing his opponents with his prowess and chipping touch. This guy is just the best. Until somewhat can unseat him from the throne, Scheffler is atop the Power Rankings any time he pegs a tee in the dirt!\n\nEnjoy the Travelers Championship and thanks for reading!

Instead of McIlroy's fifth major championship -- and his first in 10 years -- Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up.\" He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the following week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nWithout him, there will be 71 players teeing off Thursday in the limited field, no-cut signature event at the TPC River Highlands. McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we're going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I'm looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"\n\nEnemy territory\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley's Boston Celtics beat Scheffler's Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, \"Do I have to answer that question?\" Scheffler said he hasn't heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n\"I don't blame him,\" Bradley said. \"I wouldn't want to either if I was a Dallas fan.\"\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway's wooden seats at the tournament's media day in April.\n\n\"It's one of the coolest gifts I've ever gotten -- probably the coolest gift I've ever gotten in my life,\" he said. \"To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.\"\n\nParis preview\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n\"There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,\" said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. \"Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they're going to do all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it's our event, it's our own individual event.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean there's no patriotism involved.\n\n\"I'm not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,\" said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn't really thought about it. \"We're trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.\"\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years. It returned in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, making this the third go-round.\n\nScheffler said he is excited to be a part of the Summer Games and check out other sports, including basketball and tennis. He also wanted to make a trip to the Olympic Village to watch the other athletes train.\n\n\"I grew up playing a ton of sports, and so to be able to see the best in the world at their craft would be pretty special,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@triblive.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

He's already recorded 11 victories on tour, including five in 2024. He won his second major championship at the Masters in April and he'll enter the 2024 Travelers Championship as the odds-on betting favorite. According to the latest 2024 Travelers Championship odds, Scheffler is the 4-1 favorite (risk $100 to win $400). The No. 1 ranked player in the world is followed by Xander Schauffele (15-2), Ludvig Aberg (16-1) and Collin Morikawa (16-1) on the PGA odds board.\n\nOther top contenders in the Travelers Championship 2024 field include Viktor Hovland (22-1) and Patrick Cantlay (25-1). Should your 2024 Travelers Championship bets include backing Scheffler to finish on top of the leaderboard, or will a longshot like Justin Thomas (35-1), Jordan Spieth (50-1), or Keegan Bradley (55-1) win at TPC River Highlands? Before locking in your 2024 Travelers Championship picks or Scottie Scheffler props, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nOur proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot on its PGA Tour picks in recent years. In fact, the model is up nearly $9,500 on its best bets since June 2020, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nMcClure's model predicted Scheffler would finish on top of the leaderboard at the 2024 Masters, Arnold Palmer Invitational, and The Players Championship this season. McClure also included Hideki Matsuyama in his best bets to win the 2024 Genesis Invitational. That bet hit at +9000, and for the entire tournament, McClure's best bets returned nearly $1,000!\n\nMcClure's best bets also included Bryson DeChambeau winning the 2024 U.S. Open at +1800 odds and the model correctly predicted his second major victory heading into the weekend. And at the 2024 PGA Championship, the model correctly called Xander Schauffele's first major championship heading into the weekend.\n\nThe model also predicted Jon Rahm would be victorious at the 2023 Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express. At the 2023 Masters, the model was all over Rahm's second career major victory heading into the weekend. Rahm was two strokes off the lead heading into the third round, but the model still projected him as the winner.\n\nIn addition, McClure's best bets included Nick Taylor (70-1) winning the 2023 RBC Canadian Open, Jason Day (17-1) winning outright at the 2023 AT&T Byron Nelson, and Rickie Fowler (14-1) finishing on top of the leaderboard at the 2023 Rocket Mortgage Classic.\n\nThis same model has nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters -- its third Masters in a row -- and this year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow with the Travelers Championship 2024 field taking shape, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 Travelers Championship predictions\n\nOne major surprise: Corey Conners, a massive 50-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday.\n\nThe 32-year-old Canadian doesn't explode off the tee quite as much as some of the other top contenders, but he's extremely effective with an iron in his hands. In fact, Conners enters the Travelers Championship ranked second in strokes gained: approach to green (0.920) and sixth in greens in regulation percentage (70.37%). He's also finished T-13 or better in four of his last six starts, which includes a top-10 showing at last week's U.S. Open. Those impressive stats, plus his long odds, make Conners a strong play for your 2024 Travelers Championship bets.\n\nThe model has also examined where Scheffler finishes. Scheffler finished T4 at the Travelers Championship last season, and he has won five tournaments this season. He is coming off his worst showing of the year though, barely making the cut before finishing T41 at 8 over in the U.S. Open last week.\n\nThe 27-year-old won the Masters and RBC Heritage in April before adding a T8 in the PGA Championship and a T2 in the Charles Schwab Challenge. He picked up his fifth win of the year in the Memorial Tournament at 8 under prior to his dud in the third major of the year. Scheffler leads the PGA Tour in total strokes gained, scoring average and birdie average, so he is considered one of the top threats to win the Travelers. The model just locked in its Scottie Scheffler Travelers Championship picks here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Travelers Championship picks\n\nThe model is also targeting four other golfers with odds of 22-1 or longer to make a strong run at the title, and McClure's best bets include a massive triple-digit longshot. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.\n\nWho will win the 2024 Travelers Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

(AP) -- No hard feelings, Rory.\n\nPGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said he understands why Rory McIlroy withdrew from the Travelers Championship -- the final signature event on the calendar -- to recover from a late-Sunday meltdown at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"Sometimes you just need to focus on what you need,\" Monahan said on Wednesday, a day before the tournament at TPC River Highlands outside of Hartford. \"And that's what he's doing and that's exactly what he should be doing because that's what he thinks is the right path.\"\n\nMcIlroy twice had a one-shot lead at Pinehurst No. 2 before he bogeyed three of the last four holes, missing a pair of par putts from inside 4 feet. Instead of McIlroy's fifth major championship -- and his first in 10 years -- Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up.\" He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the following week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nWithout him, there will be 71 players teeing off on Thursday in the limited field, no-cut signature event at the TPC River Highlands. McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we're going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I'm looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"\n\nEnemy territory\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley's Boston Celtics beat Scheffler's Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher on Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, \"Do I have to answer that question?\" Scheffler said he hasn't heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n\"I don't blame him,\" Bradley said. \"I wouldn't want to either if I was a Dallas fan.\"\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway's wooden seats at the tournament's media day in April.\n\n\"It's one of the coolest gifts I've ever gotten -- probably the coolest gift I've ever gotten in my life,\" he said. \"To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.\"\n\nParis preview\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n\"There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,\" said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. \"Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they're going to do you all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it's our event, it's our own individual event.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean there's no patriotism involved.\n\n\"I'm not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,\" said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn't really thought about it. \"We're trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.\"\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years. It returned in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, making this the third go-round.\n\nScheffler said he is excited to be a part of the Summer Games and check out other sports, including basketball and tennis. He also wanted to make a trip to the Olympic Village to watch the other athletes train.\n\n\"I grew up playing a ton of sports, and so to be able to see the best in the world at their craft would be pretty special,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType":

For the 2024 Travelers Championship, golfers like Jason Day and Keegan Bradley have shown up time after time at TPC River Highlands. Day is appealing for 2024 Travelers Championship fantasy lineups because he has multiple top 10s at the course over his last five starts. Meanwhile, Bradley is the reigning event winner and also had a runner-up in 2019, making him potentially a top Travelers Championship fantasy golf pick.\n\nMeanwhile, Scottie Scheffler had a rough U.S. Open, but he's improved his finish in each of his last three Travelers Championship starts, with a fourth-place coming a year ago. Is this a week to include the World No. 1 in PGA Tour fantasy golf lineups? Or, should you save him for another week and look elsewhere for PGA Tour fantasy golf picks? Before making any 2024 Travelers Championship fantasy golf picks, you have to see the Travelers Championship fantasy golf rankings from SportsLine handicapper Eric Cohen.\n\nCohen is an avid golf bettor who correctly predicted the pre-tournament outright winner of the 2024 U.S. Open (Bryson DeChambeau +2000), 2024 Players Championship (Scottie Scheffler +550), 2023 Rocket Mortgage Classic (Rickie Fowler +1400), 2023 PGA Championship (Brooks Koepka +2000), 2023 Honda Classic (Chris Kirk +3500), 2022 Open Championship (Cameron Smith +2200), 2022 U.S. Open (Matt Fitzpatrick +2500), and 2022 Phoenix Open (Scheffler's first career victory at +2800).\n\nCohen is also a contributor to SportsLine's YouTube shows including \"Early Edge\" and is the host of \"The Early Wedge\" golf show. Anyone who has followed Cohen's predictions has made positive gains on their golf picks.\n\nNow, Cohen has ranked his top golfers for the 2024 Travelers Championship. Cohen's picks are only available at SportsLine.\n\n2024 Travelers Championship expert picks\n\nFor the Travelers Championship 2024, Cohen is backing Brian Harman at 40-1 odds this week. The reigning British Open champion has towered over this course like few others despite not picking up a victory at it. However, he was runner-up last year which was his third straight top 10 at TPC River Highlands. His success here stretches beyond that as he has five top 10s at this event over the last six years. He enters into the 2024 Travelers Championship with 13 straight rounds under par at TPC River Highlands.\n\nWhat makes Harman so effective here is that the course is one of the shortest on tour, so Harman's one true weakness of length off the tee doesn't hurt him here as much as on other courses. Instead, Harman's exceptional short game should be magnified and he is deadly with a putter in his hands, ranking in the top 15 on tour in total putting, overall putting average, putts per round and 3-putt avoidance. Cohen likes this player on this specific course, saying, \"At a shorter course, the diminutive Harman should have a big weekend once again.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Cohen is fading Morikawa, one of the favorites, at 16-1 odds. \"Every part of his game is working well right now, so why in my right mind would I rank him lower than usual this week? It's because in his limited history at TPC River Highlands, the American has two missed cuts and a T36 on debut to his credit.\"\n\nOne of the closest course comparisons to TPC River Highlands is another Pete Dye-designed course in TPC at Sawgrass. The latter hosts the Players Championship, and Morikawa has yet to find success at the PGA Tour's flagship event. He finished 45th at the tournament this year and has just one top-40 finish over four career starts there. Thus, Morikawa is better saved for another week, and one should look elsewhere with 2024 Travelers Championship lineups.

Usually there's some courses that people try to redo and they make them worse. So that's just kind of how it goes, unfortunately, just trying to cater to modern golf.\"\n\nSchauffele said the changes make the Travelers course \"visually more intimidating,\" with tighter fairways on holes 1 and 6. He said the green was a little smaller on 11, but that the course is still \"outstanding\" overall.\n\nWhat changes have been made to Travelers Championship course for 2024?\n\nSchauffele won the Travelers in 2022, shooting 19-under par. Last year, he was 14-under, tied for 24th. He's on a roll of success.\n\nHe won his first major, the PGA Championship, in Louisville May 19 and, just Tuesday morning, qualified for the U.S. team to play in the Olympics.\n\nSchauffele, Scottie Scheffler, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa, all of whom are at the Travelers this week, will be in Paris next month. Schauffele won the Gold Medal in Tokyo in 2021.\n\n\"It's super special,\" Schauffele said. \"It's always an honor to represent your country in any given tournament or event, so it was a really cool thing I was able to share with my family after winning the Gold Medal and qualifying was my first goal this year. It's a very hard team to qualify for, as you guys have seen on this U.S. side. That was a really big goal of mine to get back and really looking forward to competing again.\"\n\nNearly all of the top 50 players on the PGA Tour are set to play at the Travelers, a designated \"Signature Event\" with a $20 million purse, $3.6 million and 700 FedEx Cup points going to the winner. Missing, though, was Rory McIlroy, No. 3 in the world, who pulled out of the Travelers Monday, a day after missing a couple of short putts to lose the U.S. Open at Pinehurst to Bryson DeChambeau.\n\nAfter US Open meltdown, Rory McIlroy withdraws from Travelers Championship\n\n\"As a competitor all of us have had our highs and lows to a certain degree,\" said Schauffele, who finished in a tie for seventh in the Open. \"It's a tough spot. I'm sure he and his team are discussing what happened and sometimes you just need to step away from it all.\n\n\"He's under a bit more of a microscope. When things are going really well people are all over him, and unfortunately when things don't go your way, people are all over him. ... He's going to have to answer those questions and at some point he will, because he always does.\"\n\nCBS analyst Frank Nobilo dishes on Bryson DeChambeau, state of golf and the Travelers Championship field\n\nTravelers notes: Exemptions include Thorbjornsen\n\nMichael Thorbjornsen, who won some fans at the TPC with an impressive run and fourth-place finish as an amateur in 2022, will make his professional debut at this Travelers Championship as a sponsor exemption. Thorbjornsen, who played at Stanford, finished No. 1 in PGA Tour University ranking in May, earning membership for the remainder of the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Other sponsor exemptions include Adam Scott, Webb Simpson and Billy Horschel. ... Viktor Hovland and Collin Morikawa, two of the top golfers in the field, played in the Travelers as sponsor exemptions in 2019. ... Keegan Bradley will try to become the Travelers first repeat winner here since Phil Mickelson (2001-02). ... Players always tout the amenities at the Travelers; this year, the most popular new feature seems to be courtesy cars for caddies, as well as players. ... As of Tuesday afternoon, there were no withdrawals other than McIlroy. ... The Pro-Am Wednesday will be missing some of the usual celebs from UConn. Former Huskies quarterback Dan Orlovsky, and former Heisman winner Doug Flutie and former Bruin Tuuka Rask will be playing.", "source": {"uri": "courant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hartfort

Last week Bryson DeChambeau got up and down for par from 55 yards on the 72nd hole to edge Rory McIlroy by one stroke. This week, McIlroy will be in the field after withdrawing on Monday, but the tournament will feature every other player in the top 44 in the FedEx Cup standings.\n\nThis week, world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is the favorite in the 2024 Travelers Championship odds, at +360. Reigning PGA Championship champ Xander Schauffele is the +750 second choice on the PGA odds board. Collin Morikawa (+1100), Ludvig Aberg (+1200) and Viktor Hovland (+1800) round out the top five in the odds for this 71-player field. Before locking in any 2024 Travelers Championship picks, make sure you see the PGA Tour predictions and best bets from golf betting and fantasy expert Sia Nejad.\n\nNejad specializes in betting and DFS in golf, among other sports. He's had incredible success in the outright and first-round leader markets and in betting head-to-head matchups. He also has been solid with his head-to-head matchups since last year's Charles Schwab Challenge, going 49-32-4 and returning 14.31 units over that span. That's a $1,431 profit for $100 bettors since May 2023.\n\nNejad also nailed Wyndham Clark, a 75-1 longshot, as the outright winner at the Wells Fargo Championship last year. In 2023, SportsLine debuted \"The Early Wedge,\" and in the first three months of the show, he hit two first-round leaders and three outright winners.\n\nNow, Nejad has turned his attention to the 2024 Travelers Championship field and locked in his best bets, top sleepers and favorites to avoid. See whom they are at SportsLine.\n\nTop 2024 Travelers Championship expert picks\n\nOne surprise: Nejad is completely fading Scheffler, even though he is the +360 favorite. Ranked No. 1 in the world, Scheffler is having a spectacular season. He has five wins, which includes the Masters, two seconds and 12 top-10 finishes in 14 events.\n\nHowever at the U.S. Open last week in Pinehurst, Scheffler struggled all week with his game. He made the cut on the number and finished 41st. \"He almost missed the cut last week at Pinehurst, and he doesn't provide value at this number,\" Nejad told SportsLine.\n\nHowever, Nejad is high on the chances of Swede Ludvig Aberg, who is +1200 in the Travelers Championship odds. The 24-year-old rising star has two seconds and six top-10 finishes in 13 events this season. He is coming off a 12th place finish at the U.S. Open, where he was in contention going into Sunday's final round.\n\nNejad likes that Aberg has an all-around game to win this week. Aberg ranks fifth on the PGA Tour in strokes gained: total (+1.316). \"Aberg has been dialed-in with the ball-striking and, even though he can bomb it off the tee, he's shown an affinity for shorter tracks such as River Highlands,\" Nejad told SportsLine. See which other players to back at SportsLine.\n\nHow to make 2024 Travelers Championship picks\n\nNejad has locked in his best bets for the 2024 Travelers Championship and is backing several longshots, including one priced at more than +3500.

To find a worse finish by him you'd have to go back to October 2022 when he finished T45 at the CJ Cup. Can he bounce back and return to his normal self this week?\n\nXander Schauffele: The clear second-best golfer on the PGA Tour this season, as far as metrics are concerned, has been Xander Schauffele. He finally won his first career major at the PGA Championship but he still needs another win or two to help the record books reflect how good he's been playing in 2024. He now returns to an event he won two years ago, a seemingly perfect spot for him to grab his second win of the season.\n\nI'm trying not to let my bias as a Xander Schauffele fan show, but winning this week makes too much sense for him. His driver and putter let him down at last week's U.S. Open, but he was still second in the field in strokes-gained approach and finished a respectable T7. While he wasn't in the mix to truly make a run at winning on Sunday, there's enough there to show that we should continue to have faith in him in the final months of the season.\n\nReturning to TPC River Highlands, where he won in 2022, gives me tons of confidence ahead of this week. The approach play is still there and if Scheffler stumbles for the second straight week it leaves the door wide open for Schauffele.\n\nBrian Harman +3500\n\nBubba Watson was always the must-bet golfer at TPC River Highlands, but since he's moved to LIV, Brian Harman has taken over the \"horse for the course\" at this event. He has yet to win it, but he has three top-five and six top-10 finishes here the last nine seasons, including a T2 finish last season.\n\nHis form, while not spectacular, has been solid finishing inside the top 35 in four straight events. Now that he returns to a course where he feels extremely comfortable, I like him to take the next step and get back to contending.\n\nCorey Conners +4500\n\nThis marks the fourth straight event I've bet on Corey Conners but until the sportsbooks start pricing him at a more deserving (read: lower) number, I'm going to keep picking him. He's second on the PGA Tour in strokes-gained approach this season behind only Scheffler, and he has now gained strokes putting in two of his last three starts after finishing T9 at the U.S. Open.\n\nIf he keeps putting like he has been, he's going to capture his third win on Tour before the season ends. He's also aided this week by the fact he finished T9 at this event in 2023.\n\nAt 45-1, he may be the best value bet on the board this week.\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nYou can check out all of Iain's bets here!\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as 2024 Travelers Championship Betting Picks, Predictions and Odds for TPC River Highlands.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "iain_macmillan@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Iain MacMillan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Harman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Harman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bubba Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/drdr3l/picture289347585/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/45628f32-10a3-411f-92db-2fde33bcabb2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Many of the world's top golfers will be there, including current world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler. Coverage of the Travelers Championship can be found on the Golf Channel on Thursday and Friday, and on the Golf Channel and CBS on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nCantlay is hot after the US Open. He finished third, 2 strokes behind winner Bryson DeChambeau. But his 2024 season as a whole has been a roller coaster.\n\nThere is one notable trend, though. When he cards low rounds, it's usually on a Thursday. In 13 tournaments played so far this PGA season, he's shot 65 or lower 5 separate times. He's carded rounds of 67 or lower in 7 of his 13 opening rounds this year.\n\nBasically, if he's going to be in contention this weekend, he's going to get off to a hot start on Thursday. Thus, I'll take him to build on his momentum from a third-place finish last week to card a top-5 finish in Round 1 on Thursday. You can get that for +700 odds at bet365.\n\nAs for who will win the tournament, give me Xander Schauffele. He got his first major victory this year at the PGA Championship, getting that monkey off of his back. He's playing some of the best golf of his life. And, to make things even sweeter, he won this tournament in 2022. He plays TPC at River Highlands well, and I expect that to continue this weekend.\n\nAt +750 odds, betting on him is a little more palatable from a value standpoint than putting money on Scottie Scheffler (+375). There should be a lot of scoring this week, and Schauffele should be right in the middle of the action.\n\nSign up for bet365 today using promo code SBDXLM to score a first-bet safety net of up to $1,000 or $150 in bonus bets when you place an initial $5+ wager.\n\nIt makes sense to sprinkle some money on Bradley to win. Not only did he win last year's Travelers Championship, he set a course record with a 4-round total of 257 strokes. He hasn't been playing super well so far this year, but he clearly likes TPC at River Highlands, so maybe it'll spark him to victory once again. At +5000 odds, a small wager on Bradley could pay big dividends.\n\nFowler, on the other hand, has been terrible lately. He's missed the cut at his last 2 tournaments and has had a bad year overall. But the talent is there. If he can get hot, he can be in contention throughout the weekend. Call it a hunch, but I think this could be the week Fowler gets it together. He won't win, but a top-10 finish is within the realm of possibilities.\n\nWill Rory McIlroy play this weekend?\n\nAfter falling to Bryson DeChambeau by 1 stroke at the US Open last weekend, McIlroy has decided to take some time off to work on his game before a pair of important tournaments in Europe.\n\nMcIlroy, a native of Northern Ireland, said he'll be taking some time away before the Genesis Scottish Open (which he won last year) on July 14 and the start of The Open Championship at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nMcIlroy hasn't won a major since the PGA Championship in August of 2014. Since then, he's had 11 top-5 finishes in majors, including last week's second-place finish at the US Open.\n\nWill he claim another trophy or two in Scotland next month?

He's still the best golfer in strokes gained: approach and turned in a T4 finish at this event in 2023. If you've held onto Scheffler this long, time is running out, plus it's projected to be a birdie-fest, and the World No. 1 is motivated to bounce-back from going over par in all four rounds last week.\n\nXander Schauffele\n\nAfter finally securing his first major win, Xander Schauffele has endured a bit of mild regression. He's still recorded 11 top-ten finishes this season though, plus he won the 2022 Travelers, so the Californian will be comfortable navigating this short course, using every club in his bag with precision.\n\nPatrick Cantlay was in contention at the U.S. Open until the back-nine on Sunday and he's also performed well at TPC River Highlands in past years. In 2023, Cantlay finished T4 alongside Scheffler at 19-under-par, which would've been a winning score most other years. He's 33rd scrambling and 27th for one-putt percentage, so he should remain sharp at Travelers this week.\n\nBrian Harman\n\nBrian Harman has finished inside of the top-ten in three consecutive years at Travelers. It's been a bit of a lackluster showing from Harman lately, barely breaking the top-25, but he'll be comfortable at TPC River Highlands. His best weapon is the flat stick, ranked 24th strokes gained: putting.\n\nDenny McCarthy recorded a T7 finish at this event in 2023, winding up 18-under-par. He's top-25 in strokes gained: around the green and strokes gained putting, but he'll need to dial in his irons and driver a bit to contend for the outright win this week. He remains a great value and should return to the top-10 leaderboard by the end of the week.\n\nSepp Straka\n\nSepp Straka's been volatile at TPC River Highlands, however, he did card a T10 finish here in 2021 and a T38 finish in 2023. He's the best when it comes to driver accuracy on the PGA Tour, giving himself a big advantage against the field, while the short game is a work in progress. Straka's approach shots are solid though, giving him value in one-and-done formats and survivor leagues.\n\nFavorite One-And-Done: Ludvig \u00c5berg\n\nLudvig \u00c5berg has quickly ascended on the PGA Tour. The 24-year-old Swede is a great ball-striker off-the-tee and on approach, while also ranking 43rd strokes gained: putting. There are hardly any flaws in \u00c5berg's game, plus, he's sixth in par 4 scoring average, which form the majority of holes at TPC River Highlands.", "source": {"uri": "fantasypros.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FantasyPros"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Harman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Harman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludvig_\u00c5berg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ludvig \u00c5berg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_Straka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sepp Straka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denny McCarthy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Highland_Games", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Highland Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn.fantasypros.com/wp-content/images/LudvigAberg_PGA_Travelers_1470x650BP/1470x650.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

But even after Rory McIlroy withdrew from this week's Travelers Championship on Monday, the field at TPC River Highlands is stacked.\n\nThis week's Travelers Championship is the final Signature Event of the season, and the only two players currently ranked in the top 60 on the Official World Golf Ranking who are not here are McIlroy and the man who defeated him in Pinehurst last week, Bryson DeChambeau.\n\nMoney talks, and the winner of the PGA Tour's only Northeast stop will get a $3.6 million check, but this event also earns glowing reviews from players for what it does outside the ropes, too.\n\nOn Tuesday, Xander Schauffele, who won this event in 2022 and the PGA Championship last month, said, \"Coming to Travelers is awesome. They do such an amazing job for us, but also caddies and our support team.\"\n\nSchauffele, who has also earned a spot on the U.S. Olympic team, noted, \"If you look at the range, it's got the little umbrellas, we have a coffee stand, a lounging area, there's the green trucks out there with the pizza. So, it's such a relaxing week coming after the U.S. Open and I think all of us really appreciate that.\"\n\nAnd then there's the course, which at 6,835-yard is one of the shortest on the PGA Tour. The par-70 layout has earned a reputation as a venue where seriously low scores are shot every year. Consider this: Last season on the PGA Tour, there were 216 rounds of 63 or better, and 19 of them (about 9 percent) were shot here. Last year, en route to winning by three shots, Keegan Bradley won with rounds of 62, 63, 64 and 68.\n\nSome minor changes have been made to the course since Bradley won last year, but he does not anticipate they will significantly elevate scores, and to him, that's good.\n\n\"So often now in golf and in tournaments, they're making courses so difficult, and every week doesn't have to be like that,\" he said on Wednesday. \"That's what makes Travelers so fun to come play and so fun to watch, I think. Certainly, it's going to be tougher than last year, I would say, with the rough being up and some of the changes, but I think it's great to come here and know when you tee it up on the first hole you got to make birdies.\"\n\nCollin Morikawa played his third event as a professional at the 2019 Travelers Championship. Last year, he missed the cut after shooting 74-63.\n\n\"Even if it doesn't rain, and it looks like there might be a little bit of rain, but even if it doesn't rain these greens still act on the softer side,\" Morikawa said. \"I think when you see soft greens, sometimes there's nothing you can do about it and that's when we make a lot of birdies. Guys are able to go at pins a little bit more and get a little bit closer, so it is what it is.\"\n\nScottie Scheffler, who has won two Signature Events this season (the Arnold Palmer Invitational and RBC Heritage), agrees. The world's No. 1-ranked player also said that having Ted Scott, who caddied for all three of Bubba Watson's wins here, on his bag could give him an edge.\n\n\"I lean pretty heavily on Ted week-to-week, and this is a golf course that he's had a lot of success on,\" Scheffler said. \"So if there's a difference of opinion, I'm probably going to lean towards him a little bit more than myself, just because I haven't had the success on this golf course specifically.\"\n\nThe only thing that might slow the circle-writing on players' scorecards is the heat that has descended upon Connecticut and the rest of the Northeast. Temperatures are expected to be in the mid-to-upper-90s on Thursday and Friday at TPC River Highlands, and near 90 over the weekend, but Scheffler doesn't appear concerned.\n\n\"I'm from Texas, so it's actually cold up here to me,\" he said with a smile after finishing his Wednesday practice round when the thermometer was still showing temperatures in the 80s. \" I was a little chilly this morning when I got out there on the course.\"", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_dusek@golfweek.usatoday.com", "name": "David Dusek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer_Invitational", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer Invitational"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://golfweek.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2023/06/1501933470.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

To find a worse finish by him you'd have to go back to October 2022 when he finished T45 at the CJ Cup. Can he bounce back and return to his normal self this week?\n\nXander Schauffele: The clear second-best golfer on the PGA Tour this season, as far as metrics are concerned, has been Xander Schauffele. He finally won his first career major at the PGA Championship but he still needs another win or two to help the record books reflect how good he's been playing in 2024. He now returns to an event he won two years ago, a seemingly perfect spot for him to grab his second win of the season.\n\nI'm trying not to let my bias as a Xander Schauffele fan show, but winning this week makes too much sense for him. His driver and putter let him down at last week's U.S. Open, but he was still second in the field in strokes-gained approach and finished a respectable T7. While he wasn't in the mix to truly make a run at winning on Sunday, there's enough there to show that we should continue to have faith in him in the final months of the season.\n\nReturning to TPC River Highlands, where he won in 2022, gives me tons of confidence ahead of this week. The approach play is still there and if Scheffler stumbles for the second straight week it leaves the door wide open for Schauffele.\n\nBubba Watson was always the must-bet golfer at TPC River Highlands, but since he's moved to LIV, Brian Harman has taken over the \"horse for the course\" at this event. He has yet to win it, but he has three top-five and six top-10 finishes here the last nine seasons, including a T2 finish last season.\n\nHis form, while not spectacular, has been solid finishing inside the top 35 in four straight events. Now that he returns to a course where he feels extremely comfortable, I like him to take the next step and get back to contending.\n\nThis marks the fourth straight event I've bet on Corey Conners but until the sportsbooks start pricing him at a more deserving (read: lower) number, I'm going to keep picking him. He's second on the PGA Tour in strokes-gained approach this season behind only Scheffler, and he has now gained strokes putting in two of his last three starts after finishing T9 at the U.S. Open.\n\nIf he keeps putting like he has been, he's going to capture his third win on Tour before the season ends. He's also aided this week by the fact he finished T9 at this event in 2023.\n\nAt 45-1, he may be the best value bet on the board this week.\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Harman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Harman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bubba Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4665,h_2624,x_0,y_184/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j0kmrqpp1kd3ka48w9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

This week the PGA Tour shifts to Connecticut for another signature event, the Travelers Championship. Here's how our model sees the event event shaping up:\n\n2024 Travelers Championship Preview\n\nThe PGA Tour rolls along this week to the Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Connecticut. The par-70 course is known for its picturesque scenery and low scoring. Keegan Bradley will defend his title against a formidable field, including Xander Schauffele, Scottie Scheffler, and Collin Morikawa. It should be another edition that continues this even't rich tradition. Here's how our model sees it unfolding.\n\nKeyCompete's 2024 Travelers Championship Power Rankings:\n\n1. Xander Schauffele (+750): With his consistent performances and clutch play under pressure, Schauffele enters as our favorite. Four straight finishes of T8 or better, including a win at the PGA Championship.\n\n2. Scottie Scheffler (+360): For the first time in what feels like forever, Scheffler isn't No. 1 in our rankings, but his dynamic game and consistency make his a threat anywhere. Will be interesting to see how he bounces back from disappointing U.S. Open.\n\n3. Patrick Cantlay (+2000): T3 at the U.S. Open and a good fit here.\n\n4. Ludvig Aberg (+1200) : His star continues to rise, despite recent weekend fade at Pinehurst. A big-event win feels inevitable.\n\n5. Collin Morikawa (+1100) : A newly minted U.S. Olympian. Thrives on tough courses and a factor in several big events this season. Should be a good fit for TPC River Highlands.\n\n6. Brian Harman (+4000) : Horse for the course: three straight finishes of T8 or better here.\n\n7. Hideki Matsuyama (+2200) : Former Masters champion brings steady game and international acclaim. Quietly having a consistent season.\n\n8. Russell Henley (+2500) : All-around game and recent form make him one of our favorite dark horses. T7 last week.\n\n9. Sahith Theegala (+3000) : Aggressive style and ability to score low is exactly what's required here. Eight top 20s this year and a T2 here two years ago.\n\n10. Corey Conners (+3500) : Superb ball striker and consistent player, Five top 20s in his last 6 starts.\n\n2024 The U.S. Open Tournament Recap\n\nThe 2024 U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 will be remembered for its intense highs and heartbreaking lows. Bryson DeChambeau electrified the crowd with his showmanship and theatrical finish on the 72nd hole. Meanwhile Rory McIlroy's final round brought a mix of agony and drama, as two short missed putts shattered his hopes of backing into a playoff with DeChambeau. McIlroy himself seemed stunned, and it highlightec the fine margins and emotional rollercoasters that define championship golf.\n\nKeyCompete had a nice week on our matchup picks that brought our yearly record to 105-65.\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Travelers Championship Power Rankings: Our Model Eyes a New Favorite This Week.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_stracka@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Jim Stracka", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Harman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Harman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahith_Theegala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sahith Theegala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Henley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Henley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/wps/build/images/myrtlebeachonline/facebook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports / John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTPC River Highlands will play host to the final signature event of the 2024 PGA Tour season, the Travelers Championship.\n\nI've already given you my favorite bets to win this week in my full betting preview here, but I'm going to take things one step further in this article. Not only am I going to attempt to predict the winning score this week, but I'm going to predict the exact final score for the top 10 golfers on the odds list.\n\nThe winning score at the Travelers Championship has almost always been in the high-teens, with 19-under being the winning score here both in 2020 and 2023. Last year, Keegan Bradley won at 23-under-par, but that looks to be a bit of an outlier, especially with his winning score being three strokes better than second place.\n\nWe're going to take that second place score from last year and have that by my prediction to be the winning score this year. 20-under par gets it done this week.\n\nThe No. 1 ranked golfer in the world recorded just four birdies at the U.S. Open, which is a concerning sign heading into a Travelers Championship that is going to be somewhat of a birdie-fest. Am I predict he's going to finish outside the top 40 again? Absolutely not, but I don't think he'll have a chance to win on the back nine on Sunday.\n\nIf you read my betting preview, you know that Xander Schauffele is my best bet to win this week. Despite not being in the mix in the final stretch of holes on Sunday at the U.S. Open, he finished second in the field in strokes gained: approach and should be poised to make a run at winning the Travelers Championship for the second time in three years this week.\n\nCollin Morikawa has found his form and has played some fantastic golf of late, but I don't know if this is the week for him to add another win to his resume. He has a bad history at TPC River Highlands, missing the cut the last two years he's competed at it. I predict he makes the cut this time around, but won't be a factor on Sunday.\n\nLudvig Aberg's length off the tee is going to give him a huge advantage this week but there is a bit of concern about his play around the greens of late, losing strokes chipping now in four of his last six starts. To win on the PGA Tour you typically need to gain strokes in all four major areas so I could see his chipping costing him that final push he'll need to win.\n\nPatrick Cantlay found his swing at last week's U.S. Open and now goes to an event that he's always had a ton of success at. He has finished T15 or better here in six-straight starts including a T4 finish at this event in 2023. Expect a similar result from him this time around.\n\nViktor Hovland's chipping caused him to miss the cut at the U.S. Open and at this point, he's basically a not-quite-as-good version of Ludvig Aberg. His chipping won't cause him to miss the cut this week, but if you want to bet Hovland, why not just take Aberg at better odds?\n\nHideki Matsuyama is back to playing elite golf and has now finished T8 and solo sixth in his last two starts. He has also gained strokes putting now in four-straight events, something that was almost unheard of during the peak of his career. Look for him to have in name in the mix on the weekend.\n\nSahith Theegala does have good course history here, finishing T2 at this event in 2022. Unfortunately, his form hasn't been great lately, missing the cut at the Canadian Open and finishing T32 at the U.S. Open. He has to round back into form before I'll feel confident predicting him to have his name close to the top of the leaderboard on a Sunday.\n\nSam Burns has had a mixed bag of results at this event over the years, finishing T24 and T13 in 2020 and 2021 but then missing the cut in 2022. With that being said, he has now posted three-straight top 15 finishes which is a good sign heading into this week. Look for him to have a similar top 15 result at TPC River Highlands.\n\nYou have to like what we've seen from Tony Finau the past few weeks, finishing further up the leaderboard in five straight starts. His distance off the tee and sharp approach game will have him in the mix on Sunday.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortinet_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fortinet Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahith_Theegala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sahith Theegala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Burns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Burns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (golf)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3489,h_1962,x_0,y_175/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j0kq4mdvhzy1asf3p8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-06-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

After a closing 74 at the Memorial Tournament presented by Workday and rounds of 71-74-71-72 to start the U.S. Open, it was Scheffler's first time shooting five straight over-par rounds. However, Scheffler, who has won five times already this season, continues to lead dozens of key statistical categories on TOUR - and finished T4 at the Travelers last season... Keegan Bradley looks to become the first golfer to go back-to-back at the Travelers Championship since Phil Mickelson in 2001-02. Bradley has had two runners-up this year, including a playoff loss at the Sony Open in Hawaii... World No. 2 Xander Schauffele - winner of the PGA Championship and 2022 champion at TPC River Highlands - returns to action at the Travelers. Schauffele has 11 top-10 finishes this season in 15 events, including four in a row and is having a tremendously complete campaign so far in 2024, sitting second in Strokes Gained: Total... All the TOUR's top stars are set to tee it up at the Travelers, including two-time winner this season Rory McIlroy, reigning FedExCup champ Viktor Hovland, along with Ludvig \u00c5berg, Collin Morikawa, Patrick Cantlay and Max Homa - all ranked in the top-10 in the world... The field is currently at 69 players, and there will be no cut... Keep an eye on the Presidents Cup standings as we inch closer to this year's competition in Montreal, Quebec. Along with Scheffler, Schauffele, Morikawa and Homa, Wyndham Clark and Sahith Theegala - both in the field at the Travelers - are inside the automatic top-six spots for Team USA. Hideki Matsuyama, Jason Day, Tom Kim, Byeong Hun An, Sungjae Im and Nick Taylor are the top six on the international side (and are also all in the field in Connecticut).", "source": {"uri": "pgatour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pgatour.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortinet_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fortinet Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Open_in_Hawaii", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony Open in Hawaii"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludvig_\u00c5berg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ludvig \u00c5berg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kim", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Kim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahith_Theegala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sahith Theegala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Taylor_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Taylor (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidents Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/pgatour-prod/w_1200,h_628,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto/pgatour/news/editorial/2024/06/17/bradley-first-look.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

(NYSE: TRV ) today announced the start of the 2024 Travelers Championship at TPC River Highlands in Cromwell, Connecticut. This year's tournament is a PGA TOUR Signature Event and the only TOUR event in the Northeast. It also marks the 18th consecutive year that Travelers has served as title sponsor, matching the tournament record.\n\nThe field comprises the world's top players, including Scottie Scheffler, winner of this year's Masters and the top-ranked player in the world, Rory McIlroy (No. 2), PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele (No. 3), Ludvig Aberg (No. 4), Wyndham Clark (No. 5) and defending champion Keegan Bradley. As a Signature Event, there will be no cut - the full player field will compete in all four rounds.\n\nAlan Schnitzer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Travelers, said, \"In 2007, we committed to supporting our community by building a world-class tournament. Every year since then, it has continued to grow and evolve, and now we are pleased to be one of only eight Signature Events on TOUR. We are humbled and gratified by how far we have come and by the community's overwhelming response every step of the way. And, of course, the Travelers Championship is about so much more than golf - it is about making a difference in people's lives through a tradition of giving back and boosting the local economy.\"\n\nThe Travelers Championship donates 100% of its net proceeds to local charities. Since Travelers became title sponsor, the tournament has generated tens of millions of dollars for hundreds of nonprofits throughout New England, including millions of dollars for nearly 200 charities in 2023.\n\nThis year's primary beneficiary will again be The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a nonprofit based in Ashford, Connecticut, that focuses on creating fun and friendships for children with serious illnesses. Many other worthy nonprofits - spanning arts and culture, education, health care, housing, human services, mental health, food insecurity, science and technology, and youth development - also use the tournament as a platform to raise funds and promote their causes.\n\nAndy Bessette, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer at Travelers, said, \"The Travelers Championship would not be what it is today without the partnership of the PGA TOUR and the support of the players, our dedicated volunteers, other corporate sponsors, the state of Connecticut and, most importantly, the fans.

Instead of McIlroy's fifth major championship -- and his first in 10 years -- Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up.\" He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the following week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nWithout him, there will be 71 players teeing off on Thursday in the limited field, no-cut signature event at the TPC River Highlands. McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we're going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I'm looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"\n\nEnemy territory\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley's Boston Celtics beat Scheffler's Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher on Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, \"Do I have to answer that question?\" Scheffler said he hasn't heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n\"I don't blame him,\" Bradley said. \"I wouldn't want to either if I was a Dallas fan.\"\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway's wooden seats at the tournament's media day in April.\n\n\"It's one of the coolest gifts I've ever gotten -- probably the coolest gift I've ever gotten in my life,\" he said. \"To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.\"\n\nParis preview\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n\"There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,\" said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. \"Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they're going to do you all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it's our event, it's our own individual event.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean there's no patriotism involved.\n\n\"I'm not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,\" said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn't really thought about it. \"We're trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.\"\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years. It returned in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, making this the third go-round.\n\nScheffler said he is excited to be a part of the Summer Games and check out other sports, including basketball and tennis. He also wanted to make a trip to the Olympic Village to watch the other athletes train.\n\n\"I grew up playing a ton of sports, and so to be able to see the best in the world at their craft would be pretty special,\" he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Usually there's some courses that people try to redo and they make them worse. So that's just kind of how it goes, unfortunately, just trying to cater to modern golf.\"\n\nSchauffele said the changes make the Travelers course \"visually more intimidating,\" with tighter fairways on holes 1 and 6. He said the green was a little smaller on 11, but that the course is still \"outstanding\" overall.\n\nSchauffele won the Travelers in 2022, shooting 19-under par. Last year, he was 14-under, tied for 24th. He's on a roll of success.\n\nHe won his first major, the PGA Championship, in Louisville May 19 and, just Tuesday morning, qualified for the U.S. team to play in the Olympics.\n\nSchauffele, Scottie Scheffler, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa, all of whom are at the Travelers this week, will be in Paris next month. Schauffele won the gold medal in Tokyo in 2021.\n\n\"It's super special,\" Schauffele said. \"It's always an honor to represent your country in any given tournament or event, so it was a really cool thing I was able to share with my family after winning the gold medal and qualifying was my first goal this year. It's a very hard team to qualify for, as you guys have seen on this U.S. side. That was a really big goal of mine to get back and really looking forward to competing again.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nNearly all of the top 50 players on the PGA Tour are set to play at the Travelers, a designated \"Signature Event\" with a $20 million purse, $3.6 million and 700 FedEx Cup points going to the winner. Missing, though, was Rory McIlroy, No. 3 in the world, who pulled out of the Travelers Monday, a day after missing a couple of short putts to lose the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 to Bryson DeChambeau.\n\n\"As a competitor all of us have had our highs and lows to a certain degree,\" said Schauffele, who finished in a tie for seventh in the Open. \"It's a tough spot. I'm sure he and his team are discussing what happened and sometimes you just need to step away from it all.\n\n\"He's under a bit more of a microscope. When things are going really well people are all over him, and unfortunately when things don't go your way, people are all over him. ... He's going to have to answer those questions and at some point he will, because he always does.\"\n\nNotes: Exemptions include Thorbjornsen\n\nMichael Thorbjornsen, who won some fans at the TPC with an impressive run and fourth-place finish as an amateur in 2022, will make his professional debut at this Travelers Championship as a sponsor exemption. Thorbjornsen, who played at Stanford, finished No. 1 in PGA Tour University ranking in May, earning membership for the remainder of the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Other sponsor exemptions include Adam Scott, Webb Simpson and Billy Horschel. ... Viktor Hovland and Collin Morikawa, two of the top golfers in the field, played in the Travelers as sponsor exemptions in 2019.\n\nKeegan Bradley will try to become the Travelers' first repeat winner here since Phil Mickelson (2001-02). ... Players always tout the amenities at the Travelers; this year, the most popular new feature seems to be courtesy cars for caddies, as well as players. ... As of Tuesday afternoon, there were no withdrawals other than McIlroy. ... The Pro-Am Wednesday will be missing some of the usual celebs from UConn. Former Huskies quarterback Dan Orlovsky, former Heisman winner Doug Flutie and former Bruin Tuuka Rask will be playing.\n\n\u00a92024 Hartford Courant. Visit courant.com.

The Northern Irishman bogeyed three of his final four holes, handing the major championship to Bryson DeChambeau; he left the course minutes after DeChambeau clinched it with a par save at the final hole.\n\n\"As a competitor all of us have had our highs and lows to a certain degree,\" Xander Schauffele said of McIlroy this week. \"It's a tough spot. It for sure is a tough spot. I'm sure him and his team are discussing what happened and sometimes you just need to step away from it all and really try and be as objective as possible ... he's just, you know, he needs some time away to figure out what's going on.\"\n\nOther than McIlroy, seven of the top eight players in the Official World Golf Ranking headline the field, including World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler and No. 3 Schauffele, winners of the first two majors of the season.\n\nScheffler's triumph two weeks ago at the Memorial made him the first player since Justin Thomas in 2016-17 to win five tournaments in a PGA Tour season. Scheffler's victories have come on the biggest stages: The Players Championship, the Masters and three signature events.\n\nBut Scheffler is coming off a humdrum T41 finish at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"Just a long week,\" Scheffler said. \"I would say it's a tough week. I didn't have my best stuff and that's a pretty difficult golf course to try and make a lot of birdies and play some good golf around when you don't have your best stuff.\"\n\nThe defending champion is Keegan Bradley, a native of Vermont who was overjoyed last year to win New England's only PGA Tour event.\n\n\"It's fun to come back as a winner of the tournament, but I can think of when I was a 12-, 13-year-old kid coming here to watch David Duval play,\" Bradley said Wednesday. \"And then now getting to come as defending champion is pretty cool.\"\n\nOther recent winners at the short par-70, 6,835-yard track include Schauffele (2022), Harris English (2021) and Jordan Spieth (2017). Bradley shot a tournament record 23-under 257 to win last year. The winning score to par is generally in the teens.\n\nThe Travelers will mark the professional debut of 22-year-old Massachusetts native Michael Thorbjornsen, who earned his tour card via the PGA Tour University pathway this year and is in the field on a sponsor exemption.

In addition to being a signature event, this will also be no cut tournament, meaning the entire 2024 Travelers Championship field will play through the weekend. Scottie Scheffler, who has five outright wins this year, is the 4-1 betting favorite in the 2024 Travelers Championship odds. Other top contenders in the field include Xander Schauffele (15-2), Ludvig Aberg (16-1), Collin Morikawa (16-1), Viktor Hovland (22-1), Patrick Cantlay (25-1), and Hideki Matsuyama (28-1). The total 2024 Travelers Championship purse is $20 million, with the winner's share listed as $3.6 million.\n\nShould you back Scheffler this week even though he is coming off his worst performance of the season? Or would it make sense to target a longshot like Tommy Fleetwood, Jordan Spieth, or Wyndham Clark? Before locking in your 2024 Travelers Championship one and done picks, you need to see what SportsLine DFS pro and PGA expert Mike McClure has to say.\n\nThe One and Done format is growing in popularity. It has several noticeable similarities to NFL Survivor pools, with the main difference being entries are not eliminated with a bad week. Players pick one golfer per week and earn points based on their selected golfer's prize money for that tournament. Golfers can only be used once per season, and the point format makes nailing majors, signature events, and big money tournaments critical.\n\nMcClure is a DFS legend with over $2 million in career winnings, and he's been red-hot on his PGA picks dating back to the PGA Tour restart in June of 2020. McClure uses his proprietary simulation model to analyze the field and crush his golf picks.\n\nMcClure has been on fire with his One and Done picks in 2024. At The American Express he backed Justin Thomas, who finished in third place and took home $635,600. At the Genesis Invitational, McClure tabbed Patrick Cantlay, who finished in fourth place at the signature event, as his top OAD pick. At the Cognizant Classic, McClure's top one and done pick, Min Woo Lee, finished in a tie for second place. Finally, at the Arnold Palmer Invitation, another signature event, McClure recommended using Scottie Scheffler and Will Zalatoris. The Result: Scheffler won the event by five strokes, and Zalatoris finished in fourth place.\n\nHis hot steak continued at the Players Championship, where McClure again recommended using Scheffler (if was still available) and Xander Schauffele. Both players were in contention until the end, with Scheffler coming out with the win and Schauffele finishing in second place. Then, at the Valspar Championship, McClure listed Cameron Young, who finished in second place, as his top OAD pick.\n\nMore recently, at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson, McClure recommended using 50-1 longshot Alex Noren in One and Done pools. Noren would go on to be in contention until the end, before finishing in third place, two strokes off the lead! And at the PGA Championship, McClure targeted Viktor Hovland and Collin Morikawa, who finished in third and fourth places, respectively. He targeted Morikawa again at the Memorial Tournament, where Morikawa finished second.\n\nFinally, at last week's U.S. Open, McClure's top two one and done picks were Bryson DeChambeau and Rory McIlroy. DeChambeau finished in first place and McIlroy in second.\n\nNow, McClure has his sights on the 2024 Travelers Championship and just revealed his optimal One and Done picks. They are a must-see for any player looking for an edge in their One and Done pool. You can only see McClure's Travelers Championship 2024 one and done picks at SportsLine.\n\nTop 2024 Travelers Championship One and Done picks\n\nOne of McClure's top one and done picks this week at TPC River Highlands is Collin Morikawa. The 27-year-old has been playing some of the best golf of his career as of late, with five top-10 finishes in his last eight starts. Morikawa is no stranger to finding success against elite fields and has two major championships on his career resume.\n\nMorikawa is one of the best ball strikers in the world, and has the all around game that makes him a threat to win any tournament he enters. He is currently ranked sixth on the PGA Tour in total strokes gained (1.275), 11th in strokes gained (1.196), and 15th in strokes gained off-the-tee (0.539). McClure believes he will be in contention until the end at the Travelers Championship. You can see who else to back at SportsLine.\n\nHow to make Travelers Championship 2024 One and Done picks\n\nMcClure is also targeting another golfer for his 2024 Travelers Championship one and done picks who has a long track record of success against elite competition.

All of the PGA Tour's other stars are in the field, as well as rookie Michael Thorbjornsen, who is making his pro debut.\n\nAfter missing the U.S. Open with a left foot injury, two-time major champion Jon Rahm will be back in action at the LIV Golf tournament. So will U.S. Open winner Bryson DeChambeau, who is probably still catching his breath after his stunning finish.\n\nHere's what to watch in men's professional golf this week:\n\nIn the span of four days at Pinehurst No. 2 last week, Scottie Scheffler went from being the hottest golfer on the planet, having won in five of his past eight starts, to one who hasn't broken par in his past five rounds, including all four at the U.S. Open.\n\nIt's simply the nature of the game, according to Scheffler. In retrospect, the world No. 1 golfer said he didn't have his best stuff at an unforgiving course. Pinehurst No. 2's native areas left him in too many difficult spots off the tee.\n\n\"When I'm not playing my best, I feel like one of my skills is kind of managing my way around the golf course, knowing where the misses are,\" Scheffler said Tuesday. \"When you have pretty much a coin flip on whether or not you're going to have a swing or not, there's not really a side of the fairway to miss it on, there's not really areas you can play to, you just have to hit great golf shots.\"\n\nThe U.S. Open was the first time in Scheffler's pro career that he didn't break par in a tournament. He carded 71-74-71-72 and tied for 41st at 8-over 288.\n\nScheffler hasn't fared better than fourth at the Travelers Championship, but his caddie, Ted Scott, was carrying Bubba Watson's bag when he won at TPC River Highlands three times.\n\nAfter Keegan Bradley nearly set the PGA Tour scoring record with a 72-hole total of 23-under 257 at the Travelers Championship last year, McIlroy called TPC River Highlands \"obsolete\" and said improved equipment had \"passed it by.\"\n\nWith heavy rains softening the greens, Bradley set 54- and 72-hole scoring records for the tournament. There were 44 players at 10 under or better, and only one golfer who made the cut finished over par.\n\nTPC River Highlands ranked as the 40th-most difficult course on tour last season with a scoring average of 68.401. There were only 10 courses with lower averages.\n\nIn response, the club made several changes, including reducing the fairway widths on Nos. 1, 6, 12 and 13 and adding primary rough to a downhill slope on No. 12. Mounding was added to the right rough on No. 6, right side of the No. 9 green and the left side of No. 13. The Nos. 9 and 11 greens were also reduced in size.\n\n\"Usually, there's some courses that people try to redo and they make them worse,\" said Xander Schauffele, the 2022 Travelers Championship winner. \"So that's just kind of how it goes, unfortunately, just trying to cater to modern golf and, you know, putting bunkers 350 yards and turning.\n\n\"Any time you turn a par-5 into a par-4 it makes the hole worse because the hole was designed to be a par-5 and then you're hitting a 4-iron into it. So out here it seems like visually it's a little bit more intimidating, some of the fairways are tighter on 1 and 6, but the course looks the same for the most part. The green on 11 is a little bit smaller, which is fine because it's a wedge or 9-iron or something of that nature. So, overall, I think the course is still outstanding and the small upgrades to it are a good thing.\"\n\nThorbjornsen's pro debut\n\nMichael Thorbjornsen, a former Stanford All-American, earned his PGA Tour card through the 2025 season by finishing first in the PGA Tour University pathway for college golfers. He will make his pro debut this week.\n\nIt's not the first time Thorbjornsen, from Wellesley, Massachusetts, has competed in the event. In 2022, while playing on a sponsor exemption, Thorbjornsen finished fourth at 15 under, 4 strokes behind Schauffele. Since he was playing as an amateur, he couldn't collect the $406,700 he would have won.\n\n\"This is definitely my home, I would say, on the PGA Tour,\" Thorbjornsen said. \"Obviously, I made my first PGA Tour start here two years ago as an amateur. Love this place. It's close to home. Love the golf course.\"\n\nThorbjornsen, 22, won the 2018 U.S. Junior Amateur and made the cut and finished 79th at the 2019 U.S. Open. He made the cut in three of eight starts in PGA Tour events as an amateur, most recently tying for 17th at the John Deere Classic in July 2023.\n\n\"Whenever I see Massachusetts on the hometown, I am hyperfocused on whatever they're doing,\" said Bradley, who graduated from high school in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. \"So, I'm so proud of what he's done. The rumors of what type of player he is are strong. That he's, you know, very, very good. I love that.\n\n\"I can relate to what he's gone through to get to this point -- winters and stuff like that. So I'm always pulling for players from around here.\"\n\nLegion XIII captain Jon Rahm, who was forced to withdraw from last week's U.S. Open because of an infected wound on his left foot, said Wednesday that he'll be ready to tee off on Friday.\n\nHe had to pull out of the LIV Golf League's tournament in Houston after six holes of the second round on June 8 because of the same injury.\n\n\"I'm feeling good,\" Rahm said. \"The main reason for the withdrawal [from] the two events was the infection I had and just to be precautionary towards not making it worse and seeing what steps I can take to prevent that from happening in the future.\"\n\nRahm said the wound is still on his left foot, but added, \"I'm not going to really make it worse. A lot of things to follow up from what happened to make sure it heals properly and it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nRahm is still second in the individual points league with 98.17 after finishing in the top 10 in each of his first seven starts. He's 36.23 points behind Torque GC captain Joaqu\u00edn Niemann.\n\n\"I feel ready to walk and hit it,\" Rahm said. \"I haven't been able to do much. It doesn't take much for me to feel ready to compete. Looking forward to it. Just happy that I'm here.\"\n\nDeChambeau's victory lap\n\nIt has been quite a ride for Bryson DeChambeau since he won his second U.S. Open title with a 1-shot victory over Rory McIlroy at Pinehurst No. 2 on Sunday.\n\nDeChambeau appeared on the \"Today Show,\" \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\" \"The Pat McAfee Show\" and MSNBC. He estimates a couple of thousand people have touched the U.S. Open trophy since Sunday.\n\nWhen DeChambeau arrived at The Grove on Tuesday, a crowd of LIV Golf League employees were there to greet him.\n\nDuring a news conference Tuesday, DeChambeau talked about learning from things he shouldn't have done and saying things he shouldn't have said in the past.\n\n\"Messing up and learning from those mistakes and learning patience, resilience, determination, continuing to grow in that capacity and then getting to a place where I finally get to showcase my true self and show others what this great game means to me, it's given me so much,\" DeChambeau said. \"It's time for me to give back.\n\n\"That's what I love most. That's why this was so important for everyone to touch the trophy. I wanted everybody to experience it because it wasn't just for me, it was for the turnaround, everyone looking at me going, 'Wow, that person is different than what I thought.' It was for them, those people that saw who I now am, who I am. That's what I wanted people to feel is that involvement, that appreciation from me saying thank you. It meant a lot.\"\n\nBryson's Olympic snub\n\nAfter tying for sixth at the Masters, finishing solo second at the PGA Championship and winning the U.S. Open, DeChambeau climbed to No. 10 in the latest Official World Golf Ranking.\n\nThat still wasn't enough to get him into the 60-man field for the Olympic men's golf tournament outside Paris on Aug. 1-4.\n\nBecause rules prevent a single country from sending more than four golfers to the Olympics, DeChambeau was the second man out. Scheffler, Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa will represent the U.S. Patrick Cantlay was eighth in the OWGR.\n\nIt's bittersweet because DeChambeau was set to compete in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, but had to pull out after he tested positive for COVID-19 in final testing before leaving the U.S. He was replaced on the team by Patrick Reed.\n\n\"Not being able to go in 2020 was unfortunate for sure,\" DeChambeau said. \"It was very disappointing. But I got sick, and we took the precautions and made the right decisions, and I got healthy from it. I recovered. I got my smell back. It's all good.\"\n\nDeChambeau said he realized he might not be able to compete in team events like the Ryder Cup, Presidents Cup and the Olympics when he left the PGA Tour for LIV Golf in June 2022.\n\n\"This time around, it's disappointing, but I understand the decisions I made, and the way things have played out has not been necessarily perfectly according to plan,\" he said. \"I've done my best up until now to give myself a chance according to the OWGR, but I realize and respect where the current situation of the game is, albeit it's frustrating and disappointing. Hopefully 2028 will be a little different situation, and it will make it that much sweeter.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This week the PGA Tour shifts to Connecticut for another signature event, the Travelers Championship. Here's how our model sees the event event shaping up:\n\n2024 Travelers Championship Preview\n\nThe PGA Tour rolls along this week to the Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Connecticut. The par-70 course is known for its picturesque scenery and low scoring. Keegan Bradley will defend his title against a formidable field, including Xander Schauffele, Scottie Scheffler, and Collin Morikawa. It should be another edition that continues this even't rich tradition. Here's how our model sees it unfolding.\n\nKeyCompete's 2024 Travelers Championship Power Rankings:\n\n1. Xander Schauffele (+750): With his consistent performances and clutch play under pressure, Schauffele enters as our favorite. Four straight finishes of T8 or better, including a win at the PGA Championship.\n\n2. Scottie Scheffler (+360): For the first time in what feels like forever, Scheffler isn't No. 1 in our rankings, but his dynamic game and consistency make his a threat anywhere. Will be interesting to see how he bounces back from disappointing U.S. Open.\n\n3. Patrick Cantlay (+2000): T3 at the U.S. Open and a good fit here.\n\n4. Ludvig Aberg (+1200) : His star continues to rise, despite recent weekend fade at Pinehurst. A big-event win feels inevitable.\n\n5. Collin Morikawa (+1100) : A newly minted U.S. Olympian. Thrives on tough courses and a factor in several big events this season. Should be a good fit for TPC River Highlands.\n\n6. Brian Harman (+4000) : Horse for the course: three straight finishes of T8 or better here.\n\n7. Hideki Matsuyama (+2200) : Former Masters champion brings steady game and international acclaim. Quietly having a consistent season.\n\n8. Russell Henley (+2500) : All-around game and recent form make him one of our favorite dark horses. T7 last week.\n\n9. Sahith Theegala (+3000) : Aggressive style and ability to score low is exactly what's required here. Eight top 20s this year and a T2 here two years ago.\n\n10. Corey Conners (+3500) : Superb ball striker and consistent player, Five top 20s in his last 6 starts.\n\n2024 The U.S. Open Tournament Recap\n\nThe 2024 U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 will be remembered for its intense highs and heartbreaking lows. Bryson DeChambeau electrified the crowd with his showmanship and theatrical finish on the 72nd hole. Meanwhile Rory McIlroy's final round brought a mix of agony and drama, as two short missed putts shattered his hopes of backing into a playoff with DeChambeau. McIlroy himself seemed stunned, and it highlightec the fine margins and emotional rollercoasters that define championship golf.\n\nKeyCompete had a nice week on our matchup picks that brought our yearly record to 105-65.\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahith_Theegala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sahith Theegala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Harman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Harman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Henley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Henley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3170,h_1783,x_311,y_84/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j0rsx86gkray6vyqy4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Instead of McIlroy's fifth major championship -- and his first in 10 years -- Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up.\" He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the next week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nOwner of Starbeck's Smokehouse opening burger restaurant in Cedar Falls in July College Football: Cedar Falls native, grandson of former Panther basketball assistant coach commits to UNI Car trapped under semitruck in collision on North Elk Run Road Cedar Falls man arrested for alleged theft of electric bikes Deere & Co. to pay $1.1 million in back wages, interest to Black and Hispanic applicants Two transported to hospital Saturday after motorcycle crashed in ditch Greene man airlifted after motorcycle crashes with pickup west of Plainfield Two women charged in counterfeiting operation at Evansdale home Angel Reese says Caitlin Clark gets 'special whistle.'

McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we're going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I'm looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"\n\nEnemy territory\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley's Boston Celtics beat Scheffler's Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher on Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, \"Do I have to answer that question?\" Scheffler said he hasn't heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n\"I don't blame him,\" Bradley said. \"I wouldn't want to either if I was a Dallas fan.\"\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway's wooden seats at the tournament's media day in April.\n\n\"It's one of the coolest gifts I've ever gotten -- probably the coolest gift I've ever gotten in my life,\" he said. \"To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.\"\n\nParis preview\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n\"There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,\" said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. \"Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they're going to do you all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it's our event, it's our own individual event.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean there's no patriotism involved.\n\n\"I'm not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,\" said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn't really thought about it. \"We're trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.\"\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years. It returned in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, making this the third go-round.\n\nScheffler said he is excited to be a part of the Summer Games and check out other sports, including basketball and tennis. He also wanted to make a trip to the Olympic Village to watch the other athletes train.\n\n\"I grew up playing a ton of sports, and so to be able to see the best in the world at their craft would be pretty special,\" he said.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree

He's sitting at +400 to win the tournament.\n\nXander Schauffele has the second-best odds to win the tournament. He holds +750 odds to win the Travelers. Schauffele won the Travelers in 2022. He shot 19-under to win by two strokes.\n\nAs for last year's winner, Keegan Bradley is a bit further down the odds list. He has +5000 odds to repeat as the winner of the Travelers.

It's also the worst thing to happen to the PGA Tour as it heads to Cromwell, Connecticut, this weekend for the Travelers Championship.\n\nMr. DeChambeau is a member of LIV Golf, the rival tour that has used the deep financial resources of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund to lure prominent stars from the PGA Tour. While talks of a potential merger continue, the PGA Tour struggles with dwindling television ratings and fan interest.\n\nThe Travelers, a popular stop on the PGA Tour, normally benefits from the excitement generated at the U.S. Open. But this year's U.S. Open fallout isn't good for the Travelers or the PGA Tour.\n\nMr. DeChambeau is the brightest star in golf and raised the profile of LIV Golf with his dynamic performance at Pinehurst. Meanwhile, Mr. McIlroy, the no. 2-ranked player in the world, withdrew from the Travelers after announcing he is taking a hiatus from the sport to recover from blowing a chance to win his first major in 10 years.\n\nBogeys on three of the last four holes, including missed par putts within five feet on holes no. 16 and 18, caused the four-time major winner to lose by one stroke to Mr. DeChambeau, who claimed his second U.S. Open after winning at Winged Foot in 2020. His fan-friendly approach resonated with those in the gallery and millions watching television.\n\nAfter appearances on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\" \"The Today Show,\" \"The Pat McAfee Show,\" and CNBC, Mr. DeChambeau felt like a conquering hero when he arrived this week at Nashville, where LIV Golf is staging its ninth event of the year. \"Having the support of everybody, all the staff and the volunteers, the clubhouse employees, you name it, just everybody, the full-blown support, walking out of that and raising the trophy, it's truly for LIV and what they've done for me,\" Mr. DeChambeau said Wednesday.\n\nSomeone told him Google searches for his name went up by 250 percent, and he gained 150,000 followers across his social media platform. Tickets to follow his Crushers team during LIV's Nashville tournament are nearly sold out.\n\n\"I've got to just say I'm humbled by all of it,\" Mr. DeChambeau said. \"I never would have thought that from a year and a half ago, things would be where they're at right now.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. McIlroy pulled out of the Travelers at TPC River Highlands and won't play in the Rocket Mortgage Classic at Detroit or the John Deere Classic at the TPC Deere Run outside Chicago. He announced his next events would be the Genesis Scottish Open and The Open at Royal Troon.\n\nThe Travelers, a PGA Tour signature event, is boasting a lineup that includes 49 of the top 50-ranked players in the world, but, of course, does not include Mr. DeChambeau and other members of LIV Golf like Jon Rahm, Brooks Keopka, and Cam Smith, all major champions.\n\nThe Travelers includes the world no. 1, Scottie Scheffler, the 2024 PGA Championship winner, Xander Schauffele, the 2023 U.S. Open winner, Wyndham Clark, and a Fed Ex Cup champion, Viktor Hovland. Yet there is no carry-over buzz from the U.S. Open.\n\nMr. Scheffler, the reigning Masters champion and winner of five tournaments this year, was never a factor at Pinehurst and finished T41. A more competitive Mr. Schauffele tied for seventh, but neither participated in the final day fireworks. \"I didn't really feel like I had a chance to win the tournament at any point,\" Mr. Schauffele told reporters in Connecticut.\n\nWith Mr. Scheffler dominating the PGA Tour for much of this season, golf needed a rival to add spice to the sport. That might apply when PGA Tour players and LIV golfers merge at The Open, but that doesn't help the PGA Tour in the short term.\n\nIf Mr. McIlroy were at Cromwell as planned, he would attract attention from the media and fans. Instead, the U.S. Open hangover is a headache for the Travelers and the PGA Tour.\n\nThe \"Bryson Effect\" will attract more eyeballs to LIV Golf when the Nashville tournament begins Friday. He's already more personable and entertaining than anyone on the PGA Tour, and at age 30 connects with a younger audience through social media and YouTube videos.\n\n\"You're going to see some really cool changes over the next couple of years in regards to LIV,\" Mr. DeChambeau said. \"I'm not going to give too much away, but there's a really cool mission and belief that we have in what we're going to do and what we're going to accomplish for the game. There's some awesome stuff coming.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_willis@nysun.com", "name": "George Willis", "type":

As a Signature Event, there will be no cut - the full player field will compete in all four rounds\n\nThe tournament's field comprises the world's top players, including Scottie Scheffler, winner of this year's Masters and the top-ranked player in the world, Rory McIlroy (No. 2), PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele (No. 3), Ludvig Aberg (No. 4), Wyndham Clark (No. 5) and defending champion Keegan Bradley.\n\nCompetition rounds begin Thursday, June 20. Special events are scheduled throughout the week, with spectators allowed on-site starting Wednesday, June 19.\n\nThe Travelers Championship donates 100% of its net proceeds to local charities. Since Travelers became title sponsor, the tournament has generated tens of millions of dollars for hundreds of nonprofits throughout New England, including millions of dollars for nearly 200 charities in 2023.\n\nThis year's primary beneficiary will again be The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a nonprofit based in Ashford, Connecticut, that focuses on creating fun and friendships for children with serious illnesses.

It's a tournament that annually is one of the most well-attended by fans and the players seem to love this event, but it does feel like many players could potentially use an off week.\n\nThat's not the case however on the PGA Tour. We again have a limited field of participants and this week players will be asked a very different set of questions from the golf course at TPC River Highlands. It's hard to imagine a course that would be more of a contrast than Pinehurst No. 2. That said, players know exactly what to expect at the Travelers Championship, and so do we. We have seen some moderate changes to the course in recent years, but ultimately we know the formula.\n\nI wanted to use this piece to hopefully highlight a few different angles and elements that may be less spoken about to provide some value in this course preview. I'm hopeful that you can utilize this for building lineups and making your stat models to provide you with the best possible chances of success this week. Here is everything that you need to know about TPC River Highlands and nothing that you don't.\n\nOriginally opened for play in 1928 as the Middletown Golf Club, the golf course this week has undergone several transformations before becoming known TPC River Highlands in 1984. As with many of the other notable courses in the TPC network, architect Pete Dye was responsible for the design and layout. There have been numerous restorations since, most notable was the 1989 redesign by Bobby Week and Howard Twitty who were brought in to increase the challenge for professional players as the tournament began hosting the Travelers Championship.\n\nThe course remains one of the shortest courses on the PGA Tour, but still presents several aspects that have secured its integrity and kept it from being overpowered by the modern player. Keeping the ball in the fairway is a must as this course tends to reward hyper-accurate players such as Jim Furyk, who recorded a 58 at TPC River Highlands in 2016 which is still the lowest score ever recorded at a PGA Tour event.\n\nAhead of the 2016 Travelers Championship, another renovation project was completed as they redid every bunker on the course. The new bunkers made the course substantially more challenging and a legitimate penalty for professionals. The bunkers are relatively flat but they added steep grass faces which are difficult to get over if you end up on the front side of them. It's ultimately the reason that Sahith Theegala ejected on the final hole of the Travelers Championship. You can't try to bite off too much, as these bunkers are the primary defense mechanism. This is a great example of the restoration work and how it has affected the playability.\n\nSince 2016, the course has an average ranking of being the 25th most difficult course on the PGA Tour. It's right in the middle of the pack, despite being one of the shortest setups that we see all season long. There are five holes with water in play, 69 total bunkers, and features 4+ inch Kentucky Bluegrass rough that often requires players to simply chop it out around the greens. The greens are tiny which you would expect from a short course, but they are pretty receptive if you can control your spin which is best achieved from the fairways.\n\nBoth Par 5's are incredibly short and reachable for all players in the field, assuming that they are able to find the fairway. Like most short courses, the further that you hit the ball off the tee, the more the fairways will narrow. If you are willing to lay back and hit your tee shot to around the 250-yard mark on most holes, the fairways are very generous, averaging 38 yards wide. If you hit it 300 yards, they narrow to around 29 yards wide. Each tee shot will require a decision based on aggression and position which I believe makes for quality golf.\n\nWe have seen multiple strategies deployed at TPC River Highlands with success. Players like Bubba Watson and Dustin Johnson have overpowered the course on their way to victory in the past, but I would reckon that the more predictable skill set is one of heightened accuracy and proper course management. The green complexes are a blend of POA/Bentgrass but players have spoken in the past about how they believe that they putt more like a true Bentgrass.\n\nYou can see some really low scores around here if a player's irons are clicking. We have seen multiple rounds of 60 or better in the past. The average Greens-in-regulation numbers are above 70%, which is well north of the Tour average. Since they are so small, if you can hit 14-15 greens in regulation, then you are going to be left with a ton of good opportunities to make birdie. The course will penalize you if you make mistakes, but the ability to go insanely low here is unique to TPC River Highlands.\n\nI mentioned earlier how there have been different paths to success at the Travelers Championship, but the one most predictable is through Driving Accuracy. I am factoring it in heavily in my stat model. I think it's important to filter in stats mostly from other short courses if you can. There are a number of players who will hit iron off the tee or some of lofted metal, so making sure that you are pulling data from the correct club sets is important.\n\nWe have established that Greens-in-regulation rates are high at this course, but I still believe that this is a very sneaky SG: Around-The-Green course. If you look into leaderboard correlation in previous years, the players who succeed at getting it up and down out of the thick rough, and difficult greenside bunkers have a ton of success. It may be a mental thing as you must feel like momentum goes way down anytime you make a bogey out there, especially when those around you may be going low with their scoring.\n\nSurgical precision with your iron play from the 125-175-yard range is also a prerequisite for success. In 2022, 46% of all approach shots came within that range. In 2023, it was 45%. Anytime nearly half of your approach shots are coming from a 50-yard range, it's highly important to factor into your stat model. We're talking about essentially 3-4 clubs that you are hitting half of the shots with into greens. SG: Approach 125-175 yards is key.\n\nSome other stats that I am inputting are SG: Putting (I am using Bentgrass filters), Course History, SG: OTT on courses under 7200 yards, and I am sprinkling in a little SG: Pete Dye into the equation.

Instead of McIlroy's fifth major championship -- and his first in 10 years -- Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up.\" He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the next week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nIowa DCI: Wall Lake trucker David Schultz's death 'not a homicide' Lost and found: How Arnolds Park got a miniature train back after more than 50 years Jefferson, S.D. dad shares secret to fatherhood on Father's Day celebration Perley to step down as Thompson CEO; Beaulieu to take over Former Sioux City hotel under renovation, to become high-rise senior housing this year Man dies in standoff with authorities in Sac County Omaha ballpark seeks to ban two Texas A&M fans who were kicked out of College World Series game Athlete of the Week: Miller's motor leading the way for West Monona Tyson Foods heir suspended as CFO after second alcohol-related arrest Sioux City man pleads not guilty of manslaughter Our Opinion: WITCC settlement in human trafficking case raises more questions Marriage licenses for Woodbury County for June 17, 2024 Chainsaw sculptures among latest upgrades to Sioux City's historic Hubbard Park Top area softball performers: RSM last unbeaten team; Mentzer, Moreau swinging hot bats Boat speed rule imposed on Okoboji lakes in wake of heavy rains, storms that also led to wastewater discharges\n\nWithout him, there will be 71 players teeing off on Thursday in the limited field, no-cut signature event at the TPC River Highlands. McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we're going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I'm looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"\n\nEnemy territory\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley's Boston Celtics beat Scheffler's Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher on Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, \"Do I have to answer that question?\" Scheffler said he hasn't heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n\"I don't blame him,\" Bradley said. \"I wouldn't want to either if I was a Dallas fan.\"\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway's wooden seats at the tournament's media day in April.\n\n\"It's one of the coolest gifts I've ever gotten -- probably the coolest gift I've ever gotten in my life,\" he said. \"To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.\"\n\nParis preview\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n\"There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,\" said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. \"Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they're going to do you all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it's our event, it's our own individual event.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean there's no patriotism involved.\n\n\"I'm not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,\" said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn't really thought about it. \"We're trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.\"\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years. It returned in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, making this the third go-round.\n\nScheffler said he is excited to be a part of the Summer Games and check out other sports, including basketball and tennis. He also wanted to make a trip to the Olympic Village to watch the other athletes train.\n\n\"I grew up playing a ton of sports, and so to be able to see the best in the world at their craft would be pretty special,\" he said.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree

He has yet to record a hole-in-one, but he did secure an M.A. in Sports Journalism from St. Bonaventure University.\n\nThe final Signature Event of the 2024 season has arrived, as 71 golfers will tee it up at this week's Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Connecticut.\n\nRory McIlroy will not be there, as he opted to take some time off following his heartbreaking finish at the U.S. Open. But Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, Collin Morikawa, and Ludvig \u00c5berg will be. So, too, will defending champion Keegan Bradley, who blistered a soft course last year en route to shooting 23-under-par, setting a new tournament record in the process.\n\nBut this year's course will play much firmer and faster with temperatures hovering in the 90s throughout the week. Luckily, this limited-size field will not have to endure the speed and difficulty of Pinehurst No. 2, but the weather will feel more or less the same as it did in North Carolina. The Northeast is experiencing a heatwave this week, with heat advisories extending from the Great Lakes through the Mid-Atlantic and all the way through New England. That means everyone at TPC River Highlands will need to hydrate, including the putting surfaces, which will turn crisp quite easily in these conditions.\n\nThis golf course is also the shortest one played on the PGA Tour all season, requiring precision into the greens and an exquisite short game. Get ready for a birdie barrage, too; although, with this week's weather, scores likely will not go as low as they did a year ago.\n\nSo let's get to our Staff Picks, with Jeanna Kelly from SB Nation's NFL site stepping in as our guest picker this week:\n\nFor the third time this season, a Canuck will emerge victorious on the PGA Tour.\n\nI am going with Corey Conners, fresh off a strong tie for 9th at the U.S. Open, to break through at the Travelers Championship and win for the third time on tour. Funny enough, Conners won a pair of Valero Texas Opens, in 2019 and 2023, but this time, he finally wins an event outside of the Lone Star State.\n\nLast year, Conners finished in a tie for 9th at TPC River Highlands, shooting four impressive rounds in the mid-60s to finish at 17-under. His bet score came on Saturday, when he posted a 5-under 65. But what I love about Conners is that he is one of the best iron players on the PGA Tour. He ranks second in strokes gained approach, sixth in greens in regulation percentage, and seventh in total birdies made, as Conners has poured in 253 par-breakers this season.\n\nThe one knock on him is his putting and short game, but both facets showed up at Pinehurst No. 2, relatively speaking. Conners ranked 28th in strokes gained around the greens and 30th with his putter at last week's U.S. Open, which featured some of the most diabolical putting surfaces seen anywhere in the world. But best of all, his solid performance helped him clinch a spot in the 2024 Olympics, giving him plenty of confidence and momentum going into the summer.\n\nWith all of this in mind, I believe the stars have aligned for Conners to win, especially on a week when plenty of other top players mail it in fresh off a grueling major.\n\nWhen I make NFL picks, I consider many factors: recent performance, injuries, weather forecasts, and so on. Since this is my first time making golf picks, I tried to follow a similar strategy.\n\nObviously, the easy pick here would be Scottie Scheffler, who's once again the odds-on favorite to win. Prior to the U.S. Open, and depending on that outcome, I thought I'd pick Rory McIlroy, but he's withdrawn from the Travelers after last week's fiasco. So I'm actually going with Collin Morikawa this week. He's been playing really solid golf the past several weeks. His putting hasn't been a liability, and eventually, these factors are going to lead him to a win. It might as well be this weekend.\n\nI am going with Ludvig \u00c5berg this week. He tied for 24th last year, but now he returns to TPC River Highlands with some familiarity with the course.\n\nHis game is in good form, but he just had a weird weekend at the U.S. Open, where two triple bogies stymied him.\n\nBut this golf course suits him, given his exquisite iron play. He ranks 11th on the PGA Tour in strokes gained approach and ranked 15th in that metric last week at Pinehurst No. 2. Luckily for him, TPC River Highlands does not have any greens like the 13th at Pinehurst or as difficult as the par-4 2nd, so he should not make any more triples this time around.\n\nI think he runs away with it.\n\nFor all other sports betting content, check out SB Nation's DraftKings site.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) - No hard feelings, Rory.\n\nPGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said he understands why Rory McIlroy withdrew from the Travelers Championship - the final signature event on the calendar - to recover from a late-Sunday meltdown at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"Sometimes you just need to focus on what you need,\" Monahan said on Wednesday, a day before the tournament at TPC River Highlands outside of Hartford. \"And that\u00b4s what he\u00b4s doing and that\u00b4s exactly what he should be doing because that\u00b4s what he thinks is the right path.\"\n\nMcIlroy twice had a one-shot lead at Pinehurst No. 2 before he bogeyed three of the last four holes, missing a pair of par putts from inside 4 feet. Instead of McIlroy\u00b4s fifth major championship - and his first in 10 years - Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up.\" He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the following week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nWithout him, there will be 71 players teeing off on Thursday in the limited field, no-cut signature event at the TPC River Highlands. McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\nRory McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, and Scottie Scheffler finish their first round of the U.S. Open golf tournament Thursday, June 13, 2024, in Pinehurst, N.C. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart)\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we\u00b4re going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I\u00b4m looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley\u00b4s Boston Celtics beat Scheffler\u00b4s Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher on Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, \"Do I have to answer that question?\" Scheffler said he hasn\u00b4t heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t blame him,\" Bradley said. \"I wouldn\u00b4t want to either if I was a Dallas fan.\"\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway's wooden seats at the tournament\u00b4s media day in April.\n\n\"It\u00b4s one of the coolest gifts I\u00b4ve ever gotten - probably the coolest gift I\u00b4ve ever gotten in my life,\" he said. \"To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.\"\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n\"There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,\" said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. \"Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they\u00b4re going to do you all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it\u00b4s our event, it\u00b4s our own individual event.\"\n\nThat doesn\u00b4t mean there\u00b4s no patriotism involved.\n\n\"I\u00b4m not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,\" said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn\u00b4t really thought about it. \"We\u00b4re trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.\"\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years.

Instead of McIlroy's fifth major championship -- and his first in 10 years -- Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up.\" He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the following week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nWithout him, there will be 71 players teeing off on Thursday in the limited field, no-cut signature event at the TPC River Highlands. McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we're going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I'm looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley's Boston Celtics beat Scheffler's Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher on Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, \"Do I have to answer that question?\" Scheffler said he hasn't heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n\"I don't blame him,\" Bradley said. \"I wouldn't want to either if I was a Dallas fan.\"\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway's wooden seats at the tournament's media day in April.\n\n\"It's one of the coolest gifts I've ever gotten -- probably the coolest gift I've ever gotten in my life,\" he said. \"To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.\"\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n\"There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,\" said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. \"Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they're going to do you all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it's our event, it's our own individual event.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean there's no patriotism involved.\n\n\"I'm not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,\" said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn't really thought about it. \"We're trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.\"\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years. It returned in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, making this the third go-round.\n\nScheffler said he is excited to be a part of the Summer Games and check out other sports, including basketball and tennis. He also wanted to make a trip to the Olympic Village to watch the other athletes train.\n\n\"I grew up playing a ton of sports, and so to be able to see the best in the world at their craft would be

We break down their chances in our PGA Tour odds below.\n\nA historic and thrilling major championship Sunday saw Bryson DeChambeau escape with a second U.S. Open title and Rory McIlroy suffer maybe the worst defeat of his career.\n\nRory McIlroy is back for more this week and trails only Scottie Scheffler on the Travelers Championship odds boards. I break down the golf odds, the favorites, and more for TPC River Highlands below.\n\nScottie Scheffler was a historically-short favorite at Pinehurst last week but didn't meet the mark, finishing T41 in what is his worst result since the 2022 CJ Cup. The odds are hesitant to budge, however, with the World No. 1 still seeing prices ranging from +350 and +400 after this recent run of five wins in eight starts.\n\nHere at the Travelers, Scottie's improved in each of his four career starts. He missed the cut in 2020, then finished T47 and T13 the two following years before a personal-best T4 a season ago.\n\nRunning second on the board is Rory McIlroy, who enters the week after maybe the worst loss of his career. Rory did well to snag a two-shot lead with a few holes to play on Sunday but missed two shorts putts down the stretch to essentially hand the trophy back to Bryson DeChambeau.\n\nWith all five career finishes here falling between T7 and T19, Rory's clearly comfortable here, but while his odds are in the short +750 to +800 range, this week has all the makings of a massive emotional letdown.\n\nXander Schauffele is the third option on the board with very similar odds in the +800 range. The World No. 3 has continued to play well following his first major win, finishing T8 at the Memorial and T7 at Pinehurst last week. In addition to being in excellent form, Xander also won the 2022 Travelers behind back-to-back rounds of 63 on Thursday and Friday.\n\nCollin Morikawa is fourth on the board despite no good finishes here at the Travelers in his career. He is in great form, however, with three Top 5s and a T14 over his last four starts. Ludvig Aberg rounds out the Top 5 at 16/1 after a T5 finish at the Memorial and a T12 at the U.S. Open in which he held the 36-hole lead.\n\nHere are the recent Travelers Championship winners and their closing odds to win:", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_of_Champions_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tournament of Champions (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/2c0275b8-46ce-47b5-8dfd-33d18cf2242c.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Instead of McIlroy's fifth major championship -- and his first in 10 years -- Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up.\" He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the next week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nWithout him, there will be 71 players teeing off on Thursday in the limited field, no-cut signature event at the TPC River Highlands. McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we're going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I'm looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"\n\nEnemy territory\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley's Boston Celtics beat Scheffler's Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher on Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, \"Do I have to answer that question?\" Scheffler said he hasn't heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n\"I don't blame him,\" Bradley said. \"I wouldn't want to either if I was a Dallas fan.\"\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway's wooden seats at the tournament's media day in April.\n\n\"It's one of the coolest gifts I've ever gotten -- probably the coolest gift I've ever gotten in my life,\" he said. \"To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.\"\n\nParis preview\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n\"There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,\" said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. \"Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they're going to do you all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it's our event, it's our own individual event.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean there's no patriotism involved.\n\n\"I'm not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,\" said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn't really thought about it. \"We're trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.\"\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years. It returned in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, making this the third go-round.\n\nScheffler said he is excited to be a part of the Summer Games and check out other sports, including basketball and tennis. He also wanted to make a trip to the Olympic Village to watch the other athletes train.\n\n\"I grew up playing a ton of sports, and so to be able to see the best in the world at their craft would be pretty special,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@omaha.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

meltdown at the US Open.\n\n\"Sometimes you just need to focus on what you need,\" Monahan said a day before the tournament at TPC River Highlands outside of Hartford.\n\n\"And that's what he's doing and that's exactly what he should be doing because that's what he thinks is the right path.\"\n\nMcIlroy twice had a one-shot lead at Pinehurst No.2 before he bogeyed three of the last four holes, missing a pair of par putts from inside four feet.\n\nInstead of McIlroy's fifth major championship -- and his first in 10 years -- Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Tuesday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up\".\n\nHe is planning to return July 10-14 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the following week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nWithout him, there will be 71 players teeing off on Thursday in the limited field, no-cut signature event at the TPC River Highlands.\n\nMcIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we're going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I'm looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"", "source": {"uri": "nine.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title":

He has yet to record a hole-in-one, but he did secure an M.A. in Sports Journalism from St. Bonaventure University.\n\nThe eighth and final Signature Event of the 2024 season has arrived, as the best players on the PGA Tour head to the Northeast for the Travelers Championship.\n\nScottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, and Rory McIlroy, fresh off his heartbreaking finish at the U.S. Open, headline the 72-man field at TPC River Highlands. Collin Morikawa, Ludvig \u00c5berg, and Viktor Hovland will tee it up in Connecticut this week, too.\n\nUnlike Pinehurst No. 2, this golf course yields plenty of birdies while placing a premium on iron play. It's a second-shot golf course, and whoever can make the most par-breakers this week typically wins. You should also expect a final score around 18 or 20-under-par, with multiple 62s and 63s shot over the course of the week. Heck, Jim Furyk shot a 58 on this layout in 2016, which still stands as the lowest score ever on the PGA Tour.\n\nHere are the current odds for players to win this week, provided by DraftKings.\n\nKeegan Bradley, the New England native and diehard Boston sports fan, won this event last year at 23-under-par, thanks in part to an opening 8-under 62 on Thursday and a 7-under 63 on Friday. He led the field in strokes gained approach and strokes gained putting, which explains why his final 72-hole score set a new tournament record.\n\nGood ball strikers and solid putters tend to do well on this golf course. Xander Schauffele, who fits that billing, won this event two years ago, marking his 6th career win on the PGA Tour. He has won two more tournaments since, including this year's PGA Championship.\n\nSchauffele also recorded his 10th top-10 finish of the season at Pinehurst No. 2, despite not having his best stuff throughout the week.\n\nKnowing that Schauffele has won on this golf course before and has played the best golf of his career throughout 2024, we like Schauffele to record a top-five finish at +180.\n\nIf not for an unfortunate triple bogey on the 13th hole during the third round of the U.S. Open, Tony Finau could have vied for the title until the very end. He wound up tying for third, finishing at 4-under-par, two strokes behind Bryson DeChambeau.\n\nDespite that, Finau's game has rounded into form, as he has his four straight top-20 finishes over the last month.\n\nHe is a terrific ball-striker -- Finau is third on the PGA Tour in strokes gained approaching the green. His putter has let him down at times, but it did not affect him much at Pinehurst No. 2. He gained 0.43 strokes on the greens for the week, ranking 39th among the field.\n\nConsidering the greens at TPC River Highlands come nowhere close to the ones at Pinehurst No. 2, we like Finau to have another above-average week with the putter and finish in the top 10 at +280.\n\nLike Finau, the 13th hole got the best of Ludvig \u00c5berg on Saturday afternoon. He made a triple bogey there, which all but ended his chances.\n\nNevertheless, \u00c5berg will bounce back this week. He has quickly become one of the best ball-strikers on the planet, as seemingly every iron shot has a high ball flight and goes as straight as an arrow. That's an excellent combination on any golf course, especially a favorable one like TPC River Highlands.\n\nPlus, \u00c5berg played at the Travelers Championship last year, tying for 24th and finishing at 13-under par. He even shot a 5-under 65 on Saturday, an impressive round given that he had finished up his tenure at Texas Tech roughly one month before. But knowing that \u00c5berg has some experience on this course, and given his superb talent, we like him to also finish in the top 5 at +330.\n\nPerhaps the most underrated player in the game right now, Russell Henley arrives in Connecticut fresh off a tie for 7th at the U.S. Open. He carded a 3-under 67 in the final round, helping him record a back-door top 10, but Henley has four other top 10 finishes this season. He is also the 16th-ranked player in the world, thanks to his solid ball striking and excellent putting.\n\nHenley does not miss the fairway often and thus awards himself plenty of opportunities to make birdie. His game should translate well to this course, where he has had some success. Henley's best finish came in 2018 when he tied for 6th. He has since tied for 19th in his past two starts, in 2021 and 2023. But this year, we like Henley to post a result better than that. He is +3500 to win, which we are greatly considering, but we like him to finish in the top 5 at +650.\n\nFrenchman Matthieu Pavon played well enough to earn a spot in the last group of the U.S. Open and held his own for most of the final round. He shot a 1-over 71 to finish solo 5th, as an early bogey stumbled his momentum. But Pavon put on a ball-striking and putting clinic all week at Pinehurst No. 2, a sign that his game is trending in the right direction.\n\nHe knows what it takes to win, too, having won at the Farmers Insurance Open earlier this year. As such, we like Pavon to post another top-10 at +800 in Connecticut. His game seems to come in waves, and he's riding high right now.\n\nAs for a longshot winner, we like South African Christiaan Bezuidenhout to get the job done at +7500. Bezuidenhout could not get any momentum going at the U.S. Open, finishing in a tie for 32nd at 7-over for the week. But he played consistent golf and did not blow up on any day, carding three 71s and a 72 on the par-70 layout. Nevertheless, Bezuidenhout is a terrific putter, ranking 11th on the PGA Tour in strokes gained putting. He is an above-average ball striker too.\n\nThe South African is not a bomber, either, an attribute not needed on this 6,852-yard layout, the shortest course on tour this season. Instead, he relies on his ball-striking and his short game to get the job done.\n\nFor all other sports betting content, check out SB Nation's DraftKings site.\n\nAlso stay tuned for SB Nation's staff

That includes Scottie Scheffler. The reigning Masters champion struggled all weekend during the U.S. Open, finishing tied for 41st place, 14 strokes back of the leader.\n\nThe field has opened up a little bit thanks to Rory McIlroy withdrawing from the Travelers, as well as the sport in general until close to The Open Championship. Xander Schauffele and Collin Morikawa are expected to be hanging near the top of the leaderboard, while Ludvig Aberg, who tailed off on Sunday at Pinehurst, is hoping he can shake things off and make a good run in Cromwell. Schauffele won the Travelers in 2022.\n\nLike he was last year, Keegan Bradley is a longshot to win the tournament. However, that did not stop him from shooting 23-under in 2023, setting a tournament record score. He looks to become just the second player to have won the tournament in consecutive years since Phil Mickelson accomplished the feat in 2001 and 2002.", "source": {"uri": "mlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mlive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_kuehl@mlive.com", "name": "Tyler Kuehl", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boomerang/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boomerang/Competitions", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/L24UPR3B2RCPHC6OSNAFFBBFEE.jpg?auth=9105e4109995ab01df6ea515d616ed57aaf51c69e1a9929fbe48aeebde9ec0f8&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5764705882352941, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Instead of McIlroy's fifth major championship -- and his first in 10 years -- Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up.\" He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the next week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nPeople are also reading...

McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we're going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I'm looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"\n\nEnemy territory\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley's Boston Celtics beat Scheffler's Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher on Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, \"Do I have to answer that question?\" Scheffler said he hasn't heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n\"I don't blame him,\" Bradley said. \"I wouldn't want to either if I was a Dallas fan.\"\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway's wooden seats at the tournament's media day in April.\n\n\"It's one of the coolest gifts I've ever gotten -- probably the coolest gift I've ever gotten in my life,\" he said. \"To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.\"\n\nParis preview\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n\"There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,\" said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. \"Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they're going to do you all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it's our event, it's our own individual event.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean there's no patriotism involved.\n\n\"I'm not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,\" said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn't really thought about it. \"We're trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.\"\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years. It returned in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, making this the third go-round.\n\nScheffler said he is excited to be a part of the Summer Games and check out other sports, including basketball and tennis. He also wanted to make a trip to the Olympic Village to watch the other athletes train.\n\n\"I grew up playing a ton of sports, and so to be able to see the best in the world at their craft would be pretty special,\" he said.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its

Instead of McIlroy's fifth major championship -- and his first in 10 years -- Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up.\" He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the next week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nPizza Hut restaurants abruptly close across Northwest Indiana after franchisee is accused of defaulting on payments Family of Crown Point ironworker sues after 100-floot plunge at University of Chicago Hospital, faced with 'life-altering, catastrophic injuries' NWI Business Ins and Outs: True BBQ closed; Birdie's Diner, Next Door at Birdie's, Broad Street Tavern, Whihala Ice Cream, Lenny's Coal-Fired Pizza and Beauty and the Bronze opening Overnight closures of Northwest Indiana's Pizza Huts were years in the making, court records show Downtown, racetrack, Kennedy Avenue projects moving ahead in Schererville Chick-fil-A planning to come to Michigan City Downtown Valparaiso has been named a quiet zone Lake Central outlasts Mooresville to win second state title East Chicago man dies in motor vehicle accident Wednesday, coroner's office says Past president of Sin City Deciples sentenced to 17 years, officials say Second person dies in wake of alleged OWI crash; charge enhanced, records show Franciscan Health building a $185.5 million, five-story hospital addition in Munster More than 200 workers out of work at 15 shuttered Pizza Hut restaurants as chain, franchisee fight in court Pedestrian struck in fatal crash identified by coroner Man dead after being burned Monday in garage fire, officials say\n\nWithout him, there will be 71 players teeing off on Thursday in the limited field, no-cut signature event at the TPC River Highlands. McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we're going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I'm looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"\n\nEnemy territory\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley's Boston Celtics beat Scheffler's Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher on Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, \"Do I have to answer that question?\" Scheffler said he hasn't heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n\"I don't blame him,\" Bradley said. \"I wouldn't want to either if I was a Dallas fan.\"\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway's wooden seats at the tournament's media day in April.\n\n\"It's one of the coolest gifts I've ever gotten -- probably the coolest gift I've ever gotten in my life,\" he said. \"To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.\"\n\nParis preview\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n\"There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,\" said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. \"Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they're going to do you all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it's our event, it's our own individual event.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean there's no patriotism involved.\n\n\"I'm not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,\" said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn't really thought about it. \"We're trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.\"\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years. It returned in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, making this the third go-round.\n\nScheffler said he is excited to be a part of the Summer Games and check out other sports, including basketball and tennis. He also wanted to make a trip to the Olympic Village to watch the other athletes train.\n\n\"I grew up playing a ton of sports, and so to be able to see the best in the world at their craft would be pretty special,\" he said.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree

(AP) - Scottie Scheffler and Tom Kim gorged themselves on pizza to get their shared birthday celebration out of the way before turning their focus to golf this week.\n\nWhen they tee it up on the big day, they\u00b4ll be fighting for the lead at the Travelers Championship.\n\nKim shot an 8-under-par 62 on Thursday in the first round at the TPC River Highlands, good for a two-stroke lead in the final limited field, no-cut signature event on this year's PGA Tour schedule. Scheffler, the world\u00b4s No. 1 player, was tied for sixth, three shots back.\n\nKim will turn 22 on Friday, and Scheffler is exactly six years older. The Dallas-area residents marked the occasion in advance by heading about 30 miles south to Sally\u00b4s - a New Haven institution.\n\n\"I had a lot of pizza,\" Kim said. \"I wouldn\u00b4t do that in a tournament, but it\u00b4s my birthday and it\u00b4s kind of a tradition. Me, Scottie, we have the same birthday, so we had an early birthday celebration.\"\n\nKim birdied the last two holes to separate himself from the four players tied at minus-6 on the 6,835-yard, par-70 course: Rickie Fowler, Akshay Bhatia, Kurt Kitayama and Will Zalatoris.\n\nTom Kim, of South Korea, lines up a shot on the 15th hole during the first round of the Travelers Championship golf tournament at TPC River Highlands, Thursday, June 20, 2024, in Cromwell, Conn. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\nScheffler was among seven players at 5 under, looking again like the best player in the world a week after finishing tied for 41st at Pinehurst No. 2 - his worst performance of the year. Wyndham Clark, who tied for 56th in his U.S. Open defense, was another shot back at 4 under.\n\nScheffler has five wins already this year and has only missed the top ten twice - including last week, when he posted his worst finish in nine majors since he missed the cut at the 2022 PGA Championship.\n\n\"Definitely feel like I\u00b4m swinging a lot better than I did last week,\" he said. \"It\u00b4s nice to get here on some familiar surfaces and hit some good putts and see some balls go in.\"\n\nKim was even par and tied for ninth through 54 holes at Pinehurst before closing with a 76 to finish tied for 26th. On Thursday, with temperatures in the mid-90s and little wind, he had five birdies on the back nine of a bogey-free round.\n\n\"Obviously a tough day on Sunday, but it wasn't like I was playing terrible,\" he said. \"It wasn\u00b4t a bad week, but a bad round cost me the week. ... That gives me confidence to go out and that actually I am playing well and just trying to keep riding this momentum.\"\n\nKim's slump lasted for a single round. Scheffler\u00b4s could be over after one week. Fowler is hoping to snap out of a season-long skid.\n\nThe six-time winner on the PGA Tour has just one top-25 finish this year and none in the top 10. But he can console himself with the knowledge that things aren\u00b4t as bad as they were during a four-year winless drought that ended last year in Detroit.\n\n\"I try not to go back to those times too much,\" Fowler said. \"Definitely not anywhere as bad as it was a few years back, but some similarities there. Having been through that and dealt with that and ultimately coming back to playing well, I can deal with just about anything.\"\n\nFowler saved par after hitting his drive into the rough on the first hole, and he thinks that might have been the kick-start he needed. He followed that up with back-to-back birdies in a bogey-free round.\n\n\"Sometimes I would almost rather (do) that than birdie the first hole, because then it\u00b4s kind of downhill from there,\" he said. \"So, yeah, got off to a nice start. Started to see some balls go in, and making putts kind of frees up the rest of the game to where you don\u00b4t feel like you have to be perfect.\"\n\nZalatoris birdied five of the first six holes on the back nine - and eight in 10 holes making the turn - to make a brief appearance at 7 under. He bogeyed the 157-yard, par-3 16th, flying the green on his tee shot and then two-putting from 55 feet.\n\nWith an 8-footer for birdie and sole possession of the lead on No. 18, Zalatoris pushed it wide right.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\nTom Kim, of South Korea, walks the green on the second hole during the first round of the Travelers Championship golf tournament at TPC River Highlands, Thursday, June 20, 2024, in Cromwell, Conn.

This year's Travelers Championship marks the eighth and final Signature Event of the 2024 season.\n\n\"This event will be a Signature Event in 2025,\" Monahan said. \"This is the 18th year with Travelers, and we have an agreement; they're in a 10-year agreement through 2030.\"\n\nTravelers first sponsored this tournament in 2007, when Hunter Mahan won his first event on the PGA Tour. Since then, it has become a fan favorite among tour pros, who cite the golf course and hospitality as reasons why.\n\n\"It's good to be back. I feel like this is always a fun tournament to come play,\" said World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler on Wednesday.\n\n\"The community really rallies around the tournament. The fans are always tremendous. The golf course is typically always in great shape. The clubhouse. The way the tournament treats us as players is always tremendous. So it's a very easy, fun week for us to come play, and glad to be back here.\"\n\nCaddies even receive courtesy cars this week, a rarity on the PGA Tour. But that's not all. The top players on the PGA Tour receive plenty of other amenities.\n\n\"They do such an amazing job for us, our caddies, and our support team,\" added Xander Schauffele.\n\n\"If you look at the range, it's got the little umbrellas, we have a coffee stand, a lounging area, there's the green truck there with the pizza. So it's such a relaxing week coming after the U.S. Open and I think all of us really appreciate that.\"\n\nWith this in mind, the Signature Event model -- new for 2024 -- has drawn plenty of criticism. In March, Lucas Glover called these tournaments a \"money grab,\" adding that he \"doesn't like the idea at all.\"\n\n\"Why do the signature events have [a maximum of] 80 players, and only 50 make the cut? Our biggest signature event next week is 144 players with a full cut. The signature event,\" Glover said in March, referencing The Players Championship.\n\n\"I just don't see what was so bad out here that we had to do all this. Let's raise some purses to make sure we keep some guys around, but now we've eliminated a lot of playing opportunities for some really good players.\"\n\nMonahan recognizes this too, as many players, such as Min Woo Lee, who has had a strong 2024 season, did not qualify for the Travelers this week, even though Rory McIlroy withdrew.\n\n\"Nothing's perfect, nothing ever is, but when you look at where we are today and as we shared with our board [on Tuesday], we feel like we're delivering to our fans exactly what we set out to do, and that is to get our top players competing together more often, and to create the most competitive schedule we can possibly create,\" Monahan said about the Signature Events.\n\n\"When you look at our full-field events, and you look at the strength of the field, whether it's top 50 or top 125, our strength of the field at full-field events is up 35 percent.\"\n\nThe Signature Events have undoubtedly provided opportunities for the best players to compete against one another. Look no further than who has won the seven Signature Events this season: Scheffler has won three. Wyndham Clark triumphed at Pebble Beach with a record-breaking 60. Hideki Matsuyama shot 61 at Riviera to come from behind and steal the Genesis Invitational, and then Rory McIlroy won the Wells Fargo Championship. Chris Kirk also won The Sentry, the first tournament of the year. That's a pretty strong whos-who of the PGA Tour.\n\nPlus, these wins came against very strong fields. The top 50 players from last year's FedEx Cup standings gained entry into each of these tournaments in 2024. Then, the PGA Tour established the Aon Next 10 and Aon Swing 5 to help round out these limited-field events. Whoever wins an event on the PGA Tour in 2024 also gains entry, while each tournament has sponsor exemptions they use to round out the field. Those exemptions have been greatly scrutinized, as PGA Tour Policy Board members seem to take a fair share of those. Look no further than Webb Simpson, who again received an exemption to play this week.\n\nNevertheless, this tournament always delivers. Players typically go low on this golf course, as TPC River Highlands, the shortest course on tour, yields plenty of birdies. It also produces great drama, as the tournament has had six playoffs since 2007. One stroke has decided the result six other times, too.\n\nSo, considering all of this, it makes sense for the tour to make the Travelers Championship a Signature Event in 2025, despite some of the criticism the overall model has received.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Glover", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Glover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Mahan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Mahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Woo_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Min Woo Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Kirk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Kirk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Golf_Links", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Golf Links"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riviera_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riviera Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8TrUTbZyNQsxR6JZUqMrkzKclEU=/0x702:6846x4125/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25498051/1404491750.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Instead of McIlroy's fifth major championship -- and his first in 10 years -- Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up.\" He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the next week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nInvestigator tracked Kim Gardner to health clinic as St. Louis prosecutor's office crashed Here are 13 must-visit restaurants in the St. Louis area from Ian Froeb's newsletter New Channel 32?

McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we're going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I'm looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"\n\nEnemy territory\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley's Boston Celtics beat Scheffler's Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher on Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, \"Do I have to answer that question?\" Scheffler said he hasn't heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n\"I don't blame him,\" Bradley said. \"I wouldn't want to either if I was a Dallas fan.\"\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway's wooden seats at the tournament's media day in April.\n\n\"It's one of the coolest gifts I've ever gotten -- probably the coolest gift I've ever gotten in my life,\" he said. \"To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.\"\n\nParis preview\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n\"There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,\" said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. \"Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they're going to do you all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it's our event, it's our own individual event.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean there's no patriotism involved.\n\n\"I'm not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,\" said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn't really thought about it. \"We're trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.\"\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years. It returned in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, making this the third go-round.\n\nScheffler said he is excited to be a part of the Summer Games and check out other sports, including basketball and tennis. He also wanted to make a trip to the Olympic Village to watch the other athletes train.\n\n\"I grew up playing a ton of sports, and so to be able to see the best in the world at their craft would be pretty special,\" he said.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to

Find out why in our Travelers Championship picks and predictions below.\n\nThe PGA Tour doesn't skip a beat, and we've got another star-studded field for the Travelers Championship at TPC River Highlands. It's the eighth and final signature event of the season, with World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler once again the betting favorite in the Travelers Championship odds.\n\nXander Schauffele, Rory McIlroy, Collin Morikawa, and Ludvig Aberg form a secondary tier of favorites. I break down my favorite plays in our free golf picks for the week below.\n\nPick to win: Viktor Hovland to win outright (+2,200 at FanDuel)\n\nAn opening-round 78 did Viktor Hovland in last week at the U.S. Open, but he rebounded in Round 2 with a 68 while ranking second in true strokes gained approach and 10th from tee to green. His work-around remains a weakness, but the rest of his game remains elite. He's also made the cut in this event in each of his three trips and topped out with a T11 finish in 2020.\n\nHe's also gained true strokes off-the-tee and on approach in four consecutive events to respectively rank second and fifth in the metrics in this field leading into the Travelers, and I'm expecting his elite tee and iron game to give him oodles of birdie looks this week. I also think we're landing a slightly longer price than we should be simply because of one poor round at a course that isn't the best fit for his game.\n\nSleeper pick: Tony Finau to win outright (+4,000 at FanDuel)\n\nTony Finau can overpower this track and he's rolled off four consecutive Top-20 finishes, including a statement T3 showing at the U.S. Open where he paced the field in true strokes gained on approach and was second in true strokes gained tee-to-green. The strong ball-striking is nothing new, either. Finau ranks fifth and seventh in this field in the respective metrics across his past 16 events.\n\nIt's particularly encouraging that he's gained true strokes on the greens in each of his past two events and he's also fired in the 60s in eight of his past nine rounds at TPC River Highlands. Along with an outright play, I'm eyeing Tony in the Top-20 market, with Caesars offering the best available number at +126.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Pick_Two", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Pick Two", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Highland_Games", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Highland Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/a0e6929b-f669-4504-b2f7-f930811673e3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Much like Valhalla, we received an epic ending between Bryson DeChambeau and Rory McIlroy, two titans of the game.\n\nThe result caused Rory to withdraw from the Travelers Championship, while the champion has been on a media tour worthy of a historic major championship winner. Whether you like back, to back, to back elite tournaments or not, we have one more signature event this season and it takes place at TPC River Highlands.\n\nIn the northeast, we call it the Greater Hartford Open or the GHO! One of the few older small market PGA TOUR events that has evolved and remained on the modern-day schedule. A credit to Travelers for their treatment of the players, media, volunteers, and fans, they built a truly signature week and have been rewarded for their efforts.\n\nWith Rory's withdrawal, we now have 71 players in Cromwell, Connecticut competing for $20 million and a first-place check of $4 million. There is no cut this week, so even if players are feeling a little fatigue on Thursday, I believe the best will be in contention come Sunday.\n\nThis preview is just that: a preview. For a complete list of my betting predictions covering the Travelers Championship winners, placements, and H2H matchups, please go to Read The Line and subscribe.\n\nIt has to be \"The Kid\" this week. I remember covering the RSM Classic back in November. Following a successful run on the winning European Ryder Cup team, Ludvig \u00c5berg closed out the final 36 holes at Sea Island with a 122 total (61-61). \u00c5berg did it with his driver, wedge, and putter. That's exactly what he will need to go low at TPC River Highlands.\n\nAn incredible iron player from all distances, Ludvig's wedge game is top 5 in the field. His age will be enough to combat any fatigue from two long weeks leading up. In his last five starts, \u00c5berg is gaining eight(!) shots on the field (on average). The form, his skill set, and a tired field are all a perfect match for youth to be served at the Travelers.\n\nBe careful modeling certain players this week. JT Poston has six starts at the Travelers with five missed cuts. The usually-reliable short-course killer does not have a good history here.\n\nChristiaan Bezuidenhout is gaining an average of five strokes total on the field over his last five tournaments. His iron play and putter have led the way on this run. Those two skills are the perfect complement for a contending week in Connecticut.\n\nTom Kim is making a serious name for himself in big events. Kim has finished top 30 in all three majors this season. Those performances have boosted his confidence in the signature series as well.\n\nTom is incredibly accurate OTT and on approach. Those two skills will create plenty of birdie chances over four rounds. Kim has gained on the greens five times in his last eight starts so the putter will help him convert those scoring chances. In our last signature start, look for Kim to contend again in an elite field.\n\nOdds (shorter than +10000) courtesy of BetMGM.\n\nThe last 10 winners of the Travelers have shared some very specific traits. The first falls under the strokes gained par 4 category. Those 10 Travelers champs have gained an average of 11 strokes on the field the year that they won in par 4 scoring. With 12 par 4s, or 48 over four days this is a considerable advantage. To dive in further, the 400-450 yard par 4 range was the length bucket where they gained the most strokes. Believe it or not, a 425-yard par 4 is a medium sized birdie hole. The players who routinely score in this range have a huge advantage this week.\n\nThe second skill I have my eyes on is putting. Eight of the last 10 winners have gained over three strokes against the field en route to winning. Pete Dye's design allows you to make putts. The challenge comes more in just getting there. Some greens do have sections, shelves, and specific plateaus, but overall, the approaches are coming in from so close most will be putting from inside 25'. The winners average 22 sub-par scores; to get there a player must hit 30+ approaches in birdie range. Of course, approach play is just one part of the test, converting them is what leads you to the winner's circle.\n\nTPC River Highlands is a proximity contest. Over the last five winners, the approach average is five strokes over the field. We already know they are hitting a wedge, nine, eight iron in. The PGA TOUR's best are great from this range and after the last two long approach weeks, I am certain they welcome an easier challenge. Especially one where the results are far more positive. Don't lose complete sight of long iron play as one par three is over 225 yards and the two par 5s will require accurate long-range approaches.\n\nMissing the fairway carries a heavy price tag on this course. Those design changes I mentioned earlier are only going to make this course characteristic even more problematic. I still think the guys will bomb and gauge, but playing from the fairway will help you separate and score. Comps like Valspar, Sedgefield, Sea Island and others are a race to grabbing as many sub-par scores as possible. The more approaches played from the fairway the better. I like accurate drivers here. Pay attention to the par 3s as well. The leaders gain considerably more on the 3s than the par 5s. Mainly because everyone birdies the par 5s effectively cancelling out most gains. Play the par 3s under par each day and you'll really be ahead of the curve.\n\nI'm looking for fast starters this week. Keegan went out in 125 (62-63) in the first two rounds. On moving day, he carded a 64! Most of the field will be feeling a fatigue factor from Pinehurst. They will start slowly and try to build birdies over four rounds. This course is too easy for that strategy. You must attack early and often. I didn't just look at BoB%. I also considered round one and two scoring averages. In track meets like the Travelers, it is important to take aggressive players. Guys who can go deep repeatedly in the early rounds. Put a large part of the field out of reach and then close come Sunday.\n\nAfter two US Open like weeks at the Memorial and Pinehurst, we don't have to overthink this. The best putters and approach players from around 150 yards will contend. They must be in great form to win a signature event and have shown they can compete in an elite field before. Wrap those skills into a nice player profile and you'll have the basis for this week's best bets!\n\nFor full coverage of the Travelers Championship, subscribe to our Read The Line newsletter (it's free!) and follow us on Twitter!\n\nThe lovely weather from Pinehurst must have been on the next flight up the east coast. The forecast calls for triple-digit heat indexes again this week. Even up here in New England, the highs will be in the mid-90s with very little wind. The breeze won't get over 10 mph, and this walk is far from flat. Two straight weeks of intense heat and pressure will test these guys again both mentally and physically. Humidity and heat also bring along the chance for thunderstorms each afternoon. Should they arrive, the guys will also need a little patience.\n\nWith very little rain in June, the course feels and looks firm and fast through the practice rounds. That should keep the winning score closer to the 10-year average of 17 under par. If you remember, Keegan Bradley won at 23 under par a year ago. That course was drenched and the TPC test was more scoring than anything else. Those same 10 winners averaged +5100 for their pre-tournament odds. Tournament officials have also studied the data and felt a need to counter Rory's comment from a year ago that the course was \"obsolete.\" A couple of the landing areas have been reduced and obstacles have been added to the rough along both par 5s. Overall the changes are nice, but I do NOT believe that will deter these guys from bombing away.\n\nThis golf course is a par 70 layout covering 6,835 yards. That's 753 yards less than Pinehurst #2 a week ago. There is literally nothing you can do to stop these men from scoring here. If it remains firm and fast, then it's possible to keep in under 20, but overall, I would rather see the TOUR embrace the scoring and give us a Valhalla like finish. Three of the last 10 events have ended in a playoff. Just like last week, the par 70 scorecard makes a huge difference. Certain players are just better at scoring without those two extra par 5s. As you look into the best strokes gained players at TPCRH, also consider other par 70 venues and their results. A comp doesn't always have to be a course! Top par 70 scorers in the field: Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, Collin Morikawa, Justin Thomas, Matt Fitzpatrick, Viktor Hovland, Tony Finau, Hideki Matsuyama, and Patrick Cantlay.\n\nMany of those names make perfect sense. Considering the competitive course history, this is one of those weeks where fit and recent form are the two keys you need to build a competitive card. Ten of the 12 par 4s are under 450 yards. Again, this is a 6,800 yard course. I'll explain the skill set more in the outrights preview, but 69 bunkers and five holes where water comes into play won't slow anyone down. Forty-five percent of the approach shots are hit between 125-175 yards. That's a scoring club for this field and proximity really matters when creating real birdie chances.\n\nThe course has 12 holes where the birdie rate is over 15 percent. In contrast, only seven holes have a bogey rate over that value. Greens averaging 5,000 sq/ft are small targets, but these guys are coming in from close range. I'm going to enjoy our last signature event of the season. I don't care for the small field or no cut feature, but the last two have been really good on Sunday. Much like Rory, after this week we won't see these guys together again until Scotland. Enjoy the show and if you are with me in Connecticut... drink some water!", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The South Korean has five top-10 finishes and four of those saw him land inside the top-5. An's performance at Pinehurst has caused him to fly under the radar a bit, but that's good news for value-hunters who are looking to buy low on a player that has been consistent through the first six months of the season. An posted back-to-back top-5 finishes at the CJ Cup (which is also a TPC course) and the Wells Fargo in May, so he's not that far removed from playing some terrific stuff.\n\nYou'll hear a lot about course history this week and while Shane Lowry has only played this track three times, he did post a top-20 last year. The Irishman may not be having a standout season in terms of big wins (although he won the team event with Rory McIlroy), but he's got three top-10 finishes and is coming off a top-20 at Pinehurst.

Instead of McIlroy's fifth major championship -- and his first in 10 years -- Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up.\" He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the next week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nPeople are also reading...

McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we're going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I'm looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"\n\nEnemy territory\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley's Boston Celtics beat Scheffler's Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher on Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, \"Do I have to answer that question?\" Scheffler said he hasn't heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n\"I don't blame him,\" Bradley said. \"I wouldn't want to either if I was a Dallas fan.\"\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway's wooden seats at the tournament's media day in April.\n\n\"It's one of the coolest gifts I've ever gotten -- probably the coolest gift I've ever gotten in my life,\" he said. \"To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.\"\n\nParis preview\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n\"There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,\" said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. \"Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they're going to do you all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it's our event, it's our own individual event.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean there's no patriotism involved.\n\n\"I'm not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,\" said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn't really thought about it. \"We're trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.\"\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years. It returned in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, making this the third go-round.\n\nScheffler said he is excited to be a part of the Summer Games and check out other sports, including basketball and tennis. He also wanted to make a trip to the Olympic Village to watch the other athletes train.\n\n\"I grew up playing a ton of sports, and so to be able to see the best in the world at their craft would be pretty special,\" he said.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its

His addition to (Viktor) Hovland and (Xander) Schauffele, I thought it was a great finish. If we are trying to make the game younger, I do agree with some of the LIV players, they're reaching out doing more stuff on social media. That's imperative, and that's been a weakness of a lot of the players under the umbrella of the Tiger Woods era.\"\n\nBryson DeChambeau wins another U.S. Open with a clutch finish to deny Rory McIlroy\n\nThe New Zealand-born Nobilo, 64, won 14 tournaments around the world during his playing days, and had at least one top-10 finish at all four majors. He has been working in TV since 2003, joining CBS' team in 2015.\n\nTiger Woods in his heyday, Nobilo says, \"did a lot of the heavy lifting\" in promoting and growing golf's popularity. Now, the game needs more of that, which is where DeChambeau, now two-time U.S. Open champ, could help if and when he can get back on The Tour.\n\n\"From a TV point of view, Tiger was always the go-to guy because people couldn't get enough Tiger Woods,\" Nobilo said. \"But people made a lot of money in the game because of what Tiger brought to the table. We can't replicate Tiger Woods, but with a handful of players doing the right things we can put the game in a positive direction. I was very impressed with Bryson. The way he interacted with fans all week, he made himself accessible. There's a quirkiness people can relate to, but he is also an amazing athlete. He's different, and we need different.\"\n\nThe PGA and LIV reached the framework of an agreement on the eve of the Travelers last year, and recently met to try to finish off an arrangement that could end the PGA suspensions of golfers who jumped to LIV for mega-millions. The week of the U.S. Open is a time to keep the focus on golf, but perhaps some news on this front is coming soon.\n\nDom Amore: Travelers Champ Keegan Bradley thriving through pro golf's turmoil\n\n\"Hopefully we hear something this week that's very positive for the game, because people that watch deserve that,\" Nobilo said. \"It can't happen soon enough.\"\n\nIn the midst of the conflict within the sport, the PGA made changes to help keep its headliners on tour and those changes have had major impact on the Travelers, which was an \"elevated\" event in 2023 and now has long-term status as one of eight Signature Events. The larger purse ($20 million, $3.6 million to the winner) and larger allotment of FedEx points drew nearly all of the top-ranked players, at least, among those not tied to LIV Golf.\n\nSo this year neither DeChambeau (10th) nor other LIV golfers will be among those in star-studded field of 72 golfers, a field that could yet grow with sponsors' exemptions. The Travelers, the last of the Signature Events for 2024, is one of those with a no-cut format, all the golfers will be playing all four days, June 20-23, and it's an impressive list that will be at the TPC River Highlands.\n\n\"You're trying to get as many good players together in one spot and (The Travelers) has achieved that, if that's the goal,\" Nobilo said. \"For the sponsors involved, it really does pad their event nicely. Travelers has been involved in golf a long time, they've been a great sponsor for the PGA Tour and they deserve an excellent field. Personally, I prefer the (events with cuts) a little, because I am pro-cut. If I have any criticism, I wish they extended them another 20 players. If you increase field size and had a cut I think you would serve a lot more masters. I know there is always an argument that if I bought a ticket and I want to see, for example, Rory McIlroy, and he misses the cut, I don't see him. Well, that is sport.\"\n\nTravelers Championship announces another star-studded player field for 2024\n\nAs all these things are talked and ironed out, there will obviously be the most competitive field ever assembled at the Hartford-area's tournament, which has been played since 1952. The top three players in the world rankings, Scottie Scheffler, Schauffele and McIlroy who lost his lead to DeChambeau on Sunday at the U.S. Open are all signed up.\n\n\"You're looking for a hot hand someone who is going to run the tables,\" Nobilo said. \"One of the first questions is going to be how does Rory bounce back? And Scottie, for the first time all season, has had four consecutive rounds over par, which seems like an aberration. I think (Collin) Morikawa would be an excellent fit, he has done everything but win this year. I'm a little partial to Viktor Hovland, I think the last two weeks should have put him back on track. I think it's a golf course Viktor Hovland can shoot well on. Nick Taylor, it should be a good course for him.\"\n\nTPC River Highlands has undergone some changes since last year, when record-low scores were achieved, including defending champ Keegan Bradley at 23-under.\n\n\"I'm actually looking forward to seeing the changes,\" Nobilo said. \"You can look at a score a lot of different ways. You can say a course is easy, but it's also a credit to the condition of the golf course. Last years, there were only six holes that played over par, and that was a converted par-5. It's a great opportunity, especially after a major championship, because the course is not overly long, you're playing in close to perfect temperature in Cromwell, Conn., this time of year, so it's a great respite. The course doesn't beat you up, but it certainly rewards good play. I know I enjoyed playing there in my day. The variety of winners you've had there, it's a lot of different styles of play and that's always the sign of a good venue.\"\n\nDom Amore: With cool precision, Xander Schauffele strives for the top of PGA world at The Travelers\n\nThe first two rounds will be covered by The Golf Channel, with CBS taking over Saturday and Sunday. Jim Nantz will host for CBS' telecasts, with Trevor Immelman the lead analyst, Nobilo and Ian Baker-Finch the hole announcers, Dottie Pepper, Colt Knost and Mark Immelman the on-course reporters and Amanda Balionis general reporter.\n\n\"When they fill the natural amphitheaters around some of these holes, it generates a buzz,\" Nobilo said. \"... \"Visually, we try to make sure it's a beautiful watch as well as voices, if we can make it a comfortable listen, get that blend together.\"", "source": {"uri": "courant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hartfort Courant"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The event is being held at TPC Rivers Highland. Will Scottie Scheffler capture the title this week as the betting favorite, or is the value elsewhere? Check out our Travelers predictions below.\n\nOn the Outright Winner betting market, Scottie Scheffler is considered the favorite with +360 odds to win the event. Followed by Xander Schauffele sitting with odds of +750, and Colin Morikawa currently listed at +1200.\n\nIt's a matter of time before Morikawa wins this season and I am going to keep backing him until that time comes. This course should favor Morikawa as it is a shorter golf course and iron play will crucial for scoring. Morikawa has always been a great iron player and I expect him to have plenty of great birdie opportunities this week. This feels like the week he breaks through for his first win of the 2024 season.\n\nAfter a strong week at the U.S. Open last week, I think Cantlay plays well again this week. After a disappointing season thus far, Cantlay looked like he finally found his form and had every chance to win at Pinehurst. Although he didn't capture his first major, he should have plenty of confidence in his game and with his prior success at TPC Highlands I fully anticipate him being on the top page of the leaderboard once again come Sunday.\n\nFor our final selection, we'll back the defending champion to defend his title. With how Bradley has been playing this season 50/1 seems a little bit high at a course that he loves to play. Bradley can make birdies in bunches and that's what it takes to win this event.

Five of the last 13 editions of the Travelers Championship have been settled in a playoff. If you want to bet on that happening again, the odds are roughly 4-1.\n\nTPC River Highlands is a short, Pete Dye design. It is a par 70 that plays less than 6,900 yards. The crowds are a big part of the draw here and that is part of the reason that the PGA Tour is making this an elevated event for the second straight season. Scoring will be easier than what we've seen the past two weeks. The average winning score over the last five seasons is better than 18-under par.\n\nFor that reason, I looked at Birdies or Better this week, along with Strokes Gained: Approach, Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, and Par 4 Scoring. I also looked at Strokes Gained: Total on Dye designs and shorter golf courses as well.\n\nCourses that match in layout and style for me this week are Sedgefield (Wyndham Championship), East Lake (Tour Championship), TPC Sawgrass, TPC Deere Run, and TPC Southwind.\n\nWe have a smaller field this week with the Signature Event-status and McIlroy's withdrawal, leaving 71 players in the mix. With that, I found four selections this week that I like for both an outright win and a top-20 finish.\n\nFleetwood managed to cash a top-20 finish for us last week at Pinehurst, in large part because of his excellent finishing round on Sunday, firing one of the lower rounds of the day at 68. I like playing on players the following week that finish in a flurry as Fleetwood did. As I did last week, I also feel TPC River Highlands makes a lot of sense for the man who is very accurate off the tee and can rack up birdies as an excellent putter. Over the last 24 rounds, Fleetwood ranks 12th in this field, on average, for par-4s ranging in 300-450 yards. While the spotlight was on the Englishman last week to possibly win for the first time in the United States, maybe it happens this week with the shine of the event throttled down a bit.\n\nAnother player that comes in off an excellent week last week. Conners was incredibly steady at Pinehurst, shooting rounds of 69-70-71-70, good enough for a top-10 finish, his second in the last three weeks. He is money in the stats this week, most notably ranking third for SG: Approach and fourth for Birdies or Better over the last 24 rounds, along with eighth in Hole Proximity from 150-175 yards. It is always about the putter for Conners but he feels like a very hot player right now and the timing could be right -- with a pretty juicy price to boot.\n\nThis is another guy that makes my card this week that felt like a very sexy pick last week. But while nobody else is looking, I like sneaking him in here. His fit for this type of course or why he was a good play last week hasn't changed. Simply the perception and amount of attention has. He's finished top-8 in three of his last five starts. He is 15th in the field this week for SG: Off the Tee, 11th in SG: Approach, ninth on the par-4s measuring 300-350 yards, third on the 400-450 yard par-4s, and sixth in Hole Proximity from 150-175 yards. He also won at one of our correlated courses, TPC Deere Run, and was runner-up at TPC Southwind.\n\nKim fell off a bit last week in the final round, shooting a 76 on Sunday but prior to that recorded rounds of 71-68-71. This tells me the form is still very strong for a guy that hasn't missed a cut in over two months. Kim can rack up the birdies, ranking eighth in this field for Birdies or Better over the last 24 rounds. He's also very accurate off the tee and sits 10th on average in this field on par-4s measuring anywhere from 300-450 yards. Kim also ranks third in this field for Hole Proximity from 125-150 yards -- and one of his three wins on Tour came at Sedgefield CC at the Wyndham Championship.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Dye", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pete Dye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cromwell, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Deere_Run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TPC Deere Run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tour Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedgefield_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Southwind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TPC Southwind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Lake_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Lake Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_at_Sawgrass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TPC at Sawgrass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Reviews", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/f2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- No hard feelings, Rory.\n\nPGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said he understands why Rory McIlroy withdrew from the Travelers Championship -- the final signature event on the calendar -- to recover from a late-Sunday meltdown at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"Sometimes you just need to focus on what you need,\" Monahan said on Wednesday, a day before the tournament at TPC River Highlands outside of Hartford. \"And that's what he's doing and that's exactly what he should be doing because that's what he thinks is the right path.\"\n\nMcIlroy twice had a one-shot lead at Pinehurst No. 2 before he bogeyed three of the last four holes, missing a pair of par putts from inside 4 feet. Instead of McIlroy's fifth major championship -- and his first in 10 years -- Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to \"build myself back up.\" He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the following week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nWithout him, there will be 71 players teeing off on Thursday in the limited field, no-cut signature event at the TPC River Highlands. McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n\"You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we're going to have a great Travelers Championship,\" Monahan said. \"And I'm looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.\"\n\nEnemy territory\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley's Boston Celtics beat Scheffler's Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher on Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, \"Do I have to answer that question?\" Scheffler said he hasn't heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n\"I don't blame him,\" Bradley said. \"I wouldn't want to either if I was a Dallas fan.\"\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway's wooden seats at the tournament's media day in April.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Tractor Supply could be coming to Aiken's Northside Memorial to be held at Florida beach for Jamilla Smith; family starts GoFundMe page Voting begins for Aiken's Choice 2024 awards Aiken man wanted in connection to Graniteville shooting Deadline to apply for 2025 Masters Tournament tickets is near Olympic eventing team members to compete at Stable View in Summer Horse Trials Aiken County Council still 'working on the details' of deal to sell old Aiken County Hospital Jackson man indicted, arrested on charges of producing child sexual abuse material Alabama man killed in Aiken County semitruck crash Voting is open for Aiken's Choice 2024\n\n\"It's one of the coolest gifts I've ever gotten -- probably the coolest gift I've ever gotten in my life,\" he said. \"To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.\"\n\nParis preview\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n\"There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,\" said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. \"Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they're going to do you all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it's our event, it's our own individual event.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean there's no patriotism involved.\n\n\"I'm not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,\" said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn't really thought about it. \"We're trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.\"\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years. It returned in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, making this the third go-round.\n\nScheffler said he is excited to be a part of the Summer Games and check out other sports, including basketball and tennis. He also wanted to make a trip to the Olympic Village to watch the other athletes train.\n\n\"I grew up playing a ton of sports, and so to be able to see the best in the world at their craft would be pretty special,\" he said.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news",

This way, you don't have to wait all four days and it makes Thursday's action a little more exciting to watch.\n\nMy pick to be the first round leader this week is someone who finished tied for the lead on Thursday night at least week's U.S. Open. Before I get into it, let's take a look at the odds.\n\nAll odds listed in this article are via BetMGM Sportsbook\n\nBelow are the top 10 odds to be the first round leader:\n\nI'm going to back Patrick Cantlay to be the first round leader for the second straight week after being T1 at the end of Thursday alongside Rory McIlroy at the U.S. Open.\n\nHe didn't hold the lead, but Cantlay's performance at Pinehurst was impressive. After a three-week slump that resulted in finishes of T29, T53 and a missed cut, Cantlay gained strokes in all four major areas leading to a T3 finish. He also finished third in strokes-gained approach on the week, a promising sign heading into the Travelers Championship.\n\nCantlay has had plenty of success at TPC River Highlands through the years.

The model has highlighted several players who provide great value for your bets at TPC River Highlands this week.\n\nScottie Scheffler is a prime candidate for a bet this week at the Travelers Championship. With a win probability of 27.0% compared to the implied probability of 21.74% from his +360 odds, there is a significant edge of 5.26%, indicating strong value. Scheffler has been in exceptional form this year, consistently placing well in tournaments and showcasing his elite skills.\n\nDespite not achieving the desired result at the US Open last week, Scheffler's performance was commendable, and we project a strong bounce back this week. Additionally, Scheffler had a solid showing at the Travelers Championship last year, demonstrating his familiarity with the course and ability to perform under pressure.\n\nGiven his high win probability, consistent form, and strong history at the Travelers Championship, Scottie Scheffler is the best bet this week.\n\nWyndham Clark presents an intriguing betting option for the Travelers Championship. With his win probability of 1.5% lining up perfectly with the +6600 available, it's clear that he presents better value than almost every other player in the field this week.\n\nAlthough not as strong as his last, Clark has had a solid season, highlighted by his impressive victory at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. His ability to secure a win in a highly competitive field demonstrates his potential for another strong showing.\n\nAt last year's Travelers Championship, Clark finished T29, showing he can handle the course. His familiarity with the layout and recent upward trajectory suggest he could outperform his odds.\n\nChristiaan Bezuidenhout is an intriguing sleeper option for the Travelers Championship. With a win probability of 1.5% against his implied odds suggesting a 1.23% chance of victory, there's a slight edge indicating potential value.\n\nBezuidenhout has shown consistent form this season, with three top-10 finishes, including an impressive T4 at the Memorial Tournament two weeks ago. His ability to remain competitive in strong fields demonstrates his potential for a breakthrough win.\n\nWhile his history at the Travelers Championship includes two missed cuts from two starts, Bezuidenhout's current form and recent performances suggest he could overcome past difficulties on this course.\n\nAs the Travelers Championship 2024 approaches, anticipation builds for what promises to be an exceptional showcase of golfing talent at TPC River Highlands. With insights from Dimers and their comprehensive Dimers Pro tool, we've highlighted the players with the highest chances of victory, pointing out value picks and sleeper options that offer potential money-making opportunities. Scottie Scheffler is the most likely winner, ahead of Xander Schauffele and Collin Morikawa, with plenty of value options further down the board, highlighted by the edges on Wyndham Clark and Christiaan Bezuidenhout.\n\nFor those looking to engage with the event through sports betting, the variety of promotions and bonus bets available presents a huge opportunity to enhance the experience this week.

he shows up at the course and plays well.\n\nHe's an accurate driver and one of the best putters on tour.\n\nHis recent iron play has been strong as he's gained more than 10 strokes on approach in his last five events.\n\nWe know he's got that dog in him (he's a Georgia Bulldog and he won the Open Championship last year), so I like his chances if he's in the mix on Sunday.\n\nKim didn't play great during the second half of last year or the first few months of this year.\n\nSince the Masters, however, he's made nine straight cuts with six top-30 finishes.\n\nHe has gained at least two strokes off the tee in four of his last five starts and 10.6 strokes on approach in his last three events combined.\n\nWith his game trending in the right direction, he now gets a course that should suit his game perfectly.\n\nThis is a big number for a golfer who has contended in a lot of big tournaments.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poa_annua", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poa annua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrostis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agrostis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_and_Lady_Bulldogs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs and Lady Bulldogs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Highland_Games", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Highland Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/brian-harman-watches-tee-shot-83935700-e1718756542872.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Take advantage of these offers, with superstars such as Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, and Hideki Matsuyama featured.\n\nThe first boost on offer from Bet365 this week is on Xander Schauffele to be the 1st Round Leader at the Travelers Championship.\n\nSchauffele, who is known for his strong starts in tournaments, provides excellent value with these boosted odds.

The two protagonists from that wild final round, Bryson DeChambeau and Rory McIlroy, won't be teeing it up this week in Connecticut, but the field is still fully loaded. Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and Ludvig \u00c5berg will all be trying to win the final signature event of the PGA Tour season against a stacked field at TPC River Highlands.\n\nThe players teeing it up in Cromwell, Conn., will feel like they are getting a nice reward after battling Pinehurst No. 2 last week. The golf course's length will starkly contrast to Pinehurst No. 2. TPC River Highlands won't even touch 7,000 yards. The native areas to the sides of the fairways will now be bluegrass fescue rough. The bentgrass greens roll true and won't get close to the speeds that the players saw at the U.S. Open.\n\nThe model this week won't rely on driving distance but will instead concentrate on proximity to the fairway, birdie or better percentage, putting on bentgrass greens, strokes gained around the green, and strokes gained on approach. I will include some distance buckets in the wedge- to 8-iron distances. Strokes gained at TPC River Highlands will also factor in, as golfers tend to play well here year after year.\n\nFeatures: TPC River Highlands is a short Par 70 that will see players making birdies in bunches. Jim Furyk set the scoring record here, shooting an incredible 58 in 2016 at 46 years old. The golf course features bentgrass from the tee boxes to the greens and bluegrass fescue for rough. The golf course has some water in play on a few holes, with holes 15 through 17 all playing alongside a lake. Bubba Watson won this tournament three times which may surprise people after you tell them driving distance isn't a big factor in winning here.\n\nPast Champions: Keegan Bradley 2023, Xander Schauffele 2022, Harris English 2021, Dustin Johnson 2020, Chez Reavie 2019, Bubba Watson 2018, Jordan Spieth 2017, Russell Knox 2016, Bubba Watson 2015\n\nLudvig \u00c5berg (+1400) was in contention to win his first major championship at the U.S. Open before a poor performance on Saturday saw him fall back towards the field. He struggled around the green on Saturday, which can happen to anyone at a U.S. Open. \u00c5berg played here last year and finished 24th while driving the ball incredibly well and gaining over three strokes with his putter. He has gained over 5.8 strokes on approach combined over his last two tournaments.\n\nPatrick Cantlay (+2200) came out of nowhere to push Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau all the way to the end at the U.S. Open. Cantlay missed the cut at the Memorial, where he has dominated over the years, the week before the U.S. Open, so he became an afterthought to most. The only lineups I even thought about playing him was when I thought about game theory and his potential low ownership. His T3 at the U.S. Open wasn't a fluke as he gained strokes across the board, including over 10 strokes from tee to green. He has four straight top-13 finishes here, and his odds are decent because of his form before the U.S. Open.\n\nHideki Matsuyama (+2500) has looked healthy after having to withdraw late before the Wells Fargo Championship. He has two straight top eight finishes after gaining over seven strokes combined on approach. He has gained almost 13 strokes combined around the green over his last three tournaments. He finished 13th here last year.\n\nBrian Harman (+4000) has four top-eight finishes at TPC River Highlands in his last five tries. He gained strokes across the board at the U.S. Open. He had gained over 10 strokes on approach combined over his last three tournaments before the Memorial. He has gained strokes around the green in five of his last six tournaments.\n\nCorey Conners (+4000) has gained over 30 strokes ball-striking combined over his last five golf tournaments. He has gained over 6.7 strokes around the green combined over his last two tournaments. He finished T9 here last year, so he has some success under his belt.\n\nTom Kim (+5500) finished T38 here last year on his first trip to TPC River Highlands. He has gained over 4.3 strokes on approach in two out of his last three tournaments. If he didn't struggle on Sunday at the U.S. Open, we would probably be getting him at a shorter number.\n\nScottie Scheffler ($12,500) gained almost seven strokes ball-striking at the U.S. Open and still barely made the cut and finished outside the top 40. His putter took a nose dive after being locked in ever since the Genesis Invitational. He lost over six strokes on the greens, but I don't think that will bleed over to this week. His ownership in GPPs was over 40 percent last week, which is crazy high. I think it will be more toward the 32 percent area this week after his struggles at the U.S. Open.\n\nXander Schauffele ($11,200) won here in 2022 and comes in excellent ball-striking form as he has gained over 7.2 strokes on approach in three out of his last four tournaments. With Rory taking some time off, I expect Xander to attract a lot of attention at this price.\n\nTony Finau ($8,900) striking the ball well is not a surprise. Finau gaining over 1.7 strokes with his putter two weeks in a row is a surprise. Finau has gained over 22 strokes on approach combined over his last four golf tournaments. He finished T13 here in 2022 and is in such good form that you can't ignore him this week.\n\nKeegan Bradley ($8,700) won here last year and came in second in 2019. Growing up in Vermont and Massachusetts, Bradley has the closest thing to a home-court advantage here at TPC River Highlands. I don't like his price this week. It is too high when compared to some other players I want to get in my lineups.\n\nRussell Henley ($8,600) finished the U.S. Open strong, shooting a 67 on Sunday. Henley has gained strokes on approach in five straight tournaments, and he has gained over 11 strokes putting combined over his last two tournaments.\n\nAdam Scott ($7,700) made it into the U.S. Open by the skin of his teeth. He played decently last week and will probably be looking forward to coming to TPC River Highlands, as he has two straight top-19 finishes here. He is struggling with his putter a bit right now, but he has been gaining strokes on approach consistently.\n\nJason Day ($7,400) is priced so low that he popped out when I looked at the value plays. He missed the cut at the U.S. Open, which I can forgive him for. He has lost strokes on approach in nine of his last 10 tournaments, and yet he has a top five in a signature event over that time span. He has two top-10 finishes here in his last five tries. Even though he has been struggling lately, I am going to use him in some GPP lineups.\n\nAkshay Bhatia ($7,200) had his short game locked in at the U.S. Open as he gained over seven strokes in that category. He has been very good off the tee, gaining more than 1.8 strokes off the tee for four straight tournaments. He gained over two strokes on approach at the U.S. Open on Thursday before struggling a bit the rest of the week. He will need to improve that if he is going to push for a top-10 finish this week.\n\nWill Zalatoris ($7,100) is priced so low that I have to take a flier on him in a GPP lineup or two. He is too good not to shake off this current form, and maybe this short course could help him dial it in. He hasn't finished better than 41st since the Masters so I wouldn't put all my eggs in this basket.\n\nS\u00e9amus Power ($6,500) has two top 25s here in his last three trips. He has been alternating hit-or-miss weeks with struggles in every part of his game. The shorter distance here should help him this week.\n\nAdam Svensson ($6,400) is a balky putter away from jumping up the leaderboards. He hasn't missed a cut since The Players Championship, but he only has one top-25 finish in that time frame. If he can somehow figure out his putter, he could surprise this week.\n\nAndrew Putnam ($6,400) is a short-course specialist who has played well here before finishing 13th in 2021. He has gained strokes putting in five of his last six tournaments and he has gained strokes around the green in four out of his last five tournaments.\n\nEach week, we will pick in reverse order of the standings, and we can't duplicate picks in the same week. Reference this spreadsheet tracking who we have used.\n\nStandings\n\nHugh Kellenberger: It's been a really tough stretch. Have to have a big week. I'll go with Collin Morikawa, who shot a 63 a year ago here and has been one of the most consistent players on the PGA Tour this year.\n\nBrody Miller: After a troubling season, it's time to appreciate Sam Burns and the nice run he's on. He's finished top 15 in four of the last five weeks, including a great finish to the week at Pinehurst.\n\nDennis Esser: I've made a huge comeback in our One and Done over the last two weeks thanks to the huge purses at the signature events and the U.S. Open. DeChambeau has me in the lead, and I don't want to cough it up. I went back and forth between taking Harman, \u00c5berg and Cantlay this week. I even flirted with the in-form Finau. In the end, I decided to take Brian Harman, hoping he will continue his fine form at this golf course.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors":

As the cliche goes, \"To the winner go the spoils.\"\n\nHaving won in Kentucky, the 30-year-old Schauffele now knows what it's like to be a major champion. He already knew what it felt like to come up short on golf's biggest stages.\n\nWith an outstanding all-around game, Schauffele has won an Olympic gold medal, a Tour Championship and eight PGA Tour events, and he has consistently been in the mix in major tournaments. But in 27 career previous attempts before winning at Valhalla, Schaufelle earned 12 top-10 finishes, including a tie for second at the 2018 British Open and the 2019 Masters. The San Diego native is very familiar with what it feels like not to win.\n\nSo, after Rory McIlroy experienced a gut-wrenching loss to Bryson DeChambeau on Sunday evening at the U.S. Open, you might think he understands what McIlroy, who withdrew from this week's Travelers Championship, is going through. And he does -- to a point.\n\n\"It's different for everyone. It's hard for me to compare my losses to his losses,\" Schauffele said on Tuesday afternoon at TPC River Highlands. \"He's under a bit more of a microscope. When things are going really well, people are all over him and unfortunately, when things don't go his way people are all over him. So, there's a microscope on him, on why he didn't win and things of that nature, he's going to have to answer those questions at some point. And he will, because he always does.\"\n\nXander Schauffele of the United States putts on the third green during a practice round prior to the U.S. Open at Pinehurst Resort on June 11, 2024 in Pinehurst, North Carolina. (Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images)\n\nA Sunday 68 moved Schauffele into a tie for seventh on Sunday evening at Pinehurst, and after he signed his card, he went back to his rented house and watched the tournament's finish alongside his brother.\n\n\"It was pretty wild,\" Schauffele said. \"As a fan, I'm sure it was a very exciting, and for me it was just a crazy finish, for sure.\"\n\nMcIlroy did not talk with the media after losing on Sunday night. He walked out of the clubhouse with his caddie, Harry Diamond, and his agents, and once his bags were in his car, he quickly drove off. He was criticized for doing so, but listening to Schauffele talk about what Rory must have been feeling at the time, you get the sense that he understands.\n\n\"As a competitor, all of us have had our highs and lows to a certain degree. It's a tough spot. It for sure is a tough spot,\" said Schauffele. \"I'm sure he and his team are discussing what happened, and sometimes you just need to step away from it all and really try and be as objective as possible because you're very much in the moment there. It obviously didn't go his way, and he's just ... he needs some time away to figure out what's going on.\"\n\nWhat is going on for Xander is the continuation of a stretch of high-profile golf. He's here at TPC River Highlands, where he won the Travelers Championship in 2022, to play in the final Signature Even of the season, and he has the Scottish Open, British Open and the Paris Olympics in August looming before the start of the PGA Tour Playoffs and the Presidents Cup in September.\n\nHe could win one or more of those events because his game is so solid and winning breeds confidence, but Schauffele might come up short. It's a risk that anyone who competes has to take, and having experience with losing doesn't take away the sting.\n\n\"I wear 'em pretty hard, but sometimes it's nice to just get back on the horse and compete,\" Schauffele said. \"Like I said, everyone handles those situations differently, and it's those times where you just lean on your team, and everyone around you that supports you that whole time, to give you that confidence to get back on the horse and keep chugging along.\"", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_dusek@golfweek.usatoday.com", "name": "David Dusek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tour Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_River_Highlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TPC River Highlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidents Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://golfweek.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2024/06/Xander-Schauffele.jpeg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659429", "eventUri": "eng-9659429", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-06-", "textStart": 1834, "textEnd": 1841}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

His addition to (Viktor) Hovland and (Xander) Schauffele, I thought it was a great finish. If we are trying to make the game younger, I do agree with some of the LIV players, they're reaching out doing more stuff on social media. That's imperative, and that's been a weakness of a lot of the players under the umbrella of the Tiger Woods era.\"\n\nThe New Zealand-born Nobilo, 64, won 14 tournaments around the world during his playing days, and had at least one top-10 finish at all four majors. He has been working in TV since 2003, joining CBS' team in 2015.\n\nWoods in his heyday, Nobilo says, \"did a lot of the heavy lifting\" in promoting and growing golf's popularity. Now, the game needs more of that, which is where DeChambeau, now two-time U.S. Open champ, could help if and when he can get back on The Tour.\n\n\"From a TV point of view, Tiger was always the go-to guy because people couldn't get enough Tiger Woods,\" Nobilo said. \"But people made a lot of money in the game because of what Tiger brought to the table. We can't replicate Tiger Woods, but with a handful of players doing the right things we can put the game in a positive direction. I was very impressed with Bryson. The way he interacted with fans all week, he made himself accessible. There's a quirkiness people can relate to, but he is also an amazing athlete. He's different, and we need different.\"\n\nThe PGA and LIV reached the framework of an agreement on the eve of the Travelers last year, and recently met to try to finish off an arrangement that could end the PGA suspensions of golfers who jumped to LIV for mega-millions. The week of the U.S. Open is a time to keep the focus on golf, but perhaps some news on this front is coming soon.\n\n\"Hopefully we hear something this week that's very positive for the game, because people that watch deserve that,\" Nobilo said. \"It can't happen soon enough.\"\n\nIn the midst of the conflict within the sport, the PGA made changes to help keep its headliners on tour and those changes have had major impact on the Travelers, which was an \"elevated\" event in 2023 and now has long-term status as one of eight Signature Events. The larger purse ($20 million, $3.6 million to the winner) and larger allotment of FedEx points drew nearly all of the top-ranked players, at least, among those not tied to LIV Golf.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nSo this year neither DeChambeau (10th) nor other LIV golfers will be among those in star-studded field of 72 golfers, a field that could yet grow with sponsors' exemptions. The Travelers, the last of the Signature Events for 2024, is one of those with a no-cut format, all the golfers will be playing all four days, June 20-23, and it's an impressive list that will be at the TPC River Highlands.\n\n\"You're trying to get as many good players together in one spot and (The Travelers) has achieved that, if that's the goal,\" Nobilo said. \"For the sponsors involved, it really does pad their event nicely. Travelers has been involved in golf a long time, they've been a great sponsor for the PGA Tour and they deserve an excellent field. Personally, I prefer the (events with cuts) a little, because I am pro-cut. If I have any criticism, I wish they extended them another 20 players. If you increase field size and had a cut I think you would serve a lot more masters. I know there is always an argument that if I bought a ticket and I want to see, for example, Rory McIlroy, and he misses the cut, I don't see him. Well, that is sport.\"\n\nAs all these things are talked and ironed out, there will obviously be the most competitive field ever assembled at the Hartford-area's tournament, which has been played since 1952. Eight of the top 10 players in the world rankings, including No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, and No. 3 Schauffele, are signed up. McIlroy, ranked No. 2, was scheduled to play but announced he was taking time off from golf after blowing a late lead to DeChambeau at the U.S. Open on Sunday.\n\n\"You're looking for a hot hand someone who is going to run the tables,\" Nobilo said. \"One of the first questions is going to be how does Rory bounce back? And Scottie, for the first time all season, has had four consecutive rounds over par, which seems like an aberration. I think (Collin) Morikawa would be an excellent fit, he has done everything but win this year. I'm a little partial to Viktor Hovland, I think the last two weeks should have put him back on track. I think it's a golf course Viktor Hovland can shoot well on. Nick Taylor, it should be a good course for him.\"\n\nTPC River Highlands has undergone some changes since last year, when record-low scores were achieved, including defending champ Keegan Bradley at 23-under.\n\n\"I'm actually looking forward to seeing the changes,\" Nobilo said. \"You can look at a score a lot of different ways. You can say a course is easy, but it's also a credit to the condition of the golf course. Last years, there were only six holes that played over par, and that was a converted par-5. It's a great opportunity, especially after a major championship, because the course is not overly long, you're playing in close to perfect temperature in Cromwell, Conn., this time of year, so it's a great respite. The course doesn't beat you up, but it certainly rewards good play. I know I enjoyed playing there in my day. The variety of winners you've had there, it's a lot of different styles of play and that's always the sign of a good venue.\"\n\nThe first two rounds will be covered by The Golf Channel, with CBS taking over Saturday and Sunday. Jim Nantz will host for CBS' telecasts, with Trevor Immelman the lead analyst, Nobilo and Ian Baker-Finch the hole announcers, Dottie Pepper, Colt Knost and Mark Immelman the on-course reporters and Amanda Balionis general reporter.\n\n\"When they fill the natural amphitheaters around some of these holes, it generates a buzz,\" Nobilo said. \"... \"Visually, we try to make sure it's a beautiful watch as well as voices, if we can make it a comfortable listen, get that blend together.\"\n\n\u00a92024 Hartford Courant.

I have three props locked in for this week's event at TPC River Highlands.\n\nWe're going to keep things pretty straightforward for this one. There has been a hole-in-one at this event seven of the last nine years, including Rory McIlroy's first ace on the PGA Tour in 2023.\n\nHere are the four par-3s this week:\n\nA bet with -135 isn't exactly the most exciting wager to place, but that doesn't mean there's no value in it. Tommy Fleetwood only has to compete with two other Englishmen for this bet, Matt Fitzpatrick (+180) and Justin Rose (+450), neither of which have been playing great golf of late. Fitzpatrick has finished outside the top 50 in three of his last four starts and Rose has missed two-straight cuts.\n\nMeanwhile, Fleetwood has finished T26 or better in six straight starts and his game seems to be rounding into form heading into this week. This bet should be a layup.\n\nHideki Matsuyama has been playing some fantastic golf lately including in a T8 at the Memorial Tournament and a solo sixth at the U.S. Open.\n\nSi Woo Kim, Tom Kim, and Sungjae Im have played some inconsistent golf at best the past two months, and unless they round into form this week, they will have trouble competing with Matsuyama.

Let's see.\n\nFind my best picks for the Travelers Championship below.\n\nAfter a sticky period during the spring, Patrick Cantlay found form last week in the US Open at Pinehurst (where he finished third) and he has to be backed to ride that wave.\n\nHe finished fourth in this event last year, carding a brilliant 61 in round three, and he's not finished outside the top 15 in his last six visits to the course.\n\nHe's also just an exceptional performer on courses that are, like this one, designed by Pete Dye.\n\nCantlay has 10 top five finishes on them - and four in his last seven starts.\n\nHe's a solid each way option at 20/1 in bet365's eight-place market.\n\n\u26f3 Bet on Patrick Cantlay at 20/1 with bet365 \u26f3\n\nThe top 10 finish Sam Burns recorded in last week's US Open was doubly significant.\n\nOn the one hand, it was this talented player's first in a major championship.\n\nOn the other, it was his fourth top 15 finish in his last five starts.\n\nHe's another player with a fine Pete Dye log book - in his case, he's finished top 20 in 11 of his 24 starts, including victory in the WGC Dell Technologies Match Play at Austin Country Club.\n\nHis win in the 2022 Charles Schwab Challenge is also instructive because, like TPC River Highlands, it is a short par-70 with bent grass greens.\n\nFinally, stick with the each way options and add the 2023 Open champion Brian Harman.\n\nHe owns a remarkably consistent record on the course, making 11 of 13 cuts and registering a top eight finish in six of his last nine appearances.\n\nHis form on Pete Dye designs is also superb.\n\nHe was second on this course last year, second again at TPC Sawgrass in March and 12th at Harbour Town in April.\n\nHis recent returns have been solid rather than spectacular (three top 30s in four starts) but this test is right in the short hitter's wheelhouse and another good week is well within him.\n\n\u26f3 Bet on Brian Harman at 40/1 with Paddy Power \u26f3\n\nCommercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to talkSPORT. 18+.

The Memorial crushed me, but I wiped my bloody lip and formulated one of the best player pools of the season. Bryson DeChambeau was my most heavily rostered player. Rory McIlroy was second-most. Forty percent of all of my lineups had both. Mic drop.\n\nFrom the third major, we run right into another signature PGA Tour event in the Travelers Championship. McIlroy has withdrawn from the tournament stemming from his Shakespearean collapse and Irish goodbye on Sunday. Most of the rest of the Tour's best are here at TPC River Highlands in Cromwell, Connecticut to angle toward another gigantic prize purse. The Travelers is a no-cut event featuring a bounty of birdies compared to the two events prior. Carnage will have to wait, we're going pin-seeking again.\n\nTPC River Highlands is a Pete Dye design that also draws back on the extensive course length at Muirfield Village and Pinehurst. At only 6,800 yards, the par-70 has tightened up considerably with longer rough than in recent years. The Bentgrass and Poa surfaces will feel syrupy by comparison as well. The best golfers off the tee and on approach will also need a hot putter to convert enough birdies to contend here. The difficulty with playing limited-field events in DFS is in finding leverage. Fortunately, plenty can be found in the middle and value tiers. This leaves fewer reasons to completely fade any top-tier golfers in this stacked field, regardless of projected rostership.

Every year since then, it has continued to grow and evolve, and now we are pleased to be one of only eight Signature Events on TOUR. We are humbled and gratified by how far we have come and by the community's overwhelming response every step of the way. And, of course, the Travelers Championship is about so much more than golf - it is about making a difference in people's lives through a tradition of giving back and boosting the local economy.\"\n\nThe Travelers Championship donates 100% of its net proceeds to local charities. Since Travelers became title sponsor, the tournament has generated tens of millions of dollars for hundreds of nonprofits throughout New England, including millions of dollars for nearly 200 charities in 2023.\n\nThis year's primary beneficiary will again be The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a nonprofit based in Ashford, Connecticut, that focuses on creating fun and friendships for children with serious illnesses. Many other worthy nonprofits - spanning arts and culture, education, health care, housing, human services, mental health, food insecurity, science and technology, and youth development - also use the tournament as a platform to raise funds and promote their causes.\n\nAndy Bessette, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer at Travelers, said, \"The Travelers Championship would not be what it is today without the partnership of the PGA TOUR and the support of the players, our dedicated volunteers, other corporate sponsors, the state of Connecticut and, most importantly, the fans.

Otherwise, we risk the virus spreading further, including across borders.\"\n\nHamid Jafari, a WHO polio specialist, said during a news conference that while no clinical cases have been found so far, polio was detected in sewage in Gaza's Deir el-Balah and Khan Yunis.\n\nSeparately, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference the health agency will send polio vaccines to Gaza. \"WHO is sending more than 1 million polio vaccines which will be administered in the coming weeks.\"\n\nGhebreyesus said health workers need freedom of movement in Gaza to administer the vaccines, and that a ceasefire or at least a few days of calm was essential to protect Gaza's children.\n\nChildren under five are most at risk from the viral disease, most notably infants under two, since normal vaccination campaigns have been disrupted by the conflict.\n\nOn July 30, the Health Ministry in Gaza declared the Palestinian territory to be a \"polio epidemic zone\".\n\nThe ministry

The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza declared the Palestinian territory to be a 'polio epidemic zone' on July 30, 2024.\n\nThe World Health Organization said Wednesday that it would send more than 1 million polio vaccines to war-torn Gaza after the virus was detected in the Palestinian territory's wastewater.\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said health workers needed free movement within Gaza to administer the vaccines, noting that a cease-fire, or at least a few 'days of tranquility,' was essential to protect Gaza's children with routine vaccinations.\n\n'WHO is sending more than 1 million polio vaccines, which will be administered in the coming weeks,' he said at a press conference. 'The detection of polio in wastewater in Gaza is a telltale sign that the virus has been circulating in the community, putting unvaccinated children at risk.'\n\nNo clinical cases have yet been detected.\n\nAndrea King, from the WHO's global health cluster team, said the vaccination campaign would be a 'huge logistical challenge.'\n\n'It's vaccines as well as the associated cold chain [thermal packaging] supplies that are needed to enter Gaza ... as well as the micro-planning within Gaza,' she said at the press conference. 'The hope is that if everything lines up, these will arrive in time for the planned vaccination dates later this month, the first round to start on August 17.'\n\nOn July 30, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza declared the Palestinian territory to be a 'polio epidemic zone,' blaming the reappearance of the virus on Israel's military offensive since the October 7 Hamas attacks and the resulting destruction of health facilities.\n\nThe ministry said the virus was detected in wastewater samples taken in the Khan Yunis region, as well as in areas of central Gaza.\n\nMost often spread through sewage and contaminated water, poliovirus is highly infectious. It can cause deformities and paralysis and is potentially fatal. It mainly affects children younger than 5.\n\nThe wild version of the virus is now endemic only in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but an oral vaccine that contains small amounts of weakened but live polio still causes occasional outbreaks elsewhere.\n\nU.N. agencies said that such vaccine-derived type-2 poliovirus had been detected in the Gaza sewage samples.\n\nOral polio vaccine replicates in the gut and can be passed to others through fecal-contaminated water - meaning it won't hurt the child who has been vaccinated but could infect unvaccinated neighbors in places where hygiene and immunization levels are low.\n\nThe Gaza war was triggered by Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, according to Israeli official figures.\n\nPalestinian militants also seized about 250 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,677 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not break down civilian and militant deaths.", "source": {"uri": "afghanistannews.net", "dataType": "news",

Dr. Balkhy warned that although no cases have been detected, children are at high risk.\n\nIn response, WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in Gaza and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) on a range of measures, including polio vaccination campaigns which will begin very soon.\n\n\"Let me be clear - we need a ceasefire, even a temporary ceasefire - to successfully undertake these campaigns. Otherwise, we risk the virus spreading further, including across borders,\" she said.\n\nDr. Hamid Jamari, Polio Eradication Director at the WHO Regional Office, said some 500,000 children under eight, will be targeted in two rounds of vaccination campaigns.\n\nHe said the WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has already authorized the release of sufficient doses of the novel oral polio vaccine type two from global stocks, which are held in Indonesia.\n\n\"Of course, the challenge is when can we get these vaccines through to Gaza,\" he said, citing issues such as the current tensions in the region, logistical difficulties and flight cancellations.\n\n\"And once the vaccines get there, then we need a massive change in the current environment which is not only ceasefire and peace so that children can be vaccinated, but we also require freedom of movement.\"\n\nDr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO Representative in the occupied Palestinian territory, added that \"everything has to be aligned, including the cold chain and cold chain equipment\", referring to the correct conditions for storing, transporting and distributing vaccines.\n\nSpeaking from Jerusalem, he said that WHO and partners have already started \"microplanning\" for the vaccination campaigns, describing them as a \"massive operation\".

The virus attacks the nervous system, leading to spinal and respiratory paralysis, and can prove fatal.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said last month that the vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) was found at six locations in sewage samples collected on June 23 from Gaza's Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah areas.\n\nAccording to the UN health agency, wild poliovirus was eliminated from the occupied Palestinian territories a quarter of a century ago.\n\nWith the detection of the virus, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said the agency \"considers there to be a high risk of spread of this strain within Gaza, and internationally, particularly given the impact the current situation continues to have on public health services.\"\n\nNo clinical cases have been confirmed in Gaza so far but that is primarily due to a lack of surveillance and testing facilities.\n\n\"Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance has not been functioning adequately, and surveillance has been suspended since Oct. 7 last year,\" said Jasarevic.\n\nAs for immunization, he said vaccination rates in occupied Palestinian territories were \"optimal\" before the war, with routine coverage at 95% and above in 2022.\n\nIn 2023, polio vaccination coverage, primarily conducted through routine immunization, was estimated at 89%, according to latest WHO-UNICEF routine immunization estimates.\n\n\"In the past nine months, routine vaccination has been disrupted and tens of thousands of children under 5 years old are at risk of contracting polio and other vaccine preventable diseases,\" said the spokesperson.\n\nDestroyed infrastructure\n\nHughes, who is currently in Gaza, said aid workers \"could be missing the signs\" of the disease.\n\n\"Our doctors and nurses have not been trained on how to identify the signs and symptoms of polio,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a strong possibility they have come to our clinic, but we haven't necessarily identified them yet.\"\n\nHughes said the situation in Gaza is one of the worst humanitarian disasters he has seen, with the deplorable health and hygiene conditions exacerbating the threat of polio and other infectious diseases.\n\nHe said most of Gaza's infrastructure has been completely destroyed in Israel's ongoing offensive, which has now killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians and wounded almost 92,000.\n\nThis includes water and sewage treatment plants, as well as basic water supply infrastructure such as pipes, he said, while access to water trucks is also gone as Israel is not letting in any fuel.\n\nPeople throughout Gaza are forced to drink contaminated water and seawater, and \"we have no way to test it either,\" he said.\n\n\"When you drive through Gaza ... there's sewage everywhere,\" said Hughes, warning that the situation will only get worse in the winter months when rains start.\n\n'Extremely challenging circumstances'\n\nHughes pointed out that even if Israel is somehow made to let in vaccines and other critical supplies, there would still be massive hurdles to overcome.\n\n\"Once they (vaccines) get into Gaza, we need to roll out a vaccination campaign, but to do that in current situation is almost impossible,\" he said.\n\nBefore any sort of vaccination campaign, there has to be \"a lot of training for doctors and nurses\" and everything is severely complicated as access to hospitals is very difficult, especially in the north of Gaza, he said.\n\n\"We're at a point now where it's almost inevitable that there would be an outbreak,\" warned Hughes.\n\nHe said even aid workers \"have been asked to quarantine for two weeks before they come into Gaza, if they come from a polio country.\"\n\n\"This is putting more pressure on aid workers as we work all over the world and are coming to Gaza from different corners of the globe,\" he said.\n\nThe WHO said a \"socio-epidemiological investigation\" in the field and a \"risk assessment\" are ongoing.\n\nThe agency will work with the local health ministry, including on vaccination campaigns and strengthening routine immunization and surveillance \"as much as possible under the current extremely challenging circumstances,\" said Jasarevic.\n\nMore than 90% coverage needs to be achieved to ensure cessation of an outbreak and mitigate the risk of re-emergence, according to the WHO.\n\n\"The decimation of the health system, lack of security, access obstruction, constant population displacement, shortages of medical supplies, poor quality of water and weakened sanitation ... creates the perfect environment for diseases like polio to spread,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"A cease-fire is essential to allow an effective response.\"", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"},

Dr. Balkhy warned that although no cases have been detected, children are at high risk.\n\nIn response, WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in Gaza and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) on a range of measures, including polio vaccination campaigns which will begin very soon.\n\nLet me be clear - we need a ceasefire, even a temporary ceasefire - to successfully undertake these campaigns. Otherwise, wee risk the virus spreading further, including across borders, she said.\n\nDr. Hamid Jamari, Polio Eradication Director at the WHO Regional Office, said some 500,000 children under eight, will be targeted in two rounds of vaccination campaigns.\n\nHe said the WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has already authorized the release of sufficient doses of the novel oral polio vaccine type two from global stocks, which are held in Indonesia.\n\n\"Of course, the challenge is when can we get these vaccines through to Gaza\", he said, citing issues such as the current tensions in the region, logistical difficulties and flight cancellations.\n\n\"And once the vaccines get there, then we need a massive change in the current environment which is not only ceasefire and peace so that children can be vaccinated, but we also require freedom of movement\". \u009d\n\nDr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO Representative in the occupied Palestinian territory, added that everything has to be aligned, including the cold chain and cold chain equipment, referring to the correct conditions for storing, transporting and distributing vaccines.\n\nSpeaking from Jerusalem, he said that WHO and partners have already started \"microplanning\" for the vaccination campaigns, describing them as a \"massive operation\". This will be followed by the training of health workers and volunteers, and the roll-out of risk communications.\n\n\"To carry out these kinds of campaigns, you prefer to have a ceasefire,\" he said.\"If that's not possible, then at least there should be what we call \"days of tranquility\".\n\nLike his counterpart, Dr. Peeperkorn also underlined the importance of freedom of movement.\n\nHe explained that the comprehensive vaccination campaigns would have to be carried out from fixed points, from mobile teams, and, when feasible...as much as possible from door-to-door, Or, in Gaza, it would be from tent-to-tent.\u009d\n\nOne of the 85 sick and severely injured patients evacuated from Gaza to United Arab Emirates waves from the bus.\n\nRegarding other Gaza developments. Dr. Balkhy reported that WHO supported the largest medical evacuation from the enclave so far in the war, with 85 seriously ill people and their companions taken to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the end July.\n\nThis \"extremely complex operation\" involved transporting the group through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and then onto an Israeli airport, before flying to the UAE.\n\nShe explained that the easier route would have been through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, which has been closed since 6 May.\n\nIn total, nearly over 100 Gazan patients have been evacuated with WHO support, including to Belgium and Spain. However, some 10,000 people there still require medical evacuation.\n\nIn the face of regional escalation, WHO is deploying emergency experts and vital supplies to support the Ministry of Health in Lebanon, in addition to providing equipment, technical assistance and staffing for its Emergency Operations Centre.\n\nThe agency has also bolstered the capacity of 98 hospitals for mass casualty management and the prepositioning of 20 trauma kits and other lifesaving supplies.\n\n\"As we work with health officials in Syria, Iran, Jordan and other countries on emergency contingency plans, we hope and pray that they never need to be activated\", she remarked.\n\nDr. Balkhy also addressed the situation in Sudan, where war has pushed parts of North Darfur state into famine, notably the Zamzam displacement camp, home to least 500,000 people. Other areas are potentially at risk.\n\n\"These entirely avoidable developments raise the stakes for our humanitarian operations. We urgently need access to those in need by all routes possible, including cross-border\", she said.\n\nTurning to other locations in the region, she noted that extreme weather events including floods, deadly heatwaves and storms have disrupted lives and livelihoods.\n\nShe said WHO \"acted quickly\" following recent severe flooding in Afghanistan that killed 58 people and injured 380, which included dispatching 160 metric tonnes of medical supplies, deploying 24 ambulances for referrals, and activating mass casualty management systems.\n\nThe floods and heatwaves are occurring in the context of severe climate, and she highlighted the wider impacts on health.\n\n\"Climate change is a fundamental threat to people's health and the time for collective, concrete actions is now,\" she said. \"We need to understand that this threat knows no borders and leaves no one safe\".", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Dr. Balkhy warned that although no cases have been detected, children are at high risk.\n\nIn response, WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in Gaza and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) on a range of measures, including polio vaccination campaigns which will begin very soon.\n\n\"Let me be clear - we need a ceasefire, even a temporary ceasefire - to successfully undertake these campaigns. Otherwise, we risk the virus spreading further, including across borders,\" she said.\n\nVaccines on the way\n\nDr. Hamid Jamari, Polio Eradication Director at the WHO Regional Office, said some 500,000 children under eight, will be targeted in two rounds of vaccination campaigns.\n\nHe said the WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has already authorized the release of sufficient doses of the novel oral polio vaccine type two from global stocks, which are held in Indonesia.\n\n\"Of course, the challenge is when can we get these vaccines through to Gaza,\" he said, citing issues such as the current tensions in the region, logistical difficulties and flight cancellations.\n\n\"And once the vaccines get there, then we need a massive change in the current environment which is not only ceasefire and peace so that children can be vaccinated, but we also require freedom of movement.\"\n\nPlanning for a 'massive operation'\n\nDr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO Representative in the occupied Palestinian territory, added that \"everything has to be aligned, including the cold chain and cold chain equipment\", referring to the correct conditions for storing, transporting and distributing vaccines.\n\nSpeaking from Jerusalem, he said that WHO and partners have already started \"microplanning\" for the vaccination campaigns, describing them as a \"massive operation\". This will be followed by the training of health workers and volunteers, and the roll-out of risk communications.\n\n\"To carry out these kinds of campaigns, you prefer to have a ceasefire,\" he said. \"If that's not possible, then at least there should be what we call 'days of tranquility\"'.\n\nLike his counterpart, Dr. Peeperkorn also underlined the importance of freedom of movement.\n\nHe explained that the comprehensive vaccination campaigns would have to be carried out \"from fixed points, from mobile teams, and, when feasible...as much as possible from door-to-door. Or, in Gaza, it would be from tent-to-tent.\"\n\nThousands awaiting medical evacuation\n\nRegarding other Gaza developments. Dr. Balkhy reported that WHO supported the largest medical evacuation from the enclave so far in the war, with 85 seriously ill people and their companions taken to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the end July.\n\nThis \"extremely complex operation\" involved transporting the group through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and then onto an Israeli airport, before flying to the UAE.\n\nShe explained that the easier route would have been through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, which has been closed since 6 May.\n\nIn total, \"nearly over 100 Gazan patients\" have been evacuated with WHO support, including to Belgium and Spain. However, some 10,000 people there still require medical evacuation.\n\nEmergency contingency plans\n\nIn the face of regional escalation, WHO is deploying emergency experts and vital supplies to support the Ministry of Health in Lebanon, in addition to providing equipment, technical assistance and staffing for its Emergency Operations Centre.\n\nThe agency has also bolstered the capacity of 98 hospitals for mass casualty management and the prepositioning of 20 trauma kits and other lifesaving supplies.\n\n\"As we work with health officials in Syria, Iran, Jordan and other countries on emergency contingency plans, we hope and pray that they never need to be activated,\" she remarked.\n\nAccess across Sudan\n\nDr. Balkhy also addressed the situation in Sudan, where war has pushed parts of North Darfur state into famine, notably the Zamzam displacement camp, home to least 500,000 people. Other areas are potentially at risk.\n\n\"These entirely avoidable developments raise the stakes for our humanitarian operations. We urgently need access to those in need by all routes possible, including cross-border,\" she said.\n\nClimate change threat\n\nTurning to other locations in the region, she noted that extreme weather events including floods, deadly heatwaves and storms have disrupted lives and livelihoods.\n\nShe said WHO \"acted quickly\" following recent severe flooding in Afghanistan that killed 58 people and injured 380, which included dispatching 160 metric tonnes of medical supplies, deploying 24 ambulances for referrals, and activating mass casualty management systems.\n\nThe floods and heatwaves are occurring in the context of severe climate, and she highlighted the wider impacts on health.\n\n\"Climate change is a fundamental threat to people's health and the time for collective, concrete actions is now,\" she said. \"We need to understand that this threat knows no borders and leaves no one safe.\"", "source": {"uri": "allafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "allAfrica"},

He mentioned the use of artificial intelligence to monitor and predict the future escalation of the crisis.\n\nDr. Hamid Jafari, Director of the Polio Eradication Program at the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office, confirmed the outbreak of type 2 polio in Gaza, caused by the spread of sewage in the streets due to the war and contaminated drinking water. Efforts are being made to vaccinate children and provide polio vaccines in Gaza.\n\nHe added, \"We aim to provide polio vaccines in Gaza, which is a significant challenge exacerbated by conflicts and infrastructure failures in some countries.\"\n\nDr. Richard Peeperkorn, WHO Representative in the occupied Palestinian territory, emphasized the need to establish cold chains to deliver polio vaccines and plan immunization campaigns for the large number of children in Gaza. He noted the necessity of trained medical staff to vaccinate these children.\n\nHe further stated, \"Sewage infrastructure has collapsed due to road destruction, leading to outbreaks of diseases like dehydration and watery diarrhea. Reliable sources are scarce in Gaza, with over 100,000 cases of infectious diseases, more than 100,000 cases of scabies, lice, and chickenpox, and 100,000 cases of jaundice due to sewage outbreaks and the lack of a suitable environment.\"\n\nRegarding the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, experts have observed that the deteriorating sewage infrastructure exacerbates the problem, with many patients not responding to antibiotic treatment.\n\nDr. Hanan Balkhy, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, warned that antibiotic-resistant bacteria could spread beyond Gaza to neighboring countries. She explained that the sewage system contributes to the spread of these resistant bacteria, with sewage odors pervasive and access to clean water limited.\n\nThe inability to identify the appropriate antibiotics for certain infections could lead to a catastrophe that extends beyond Gaza. Ensuring access to treatment and the availability of medications in Gaza is crucial, along with the need for a ceasefire to prevent the spread of diseases and the emergence of new antibiotic-resistant bacteria.", "source": {"uri": "egypttoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EgyptToday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Mediterranean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Mediterranean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Polio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Polio vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cold chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antimicrobial resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scabies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scabies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewerage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewerage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaundice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenpox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chickenpox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/202407130454315431.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798407", "eventUri": "eng-9798407", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Otherwise, we risk the virus spreading further, including across borders,\" she said.\n\nVaccines on the way\n\nDr. Hamid Jamari, Polio Eradication Director at the WHO Regional Office, said some 500,000 children under eight, will be targeted in two rounds of vaccination campaigns.\n\nHe said the WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has already authorized the release of sufficient doses of the novel oral polio vaccine type two from global stocks, which are held in Indonesia.\n\n\"Of course, the challenge is when can we get these vaccines through to Gaza,\" he said, citing issues such as the current tensions in the region, logistical difficulties and flight cancellations.\n\n\"And once the vaccines get there, then we need a massive change in the current environment which is not only ceasefire and peace so that children can be vaccinated, but we also require freedom of movement.\"\n\nPlanning for a 'massive operation'\n\nDr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO Representative in the occupied Palestinian territory, added that \"everything has to be aligned, including the cold chain and cold chain equipment\", referring to the correct conditions for storing, transporting and distributing vaccines.\n\nSpeaking from Jerusalem, he said that WHO and partners have already started \"microplanning\" for the vaccination campaigns, describing them as a \"massive operation\". This will be followed by the training of health workers and volunteers, and the roll-out of risk communications.\n\n\"To carry out these kinds of campaigns, you prefer to have a ceasefire,\" he said. \"If that's not possible, then at least there should be what we call 'days of tranquility'\".\n\nLike his counterpart, Dr. Peeperkorn also underlined the importance of freedom of movement.\n\nHe explained that the comprehensive vaccination campaigns would have to be carried out \"from fixed points, from mobile teams, and, when feasible...as much as possible from door-to-door. Or, in Gaza, it would be from tent-to-tent.\"\n\nEmergency contingency plans\n\nIn the face of regional escalation, WHO is deploying emergency experts and vital supplies to support the Ministry of Health in Lebanon, in addition to providing equipment, technical assistance and staffing for its Emergency Operations Centre.\n\nThe agency has also bolstered the capacity of 98 hospitals for mass casualty management and the prepositioning of 20 trauma kits and other lifesaving supplies.\n\n\"As we work with health officials in Syria, Iran, Jordan and other countries on emergency contingency plans, we hope and pray that they never need to be activated,\" she remarked.\n\nAccess across Sudan\n\nDr. Balkhy also addressed the situation in Sudan, where war has pushed parts of North Darfur state into famine, notably the Zamzam displacement camp, home to least 500,000 people. Other areas are potentially at risk.\n\n\"These entirely avoidable developments raise the stakes for our humanitarian operations. We urgently need access to those in need by all routes possible, including cross-border,\" she said.\n\nClimate change threat\n\nTurning to other locations in the region, she noted that extreme weather events including floods, deadly heatwaves and storms have disrupted lives and livelihoods.\n\nShe said WHO \"acted quickly\" following recent severe flooding in Afghanistan that killed 58 people and injured 380, which included dispatching 160 metric tonnes of medical supplies, deploying 24 ambulances for referrals, and activating mass casualty management systems.\n\nThe floods and heatwaves are occurring in the context of severe climate, and she highlighted the wider impacts on health.\n\n\"Climate change is a fundamental threat to people's health and the time for collective, concrete actions is now,\" she said. \"We need to understand that this threat knows no borders and leaves no one safe.\"", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"},

The first round of vaccinations is slated to commence on August 17.\n\nPolio is a highly infectious viral disease that can lead to severe complications, including paralysis and even death. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated fecal matter.\n\nCurrently, Gaza is experiencing severe disruptions due to a significant military operation that has hindered the operations of healthcare facilities, leaving only 16 out of 36 hospitals functioning to any degree.\n\nAndrea King, a representative of the WHO, described the vaccine distribution as a \"huge logistical challenge.\" It is essential for the vaccine to remain within a specific temperature range from the time of production until it is administered, complicating the effort during ongoing hostilities.\n\nThe WHO is urging for a ceasefire and is seeking assurance of unrestricted access for vaccination efforts. Currently, it is working on obtaining the requisite permissions to enter Gaza for the vaccination drive.\n\nPrevious requests for a ceasefire on humanitarian grounds have been denied by the Israeli authorities.\n\nThe Israeli military had announced in July that it had started vaccinating its own forces against the virus.\n\nRecent tests conducted by the WHO have confirmed the presence of poliovirus in sewage samples from two areas in Gaza. Dr. Hamed Jafari, a polio expert with the WHO, explained that the genetic analysis of the samples suggests they have been circulating in the region for an extended period, with roots possibly tracing back to September of the previous year.\n\nDr. Jafari noted that the conditions in Gaza -- characterized by high density, displacement, sewage contamination, and access to clean water -- create an environment conducive to the spread of polio.\n\nThe WHO has acknowledged that immunization rates in both Gaza and the West Bank were notably high prior to the onset of the conflict, with a 99% coverage of polio vaccinations reported in 2022. However, data indicates a decline to 89% in the subsequent year.\n\nRecently, the health authorities in Gaza, under Hamas, declared the region to be a \"polio epidemic zone,\" attributing the resurgence of the virus to the ongoing military operations and the resulting degradation of health infrastructure.\n\nWith less than half of Gaza's primary healthcare facilities currently operational, and about 70% of sewage handling mechanisms destroyed, the region faces dire health risks exacerbated by the ongoing crisis.\n\nThe ongoing military campaign in Gaza, conducted by Israeli forces, has resulted in significant casualties, with reports indicating over 39,677 deaths, as per figures from the Hamas-run health ministry, although these figures do not delineate between civilians and militants.\n\nThe violence was triggered by an unprecedented attack from Hamas on Israel, which resulted in approximately 1,200 Israeli fatalities and the abduction of 251 individuals into Gaza.",

Another 2.3 million people have been displaced.\n\nJust 16 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are now partially functional, and other medical services have been depleted. Israeli forces have destroyed all of Gaza's wastewater treatment plants and 70 per cent of its sewage pumps, according to Oxfam - making it a prime environment for diseases to spread.\n\nThat's particularly true during the warmer summer months when mosquitoes and other bugs proliferate and food spoils faster.\n\nAs a result of the conflict, people in Gaza are grappling with respiratory infections, diarrhoea, scabies and lice, skin rashes, chickenpox, jaundice, and hepatitis A, among other health issues that are unlikely to spread beyond Gaza because it is effectively \"blocked off\" from the rest of the region, Peeperkorn said.\n\nEven so, other global health concerns could erupt from the conflict, such as growing antimicrobial resistance, which is a longer-term threat that WHO experts are already raising the alarm about.\n\nWar zones are fertile ground for antibiotic-resistant superbugs that emerge due to poor sanitary conditions and hospitals' limited ability to treat wounds and infections in areas that have been ravaged by conflict, officials said.\n\nBalkhy warned that antibiotic-resistant bacteria could move from Gaza to the broader region, and from there become globally endemic, making these bacteria difficult, if not impossible, to control.\n\nSuperbugs can be bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi that have mutated to resist antibiotics, meaning they are more likely to cause deadly infections that would otherwise be treatable. Antimicrobial resistance was responsible for nearly 5 million deaths globally in 2019, according to the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n\n\"This is going to be one of the most devastating outcomes of this current war in Gaza,\" Balkhy said. When drug-resistant bacteria spread, \"we face more and more challenges in treating patients in the highest, most sophisticated hospitals around the world\".", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tedros Adhanom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cold chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagious_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contagious disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antimicrobial resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Mediterranean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Mediterranean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paralysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/63/61/66/1200x675_cmsv2_dab08ee6-f269-567e-803e-0d9d95e3f87b-8636166.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798407", "eventUri": "eng-9798407", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Dr. Balkhy warned that although no cases have been detected, children are at high risk.\n\nIn response, WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in Gaza and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) on a range of measures, including polio vaccination campaigns which will begin very soon.\n\n\"Let me be clear - we need a ceasefire, even a temporary ceasefire - to successfully undertake these campaigns. Otherwise, we risk the virus spreading further, including across borders,\" she said.\n\nDr. Hamid Jamari, Polio Eradication Director at the WHO Regional Office, said some 500,000 children under eight, will be targeted in two rounds of vaccination campaigns.\n\nHe said the WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has already authorized the release of sufficient doses of the novel oral polio vaccine type two from global stocks, which are held in Indonesia.\n\n\"Of course, the challenge is when can we get these vaccines through to Gaza,\" he said, citing issues such as the current tensions in the region, logistical difficulties and flight cancellations.\n\n\"And once the vaccines get there, then we need a massive change in the current environment which is not only ceasefire and peace so that children can be vaccinated, but we also require freedom of movement.\"\n\nDr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO Representative in the occupied Palestinian territory, added that \"everything has to be aligned, including the cold chain and cold chain equipment\", referring to the correct conditions for storing, transporting and distributing vaccines.\n\nSpeaking from Jerusalem, he said that WHO and partners have already started \"microplanning\" for the vaccination campaigns, describing them as a \"massive operation\". This will be followed by the training of health workers and volunteers, and the roll-out of risk communications.\n\n\"To carry out these kinds of campaigns, you prefer to have a ceasefire,\" he said. \"If that's not possible, then at least there should be what we call 'days of tranquility'\".\n\nLike his counterpart, Dr. Peeperkorn also underlined the importance of freedom of movement.\n\nHe explained that the comprehensive vaccination campaigns would have to be carried out \"from fixed points, from mobile teams, and, when feasible...as much as possible from door-to-door. Or, in Gaza, it would be from tent-to-tent.\"\n\nRegarding other Gaza developments. Dr. Balkhy reported that WHO supported the largest medical evacuation from the enclave so far in the war, with 85 seriously ill people and their companions taken to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the end July.\n\nThis \"extremely complex operation\" involved transporting the group through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and then onto an Israeli airport, before flying to the UAE.\n\nShe explained that the easier route would have been through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, which has been closed since 6 May.\n\nIn total, \"nearly over 100 Gazan patients\" have been evacuated with WHO support, including to Belgium and Spain. However, some 10,000 people there still require medical evacuation.\n\nIn the face of regional escalation, WHO is deploying emergency experts and vital supplies to support the Ministry of Health in Lebanon, in addition to providing equipment, technical assistance and staffing for its Emergency Operations Centre.\n\nThe agency has also bolstered the capacity of 98 hospitals for mass casualty management and the prepositioning of 20 trauma kits and other lifesaving supplies.\n\n\"As we work with health officials in Syria, Iran, Jordan and other countries on emergency contingency plans, we hope and pray that they never need to be activated,\" she remarked.\n\nDr. Balkhy also addressed the situation in Sudan, where war has pushed parts of North Darfur state into famine, notably the Zamzam displacement camp, home to least 500,000 people. Other areas are potentially at risk.\n\n\"These entirely avoidable developments raise the stakes for our humanitarian operations. We urgently need access to those in need by all routes possible, including cross-border,\" she said.\n\nTurning to other locations in the region, she noted that extreme weather events including floods, deadly heatwaves and storms have disrupted lives and livelihoods.\n\nShe said WHO \"acted quickly\" following recent severe flooding in Afghanistan that killed 58 people and injured 380, which included dispatching 160 metric tonnes of medical supplies, deploying 24 ambulances for referrals, and activating mass casualty management systems.\n\nThe floods and heatwaves are occurring in the context of severe climate, and she highlighted the wider impacts on health.\n\n\"Climate change is a fundamental threat to people's health and the time for collective, concrete actions is now,\" she said. \"We need to understand that this threat knows no borders and leaves no one safe.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.un.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "UN News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

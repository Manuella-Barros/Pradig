In such a strange environment, rare species have abounded. Until now.\n\n\"All the miseries of the Balkhash are right under my eyes,\" fisherman Alexei Grebennikov told AFP from the deck of his boat on the northern shores, which sometimes has salty water, sometimes fresh.\n\n\"There are fewer and fewer fish, it's catastrophic, the lake is silting up,\" warned the 50-year-old.\n\nA dredger to clear the little harbour lay anchored, rusting and unused, off the industrial town of Balkhack, itself seemingly stuck in a Soviet timewarp.\n\n\"We used to take tourists underwater fishing. Now the place has become a swamp,\" said Grebennikov.\n\nIn town, scientist Olga Sharipova was studying the changes.\n\n\"The Balkhash is the country's largest fishery. But the quantity of fish goes down when the water level drops, because the conditions for reproduction are disrupted,\" she told AFP.\n\nAnd its level is now only a metre from the critical threshold where it could tilt towards disaster.\n\nThere was an unexpected respite this spring when unprecedented floods allowed the Kazakh authorities to divert 3.3 million cubic metres of water to the Balkhash.\n\nThe Caspian also got a six-billion-cubic-metre fill-up.\n\nChina 'overusing' water\n\nBut the few extra centimetres has not changed the longterm trend.\n\n\"The level of the Balkhash has been falling everywhere since 2019, mainly due to a decrease in the flow of the Ili River\" from neighbouring China, said Sharipova.\n\nAll the great lakes of Central Asia, also known as enclosed seas, share a similar worrying fate.\n\nThe Aral Sea has almost disappeared, the situation is alarming for the Caspian Sea and Lake Issyk-Kul in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan.\n\nLocated on dry lands isolated from the ocean, they are particularly vulnerable to disturbances \"exacerbated by global warming and human activities\", according to leading scientific journal Nature.\n\nRising temperatures accelerate evaporation, as water resources dwindle due to the melting of surrounding glaciers.\n\nThese issues are compounded by the economic importance of the Balkhash, which is on the path of China's Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project also known as the New Silk Road.\n\nA 2021 study by Oxford University scientists published in the journal \"Water\" concluded the lake's decline resulted from China's overuse of the Ili River which feeds it for its agriculture, including cotton.\n\n\"If the hydro-climatic regime of the Ili for 2020-2060 remains unchanged compared to the past 50 years and agriculture continues to expand in China, future water supplies will become increasingly strained,\" the study said.\n\nBeijing is a key economic partner for Kazakhstan but it is less keen to collaborate on water issues.\n\n\"The drafting and signing of an agreement with China on the sharing of water in transborder rivers is a key issue,\" the Kazakh Ministry of Water Resources told AFP.\n\n\"The main objective is to supply the volumes of water needed to preserve the Balkhash,\" it said.\n\nThe level of the Balkhash has been falling everywhere since 2019, said Olga Sharipova, a scientist (File)\n\nPhoto Credit: AFP\n\nHeavy pollution\n\nThe water being syphoned away adds to \"pollution from heavy metals, pesticides and other harmful substances\", authorities said, without citing culprits.\n\nThe town of Balkhash was founded around Kazakhstan's largest copper producer, Kazakhmys.\n\nHolidaymakers bathing on Balkhash's municipal beach have a view of the smoking chimneys of its metal plant.\n\nLung cancer rates here are almost 10 times the regional average, which is already among the highest in the country, health authorities said.\n\nDespite being sanctioned for breaking environmental standards, Kazakhmys denies it is the main polluter of the lake and has vowed to to reduce pollution by renewing its equipment.\n\n\"Kazakhmys is carrying out protective work to prevent environmental disasters in the Balkhash,\" Sherkhan Rustemov, the company's ecological engineer, told AFP.\n\nPromotedListen to the

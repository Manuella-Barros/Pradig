From award-winning movies like \u2018Breaded Life\u2019 (2021), \u2018Strangers\u2019 (2022), to recent hits like \u2018Sista\u2019 (2023), \u2018Big Love\u2019 (2023), to \u2018Small Talk\u2019 (2024), Stephen continues to explore the complexities of human connections. Her latest film, \u201cMomiwa,\u201d is a family drama about a beloved housekeeper who brings joy to a household, only to face tension and competition when her employer\u2019s estranged wife returns from nowhere. Plot The movie begins with a gripping scene: Neighbours hear the desperate cries of two siblings locked in an apartment and rush to help. Just as they are about to break down the door, the children\u2019s father arrives. As the movie progresses, we later learn that Naetochukwu is struggling for survival. His wife had locked up his children and abandoned them. In the subsequent scene, we meet Momiwa (Chinonso), the devoted housekeeper who cares for Naeto (Dadiwa), the children Vida and Abel, and the rest of the household. It\u2019s been ten years now, and things have pretty much changed for the good of Naeto and his family. What seems like an ordinary day takes a dramatic turn when Kiki, Naeto\u2019s estranged wife, suddenly reappears after having vanished, leaving her husband and kids behind. Despite Naeto\u2019s initial refusal to take her back, Momiwa persuades him to let Kiki return. Abel is happy to see her, but Vida and Naeto are wary. As Kiki tries to rebuild her relationships, Momiwa supports her. Kiki eventually opens up to Naeto, explaining that she left due to postpartum depression and sought therapy, clearing up rumours of infidelity. Naeto, overwhelmed by years of hurt, starts to forgive her. However, Kiki soon views Momiwa as a rival, straining their relationship. She demands to be called \u201cMadam\u201d and ultimately orchestrates Momiwa\u2019s arrest on false theft charges while Naetoway is on a business trip. On his return, Naeto finds a fake resignation letter from Momiwa. Refusing to believe she left voluntarily, he searches for her. Meanwhile, Kiki\u2019s true colours show as she neglects the children and household duties. When Vida asks for sanitary pads, Kiki berates her. Naeto goes to the pharmacy to buy them and runs into Dr Bamidele, who reveals that Kiki ran off to Abuja with him, abandoning her family when she learned of Naeto\u2019s newfound wealth. Back home, Naeto confronts Kiki, who admits her plot to frame Momiwa. Furious, Naeto recalls the pain Kiki caused and recognises Momiwa\u2019s crucial role in their lives. He orders Kiki to leave for good. But would Naeto ever find Momiwa again? Would his family ever remain the same?

Movie Review How do you know whether you\u2019ve watched a good movie or not? You know you\u2019ve watched a good movie when it evokes a strong emotional response, whether joy, sadness, anger, or such emotions that make you feel like you are part of the narrative. The storytelling should be compelling and well-paced, with authentic and relatable characters. The film\u2019s technical aspects,\u201d like cinematography, editing, and sound,\u201d should seamlessly enhance the narrative rather than distract from it. Ultimately, a good movie leaves a lasting impression, prompting reflection and discussion long after the credits roll. \u201cMomiwa\u201d exemplifies this standard, showcasing scriptwriting and production excellence by revealing each twist and truth at precisely the right moment. One thing that stands out in this movie is that the meticulous pacing captivates viewers and ensures the movie\u2019s coherence. Also, the satisfying conclusion leaves viewers content yet curious, as lingering unanswered questions about Momiwa\u2019s past provoke contemplation. This film is evidence of Stephen\u2019s directorial brilliance, reaffirming her status as a genre maestro. \u201cMomiwa\u201d is a worthy addition to Stephen\u2019s growing repertoire of compelling dramas, showcasing her directorial prowess and narrative finesse. The movie seamlessly integrates various languages, including English, Igbo, and Yoruba, with a touch of French, minimally used by the character of the chef, Phildela Yve. This multilingual approach adds depth and authenticity to the film. At its core, \u201cMomiwa\u201d presents a profound lesson that transcends conventional notions of family, challenging the belief that blood ties solely define familial bonds. Instead, it beautifully illustrates that the true essence of family lies in the sincere efforts and unwavering love extended by those who surround us. With stellar performances and a well-crafted narrative, this heartfelt message makes \u201cMomiwa\u201d a standout film that resonates deeply with its audience. However, the movie has its flaws. While we know so much about Naetochukwu\u2019s family, little or nothing is told about Momiwa\u2019s background and family. Also, viewers are left blank about Momiwa\u2019s relationship with Dadiwa. Initially, it felt like they were a couple, but not until Kiki surfaced. While the conclusion may feel somewhat rushed and uncertain, as if hurriedly wrapping up loose ends, it is a minor flaw in an otherwise heartwarming film that offers a delightful serving of classic Nollywood family drama.

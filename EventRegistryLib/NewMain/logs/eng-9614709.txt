Joe Manchin of West Virginia registers as independent, citing 'partisan extremism'", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia announced Friday he has switched his registration to independent, raising questions about his political plans since the move could help his chances should he seek elected office again in a state that has turned heavily Republican.\n\nManchin, 76, has often been at odds with the Democratic Party and an obstacle to many of President Joe Biden's legislative priorities. But he played a central role in helping Biden get a landmark climate change and health care bill over the finish line in 2022.\n\nHe had already announced in November that he wouldn't seek re-election to the Senate, giving Republicans a clear path to picking up his West Virginia seat in their bid to retake the majority next year.\n\nManchin has served in the Senate since 2010 and is the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He said in a statement that over the past 15 years he has seen both major political parties leave their constituents behind for \"partisan extremism while jeopardizing our democracy.\"\n\n\"Today, our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground,\" Manchin said. \"To stay true to myself and remain committed to put country before party, I have decided to register as an independent with no party affiliation and continue to fight for America's sensible majority.\"\n\nManchin will continue to caucus with Democrats and keep his chairmanship, according to a person familiar with his thinking who was granted anonymity to share his plans. The move helps Democrats preserve their slim 51-49 majority in the Senate.\n\nStill, facing potential retirement from politics, Manchin appears to be keeping other options open.\n\nHe has long wanted to switch his party affiliation to become an independent, according to a second person familiar with the situation who was granted anonymity to discuss it. But a looming deadline in West Virginia forced the issue.\n\nCandidates must file their political affiliation 60 days prior to a Aug. 1 deadline to run in this year's election.\n\nNow registered as an independent, Manchin still has time to mount another Senate race or a potential run for governor, a position he held from 2005 to 2010.\n\nHe had gone back and forth for months before announcing he wasn't running for reelection to the Senate. Many questioned whether he could win against the immensely popular Gov. Jim Justice, the Republican Senate nominee who Manchin helped recruit to run for governor as a Democrat in 2016. Justice switched to Republican at a rally with then-President Donald Trump not long into his first term.\n\nShould the Senate candidates stumble, Manchin could be poised to try to keep his seat. But a run for governor could be more favorable.\n\nManchin has defeated the Republican nominee for governor, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, once before, in 2018. That Senate campaign was Manchin's toughest in his three-plus decades in West Virginia politics. He defeated Morrisey by just over 3 percentage points.\n\nSteve Williams, who is the Democratic nominee for governor and the mayor of Huntington, said last week he doesn't believe Manchin intends to enter the gubernatorial race, adding that they've been friends for decades.\n\nWest Virginia Democratic Party officials said Friday Manchin did not give them a heads up he was switching to independent. In a statement Friday, state Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin said he was disappointed.\n\n\"While the senator has been one of the most independent senators in the country, and has sometimes opposed the Democratic agenda, we'll always be grateful for his votes to impeach President Trump, to create the January 6th Commission, and his warning that, if re-elected, Trump 'will destroy democracy in America,'\" he said.\n\nManchin first entered the Senate after winning a special election following the death of Robert C. Byrd in 2010. The state's political tilt has changed dramatically since then.\n\nRegistered Democrats outnumbered Republicans during Manchin's first two Senate campaigns, but those numbers have flipped. Now, about 40% of registered voters are Republicans, compared with 31% for Democrats and about 24% with no party affiliation.\n\nBoth chambers of the Legislature have Republican supermajorities, and Trump overwhelmingly won the state in 2016 and 2020.\n\nManchin had also flirted with the possibility of running for president as a third-party candidate, but decided against that in February, saying he didn't want to be a \"spoiler.\"\n\nManchin, the last in a line of powerful Senate Democrats from West Virginia who promoted coal interests at the national level, has increasingly lamented the two-party system in the past year. During a tour of a Charleston stamping plant in October, he said he identified more with independents than either party.\n\n\"Don't worry about the 'D' or the 'R', worry about the person -- who is that person?\" he said. \"There can be a good D and a bad D and a good R and a bad R, but the identity -- I like more the independent identity.\"", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType":

Joe Manchin of West Virginia registers as an independent", "body": "Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia announced Friday he has registered as an independent, raising questions about his future political plans.\n\nManchin has often been at odds with the Democratic Party and an obstacle to many of President Joe Biden's legislative priorities.\n\nHe had announced in November that he wouldn't seek re-election to the Senate in the heavily GOP state, making Republicans heavy favorites to pick up a seat in their bid to retake the majority next year.\n\nManchin has served in the Senate since 2010. He serves as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He said in a statement that over the past 15 years he has seen both major political parties leave their constituents behind \"for partisan extremism while jeopardizing our democracy.\"\n\n\"Today, our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground,\" Manchin said. \"To stay true to myself and remain committed to put country before party, I have decided to register as an independent with no party affiliation and continue to fight for America's sensible majority.\"\n\nBut his announcement left many questions unanswered. Manchin did not disclose if he will continue caucusing with Democrats in the Senate, where they hold a slim majority. And he did not indicate if he will be running for political office in the near future.\n\nA request for further comment from his office was not immediately returned.\n\nManchin announced in February that he would not be running for president, saying he didn't want to be a \"spoiler.\"\n\n\"I will not be seeking a third-party run,\" he said in a speech at West Virginia University. \"I will not be involved in a presidential run. I will be involved in making sure that we secure a president that has the knowledge and has the passion and has the ability to bring this country together.\"\n\nThe speech was billed as part of a national listening tour Manchin announced when he decided not to seek another Senate term. He told the Morgantown audience that he had no interest in being \"a deal-breaker, if you will, a spoiler, whatever you want to call it.\"\n\n\"I just don't think it's the right time,\" he said then.\n\nFacing potential retirement, Manchin appears to be keeping all options open - for another Senate race or a potential run for governor.\n\nManchin has long wanted to switch his party affiliation to become an independent, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. But a looming deadline in West Virginia forced the issue.\n\nCandidates must file with their affiliation 60 days prior to the Aug. 1 deadline in West Virginia to run in this years election. If the Senate candidates stumble, Manchin could be poised to try to keep his seat. Or he could run for governor.\n\nManchin did not say whether he will caucus with Democrats, but he would lose his chairmanship of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee if he does not align with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in some way. Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema does not caucus with Senate Democrats, but is still considered part of the majority party because she receives her committee assignments from Schumer.\n\nManchin entered the Senate after winning a special election following the death of Robert C. Byrd. He won reelection in both 2012 and 2018, with the latter campaign his toughest in his three-plus decades in West Virginia politics. He defeated Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey by just over 3 percentage points.\n\nRegistered Democrats outnumbered Republicans during Manchin's first two Senate campaigns, but things have changed since then. Now, about 40% of registered voters are Republicans, compared with 31% for Democrats and about 24% with no party affiliation.\n\nBoth chambers of the Legislature have Republican supermajorities, and Donald Trump overwhelmingly won the state in 2016 and 2020.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Manchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Energy_and_Natural_Resources", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Morrisey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Morrisey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrsten_Sinema", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrsten Sinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.nbcdfw.com/2024/05/GettyImages-2148201355.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C158px%2C5994px%2C3375px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614709", "eventUri": "eng-9614709", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-01", "textStart": 2615, "textEnd": 2621}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Joe Manchin of West Virginia registers as independent, citing 'partisan extremism'", "body": "By LISA MASCARO, KEVIN FREKING and LEAH WILLINGHAM (Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia announced Friday he has switched his registration to independent, raising questions about his political plans since the move could help his chances should he seek elected office again in a state that has turned heavily Republican.\n\nManchin, 76, has often been at odds with the Democratic Party and an obstacle to many of President Joe Biden's legislative priorities. But he played a central role in helping Biden get a landmark climate change and health care bill over the finish line in 2022.\n\nHe had already announced in November that he wouldn't seek re-election to the Senate, giving Republicans a clear path to picking up his West Virginia seat in their bid to retake the majority next year.\n\nManchin has served in the Senate since 2010 and is the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He said in a statement that over the past 15 years he has seen both major political parties leave their constituents behind for \"partisan extremism while jeopardizing our democracy.\"\n\n\"Today, our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground,\" Manchin said. \"To stay true to myself and remain committed to put country before party, I have decided to register as an independent with no party affiliation and continue to fight for America's sensible majority.\"\n\nManchin will continue to caucus with Democrats and keep his chairmanship, according to a person familiar with his thinking who was granted anonymity to share his plans. The move helps Democrats preserve their slim 51-49 majority in the Senate.\n\nStill, facing potential retirement from politics, Manchin appears to be keeping other options open.\n\nHe has long wanted to switch his party affiliation to become an independent, according to a second person familiar with the situation who was granted anonymity to discuss it. But a looming deadline in West Virginia forced the issue.\n\nCandidates must file their political affiliation 60 days prior to a Aug. 1 deadline to run in this year's election.\n\nNow registered as an independent, Manchin still has time to mount another Senate race or a potential run for governor, a position he held from 2005 to 2010.\n\nHe had gone back and forth for months before announcing he wasn't running for reelection to the Senate. Many questioned whether he could win against the immensely popular Gov. Jim Justice, the Republican Senate nominee who Manchin helped recruit to run for governor as a Democrat in 2016. Justice switched to Republican at a rally with then-President Donald Trump not long into his first term.\n\nShould the Senate candidates stumble, Manchin could be poised to try to keep his seat. But a run for governor could be more favorable.\n\nManchin has defeated the Republican nominee for governor, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, once before, in 2018. That Senate campaign was Manchin's toughest in his three-plus decades in West Virginia politics. He defeated Morrisey by just over 3 percentage points.\n\nSteve Williams, who is the Democratic nominee for governor and the mayor of Huntington, said last week he doesn't believe Manchin intends to enter the gubernatorial race, adding that they've been friends for decades.\n\nWest Virginia Democratic Party officials said Friday Manchin did not give them a heads up he was switching to independent. In a statement Friday, state Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin said he was disappointed.\n\n\"While the senator has been one of the most independent senators in the country, and has sometimes opposed the Democratic agenda, we'll always be grateful for his votes to impeach President Trump, to create the January 6th Commission, and his warning that, if re-elected, Trump 'will destroy democracy in America,'\" he said.\n\nManchin first entered the Senate after winning a special election following the death of Robert C. Byrd in 2010. The state's political tilt has changed dramatically since then.\n\nRegistered Democrats outnumbered Republicans during Manchin's first two Senate campaigns, but those numbers have flipped. Now, about 40% of registered voters are Republicans, compared with 31% for Democrats and about 24% with no party affiliation.\n\nBoth chambers of the Legislature have Republican supermajorities, and Trump overwhelmingly won the state in 2016 and 2020.\n\nManchin had also flirted with the possibility of running for president as a third-party candidate, but decided against that in February, saying he didn't want to be a \"spoiler.\"\n\nManchin, the last in a line of powerful Senate Democrats from West Virginia who promoted coal interests at the national level, has increasingly lamented the two-party system in the past year. During a tour of a Charleston stamping plant in October, he said he identified more with independents than either party.\n\n\"Don't worry about the 'D' or the 'R', worry about the person -- who is that person?\" he said. \"There can be a good D and a bad D and a good R and a bad R, but the identity -- I like more the independent identity.\"\n\n-- -\n\nAssociated Press writers Farnoush Amiri and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.

The news of Manchin's decision to register as an independent raises new questions about his political future and ambitions.\n\n\"Our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground,\" Manchin stated. \"To stay true to myself and remain committed to putting country before party, I have decided to register as an independent with no party affiliation and continue to fight for America's sensible majority.\"\n\nIf Manchin decides to pursue a Senate or governor run, he must file a statement of candidacy and gather approximately 8,000 signatures by August 1 to be included on the ballot. In March, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer reportedly discussed the possibility of Manchin running for reelection as an independent, although Manchin initially expressed skepticism about the idea.\n\nDespite this recent development, a spokesperson for Manchin confirmed that he will still caucus with Democrats in the Senate. It is worth noting that there are other senators, such as Bernie Sanders, Angus King, and Kyrsten Sinema, who are registered as independents but align with Senate Democrats.\n\nAs the situation continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how Manchin's decision to register as an independent will impact the political landscape in West Virginia and beyond. This story will be updated with any further developments.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Manchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red states and blue states"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrsten_Sinema", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrsten Sinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_King", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angus King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Independent_Living", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Independent Living", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash_Registers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash Registers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614709", "eventUri": "eng-9614709", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-01", "textStart": 935, "textEnd": 943}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) did when she left the party in 2022. A spokesperson later reversed course, confirming that \"nothing will change with caucusing with the Democrats,\" a move that allows the Senate Energy Committee chairman to keep his gavel.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was not clear whether Manchin made him aware of the decision before it was announced publicly.\n\nManchin, who's often irked his liberal Democratic colleagues for his more centrist political views, is not seeking reelection this November. He's served since 2010.\n\nManchin's party affiliation switch comes amid speculation about his political future and potential longshot third-party runs for other offices. He shot down conjecture on Wednesday that he would mount a last-minute campaign for governor, an office he previously held. And although he's also previously declined an independent Senate run, his latest move fueled further rumors of another bid for statewide office.\n\nNotably, if Manchin did want to seek another office, Saturday is the deadline by which he needed to become an independent to run as one by the Aug. 1 candidate filing deadline.\n\nThe party switch also came the day after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was found guilty by a Manhattan jury on 34 felony counts of falsifying documents in his New York hush-money trial, but Manchin made no indication the two were related.\n\n\"Throughout my days in elected office, I have always been proud of my commitment to common sense, bipartisanship and my desire to bring people together,\" Manchin said. \"It's who I am.

Joe Manchin -- a longtime moderate Democrat -- has switched his party registration to independent mere months before he was expected to leave the Senate, raising questions about whether he intends to mount another campaign.\n\nOn Friday, May 31, Manchin posted a photo on X that appears to show him holding an updated voter registration form.\n\nIn a follow-up statement released on Friday, Manchin said, \"Throughout my days in elected office, I have always been proud of my commitment to common sense, bipartisanship and my desire to bring people together. It's who I am. It's who I will always be. I have never seen America through a partisan lens.\"\n\n\"Today, our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground,\" he continued. \"To stay true to myself and remain committed to put country before party, I have decided to register as an independent with no party affiliation and continue to fight for America's sensible majority.\"\n\nManchin, 76, revealed in November that he did not intend to seek reelection in 2024, which would almost certainly hand his Senate seat to Republicans in the deep-red state of West Virginia. At the time, he had teased running for president on a third-party ticket, but then he ruled that out, too.\n\nRelated: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin Says He's 'Thinking' About Becoming an Independent\n\nThe former West Virginia governor is a rare Democrat who has found success in the Mountain State, touting his moderate values and willingness to challenge his own party to win over conservative voters. He has long entertained the idea of leaving the Democratic Party, but never took steps toward changing his registration.\n\nThe timing of his party switch -- months before his presumed retirement from politics and just ahead of the deadline to file as an independent in West Virginia -- quickly ignited murmurs that he may cave to pressure from Democrats at the last moment and run for another term in Senate, to prevent the seat from turning red.\n\nAnother theory is that he could be eyeing his old job as governor.\n\nRelated: Sen. Joe Manchin Says He Can Handle Attacks from Both Sides That Paint Him as 'the Hero and the Villain'\n\nManchin, who currently chairs the Senate Energy Committee, was elected to Congress' upper chamber in 2010, after serving nearly six years as West Virginia governor.\n\nHe rose through the ranks of West Virginia politics the old-fashioned way, beginning as a state delegate in the '80s, then serving in the state Senate for 10 years, then becoming secretary of state before launching his gubernatorial bid.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Manchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrats", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Democrats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_House_of_Delegates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland House of Delegates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Energy_and_Natural_Resources", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xIpx6jMVNBpAcktD3ABekg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/ec2425a38a76a9d94bc1281a2933adb1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614709", "eventUri": "eng-9614709", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 448, "textEnd": 454}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Manchin won a full Senate term in 2012 and a second term in 2018.\n\nBut he won that race over Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey by a little more than 20,000 votes, or 3 percentage points, as the state shifted ruby red, propelled by Donald Trump's rise in 2016. In 2020, Trump captured nearly 70% of the vote in West Virginia.\n\nEarlier this month, current Gov. Jim Justice, backed by Trump, won the Republican nomination for Senate and had been favored to succeed Manchin in the fall. But Manchin's surprise move could scramble that race if he decides to run for re-election as an independent.\n\nA more likely scenario is that Manchin seeks his old job as governor -- a potential race that would pit him in a rematch with the GOP nominee, Morrisey, as well as against the Democratic nominee, Huntington Mayor Steve Williams.\n\nIf he is considering an independent bid for either office, Manchin had until June 1 to change his party affiliation; West Virginia state law allows the secretary of state to refuse to certify a candidate if they were registered to vote with a different party within 60 days of filing to run for office.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_wong@cnbc.com", "name": "Scott Wong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kate_santaliz@cnbc.com", "name": "Kate Santaliz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Manchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Morrisey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Morrisey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Justice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106965814-1635259832681-gettyimages-1236140087-MANCHIN_ECO_CLUB.jpeg?v=1635259869&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614709", "eventUri": "eng-9614709", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-01", "textStart": 929, "textEnd": 935}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2079, "textEnd": 2085}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Many progressive activists accused him of being too friendly with the energy industry that dominated his home state.\n\nLater, Mr Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer negotiated the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest piece of legislation to combat climate change, but which also included leases for offshore drilling.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_garcia@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Eric Garcia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Manchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Labels", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "No Labels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_Senate_special_election_in_Massachusetts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2010 United States Senate special election in Massachusetts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation Reduction Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Democratic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senate Democratic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrsten_Sinema", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrsten Sinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_drilling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offshore drilling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/3209d88aa9ce1ec1eb720eb0caa844d7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614709", "eventUri": "eng-9614709", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

However, he said it would be \"very challenging\" and a \"deal-breaker\" or \"spoiler.\"\n\n\"The system right now is not set up for [it].

This move comes after Manchin had previously stated that he would not be seeking re-election this November and ruled out running for president as a rebel candidate.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Manchin has been known for his efforts to strengthen Democratic support in his predominantly red state while wielding significant conservative influence over legislation in Washington DC. As the chair of the Senate energy and natural resources committee, Manchin has often found himself at odds with both the White House and his fellow Democrats on key issues such as spending and the environment.\n\nIn a statement, Manchin expressed his frustration with the current state of national politics, criticizing both major political parties for their partisan extremism and failure to find common ground. By registering as an independent with no party affiliation, Manchin aims to prioritize the interests of the American people over party loyalty.\n\nWhile Manchin did not confirm whether he would continue to caucus with Democrats in the Senate, his decision to register as an independent raises questions about his potential future political endeavors.

Manchin Registers As Independent, Leaving Democrat Party Behind", "body": "West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, a longtime Democrat, announced that he is leaving the Democrat party and will be switching to register as an Independent.\n\nIn a news release on Friday, Manchin, who is not running for re-election in the Senate, declared that he would be switching his party affiliation at the West Virginia State Capitol.\n\n\"From my first day in public service in 1982, I have always focused on doing what's best for my state and my country, without regard to party or politics. Throughout my days in elected office, I have always been proud of my commitment to common sense, bipartisanship and my desire to bring people together. It's who I am. It's who I will always be. I have never seen America through a partisan lens,\" Manchin said.\n\n\"However, since becoming a United States Senator in 2010, I have seen both the Democrat and Republican parties leave West Virginia and our country behind for partisan extremism while jeopardizing our democracy. Today, our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground. To stay true to myself and remain committed to put country before party, I have decided to register as an Independent with no party affiliation and continue to fight for America's sensible majority.\"\n\nThe decision comes after reports surfaced in the news regarding how Manchin was encouraged to run for governor of The Mountain State by moderate Republicans who were unsatisfied with the party's nominee, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R-W.Va).\n\nAt the time, Manchin downplayed the rumors, but he also said that he would not completely rule it out. He also expressed that the Democrat nominee, Huntington Mayor Steve Williams, is a good friend.\n\n\"I heard that this morning, the rumors. I've supported my friend Steve Williams, we've known each other for 40 years, got him involved. He's a good person. I don't know what's going on. So basically, I'll just wait until I go home,\" Manchin said.\n\nManchin's announcement left many questions unanswered, as he did not disclose whether he will continue caucusing with Democrats in the Senate, where they currently have a slim majority. Additionally, he had not yet indicated if he would be running for gubernatorial office in the near future.\n\n\"The talk about the possibility of Joe Manchin running for West Virginia governor again is real,\" wrote Hoppy Kercheval, a news anchor and one of the state's most recognizable media figures.\n\nThe Democrat primary is now over and Manchin could not run for governor as a Democrat.

Joe Manchin registers as an independent", "body": "(CNN) -- Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a longtime moderate Democrat, announced on Friday that he is registering as an independent.\n\nManchin announced last year that he would not run for reelection in the deep red state, creating an opportunity for Republicans to flip the Senate seat. The news that Manchin has registered as an independent raises fresh questions, however, over his political future and aspirations.\n\n\"Our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground,\" Manchin, who has long been a pivotal swing vote in the Senate, said in a statement. \"To stay true to myself and remain committed to put country before party, I have decided to register as an independent with no party affiliation and continue to fight for America's sensible majority.\"\n\nIf Manchin decides to run for Senate or governor, he has until August 1 to file a statement of candidacy and submit the necessary signatures needed to get on the ballot. He would need about 8,000 signatures to appear on the ballot.\n\nCNN reported in March that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer approached Manchin about running for reelection as an independent.\n\n\"I think that's a long, long, long-shot scenario,\" Manchin said at the time. \"So I don't anticipate that happening. I don't anticipate running.\"\n\nBut when asked if that meant the door was completely closed, he did not rule it out, saying at the time, \"I don't know if anything in Washington, DC, is 100%.\"\n\nA Manchin spokesperson told CNN that he will continue to caucus with Democrats in the Senate.\n\nThere are several senators who are registered as independents who caucus with Senate Democrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Angus King of Maine and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Today, our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground.\"\n\nMr. Manchin's departure from the party does not change Democrat control of the Senate.\n\nHe joins Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), both of whom caucus with the Democrats.\n\nMr. Manchin, who has been in the Senate since November 2010, has been critical of President Joe Biden, particularly regarding his green energy policies, despite voting for the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which included aggressive climate change-related measures.\n\nHe was key in preventing the Democrats from abolishing the filibuster, which requires 60 votes for most legislation to proceed to a final vote in the Senate.\n\nMr. Manchin, 76, explored a possible third-party run. However, he said it would be \"very challenging\" and a \"deal-breaker\" or \"spoiler.\"\n\n\"The system right now is not set up for [it]. [In] the long game, maybe we can make a third party viable where it has a process and opportunity. Right now, it's very challenging,\" he said.\n\n\"And I'm not going to be a deal breaker, if you will, spoiler, whatever you want to call it,\" he continued. \"I just don't think it's the right time.\"\n\nHe has declined to endorse President Biden's re-election campaign.\n\n\"I'm not endorsing anybody right now. We're going to see what all happens,\" Mr. Manchin told CNN on Feb. 19.\n\n\"I've had this conversation with him and with his people that he's gone too far to the left. They've pushed him and pulled him, and whatever. But that's not where America is. That's not where our country is,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm hoping the Joe Biden that we saw in 2020 will be the Joe Biden we see in 2024 if that can be done. If not, it's going to be a long road for everybody,\" he added.\n\nMr. Manchin declined to run for re-election this year and his seat is expected to flip to the GOP with the election of Gov.

When the 76-year-old two-term incumbent and former governor announced his retirement from the Senate last November and then passed up an independent presidential run earlier this year, it appeared he would drift off into history as one of the last of his breed. He had very recently even reinforced his tenuous ties to the Democrats he has disrespected regularly by endorsing the party's nominee for West Virginia governor, Steve Williams.\n\nBut now, halfway out the door, Manchin has suddenly announced he is switching his voter registration status from Democratic to independent. The timing is almost certainly significant: Today is the final day West Virginia candidates can establish their party status for the 2024 general election. Now, Manchin has until August 1, in theory, to decide whether to abandon retirement and run for another Senate term as an independent, or perhaps abandon Williams and run for governor, a position he held from 2005 to 2010.\n\nEven as an independent, and even if all this waffling over his intentions doesn't offend West Virginia voters, this isn't a particularly good time for Manchin or any other non-Republican to run for statewide office in that state, which Donald Trump won by 42 points in 2016 and 39 points in 2020. His Senate seat will almost certainly be occupied by Governor Jim Justice, a longtime Manchin rival who is himself a former Democrat. Before Manchin announced his retirement, Justice was leading him by double digits in the polls. Loyalty to Williams aside, a gubernatorial run might make more sense: Republican nominee Patrick Morrisey isn't terribly popular; he just won a close and complicated GOP primary; and he lost to Manchin in a 2018 Senate race.\n\nBut who knows what Manchin is thinking? He's been playing Hamlet for a long time, both in West Virginia, where his political future has been a constant topic of puzzled speculation for decades now, and in Washington, where he has thoroughly enjoyed driving his fellow Democrats nuts with his demands for legislative concessions to keep his vote in the party column. Nobody has forgotten his two-year reign as King of America, when Democratic control of the chamber was constantly threatened by Manchin and his sidekick, Kyrsten Sinema (who is also leaving the Senate this year); they did eventually allow Joe Biden some significant accomplishments, but not without quite a bit of pain and angst. Manchin has been a bit of a lame duck since Democrats lost the House in 2022 (while picking up a Senate seat to reduce any one senator's leverage), ending the trifecta that gave him his power to make or break legislation. So his drift toward a post-political retirement seemed inevitable -- until now.\n\nAs we await the final word on Manchin's future, his newly independent status adds another member to the odd pack of indies participating in the Senate Democratic Caucus:\n\nDemocrats will mourn the likely loss of his Senate seat, but they may be quite happy to give Joe Manchin a ticket to the political boneyard.

Today, our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground. To stay true to myself and remain committed to put country before party, I have decided to register as an independent with no party affiliation and continue to fight for America's sensible majority.\n\nManchin announced in late 2023 that he would not be seeking re-election to the Senate in 2024, and initially said he would \"absolutely\" consider a run for president, before saying in February 2024 that he would not because he didn't want to be a \"spoiler.\"\n\nThe deadline to register as a candidate for president in West Virginia is Aug. 1.

Joe Manchin (D-WV) is finally pulling the trigger. The West Virginia senator announced Friday he will leave the Democrat party, a long-speculated move for the retiring senator.\n\n\"My commitment to do everything I can to bring our country together has led me to register as an independent with no party affiliation,\" Manchin posted on X:\n\nManchin's party affiliation might not change his style of governance. He reportedly will continue caucusing with Democrats, joining three other independents.\n\nSens. Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) and Angus King (I-ME) also style themselves as moderates, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-NH) has used his progressive stances to power a large fundraising operation and two presidential runs:\n\nBy continuing to caucus with Democrats, Manchin can continue chairing the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\nHowever, the timing of Manchin's announcement, less than 24 hours after a Manhattan jury found former President Donald Trump guilty on 34 counts for falsifying business records, fuels speculation about his next move.\n\nManchin could opt to run for a third Senate term as an independent. Potential candidates for West Virginia's Senate seat reportedly must declare themselves a member of a political party by June 1 to run in November under that party's banner. Candidates have until August 1 to declare their intent to run:\n\nGov. Jim Justice (R-WV), himself a former Democrat, is the Republican nominee for the Senate seat Manchin is vacating, decisively winning a contested primary. Justice would be a tough opponent for Manchin, who has held office as a Democrat even as West Virginia has shifted massively towards Republicans.\n\nManchin has also flirted with the possibility of a presidential run. He has criticized President Joe Biden for hostility towards American energy and refusing to fix the border crisis that is \"his fault.\" And he previously expressed interest in launching a candidacy on the \"No Labels\" ticket, particularly if Biden had a \"health scare.\"\n\nYet Manchin announced in February he \"will not be seeking a third-party run\" and \"will not be involved in a presidential run.\"\n\nAny opening for Manchin - or anyone else - to win as a third party or independent candidate is miniscule. The dust has yet to settle after the Manhattan jury's monumental verdict; however, Trump's monumental fundraising in the hours after the verdict - overwhelming traffic shut down the GOP's online fundraising platform Thursday evening - suggests Trump might consolidate or even grow his support.", "source": {"uri": "tjvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Manchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrsten_Sinema", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrsten Sinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_King", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angus King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Energy_and_Natural_Resources", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Justice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://tjvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/manchin.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614709", "eventUri": "eng-9614709", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1337, "textEnd": 1343}, {"amb": false, "date": "-08-01", "textStart": 1412, "textEnd": 1420}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Joe Manchin registers as an independent", "body": "(CNN) -- Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a longtime moderate Democrat, announced on Friday that he is registering as an independent.\n\nManchin announced last year that he would not run for reelection in the deep red state, creating an opportunity for Republicans to flip the Senate seat. The news that Manchin has registered as an independent raises fresh questions, however, over his political future and aspirations.\n\n\"Our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground,\" Manchin, who has long been a pivotal swing vote in the Senate, said in a statement. \"To stay true to myself and remain committed to put country before party, I have decided to register as an independent with no party affiliation and continue to fight for America's sensible majority.\"\n\nIf Manchin decides to run for Senate or governor, he has until August 1 to file a statement of candidacy and submit the necessary signatures needed to get on the ballot. He would need about 8,000 signatures to appear on the ballot.\n\nCNN reported in March that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer approached Manchin about running for reelection as an independent.\n\n\"I think that's a long, long, long-shot scenario,\" Manchin said at the time. \"So I don't anticipate that happening. I don't anticipate running.\"\n\nBut when asked if that meant the door was completely closed, he did not rule it out, saying at the time, \"I don't know if anything in Washington, DC, is 100%.\"\n\nThere are several senators who are registered as independents who caucus with Senate Democrats, including Sen.

Joe Manchin Switches Party Registration to Independent, Prompting Speculation About His Political Future", "body": "Kyler Alvord is a news editor at PEOPLE, leading the brand's political coverage. He joined the publication in 2021 on the crime beat.\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin -- a longtime moderate Democrat -- has switched his party registration to independent mere months before he was expected to leave the Senate, raising questions about whether he intends to mount another campaign.\n\nOn Friday, May 31, Manchin posted a photo on X that appears to show him holding an updated voter registration form.\n\nIn a follow-up statement released on Friday, Manchin said, \"Throughout my days in elected office, I have always been proud of my commitment to common sense, bipartisanship and my desire to bring people together. It's who I am. It's who I will always be. I have never seen America through a partisan lens.\"\n\n\"Today, our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground,\" he continued. \"To stay true to myself and remain committed to put country before party, I have decided to register as an independent with no party affiliation and continue to fight for America's sensible majority.\"\n\nManchin, 76, revealed in November that he did not intend to seek reelection in 2024, which would almost certainly hand his Senate seat to Republicans in the deep-red state of West Virginia. At the time, he had teased running for president on a third-party ticket, but then he ruled that out, too.\n\nThe former West Virginia governor is a rare Democrat who has found success in the Mountain State, touting his moderate values and willingness to challenge his own party to win over conservative voters. He has long entertained the idea of leaving the Democratic Party, but never took steps toward changing his registration.\n\nThe timing of his party switch -- months before his presumed retirement from politics and just ahead of the deadline to file as an independent in West Virginia -- quickly ignited murmurs that he may cave to pressure from Democrats at the last moment and run for another term in Senate, to prevent the seat from turning red.\n\nAnother theory is that he could be eyeing his old job as governor.\n\nManchin, who currently chairs the Senate Energy Committee, was elected to Congress' upper chamber in 2010, after serving nearly six years as West Virginia governor.\n\nHe rose through the ranks of West Virginia politics the old-fashioned way, beginning as a state delegate in the '80s, then serving in the state Senate for 10 years, then becoming secretary of state before launching his gubernatorial bid.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Manchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrats", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Democrats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voter registration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_House_of_Delegates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland House of Delegates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Energy_and_Natural_Resources", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/EMp9VrLHPo1WoYdEU2d_A2YFpFY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x399:751x401)/joe-manchin-f447df1bd7fd45f4aaa1d48799c2c914.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614709", "eventUri": "eng-9614709", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 390, "textEnd": 396}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Joe Manchin on Friday announced he has left the Democratic Party and registered as an independent at the West Virginia State Capitol.\n\nManchin said in a statement he made the decision because both the Republican and Democratic parties have \"left our country behind for partisan extremism.\"\n\n\"Today, our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground. To stay true to myself and remain committed to put country before party, I have decided to register as an independent with no party affiliation and continue to fight for America's sensible majority.\"\n\nIn November Manchin said he would not seek another term in the Senate. He considers himself a centrist but fellow Democrats accused him of siding too often with Republicans.\n\n\"From my first day in public service in 1982, I have always focused on doing what's best for my state and my country, without regard to party or politics,\" Manchin's Friday statement said. \"Throughout my days in elected office, I have always been proud of my commitment to common sense, bipartisanship and my desire to bring people together. It's who I am. It's who I will always be. I have never seen America through a partisan lens.\"\n\nIn February, Manchin said he would not run for president, either as an independent or third-party candidate. He said then he didn't want a potential campaign to be a \"deal-breaker\" or a \"spoiler.\"\n\nAccording to a January Gallup poll the number of Americans who consider themselves political independents is the highest since 2014.\n\nThat poll showed 43% of Americans across the country identifying ads political independents. Gallup found that the percent of people considering themselves political independents has been 40% or higher since 2011.\n\nThe poll also found independents lean more toward the Republican party that toward Democrats.\n\nIn December 2022 former Democrat Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona left the party to become an independent.\n\nShe said at the time that there was a \"broken partisan system\" in Washington.\n\nSen.

Joe Manchin III, W.Va., seen here in February, announced Friday he has changed his registration to independent. Matt McClain/The Washington Post\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia announced Friday that he has changed his party registration to independent, fueling speculation he could run for office again in November after announcing his retirement last year.\n\n\"My commitment to do everything I can to bring our country together has led me to register as an independent with no party affiliation,\" Manchin wrote on X.\n\nManchin did not immediately say anything about his political plans. But the move allows him to possibly reconsider his plan to not seek reelection - or to run for governor, a job he previously held.\n\nAug. 1 is the deadline for independent candidates to file for office in West Virginia.\n\nThe centrist senator announced in November 2023 that he would not run for another term, handing Republicans a likely pickup seat in solidly red West Virginia. The GOP nominee for the seat is the state's governor, Jim Justice.\n\nFor months, Manchin flirted with running for president as an independent or third-party candidate, worrying Democrats who anticipated a close rematch between President Biden and former president Donald Trump. But Manchin announced in February that he would \"not be involved in a presidential run\" this year.\n\nSpeculation has picked up in recent weeks that Manchin may be mulling a return to the governor's office, though he reportedly said this week he would not enter the race. He said he is supporting the Democratic nominee, Steve Williams.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

To stay true to myself and remain committed to put country before party, I have decided to register as an independent with no party affiliation and continue to fight for America's sensible majority.\"\n\nManchin, 76, announced in November that he would not seek re-election to a third full term in 2024 and briefly entertained but ultimately declined a third-party run for the presidency.\n\n\"I will not be seeking a third-party run,\" he told West Virginia University students in a February speech, adding that he did not want to be a \"spoiler\" candidate.\n\nThe centrist senator has previously said he was considering abandoning the Democratic Party amid public spats with the Biden administration over energy policy and out-of-control federal spending.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) departed the Democratic Party in December 2022, as she and Manchin impeded some of President Biden's domestic agenda and sought to uphold the norms of the upper chamber, including its 60-vote filibuster threshold to pass most legislation.\n\nSinema no longer caucuses with Democrats and opted to not run for re-election in March.\n\nReps for Manchin's office did not respond to questions about whether the senator would still caucus with Democrats or affiliate with the party as an elected official.\n\nThe announcement followed the first-ever conviction of a US president, with a Manhattan jury finding former President Donald Trump guilty on 34 counts of business fraud on Thursday for hiding evidence of \"hush money\" payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election to cover up a decade-old alleged extramarital affair.\n\nManchin -- the only Democrat currently serving in a statewide office in deep-red West Virginia -- did not issue a statement on the verdict.\n\nWest Virginia GOP Gov.

His departure follows a similar move by Senator Kyrsten Sinema. This decision impacts the Senate dynamics but doesn't weaken the slim Democratic majority.\n\nRetiring U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, a frequent thorn in the side of the Democratic Party, on Friday left the Democrats, decrying \"partisan extremism\" as he followed in the footsteps of fellow former party maverick Senator Kyrsten Sinema. Like Sinema, Manchin registered as an independent. The 76-year-old West Virginia lawmaker's move will have no practical effect as he, like his Arizona colleague, will continue to caucus with Democrats, who hold a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate. Republicans, however, are seen as all but certain to win his seat in the Nov. 5 election.\n\n\"Our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground,\" Manchin said in a statement, adding that both parties had embraced \"partisan extremism\" and were putting democracy in jeopardy. Manchin and Sinema were key votes on multiple pieces of legislation early in Democratic President Joe Biden's administration, including a massive infrastructure bill.\n\nBut he has also forced some sweeping legislation to be scaled back and, along with Sinema, stood in the way of plans to reform or scrap the filibuster, a procedural tool that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation in the chamber. Manchin, a former state legislator and governor who arrived in the Senate in November 2010, announced last year that he would not seek reelection in November. He has been the subject of speculation that he would seek another political office.\n\nSinema has also said she will leave the Senate after serving one six-year term. Republicans have a strong chance of capturing a Senate majority in November, as Democrats are defending more than a half-dozen competitive seats while the Republicans up for reelection are in solidly Republican states.\n\nRepublican West Virginia Governor Jim Justice is expected to easily capture Manchin's seat, according to nonpartisan analysts. Former President Donald Trump won the state in 2020, taking a whopping 69% of the vote to 30% for Biden.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@devdiscourse.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrsten_Sinema", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrsten Sinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Manchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Justice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filibuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/09_01_2022_18_34_26_325049.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614709", "eventUri": "eng-9614709", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 856, "textEnd": 862}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-11-", "textStart": 1585, "textEnd": 1598}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Joe Manchin has officially left the Democratic Party, and the West Virginia senator is now a registered independent.\n\nManchin has long presented himself as a moderate, facilitating his political survival in one of the most Republican states in the union. It wasn't immediately clear if the move was a setup for the now-former Democrat to backtrack on his pledge to not run for re-election in the Senate or to stage a late gubernatorial bid.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) officially left the Democratic Party on Friday and registered as an independent.\n\nWhy it matters: Manchin, who flirted with an independent presidential bid earlier this year, has said he's not running for Senate re-election. But leaving the party could give him the flexibility to change tack and run for Senate or West Virginia governor as an independent.\n\nWith all due respect to West Virginians, if they fall for this, they deserve the representation they get. If Manchin's \"sane Democrat\" act was ever real, it ceased to be in 2022 when he voted for the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nFor those who don't remember how brazen Manchin's betrayal was, he promised Republicans he would not move Biden's big-spending boondoggle forward. In response, GOP senators agreed to pass the CHIPS Act.\n\nA bit of an aside, but take a wild guess at how that's going.\n\nRegardless, after Republicans gave up their leverage with the CHIPS Act, Manchin reversed course and announced he would vote for the Inflation Reduction Act. The reason? It appears all it took was fluffing Manchin's ego while making a few false promises.\n\nSEE: Details of How Joe Manchin Was Bought Off Reveal the World's Biggest Sucker\n\nAs the above link shows, I called Manchin the \"world's biggest sucker\" at the time. It didn't take long before I was vindicated. Democrats refused to move forward on overhauling the permitting process for energy projects while the White House used the Inflation Reduction Act to set money on fire in the name of \"climate change.\"\n\nManchin's response? To go on Fox News and threaten to repeal the act, something that he knew was impossible given Biden would have to sign such a repeal. In other words, it was yet more kabuki theater from the \"moderate.\"\n\nSEE: Joe Manchin Pathetically Tries to Flip the Script After Nuking His Career\n\nBecoming an independent has not made any of the above go away. As I said when he first folded and voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, Manchin's career should be over. This wasn't a case of him being bamboozled. He was warned over and over what he was signing on to and he did it anyway.\n\nSo he can appear on Fox News and throw his hands up, pretending he can be counted on to oppose the Democrat agenda, but everyone knows the truth because he showed it to them. He could have stood firm and not voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act. He could have chosen to stand by his friends who were counting on him to keep his word. He didn't do those things, and now he will pay the price for his actions. Manchin should look at upgrading his houseboat because he's going to be spending a lot of time on it after 2024.\n\nI stand by every word of that. Manchin could register as a Republican at this point. West Virginians should still never give him another vote.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Manchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation Reduction Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIPS_and_Science_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CHIPS and Science Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/213/8a3d2ca2-09e0-477c-b3d9-4ddbceb95243.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614709", "eventUri": "eng-9614709", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

(WBOY) -- West Virginia Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin expressed the party's disappointment Friday after Sen. Joe Manchin, who was the state's only Democratic member of its Congressional delegation, announced he had registered as an independent.\n\nManchin said in a statement that since he began his Senate career in 2010, he has \"seen both the Democrat and Republican parties leave West Virginia and our country behind for partisan extremism while jeopardizing our democracy.\"\n\n\"To stay true to myself and remain committed to put country before party, I have decided to register as an independent with no party affiliation and continue to fight for America's sensible majority,\" his statement concluded.\n\nPushkin released the statement below shortly after news broke that Manchin was no longer a Democrat:\n\nClearly the Senator thinks his new role as the head of Americans Together, an organization dedicated to bridging the divide between the two major parties, can best be served in the final 8 months of his term as an Independent.\n\nWe'd like to thank Senator Manchin for expressing his wholehearted support for Huntington Mayor Steve Williams's campaign for Governor against Patrick Morrisey just two days ago. In his endorsement of Mayor Williams, Senator Manchin said, 'My support is with Steve Williams. He's been a friend of mine for 40 years. I know how good he is, how competent he is, and I know how hard he'll work.' The Senator's support shows the appeal Steve Williams has across the political spectrum.\n\nWhile the Senator has been one of the most independent Senators in the country, and has sometimes opposed the Democratic agenda, we'll always be grateful for his votes to impeach President Trump, to create the January 6th Commission, and his warning that, if re-elected, Trump 'will destroy democracy in America.'\n\nRegardless of the party affiliation or non-party affiliation of any politician, the West Virginia Democratic Party will continue to fight for our basic core values. The right to earn a living wage, safety in the workplace, quality schools, affordable health care, and reproductive freedom for all citizens.\n\nWest Virginia's Democratic Party has lost other several members recently, with former House of Delegates Minority Leader Doug Skaff stepping down as leader, resigning from the House and registering as a Republican before running for Secretary of State, which he lost. In 2023 and 2022, politicians like Del. Elliott Pritt and State Sen. Glenn Jeffries switched parties from Democrat to Republican while staying in office.", "source": {"uri": "wboy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOY.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Joe Manchin switches party affiliation to Independent", "body": "West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin made headlines today by announcing his decision to switch party affiliation from Democrat to Independent. This move comes as a surprise to many, as Manchin has been a long-time member of the Democratic party.\n\nIn a statement released earlier today, Manchin cited growing concerns over the direction of the Democratic party and his desire to better represent the interests of his constituents in West Virginia. \"I believe that by becoming an Independent, I can better serve the people of my state and work towards finding common ground on important issues,\" Manchin said.\n\nThis decision has sparked speculation about the potential impact on the balance of power in the Senate, as Manchin's vote has often been seen as a crucial swing vote on key legislation. Political analysts are closely watching to see how this move will play out in upcoming votes and negotiations on Capitol Hill.\n\nDespite this shift in party affiliation, Manchin has reassured his supporters that his commitment to bipartisanship and working across the aisle remains unchanged. He has expressed his willingness to continue working with both Democrats and Republicans to find solutions to the pressing issues facing the country.\n\nThe news of Senator Manchin's party switch has generated a mix of reactions from politicians and the public alike.

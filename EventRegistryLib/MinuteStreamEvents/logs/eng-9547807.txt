She has previously spoken about the 'huge emotional and physical challenges'.\n\nHer husband told BBC Breakfast: 'I'm trying not to be soppy but some of the things that Lindsey does for me is proof I've found my one and only.\n\n'I've played with some strong players in my rugby career but no one is as strong a personality than Lindsey. I hope that will inspire people to be more like her...what a world that would be.'\n\nIn turn, Lindsey said: 'What keeps me going is I have three beautiful children, I have a husband I adore and I think the world of and is battling a life limiting disease. He is an inspiration to all of us.

It causes weakness that gets worse over time.'\n\nThe weakness is caused by the deterioration of motor neurons, upper motor neurons that travel from the brain down the spinal cord, and lower motor neurons that spread out to the face, throat and limbs.\n\nIt was first discovered in 1865 by a French neurologist, Jean-Martin Charcot, hence why MND is sometimes known as Charcot's disease.\n\nIn the UK, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is referred to as Motor Neurone Disease, while in the US, ALS is referred to as a specific subset of MND, which is defined as a group of neurological disorders.\n\nHowever, according to Oxford University Hospitals: 'Nearly 90 per cent of patients with MND have the mixed ALS form of the disease, so that the terms MND and ALS are commonly used to mean the same thing.'\n\nSymptoms\n\nWeakness in the ankle or leg, which may manifest itself with trips or difficulty ascending stairs, and a weakness in the ability to grip things.\n\nSlurred speech is an early symptom and may later worsen to include difficulty swallowing food.\n\nMuscle cramps or twitches are also a symptom, as is weight loss due to leg and arm muscles growing thinner over time.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nMND is difficult to diagnose in its early stages because several conditions may cause similar symptoms. There is also no one test used to ascertain its presence.\n\nHowever, the disease is usually diagnosed through a process of exclusion, whereby diseases that manifest similar symptoms to ALS are excluded.\n\nCauses\n\nThe NHS says that MND is an 'uncommon condition' that predominantly affects older people. However, it caveats that it can affect adults of any age.\n\nThe NHS says that, as of yet, 'it is not yet known why' the disease happens. The ALS Association says that MND occurs throughout the world 'with no racial, ethnic or socioeconomic boundaries and can affect anyone'.\n\nIt says that war veterans are twice as likely to develop ALS and that men are 20 per cent more likely to get it.\n\nLou Gehrig was one of baseball's preeminent stars while playing for the Yankees between 1923 and 1939. Known as 'The Iron Horse,' he played in 2,130 consecutive games before ALS forced him to retire. The record was broken by Cal Ripken Jr. in 1995\n\nLou Gehrig's Disease\n\nAs well as being known as ALS and Charcot's disease, MND is frequently referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease.\n\nLou Gehrig was a hugely popular baseball player, who played for the New York Yankees between 1923 and 1939.\n\nHe was famous for his strength and was nicknamed 'The Iron Horse'.\n\nHis strength, popularity and fame transcended the sport of baseball and the condition adopted the name of the sportsman.\n\nHe died two years after his diagnosis.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

improving the psychological wellbeing of those with the condition are \"crucial\" in the absence of a cure, researchers said.\n\nMND affects the brain and nerves, with patients eventually losing the ability to move, speak, swallow and breathe.\n\nCurrent treatments include physiotherapy to maintain muscle strength and a drug called riluzole, which can slow the progression of the disease.\n\nWhile we work hard for a cure, it is essential we support those living with MND now Prof Chris McDermott, University of Sheffield\n\nThe Commend study, led by a team from the University of Sheffield and University College London (UCL), explored whether acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) could boost the psychological health of people with MND.\n\nACT is a type of psychotherapy that combines behavioural therapy with strategies like mindfulness, encouraging patients to accept difficult thoughts and feelings rather than trying to control or avoid them.\n\nTailored psychological support could enhance the quality of life of patients with MND, a study has found (Alamy/PA)\n\nChris McDermott, a professor of translational neurology at the University of Sheffield, honorary consultant neurologist and joint lead of the trial, said: \"We desperately need treatments to slow down and stop MND.\n\n\"In a year when several large drug trials have already reported negative results we are reminded what a huge and difficult challenge that is.\n\n\"While we work hard for a cure, it is essential we support those living with MND now.\"\n\nCommend began in 2019 and involved 191 people across 16 MND centres in the UK.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to have either their usual care or their usual care plus ACT.\n\n5,000\n\nThe estimated number of people affected by MND in the UK at any one time (The MND Association)\n\nThe results, published in The Lancet, showed ACT, when combined with usual care, was \"clinically effective for maintaining or improving quality of life\" in patients with MND.\n\nResearchers said: \"As further evidence emerges confirming these findings, healthcare providers should consider how access to ACT, adapted for the specific needs of people with motor neurone disease, could be provided within motor neurone disease clinical services.\"\n\nProf McDermott added: \"The Commend study shows that tailored psychological support can have a major impact on the quality of life of those people living with MND.\"\n\nPoor quality of life and psychological distress are associated with numerous negative outcomes, including shorter survival and increased risk of suicide Prof Rebecca Gould, UCL\n\nRebecca Gould, a professor of psychological therapies at UCL, honorary clinical psychologist, chief investigator of the study and joint lead of the trial, said: \"In the absence of a cure for this devastating disease, interventions aimed at helping to improve the psychological wellbeing and quality of life of people living with MND are crucial.\n\n\"Poor quality of life and psychological distress are associated with numerous negative outcomes, including shorter survival and increased risk of suicide.\n\n\"Therefore, it is vital that we provide evidence-based interventions to help manage this.\n\n\"This study provides strong evidence that acceptance and commitment therapy can be a valuable tool for improving quality of life for the 5,000 people who are currently living with MND in the UK.\"\n\nThe study was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment and the MND Association.\n\nAccording to the MND Association, the condition can affect up to 5,000 adults in the UK at any one time.\n\nChris Bennett, head of regional services and partnerships at the charity, added: \"We know many people with MND seek help to cope with the psychological impact of the disease but often this isn't available or, if it is, not in a timely way.\n\n\"The Commend study shows psychological support can be effective in improving quality of life and that there is clear clinical benefit in acceptance commitment therapy specifically.\n\n\"It is therefore important these findings are taken forward and consideration is given to offering psychological support, such as ACT, within the standard care package to all those who may benefit from it.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

Despite the situation there is reason to smile.'\n\nMND sees messages from motor neurones in the brain and the spinal cord, which tell the body's muscles what to do, gradually stop working.\n\nThis causes the muscles to weaken, stiffen and waste.\n\nWhile some can survive for many years, such as Professor Stephen Hawking who lived with the condition for 55 years, for many the prognosis is less than five years.\n\nThere is no cure and just one licensed drug in the UK which only has a 'modest effect' in slowing down progress of the disease.\n\nCharities such as the Motor Neurone Disease Association work to support sufferers and their families, particularly with managing their quality of life, as well fund research to find a cure for the disease.\n\nThe former Leeds Rhino rugby star (pictured left) is now unable to feed himself\n\nMND affects up to 5,000 adults in the UK at any one time - one in 300 people will be affected during their lifetime - and is more prevalent in people over the age of 50.\n\nRob was diagnosed with the disease in 2019 shortly after retiring from professional sport and was given just two years to live.\n\nREAD MORE - Touching moment Rob Burrow smiles as he's presented with his CBE by Prince William - alongside his beaming wife and daughters Advertisement\n\nSince then he has defiantly fought its progress and devoted himself to fund-raising for a range of MND charities, as well as building a dedicated MND centre at the Seacroft Hospital in Leeds.\n\nSymptoms progress at varying speeds but sufferers will often experience problems in walking, talking, eating, drinking and breathing.\n\nHis wife, 40, appeared on an ITV documentary Lindsey Burrow: Who Cares for Our Carers? to discuss the challenges the pair face.\n\n'Being a carer is tough, and it has huge emotional and physical challenges, I think a lot of carers that you speak to, they'll say that you lose friends,' she said.\n\n'I've been an unpaid carer for almost five years.\n\n'My husband Rob was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in December 2019, since then, I've balanced caring for Rob while caring for our three young children and continuing to work for the NHS as a physiotherapist.\n\n'But although I'm proud to be able to do that, it's had a huge impact on my life.'\n\nRob appeared touched as the Prince of Wales told him that 'we're all so proud of you' while visiting Headingley Stadium in Leeds to present the rugby legend with his CBE\n\nThis is the adorable moment Rob's two daughters readied themselves for meeting royalty\n\nRob, 41, and his friend Kevin Sinfield showing their CBEs at Headingley Stadium in Leeds\n\nThe couple share three children together, Macy, 11, Maya, eight, and Jackson, four.\n\nIn January, the Prince of Wales told Rob 'we're all so proud of you' while visiting Headingley Stadium in Leeds to present the rugby legend with his CBE.\n\nThe royal also presented Rob with the medal - still in its box - as he lauded the former athlete's legacy and efforts in campaigning.\n\n'Thank you and congratulations - for all the inspirational work you've done, Rob,' Prince William said as the sporting icon was surrounded by his beaming wife and their children in a video shared by BBC Breakfast on X.\n\n'You've been amazing, you really have and everyone's so proud of you.\n\n'We've all been following your case. You've changed so many people's lives with MND with what you've done. We're all so proud of you.'\n\nMotor Neurone Disease (ALS): No known cure and half of sufferers live just three years after diagnosis Treatment\n\nThere is no cure for MND and the disease is fatal, however the disease progresses at different speeds in patients.\n\nPeople with MND are expected to live two to five years after the symptoms first manifest, although 10 per cent of sufferers live at least 10 years.\n\nHistory\n\nThe NHS describes motor neurone disease (MND) as: 'An uncommon condition that affects the brain and nerves. It causes weakness that gets worse over time.'\n\nThe weakness is caused by the deterioration of motor neurons, upper motor neurons that travel from the brain down the spinal cord, and lower motor neurons that spread out to the face, throat and limbs.\n\nIt was first discovered in 1865 by a French neurologist, Jean-Martin Charcot, hence why MND is sometimes known as Charcot's disease.\n\nIn the UK, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is referred to as Motor Neurone Disease, while in the US, ALS is referred to as a specific subset of MND, which is defined as a group of neurological disorders.\n\nHowever, according to Oxford University Hospitals: 'Nearly 90 per cent of patients with MND have the mixed ALS form of the disease, so that the terms MND and ALS are commonly used to mean the same thing.'\n\nSymptoms\n\nWeakness in the ankle or leg, which may manifest itself with trips or difficulty ascending stairs, and a weakness in the ability to grip things.\n\nSlurred speech is an early symptom and may later worsen to include difficulty swallowing food.\n\nMuscle cramps or twitches are also a symptom, as is weight loss due to leg and arm muscles growing thinner over time.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nMND is difficult to diagnose in its early stages because several conditions may cause similar symptoms. There is also no one test used to ascertain its presence.\n\nHowever, the disease is usually diagnosed through a process of exclusion, whereby diseases that manifest similar symptoms to ALS are excluded.\n\nCauses\n\nThe NHS says that MND is an 'uncommon condition' that predominantly affects older people. However, it caveats that it can affect adults of any age.\n\nThe NHS says that, as of yet, 'it is not yet known why' the disease happens. The ALS Association says that MND occurs throughout the world 'with no racial, ethnic or socioeconomic boundaries and can affect anyone'.\n\nIt says that war veterans are twice as likely to develop ALS and that men are 20 per cent more likely to get it.\n\nLou Gehrig was one of baseball's preeminent stars while playing for the Yankees between 1923 and 1939. Known as 'The Iron Horse,' he played in 2,130 consecutive games before ALS forced him to retire. The record was broken by Cal Ripken Jr. in 1995\n\nLou Gehrig's Disease\n\nAs well as being known as ALS and Charcot's disease, MND is frequently referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease.\n\nLou Gehrig was a hugely popular baseball player, who played for the New York Yankees between 1923 and 1939.\n\nHe was famous for his strength and was nicknamed 'The Iron Horse'.\n\nHis strength, popularity and fame transcended the sport of baseball and the condition adopted the name of the sportsman.\n\nHe died two years after his diagnosis.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

found.\n\nTreatments aimed at improving the psychological wellbeing of those with the condition are \"crucial\" in the absence of a cure, researchers said.\n\nMND affects the brain and nerves, with patients eventually losing the ability to move, speak, swallow and breathe.\n\nCurrent treatments include physiotherapy to maintain muscle strength and a drug called riluzole, which can slow the progression of the disease.\n\nACT is a type of psychotherapy that combines behavioural therapy with strategies like mindfulness, encouraging patients to accept difficult thoughts and feelings rather than trying to control or avoid them.\n\nChris McDermott, a professor of translational neurology at the University of Sheffield, honorary consultant neurologist and joint lead of the trial, said: \"We desperately need treatments to slow down and stop MND.\n\n\"In a year when several large drug trials have already reported negative results we are reminded what a huge and difficult challenge that is.\n\n\"While we work hard for a cure, it is essential we support those living with MND now.\"\n\nCommend began in 2019 and involved 191 people across 16 MND centres in the UK.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to have either their usual care or their usual care plus ACT.\n\nResearchers said: \"As further evidence emerges confirming these findings, healthcare providers should consider how access to ACT, adapted for the specific needs of people with motor neurone disease, could be provided within motor neurone disease clinical services.\"\n\nProf McDermott added: \"The Commend study shows that tailored psychological support can have a major impact on the quality of life of those people living with MND.\"\n\n\"Poor quality of life and psychological distress are associated with numerous negative outcomes, including shorter survival and increased risk of suicide.\n\n\"Therefore, it is vital that we provide evidence-based interventions to help manage this.\n\n\"This study provides strong evidence that acceptance and commitment therapy can be a valuable tool for improving quality of life for the 5,000 people who are currently living with MND in the UK.\"\n\nThe study was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment and the MND Association.\n\nAccording to the MND Association, the condition can affect up to 5,000 adults in the UK at any one time.\n\nChris Bennett, head of regional services and partnerships at the charity, added: \"We know many people with MND seek help to cope with the psychological impact of the disease but often this isn't available or, if it is, not in a timely way.\n\n\"The Commend study shows psychological support can be effective in improving quality of life and that there is clear clinical benefit in acceptance commitment therapy specifically.\n\n\"It is therefore important these findings are taken forward and consideration is given to offering psychological support, such as ACT, within the standard care package to all those who may benefit from it.\"", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@jerseyeveningpost.com",

Commend study, led by a team from the University of Sheffield and University College London (UCL), explored whether acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) could boost the psychological health of people with MND.\n\nACT is a type of psychotherapy that combines behavioural therapy with strategies like mindfulness, encouraging patients to accept difficult thoughts and feelings rather than trying to control or avoid them.\n\nChris McDermott, a professor of translational neurology at the University of Sheffield, honorary consultant neurologist and joint lead of the trial, said: \"We desperately need treatments to slow down and stop MND.\n\n\"In a year when several large drug trials have already reported negative results we are reminded what a huge and difficult challenge that is.\n\n\"While we work hard for a cure, it is essential we support those living with MND now.\"\n\nCommend began in 2019 and involved 191 people across 16 MND centres in the UK.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to have either their usual care or their usual care plus ACT.\n\nThe results, published in The Lancet, showed ACT, when combined with usual care, was \"clinically effective for maintaining or improving quality of life\" in patients with MND.\n\nResearchers said: \"As further evidence emerges confirming these findings, healthcare providers should consider how access to ACT, adapted for the specific needs of people with motor neurone disease, could be provided within motor neurone disease clinical services.\"\n\nProf McDermott added: \"The Commend study shows that tailored psychological support can have a major impact on the quality of life of those people living with MND.\"\n\nRebecca Gould, a professor of psychological therapies at UCL, honorary clinical psychologist, chief investigator of the study and joint lead of the trial, said: \"In the absence of a cure for this devastating disease, interventions aimed at helping to improve the psychological wellbeing and quality of life of people living with MND are crucial.\n\n\"Poor quality of life and psychological distress are associated with numerous negative outcomes, including shorter survival and increased risk of suicide.\n\n\"Therefore, it is vital that we provide evidence-based interventions to help manage this.\n\n\"This study provides strong evidence that acceptance and commitment therapy can be a valuable tool for improving quality of life for the 5,000 people who are currently living with MND in the UK.\"\n\nThe study was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment and the MND Association.\n\nAccording to the MND Association, the condition can affect up to 5,000 adults in the UK at any one time.\n\nChris Bennett, head of regional services and partnerships at the charity, added: \"We know many people with MND seek help to cope with the psychological impact of the disease but often this isn't available or, if it is, not in a timely way.\n\n\"The Commend study shows psychological support can be effective in improving quality of life and that there is clear clinical benefit in acceptance commitment therapy specifically.\n\n\"It is therefore important these findings are taken forward and consideration is given to offering psychological support, such as ACT, within the standard care package to all those who may benefit from it.\"", "source": {"uri":

Scotland has 15 nurses caring for 400 MND patients.\n\n\"This is a shocking statistic that we are determined to change. By doing so, we will help to ensure better care for MND patients across the local Midlands area.\n\n\"The foundation's focus is to help those in need now, whether that be a deposit for a mobility car, helping fund a wet room or even a specialised toilet to help these\n\nwarriors keep their dignity. Therefore, every event will raise awareness and contribute to the fundraising efforts for this highly deserving cause.\"\n\nThe Foundation held its first fundraising event in January - an under-18s rugby match, in association with Solihull School, where \u00a34,345 was raised.\n\nThe Foundation sent these funds to a member of the MND community to put towards a deposit for their mobility car, and to cover the costs of a rental car in the meantime.\n\nHollie-Mae said: \"Beyond this, we've had donations of nearly \u00a39,000 and at a Coventry Former Players event raising nearly \u00a35,000. Some of this money has already been allocated to a wet room for a local MND patient.\n\n\"Also, friends, and family made amazing efforts to raise over \u00a35,600 for the MNDA, during January's 15,000 steps a day challenge.\"\n\nHowever, the fundraising highlight was The Matt Gallagher Foundation Ball, which was held earlier this month where \u00a3218,000 was raised.\n\nFor more search for The Matt Gallagher Foundation on Facebook and Instagram.", "source": {"uri": "coventryobserver.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coventry Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadnock_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monadnock Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gallagher_(rugby_union)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matt Gallagher (rugby union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_R.F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coventry R.F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motor neuron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neuron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spinal cord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solihull", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solihull"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Solihull"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Neurone_Disease_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motor Neurone Disease Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Observer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Observer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solihull_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solihull School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rugby football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://coventryobserver.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MND_Fundraiser.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547807", "eventUri": "eng-9547807", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

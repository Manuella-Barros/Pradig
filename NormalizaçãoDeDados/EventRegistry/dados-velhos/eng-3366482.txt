It is therefore with regret that I tender my resignation as Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities.\"\n\nThe column penned by Ms Champion was written in the wake of news that 18 members of a grooming gang in Newcastle were convicted of offences including rape, assault, supplying drugs and trafficking for prostitution.\n\nThe defendants were mainly British-born Muslims and belonged to the Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Indian, Iraqi, Iranian and Turkish communities, while their victims are believed to be mainly white British girls and young women. The convictions followed similar patterns of abuse in Rotherham, Rochdale and Oxford.\n\nIn it she said: \"Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls.\n\n\"There. I said it. Does that make me a racist? Or am I just prepared to call out this horrifying problem for what it is?\n\n\"For too long we have ignored the race of these abusers and, worse, tried to cover it up.\n\n\"No more. These people are predators and the common denominator is their ethnic heritage.\"\n\nEarlier today, The Guardian reported that Ms Champion was attempting to distance herself from the column, claiming she did not write the headline or opening sentences, which she said were 'stripped of any nuance about the complex issue of grooming gangs, which have exploited thousands in my constituency'.\n\nBut a spokesman for The Sun said Ms Champion's press team had approved the column, and said they were 'thrilled' with it.\n\nResponding to Ms Champion's resignation, Jeremy Corbyn MP, Leader of the Labour Party, said: \"I have accepted Sarah Champion's resignation and thank her for her work in the Shadow Cabinet. I look forward to working together in future.\"\n\nIn response to Ms Champion's column, Trevor Kavanagh, a senior writer for The Sun, said MPs had to tackle what he referred to as the 'Muslim problem,' and praised Ms Champion for being prepared to speak out on the issue.\n\nOver 100 cross-party politicians, including Ms Champion, signed an open letter to the newspaper condemning the column for using 'Nazi-like language' regarding the Muslim community in Britain, coordinated by the Labour MP Naz Shah.\n\nMs Champion responded to Mr Kavanagh's column by saying she was horrified to learn she had been praised in a 'repulsive and extreme Islamophobic' column.\n\nLabour members have also called on the party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to sack Champion from the front bench through Twitter.\n\nPaul Cotterill, a Labour councillor in West Lancashire, branded Ms Champion's column 'a sinister piece of propaganda'.\n\nIn 2014, a major report detailed how at least 1,400 children were sexually exploited in Rotherham over a 16-year-period, sparking nationwide outrage, led by Professor Alexis Jay.\n\nThe inquiry team noted fears among council staff of being labelled 'racist' if they focused on victims' descriptions of the majority of abusers as being 'Asian' men.", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T16:04:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7921568751335144, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16",

In her words, she said, her continued presence there would be a distraction.\n\n\"We cannot demonise whole communities or whole groups of people because of the actions of some people.\"\n\nMr Javid said in a tweet: \"Corbyn wrong to sack Sarah Champion. We need an honest open debate on child sexual exploitation, including racial motivation.\"\n\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission said it was a \"real shame\" that Ms Champion had resigned because of \"over-sensitivity about language\".\n\nLabour's shadow justice minister Yasmin Qureshi refused to be drawn on whether it was right that Ms Champion stepped down.\n\n\"I think you need to ask Sarah that question,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"Of course we should deal with abuse wherever it occurs and we should ask ourselves as to what we can do to ensure these things don't happen.\"\n\nMs Champion's article was written after 17 men were convicted of forcing girls in Newcastle to have sex.\n\nThe men, who were mostly British-born, were from Iraqi, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iranian and Turkish communities.\n\nIn interviews following the convictions, the Labour MP said such crimes involved \"predominately Pakistani men\" and said a fear of being called racist was hampering the authorities' investigations.\n\nShe then wrote the Sun article, which also included the line: \"These people are predators and the common denominator is their ethnic heritage.\"\n\nAmong the article's critics was fellow Labour MP Naz Shah, who said it was \"irresponsible\" and \"setting a dangerous precedent\".\n\nFollowing the backlash, Ms Champion sought to distance herself from the article, claiming it had been altered, something denied by the newspaper.\n\nAnnouncing she was stepping down, Ms Champion said: \"I apologise for the offence caused by the

It was \"predominately Pakistani men\" who were involved in such cases \"time and time again\" said the MP for Rotherham - a town where a notorious grooming gang was exposed.\n\nThe column led to much anger being directed at Ms Champion and one of her colleagues describing her as \"irresponsible\" for making \"blanket, radicalised, loaded statements\" that would set up stigmatised Pakistani boys to fail.\n\nIt also resulted in praise being heaped on the Labour MP in an incendiary column by Trevor Kavanagh in the newspaper for making it \"acceptable to say Muslims are specific rather than a cultural problem.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, 1000 cross-party politicians signed an open letter, published in The Independent, demanding action over Mr Kavanagh's article for \"using Nazi like language\".", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T16:41:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7803921699523926, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3366482", "time": "16:41:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3366482", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "84560", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302940", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "score": 2}, {"id": "302970", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament", "score": 4}, {"id": "305292", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tabloid (newspaper format)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_(newspaper_format)", "score": 3}, {"id": "305931", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_people", "score": 4}, {"id": "306302", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anger"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger", "score": 2}, {"id": "306422", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "score": 4}, {"id": "309746", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "score": 2}, {"id": "311306", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "score": 4}, {"id": "312758", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "score": 3}, {"id": "312763", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Corbyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn", "score": 3}, {"id": "324254", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Child protection"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_protection", "score": 3}, {"id": "332166", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shadow Cabinet"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet", "score": 3}, {"id": "338571", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Frontbencher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontbencher", "score": 4}, {"id": "421302", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "British Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Pakistanis", "score": 4}, {"id": "466665", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "ITN"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITN", "score": 3}, {"id": "512097", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kavanagh (surname)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavanagh_(surname)", "score": 1}, {"id": "679813", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Trevor Kavanagh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Kavanagh", "score": 1}, {"id": "726070", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sarah Champion (politician)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Champion_(politician)", "score": 5}, {"id": "1247904", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sarah Champion (journalist)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Champion_(journalist)", "score": 3}, {"id": "1314058", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shadow Cabinet of Jeremy Corbyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet_of_Jeremy_Corbyn", "score": 3}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "16:41:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Labour's shadow equalities minister quits in row over profiling Muslims as abusers The Independent 22 mins ago", "originalArticle": null}

Child abuse is wrong. It is a crime, and it has to be dealt with.\n\n\"But you cannot blame an entire community, an entire nation or an entire ethnic community. You have to deal with it for the crime of what it is.\"\n\nAsked if he had sacked Ms Champion over her comments, he said: \"Look, she resigned and I accepted the resignation, so, clearly, I think it's right thing to do and I thank her for her work.\"\n\nCommunities Secretary Sajid Javid accused Mr Corbyn of stifling debate.\n\nThe Conservative minister said in a tweet: \"Corbyn wrong to sack Sarah Champion. We need an honest open debate on child sexual exploitation, including racial motivation.\"\n\nConservative former Children's Minister Tim Loughton said he did not know if Ms Champion had been sacked or not - but he accused Mr Corbyn of being \"deaf to a problem that is happening in our country\".\n\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission said it was a \"real shame\" that Ms Champion had resigned because of \"over-sensitivity about language\".\n\nLabour's shadow justice minister, Yasmin Qureshi, refused to be drawn on whether it was right that Ms Champion had stepped down.\n\n\"I think you need to ask Sarah that question,\" she told\n\n\"Of course we should deal with abuse wherever it occurs and we should ask ourselves as to what we can do to ensure these things don't happen.\"\n\nMs Champion's article was written after 17 men were convicted of forcing girls in Newcastle to have sex.\n\nThe men, who were mostly British-born, were of Iraqi, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iranian and Turkish heritage.\n\nIn interviews following the convictions, the Labour MP said such crimes involved \"predominately Pakistani men\" and a fear of being called racist was hampering the authorities' investigations.\n\nShe then wrote the Sun article, which also included the line: \"These people are predators, and the common denominator is their ethnic heritage.\"\n\nAmong the article's critics was fellow Labour MP Naz Shah, who said it was \"irresponsible\" and \"setting a dangerous precedent\".\n\nFollowing the backlash, Ms Champion sought to distance herself from the article, claiming it had been altered, something denied by the newspaper.\n\nAnnouncing she was stepping down, Ms Champion said: \"I apologise for the offence caused by the extremely poor choice of words in the Sun article on Friday.\n\n\"I am concerned that my continued position in the shadow cabinet would distract from the crucial issues around child protection which I have campaigned on my entire political career.\n\n\"It is therefore with regret that I tender my resignation as shadow secretary of state for women and equalities.\"", "dateTime":

be groomed by all kinds of people into some awful and dangerous situations.\"\n\nQuestioned by ITV's Daniel Hewitt whether Ms Champion was sacked or resigned, the Labour leader repeated seven times that Ms Champion had resigned.\n\nHe added: \"Listen - she resigned and I accepted the resignation.\n\n\"Well, I accepted her resignation, so clearly I did think it was the right thing to do.\"",

There. I said it. Does that make me a racist? Or am I just prepared to call out this horrifying problem for what it is?\"\n\nShe said the opening paragraphs had been changed, and \"stripped of nuance\".\n\nBut a spokesperson for the Sun said: \"Sarah Champion's column, as it appeared on Friday, was approved by her team and her adviser twice contacted us thereafter to say she was 'thrilled' with the piece and it 'looked great'.\n\n\"Indeed, her only objection after the article appeared was her belief that her picture byline looked unflattering. Her office submitted five new pictures for further use.\"\n\nEmails sent by Champion's team to the Sun were leaked to the Guido Fawkes blog earlier today, in which a member of her team says the MP was \"absolutely thrilled\" with the finished piece.\n\nDate: 11 August 2017 at 10:40\n\nSubject: RE: Sarah's piece\n\nShe is absolutely thrilled with it - just gone to get some hard copies.

These people are predators and the common denominator is their ethnic heritage.\"\n\nThe article raised issues of political correctness, racism and criminality, but the MP from Rotherham later found support from the Pakistan-origin cabinet minister in the Theresa May government, Sajid Javid, who said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was wrong to sack Champion from his shadow cabinet.\n\nThere are also claims of grooming gangs exploiting Asian girls. Labour MP Preet Gill told Eastern Eye, a leading British Asian publication, that Asian girls are being exploited across Britain, but victims were afraid to report it to authorities and seek justice because they fear for their safety and concerns over bringing shame to their families.\n\nThe row involving Champion escalated after a columnist of The Sun, Trevor Kavanagh, used her article to urge MPs to tackle what he called \"the Muslim Problem\", stating that Champion was one of the few politicians prepared to speak out.\n\nThe column led over 100 MPs from various parties writing to The Sun to condemn it. Champion said she was horrified that a \"repulsive and extreme Islamophobic\" column had quoted her positively: \"I am ashamed that he made positive reference to my own piece. We must always stand up against racism and prejudice, whatever form it takes.\"\n\nAfter Champion resigned, Corbyn issued a brief statement: \"I have accepted Sarah Champion's resignation and thank her for her work in the shadow cabinet. I look forward to working together in future.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T15:42:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 245, "textStart": 233, "date": "2017-08-09", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 426, "textStart": 417, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-10", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3366482", "time": "15:42:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3366482", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "76", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "178", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "84560", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302940", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "score": 2}, {"id": "302941", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Political correctness"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness", "score": 3}, {"id": "302954", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Politician"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "score": 2}, {"id": "302970", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament", "score": 5}, {"id": "303327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ethnic group"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group", "score": 3}, {"id": "303435", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Minister (government)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)", "score": 3}, {"id": "303629", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim", "score": 2}, {"id": "304328", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May", "score": 2}, {"id": "305935", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rape"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "score": 4}, {"id": "306422", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "score": 3}, {"id": "311306", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "score": 4}, {"id": "312758", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "score": 2}, {"id": "312763", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Corbyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn", "score": 2}, {"id": "313196", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "score": 1}, {"id": "316800", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shadow"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow", "score": 4}, {"id": "317044", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Prejudice"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice", "score": 1}, {"id": "332166", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shadow Cabinet"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet", "score": 4}, {"id": "342610", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "British Asian"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Asian", "score": 2}, {"id": "381514", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sajid Javid"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajid_Javid", "score": 2}, {"id": "382798", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fraction (mathematics)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)", "score": 3}, {"id": "421302", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "British Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Pakistanis", "score": 5}, {"id": "477818", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Eastern Eye"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Eye", "score": 2}, {"id": "679813", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Trevor Kavanagh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Kavanagh", "score": 2}, {"id": "726070", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sarah Champion (politician)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Champion_(politician)", "score": 4}, {"id": "1083325", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)", "score": 3}], "image": "http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/08/17/Pictures/_8a1b4724-835f-11e7-929c-3545fa1ac73c.JPG", "timeCrawl": "15:42:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "British MP forced to resign as shadow minister for 'Pakistanis raping white girls' statement", "originalArticle": null}

It was \"predominately Pakistani men\" who were involved in such cases \"time and time again\" said the MP Rotherham - a town where a notorious grooming gang was exposed.\n\nBut she then followed up her comments with a column in The Sun newspaper, under the provocative headline: \"British Pakistani men ARE raping and exploiting white girls - and it's time we faced up to it.\"\n\n\"Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploring white girls,\" she wrote. \"There. I said it.\"\n\nThe column led to much anger being directed at Ms Champion and one of her colleagues describing her as \"irresponsible\" for making \"blanket, radicalised, loaded statements\" that would set up stigmatised Pakistani boys to fail. It also resulted in praise being heaped on the Labour MP in an incendiary column by Trevor Kavanagh in the newspaper for making it \"acceptable to say Muslims are specific rather than a cultural problem.\"\n\nNow, Ms Champion claims she \"did not write the headline or opening sentences\" of the column, \"which were stripped of any nuance about the complex issues of grooming gangs, which have exploited thousands in my constituency\".\n\n\"The article should not have have gone out in my name and I apologise that it did,\" she said.\n\nSarah Champion on Newcastle sex ring: \"The majority of the perpetrators have been British Pakistani\"\n\nShe continued: \"A column appeared in my name in the The Sun last Friday. My aim was to try and open the debate about a very specific form of child abuse. However, The Sun decided to make the headline and opening sentences highly inflammatory and they could be taken to vilify an entire community on the basis of race, religion or country of origin.\"\n\n\"The Sun followed the piece up with a repulsive and extreme Islamophobic column by Trevor Kavanagh. I am ashamed that he made positive reference to my own piece. We must always stand up against racism and prejudice, whatever form it takes.\"\n\nIt comes after 100 cross-party MPs published a letter in The Independent over Mr Kavangh's article - including Ms Champion - calling for action to be taken by the newspaper over the comment piece. The MP's claimed the article used \"Nazi-like language\".\n\nMore about: Sarah Champion Sun newspaper Reuse content", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T14:20:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3366482", "time": "14:20:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3366482", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "84560", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302940", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "score": 3}, {"id": "302970", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament", "score": 3}, {"id": "303332", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "score": 2}, {"id": "305878", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Independent on Sunday"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "score": 3}, {"id": "305931", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_people", "score": 5}, {"id": "305935", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rape"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "score": 5}, {"id": "306302", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anger"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger", "score": 2}, {"id": "306422", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "score": 5}, {"id": "309746", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "score": 3}, {"id": "311306", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "score": 4}, {"id": "313196", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "score": 1}, {"id": "317044", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Prejudice"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice", "score": 1}, {"id": "421302", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "British Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Pakistanis", "score": 5}, {"id": "679813", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Trevor Kavanagh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Kavanagh", "score": 2}, {"id": "726070", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sarah Champion (politician)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Champion_(politician)", "score": 5}, {"id": "1247904", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sarah Champion (journalist)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Champion_(journalist)", "score": 3}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/02/27/19/Sarah_Champion_MP.jpg", "timeCrawl": "14:35:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Sarah Champion issues retraction over article she wrote claiming British Pakistani men 'are raping and exploiting white girls'", "originalArticle": null}

We need an honest open debate on child sexual exploitation, including racial motivation\".\n\nMs Lone later tweeted: \"Sarah Champion was talking about a particular type of grooming which is carried by men because of their cultural/religious practices.\n\n\"She's been punished and used as a scapegoat\" - @Amina_Lone on @SarahChampionMP's resignation from the shadow cabinet #newsnight pic.twitter.com/zWSFGEJhJZ -- BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\n\"Obviously not all men. She is not a racist but a brave woman speaking out about a politically awkward issue.\n\n\"UK Labour bury your heads as much as you like in the black and white purist world you push. The chickens will come home to roost\".\n\nMs Champion's resignation follows a controversial article written in The Sun newspaper in which the MP for Rotherham, warned politicians should not be afraid to discuss the high number of sexual exploitation and grooming cases against Pakistani men in the UK.\n\nShe wrote that an \"over-sensitivity about language\" had resulted in a climate which had led to the \"neglect, for so long, of the victims of these terrible crimes\".\n\nHowever following the article Labour MPs, including Jeremy Corbyn, appeared to publicly condemn the sentiment, warning that stereotyping large groups of people is not acceptable.\n\nLabour MP Naz Shah wrote an open letter to the editor of The Sun, criticising numerous articles which she claimed were Islamophobic.\n\nA subsequent petition was signed by Mr Corbyn, who posted on Facebook: \"In recent days, The Sun has published statements that incite Islamophobia and stigmatise entire communities. That is wrong, dangerous and must be condemned\".\n\nIt came as Yasmin Qureshi, Labour's shadow justice minister, refused to accept the Pakistani community has a particular issue with child grooming, despite high-profile cases in Yorkshire and the north of the country.\n\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that all abuse should be looked into and angrily rejected any cultural link.\n\nLast night critics accused Mr Corbyn of \"stalinist\" tendancies after it emerged that the Labour leader had asked for Ms Champion's resignation.\n\nTrevor Philips, the former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, told The Telegraph: \"I am absolutely gobsmacked, this is not the Labour party I know, even in the darkest days I don't remember people being asked to stand down for trying to represent their constituents, which is what I think Sarah Champion was trying to do.\n\n\"We shouldn't have to have an argument about free speech, what this feels like is what we used to call democratic centralism in the Labour party, in other words Stalinism\".\n\nWriting in The Sun, Ms Champion said: \"Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls.\n\n\"There. I said it. Does that make me a racist? Or am I just prepared to call out this horrifying problem for what it is?\n\n\"For too long we have ignored the race of these abusers and, worse, tried to cover it up. \"No more. These people are predators and the common denominator is their ethnic heritage.\n\n\"We have to have grown-up conversations, however unpalatable, or in six months' time we will be having this same scenario all over again.\"\n\nCommenting on her decision to resign Ms Champion said: \"I apologise for the offence caused by the extremely poor choice of words in The Sun article on Friday.\n\n\"I am concerned that my continued position in the Shadow cabinet would distract from the crucial issues around child protection which I have campaigned on my entire political career.\n\n\"It is therefore with regret that I tender my resignation as Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities.\"\n\nJeremy Corbyn, Leader of the Labour Party, said: \"I have accepted Sarah Champion's resignation and thank her for her work in the shadow cabinet. I look forward to working together in future.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for The Sun said: \"Sarah Champion's column, as it appeared on Friday, was approved by her team and her adviser twice contacted us thereafter to say she was 'thrilled' with the piece and it 'looked great'.\n\n\"Indeed, her only objection after the article appeared was her belief that her picture byline looked unflattering.

a statement four days after the article's publication, claiming the newspaper had altered aspects of the piece, including the opening sentences - an allegation The Sun dismissed.\n\nA spokesperson for the newspaper added: \"Sarah Champion's column, as it appeared on Friday, was approved by her team and her adviser twice contacted us thereafter to say she was 'thrilled' with the piece and it 'looked

There. I said it. Does that make me a racist? Or am I just prepared to call out this horrifying problem for what it is?\"\n\nThe remarks spiralled further as they were quoted in another 'Sun' article penned by journalist Trevor Kavanagh urging the British Parliament to tackle Britain's \"Muslim problem\".\n\nChampion, who distanced herself from the 'Muslim problem' reference, said, \"I apologise for the offence caused by the extremely poor choice of words in the 'Sun' article on Friday.\"\n\n\"I am concerned that my continued position in the shadow cabinet would distract from the crucial issues around child protection which I have campaigned on my entire political career. It is therefore with regret that I tender my resignation as shadow secretary of state for women and equalities,\" she said.\n\nThe article by Kavanagh has drawn widespread condemnation, including from the Muslim Council of Britain and the Board of Deputies of British Jews after he wrote, \"Thanks to former equalities chief Trevor Phillips, and Labour MPs such as Rotherham's Sarah Champion, it is acceptable to say Muslims are a specific rather than a cultural problem.\" It prompted a letter to the Sun from a cross-party group of MPs accusing Kavanagh of using Nazi-like language regarding the Muslim community in Britain.\n\nThe letter, also signed by Champion, read, \"Muslims currently face threats from far right and neo-Nazi groups in the UK and your publication of this article can therefore only be seen as an attempt to further stoke up hatred and hostility against Muslims.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Sun said, \"We strongly reject the allegation that Trevor Kavanagh is inciting Islamophobia. He is reflecting the links between immigration, religion and crime in the context of a trial of largely Pakistani sex gangs.\"\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T14:19:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3366482", "time": "14:19:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3366482", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "76", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "84560", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302813", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "score": 2}, {"id": "302901", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Crime"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "score": 2}, {"id": "302948", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics", "score": 2}, {"id": "302970", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament", "score": 3}, {"id": "303169", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sun"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "score": 5}, {"id": "303629", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim", "score": 5}, {"id": "303910", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "score": 2}, {"id": "305262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "score": 2}, {"id": "305267", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "score": 3}, {"id": "305931", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_people", "score": 5}, {"id": "305935", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rape"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "score": 3}, {"id": "306422", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "score": 3}, {"id": "311306", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "score": 4}, {"id": "312763", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Corbyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn", "score": 3}, {"id": "315921", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "score": 3}, {"id": "316800", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shadow"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow", "score": 5}, {"id": "323429", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Trafficking of children"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafficking_of_children", "score": 3}, {"id": "332166", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shadow Cabinet"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet", "score": 2}, {"id": "400123", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Board of Deputies of British Jews"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Deputies_of_British_Jews", "score": 2}, {"id": "421302", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "British Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Pakistanis", "score": 3}, {"id": "483092", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Muslim Council of Britain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Council_of_Britain", "score": 2}, {"id": "568185", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sexual Offences Act 2003"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Offences_Act_2003", "score": 3}, {"id": "597562", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Trevor Philips"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Phillips", "score": 2}, {"id": "679813", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Trevor Kavanagh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Kavanagh", "score": 3}, {"id": "726070", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sarah Champion (politician)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Champion_(politician)", "score": 4}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "14:19:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "UK's shadow equalities minister forced to quit over remarks", "originalArticle": null}

There. I said it. Does that make me a racist? Or am I just prepared to call out this horrifying problem for what it is?\"\n\nThe remarks spiralled further as they were quoted in another 'Sun' article penned by journalist Trevor Kavanagh urging the British Parliament to tackle Britain's \"Muslim problem\".\n\nChampion, who distanced herself from the 'Muslim problem' reference, said, \"I apologise for the offence caused by the extremely poor choice of words in the 'Sun' article on Friday.\"\n\n\"I am concerned that my continued position in the shadow cabinet would distract from the crucial issues around child protection which I have campaigned on my entire political career. It is therefore with regret that I tender my resignation as shadow secretary of state for women and equalities,\" she said.\n\nThe article by Kavanagh has drawn widespread condemnation, including from the Muslim Council of Britain and the Board of Deputies of British Jews after he wrote, \"Thanks to former equalities chief Trevor Phillips, and Labour MPs such as Rotherham's Sarah Champion, it is acceptable to say Muslims are a specific rather than a cultural problem.\"\n\nIt prompted a letter to the Sun from a cross-party group of MPs accusing Kavanagh of using Nazi-like language regarding the Muslim community in Britain.\n\nThe letter, also signed by Champion, read, \"Muslims currently face threats from far right and neo-Nazi groups in the UK and your publication of this article can therefore only be seen as an attempt to further stoke up hatred and hostility against Muslims.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Sun said, \"We strongly reject the allegation that Trevor Kavanagh is inciting Islamophobia. He is reflecting the links between immigration, religion and crime in the context of a trial of largely Pakistani sex gangs.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T13:55:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3366482", "time": "13:55:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3366482", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "76", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "84560", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "86522", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302813", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "score": 2}, {"id": "302901", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Crime"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "score": 2}, {"id": "302948", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics", "score": 2}, {"id": "302970", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament", "score": 3}, {"id": "303169", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sun"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "score": 5}, {"id": "303629", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim", "score": 4}, {"id": "303910", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "score": 1}, {"id": "305262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "score": 1}, {"id": "305267", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "score": 3}, {"id": "305931", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_people", "score": 4}, {"id": "305935", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rape"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "score": 4}, {"id": "306422", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "score": 3}, {"id": "311306", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "score": 3}, {"id": "312763", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Corbyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn", "score": 3}, {"id": "315921", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "score": 3}, {"id": "323429", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Trafficking of children"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafficking_of_children", "score": 3}, {"id": "332166", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shadow Cabinet"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet", "score": 2}, {"id": "400123", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Board of Deputies of British Jews"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Deputies_of_British_Jews", "score": 2}, {"id": "421302", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "British Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Pakistanis", "score": 3}, {"id": "483092", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Muslim Council of Britain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Council_of_Britain", "score": 2}, {"id": "568185", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sexual Offences Act 2003"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Offences_Act_2003", "score": 3}, {"id": "597562", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Trevor Philips"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Phillips", "score": 2}, {"id": "679813", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Trevor Kavanagh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Kavanagh", "score": 3}, {"id": "726070", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sarah Champion (politician)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Champion_(politician)", "score": 3}], "image": "http://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/8/17/w600X390/RT.JPG", "timeCrawl": "13:55:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "UK's shadow equalities minister forced to quit over remarks against Pakistani men", "originalArticle": null}

We need an honest open debate on child sexual exploitation, including racial motivation.'\n\nSarah Champion resigned from the Shadow Cabinet on Wednesday. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid supported her\n\nThere was also criticism from within the Labour Party that Miss Champion - who has campaigned for years about grooming in her Rotherham constituency - had to quit as shadow women and equalities minister.\n\nMeanwhile, a poll found that the British public support Miss Champion for speaking out. YouGov found that 39 per cent of people believed she had 'raised awareness of the issue in the right way and should have stuck to her guns'.\n\nAnother 31 per cent said she was 'right to try to raise awareness of the issue' - but the way she went about it was 'counterproductive'. Only 13 per cent said she had 'misrepresented' the issue and 'wrongly demonised a section of British society'.\n\nBut yesterday Jeremy Corbyn denied there was any 'problem' with Pakistani men and abuse, saying: 'The problem is the crime that's committed against women from any community.'\n\nIt is believed that the Labour leader told Miss Champion she would be sacked from the Shadow Cabinet on Wednesday if she refused to resign over her article in The Sun five days before. The article came after 17 men were convicted of forcing girls in Newcastle upon Tyne to have sex.\n\nAmina Lone, a Muslim who is a former Labour parliamentary candidate, told BBC2's Newsnight: 'I think she's been punished and used as a scapegoat because as a politician she's an easy target.'\n\nMiss Lone, who is co-director of the Social Action and Research Foundation, later wrote on Twitter: 'I grew up in a Muslim community where these attitudes were common. \"White girls are easy\", \"Nobody cares about them\", \"They are just slags\", \"Their parents don't look after them properly\" etc were/are still said today. Sarah Champion was talking about a particular type of grooming which is carried out by men because of their cultural/religious practices. Obviously not all men. She is not a racist but a brave woman speaking out about a politically awkward issue.'\n\nTorrent of vile abuse she received for speaking out\n\nLeft-wingers targeted Sarah Champion with online abuse after she wrote her article in The Sun.\n\nTwitter users demanded the MP be sacked, calling her a peddler of 'racist garbage'.\n\nShe was accused of 'dogwhistle, racist politics', of 'inciting racial hatred' and being as bad as the far-Right British National Party.\n\nThe Sun article appeared last Friday, soon after 17 men were convicted of forcing girls in Newcastle upon Tyne to have sex. Mostly British-born, they were from Iraqi, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iranian and Turkish communities. Miss Champion also faced criticism from fellow Labour MP Naz Shah, who wrote an article saying the headline on the Sun piece had been 'irresponsible' and was 'setting a dangerous precedent'.\n\nShe said at the weekend that the 'blanket, racialised, loaded statements' would set up stigmatised Pakistani boys to fail. The Bradford West MP's criticism came despite the fact that she herself was suspended from the Labour party last year for promoting anti-semitic messages on social media. Hours after the Sun article appeared, a Twitter user called Hayls wrote: 'Hello Jeremy Corbyn you need to remove Sarah Champion from her position right now. This racist garbage is not acceptable.'\n\nMichael Walker, who describes himself as a 'class war social democrat', wrote: 'There's exploring how attitudes to sex and gender relate to culture; and there's dogwhistle, racist politics. Sarah Champion's piece was latter. It reduces problem entirely to race, claims PC culture has hidden truth. It's proper BNP s***.' West Lancashire councillor Paul Cotterill called the article 'a sinister piece of propaganda', and Labour activist Tony Greenstein said she should be sacked just as Ted Heath had sacked Enoch Powell in 1968 after his 'Rivers of Blood' speech.\n\nHe wrote: 'It is intolerable that Sarah Champion, who has engaged in no less despicable racist stereotyping, remains as Labour's shadow minister for women and equalities.'\n\nOne Liberal Democrat tweeted a link to her Sun article and wrote: 'This sweeping generalisation vilifying all Pakistani men was not written by Nigel Farage but Labour's Sarah Champion. Progressive party?'\n\nLabour MPs also expressed disappointment. Barry Sheerman wrote: 'I don't understand the forced resignation of Sarah Champion and nor will my constituents.' But Mr Corbyn told radio station LBC: 'I think she was right to step down.\n\nIn her words, she said her continued presence would be a distraction. We cannot demonise whole communities because of the actions of some people.'\n\nAsked if Rotherham, Rochdale and Newcastle showed there was a 'particular problem' with Pakistani men, Mr Corbyn said: 'The problem is the crime that is committed against women from any community. Much crime is committed by white people, crime is committed by people of other communities as well.\n\n'I think it is wrong to designate an entire community as the problem.' In an article for The Sun last Friday, Miss Champion wrote: 'Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls.\n\n'There. I said it. Does that make me a racist? Or am I just prepared to call out this horrifying problem for what it is?'\n\nThe Left will call me racist: Campaigner predicted her own downfall\n\nSarah Champion made forceful comments about the issue on Radio 4's Today programme the day before her article appeared in The Sun. Below is a transcript of the interview.\n\nSarah Champion\n\nI think what we need to acknowledge and be very upfront about is all of the towns [Rochdale, Rotherham, Aylesbury etc] where these [grooming] cases have gone on - the majority of the perpetrators have been British Pakistani.\n\nNow, one of the things, that, for example, was on the news last night, there was picture of 18 of the people [who] were convicted [in Newcastle], [and] there was no comment that 17 of those were clearly Asian men.\n\nAnd it just pains me that this is going on time and time again, and the Government aren't researching what is going on. Are these cultural issues? Is there some sort of message going out within the community?\n\nWe have got now hundreds of men, Pakistani men, who've been convicted of this crime. Why are we not commissioning research to see what's going on, and how we need to change what's going on so it never happens again?\n\nInterviewer Do we need the research? We know what's going on...\n\nChampion We don't know WHY it's going on though and unless... and what I'm all about is prevention. So it's all great hand-wringing after it's happened but WHY has it happened. How do we prevent it because lives are being absolutely destroyed because of this, and also I have to say, within my own constituency. I really... I didn't sleep last night [before] coming on talking about this, because every time I talk about it the level of Islamophobia increases, so everybody wants this sorted.\n\nSarah Champion made forceful comments about the issue on Radio 4's Today programme\n\nInterviewer Will you yourself be attacked?\n\nChampion Absolutely - and from both sides. The Far Right will attack me for not doing enough; the Floppy Left will have a go at me for being a racist.\n\nBut this isn't racist - it's child protection and we need to be grown-up and deal with it.\n\nThere are many types of child abuse and many types of child sexual exploitation but... the prosecutions and convictions we get are predominantly Pakistani men, and therefore we have to address this.\n\nYou know if [it] was people from a particular town [who] were [committing] this crime across the country... If it was people from, I don't know, a motorbike gang that [was] doing this, we would recognise this as an indicator and we would deal with it. But we're just not dealing with it.\n\nI genuinely think it's because people are more afraid to be called a racist than they are afraid to be wrong about calling out child abuse.\n\nIn Rotherham, I've met frontline social workers who, when - we're talking ten years ago now - they were trying to report this crime were sent on race relations courses. They were told they were going to [face] disciplinary action if they didn't remove the fact they were identifying the person as a Pakistani male. This is still going on in our towns now. I know it's still going on, but we're still not addressing it.\n\nInterviewer And who is the 'they' that are not addressing it specifically?\n\nChampion I would say, from the cases that I've been involved, that the sort of senior managers tend to be on top of this. They go on the training courses.\n\nIn councils, police forces, the frontline staff know exactly what's going on, but it seems to be the middle management [who] are more concerned... to be seen as politically correct and doing the right thing than they are about addressing what is a very unpleasant crime.\n\nInterviewer So we're not just talking about social services then?\n\nChampion No, literally it's across the board. I mean the victims and survivors tend to present in, say, the NHS, [to] GPs, to social workers, to children's services, to the police forces. And sadly we keep on getting examples, we get examples of brilliant people [trying to alert the authorities], of where these people are being turned away or where the race element isn't being addressed.\n\nInterviewer It's not quite true to say that their ethnicity hasn't been mentioned in news reports. Your description [of] the ten o'clock news last night might be accurate, but we certainly refer to it on this programme.\n\nChampion Good. And we need to keep on referring to this, because if we don't refer to it, it goes underground and that's why we have an Islamophobic, far-Right response to it.

(UK Parliament)\n\nA British lawmaker was forced to resign Wednesday after writing a column in which she wrote, \"Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls\" that has sparked a debate about child abuse in the country.\n\nSarah Champion resigned nearly a week after her column in The Sun appeared in the wake of the convictions of 18 people for sexually abusing women and girls as young as 15.\n\n\"Britain has a problem with British-Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls,\" she wrote in The Sun. \"There. I said it. Does that make me a racist? Or am I just prepared to call out this horrifying problem for what it is? For too long we have ignored the race of these abusers and, worse, tried to cover it up.\"\n\nShe later apologized for her \"extremely poor choice of words,\" and quit her position as shadow equalities minister.\n\nOne woman and 17 men were convicted of, or admitted, to charges including rape, supplying drugs and inciting prostitution in a series of trials that ended last week at Newcastle Crown Court in northeast England.\n\nThe crimes followed a pattern that has become grimly familiar from cases across Britain in the last few years. The convicted men mostly come from South Asian Muslim backgrounds. Their victims -- who were plied with drugs and alcohol before being abused at parties, in taxis or in back rooms -- were mostly white.\n\nThe prosecution of child-grooming gangs in Rochdale, Rotherham, Oxford and now Newcastle has raised uncomfortable questions in Britain. Some allege that the crimes were long ignored by authorities afraid they would be branded racist or fearful the allegations might inflame ethnic tensions.\n\nChampion has previously said the causes of abuse weren't being tackled \"because people are more afraid to be called a racist than they are afraid to be wrong about calling out child abuse.\"\n\nWhile her comments were met by fierce opposition from own political party, including Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn, who insisted his party would not \"demonise\" any particular group, others say there should be an \"honest open debate\" about child abuse.\n\nCommunities Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted Thursday \"Corbyn wrong to sack Sarah Champion. We need an honest open debate on child sexual exploitation, including racial motivation,\" Sky News reported.\n\nCorbyn had originally backed Champion in the wake of the article being published, saying last Friday: \"She has stood up for her city, she stood up against those that have abused children.\"\n\n\"That's why she said what she did and I support her in her work as a shadow minister and I say to everyone, if you think there's child abuse going on, report it, and I say to the police, don't be afraid of anyway you're going to investigate,\" Corbyn said at the time.\n\nBut a member of Corbyn's top team repeatedly refused to be drawn when asked Thursday whether it was right for Champion to go.\n\n\"I think you need to ask Sarah that question,\" shadow justice minister Yasmin Qureshi told the BBC's Today program.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T16:47:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3366482",

But the Sun produced emails from an aide to the MP saying she was \"thrilled\" with the piece.\n\nJavid, who was the first British Pakistani MP to lead a government department, criticised Jeremy Corbyn, suggesting Champion had been removed from her post by the Labour leader as a result of the controversy.\n\nJavid tweeted:\n\nChampion has been a vocal campaigner on child sexual exploitation during her time as MP for Rotherham. A 2014 inquiry led by Prof Alexis Jay concluded that at least 1,400 children had been sexually abused in the town over a six-year period, predominantly by British Pakistani men.\n\n\"I am concerned that my continued position in the shadow cabinet would distract from the crucial issues around child protection which I have campaigned on my entire political career,\" she said in her resignation statement.\n\nIn her piece in the Sun, published in the aftermath of another string of convictions for child sex abuse in Newcastle, Champion wrote: \"Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls. There. I said it. Does that make me a racist? Or am I just prepared to call out this horrifying problem for what it is?\n\n\"For too long we have ignored the race of these abusers and, worse, tried to cover it up. No more. These people are predators and the common denominator is their ethnic heritage.\"\n\nControversy over the piece, published last Friday after Champion was quoted approvingly in a separate piece by the Sun columnist Trevor Kavanagh, where he said that politicians had to deal with \"the Muslim Problem\" and that Champion was one of the few politicians prepared to speak out.\n\nChampion said she was horrified that a \"repulsive and extreme Islamophobic\" column had quoted her positively but Kavanagh's piece prompted more than 100 cross-party MPs, led by the Labour's Naz Shah, to write a letter to the Sun accusing him of using \"Nazi-era language\" to demonise a community.\n\nShah had used Javid as an example of a British Pakistani man who should not be stereotyped, in an article she wrote rebutting Champion's piece. \"Let's be clear about 'Pakistani' men - are we including the secretary of state for communities and local government, Sajid Javid, in this sweeping statement? Because he's Pakistani,\" she wrote in the Independent. \"Or how about Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London? The list goes on. There is no community where men don't rape girls and we must face up to it.\"\n\nAmina Lone, a former Labour parliamentary candidate and community activist, also defended Champion, saying she had been made a scapegoat. \"She's being punished for a subsequent column in the same newspaper that referenced her,\" Lone told BBC Newsnight. \"She also said in her article the vast majority of convictions are against white men acting alone. But we haven't seen an outcry from white men.\n\n\"She was very specific about a certain type of exploitation crime, from a certain community with cultural differences.

There. I said it. Does that make me a racist? Or am I just prepared to call out this horrifying problem for what it is?\"\n\nThe piece was derided as racist by commentators.

I said it,\" she added.\n\n\"Does that make me a racist? Or am I just prepared to call out this horrifying problem for what it is?\"\n\nShe concluded that the sentencing of a huge grooming gang in Newcastle last month only underlined the fact that 'we must accept that for gang-related child sexual exploitation, the convictions have largely been against British Pakistani men'.\n\n\"The government must act now to understand why this is,\" she wrote.\n\n\"We have a large group of men behind bars, let's do some research and find out why these monsters think it is acceptable to abuse children in this way.\n\n\"Unless we know why they do, we can't prevent it.\"\n\n'There. I said it. Does that make me a racist?'\n\nPushed on whether he saw any link between certain kinds of grooming and specific Asian backgrounds, Mr Corbyn said: \"What I say is you deal with the crime and you deal with the issues surrounding the crime and you support the victims of the crime.\n\n\"That has to be the right approach.\"\n\nAnd he denied 'silencing' debate on the issue, including Ms Champion, insisting she had resigned of her own accord.\n\n\"I'm not silencing anybody,\" he said.\n\n\"Sarah Champion offered her resignation because she didn't want the issue to become a distraction.\n\n\"She's a great campaigner for women's rights and equality I get on very well with her she's decided to resign and we move on.\n\n\"The issue has to be the safety of children it doesn't have to be the kind of language used by the Sun or other newspapers.\"\n\nMs Champion faced a fierce backlash on social media following her piece, including from Labour members accusing her of racism and demanding she be sacked.\n\nHer fellow Labour MP Naz Shah slammed the article as 'irresponsible'.\n\nThe row was further inflamed by an opinion piece published by the Sun alongside Ms Champion's own, referring to the country's so-called 'Muslim problem'.\n\nOn Wednesday the shadow minister resigned, apologising for her own 'extremely poor choice of words'.\n\nBut some Labour figures offered their support.\n\nManchester councillor Amina Lone, who has previously stood for the party in the general election and has repeatedly spoken out about the treatment of women within some Muslim communities, described Sarah Champion's article as 'brave', adding that Labour has now 'got a problem' after pushing the MP 'into the wilderness'.\n\nIn a Twitter thread Coun Lone, who is a Muslim of Kashmiri heritage, said Ms Champion had been 'silenced'.\n\n\"I grew up in a Muslim community where these attitudes were common,\" she wrote.\n\n\"'White girls are easy', 'nobody cares about them', 'they are just slags', 'their parents don't look after them properly' etc were/are said today. I hear it regularly.\n\n\"Sarah Champion was talking about a particular type of grooming which is being carried [out] by men because of their cultural/religious practices.\n\n\"She is not a racist but a brave woman speaking out about a politically awkward issue.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T20:40:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6627451181411743, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {},

resigned from her position as Shadow Equalities Secretary following a backlash over a controversial Sun column on child grooming gangs.\n\nThe Rotherham MP had initially sought to distance herself from the article, but within hours of accusing the newspaper of altering the piece she announced she was standing down and apologised for any offence she had caused.\n\nThe decision came as more than 100 cross-party MPs and peers wrote a joint letter to the tabloid paper, accusing it of \"[stoking] up hatred and hostility against Muslims\".\n\nLed by the Bradford MP Naz Shah, the group cites a specific article by The Sun columnists Trevor Kavanagh in which the journalist urges politicians to address the country's \"Muslim problem\".\n\n\"Muslims currently face threats from far right and neo-Nazi groups in the UK and your publication of this article can therefore only be seen as an attempt to further stoke up hatred and hostility against Muslims,\" the group writes.\n\n\"We implore you to not only retract this article but given the sacking of Mr Myers following his disgraceful anti-Semitic article in the The [Sunday] Times, strongly consider whether Mr Kavanagh's brand of bigotry fits with your vision for the paper.\"\n\nDefending her column, Ms Champion claimed that she was trying to \"open [up] the debate about a very specific form of child abuse\".\n\nThe piece, which was published on Friday, opened with the claim that: \"Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls.\"\n\nThe MP initially accused The Sun of stripping her article of \"any nuance about the complex issue of grooming gangs, which have exploited thousands in my constituency\".\n\nBut she later apologised \"for the offence caused by the extremely poor choice of words\".\n\n\"I am concerned that my continued position in the shadow cabinet would distract from the crucial issues around child protection which I have campaigned on my entire political career,\" he resignation statement said.\n\n\"It is therefore with regret that I tender my resignation as shadow secretary of state for women and equalities.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T16:40:00Z",

The police initially interviewed 108 potential suspects, 20 victims ultimately testified.\n\n\"Britain has a problem with British-Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls,\" Champion wrote. \"There. I said it. Does that make me a racist? Or am I just prepared to call out this horrifying problem for what it is? For too long we have ignored the race of these abusers and, worse, tried to cover it up.\"\n\nChampion apologized for her \"extremely poor choice of words\" and stepped down from her position as Rotherham MP and shadow equalities in response to the backlash.\n\nChampion framed the recent conviction of 17 men and one women on charges including rape, supplying drugs and inciting prostitution as part of a horrific pattern that U.K. authorities and lawmakers have failed to meaningfully address \"because people are more afraid to be called a racist than they are afraid to be wrong about calling out child abuse.\"\n\nThere have been similar cases in Rochdale, Rotherham, Oxford over the last several years in which men, mostly from South Asian backgrounds, ply young, working class women and girls with drugs and alcohol in order to sexually exploit them.\n\nThe Rotherham case, which occurred in Champion's district, was particularly brutal, 1,400 children were subjected to sexual abuse between 1997 and 2013. A report, commissioned by the Rotherham Borough Council, found that \"several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought as racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.\"\n\nChampion's column was met with harsh backlash from her own party, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who told the BBC Wednesday the party will not \"blame\" or \"demonize any particular group.\" Corbyn denied there was a 'particular problem' with Pakistani men grooming young white women and girls for sexual predation.\n\nHis statements represent a stark departure from his original comments, made Friday, in which he praised Champion, saying \"She stood up for her city, she stood up against those that have abused children.\"\n\nFollow Jack on Twitter", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T21:54:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3366482", "time": "21:54:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3366482", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "76", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "84560", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302532", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Police"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "score": 3}, {"id": "302689", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "score": 2}, {"id": "302926", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "BBC"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "score": 1}, {"id": "302940", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "score": 3}, {"id": "302970", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament", "score": 3}, {"id": "303327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ethnic group"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group", "score": 2}, {"id": "304436", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield Wednesday F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.", "score": 1}, {"id": "305267", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "score": 3}, {"id": "305609", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "score": 2}, {"id": "305624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Working class"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class", "score": 2}, {"id": "305931", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_people", "score": 4}, {"id": "305935", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rape"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "score": 5}, {"id": "307927", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "score": 3}, {"id": "309746", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "score": 2}, {"id": "312758", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "score": 1}, {"id": "312763", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Corbyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn", "score": 1}, {"id": "313490", "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 2}, {"id": "313792", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "score": 2}, {"id": "325697", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rochdale A.F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_A.F.C.", "score": 2}, {"id": "337173", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Commercial sexual exploitation of children"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_sexual_exploitation_of_children", "score": 2}, {"id": "421302", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "British Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Pakistanis", "score": 4}, {"id": "515419", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Resignation from the British House of Commons"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resignation_from_the_British_House_of_Commons", "score": 3}, {"id": "726070", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sarah Champion (politician)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Champion_(politician)", "score": 3}], "image": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/RTXYDLY-e1503001649717.jpg", "timeCrawl": "21:54:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "British Lawmaker Forced To Step Down For Calling Out 'British Pakistani Men Raping White Girls'", "originalArticle": null}

Why? Because she wrote an article in the Sun last week raising questions about Pakistani grooming gangs.\n\nIt was the headline to Champion's piece that caused most controversy: 'British Pakistani men ARE raping and exploiting white girls... and it's time we faced up to it.' Critics of Champion said she was making a racist generalisation about the Pakistani community. Champion later claimed the opening paragraphs of her piece had been 'stripped of nuance' by the Sun's editors, though the Sun says her people checked the piece twice and said it 'looked great'.\n\nLet's get one thing straight: Champion is not a racist. Aside from the questionable headline, her article made an important point. She was writing about two things: the independent inquiry into the scale of abuse of women in the Rotherham area, and the conviction of 17 men in Newcastle under Operation Sanctuary. The inquiry, commissioned by Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council, revealed that 1,400 girls and young women had been abused in the area over a period of six years, and that 'the majority of known perpetrators were of Pakistani heritage, including the five men convicted in 2010'. The men convicted in Operation Sanctuary were from a mix of backgrounds: Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Indian, Iraqi, Iranian and Turkish.\n\nChampion, as MP for the area, had been party to discussions about the abuse cases in Rotherham and Rochdale, and had worked to change the law on grooming in response to police negligence. She is familiar with this subject and how contentious it is. The inquiry Champion wrote about said that both police and social services had wilfully ignored data and failed to protect vulnerable girls -- and one of the reasons this happened is because the issues of race and religion were seen as too sensitive for open, frank discussion.\n\nChampion's resignation sends out a clear message: discussing the significance of race or religion in these cases is frowned upon. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the resignation was Champion's decision. But she really only started to receive criticism after her piece was quoted in a Sun column by Trevor Kavanagh this week -- a column which attracted the ire of many MPs for its critical comments on Islam.

Sarah Champion's remarks are not racist. People have tiptoed around this for the past 15 years.\n\n\"Not all Pakistani men are abusive but this kind of sexual crime and on-street grooming is predominantly carried out by Pakistani men on mainly vulnerable white children.\n\n\"This is a warning shot to anyone else who dares speak the truth, that they may lose their jobs. It merely serves to shut down all debate.\n\n\"To this day I'm not aware of a single police officer speaking out about these grooming gangs. I had to resign in order to do it and that was not an easy decision to make.\n\n\"Remember that Home Secretary Amber Rudd has only just come out and said we mustn't hide behind political correctness. Is this not exactly what's happening here?\"\n\nMs Champion received backing from Communities Secretary Sajid Javid and the Equality and Human Rights Commission following her resignation.\n\nBut Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Thursday it was \"wrong to designate an entire community as the problem\".\n\n\"I don't think you can label a whole community,\" he said.\n\n\"I think what you have to do is label those that perpetrate disgusting and disgraceful crimes against people, and they can be from any community, they can be white, they can be black, they can be any community, but they

As Jay concluded, there was over-whelming denial of what was happening and most Rotherham councillors disputed her findings.\n\nI am representing many victims of child rape and other abuse. In most cases the perpetrators were white men. Another was jailed last week after we battled to have the case re-opened. I and my staff have spent very many hours supporting and advising those who childhood was stolen from them and negotiating proper support for them now. I cannot be a spectator.\n\nSarah Champion has told it as it is. She was clumsy in her language: not all the gangs of men convicted are of Pakistani origin. In Bristol, they were Somali, in Keighley Bangladeshi.\n\nIt would have been more accurate to describe them as Muslim men, because an overwhelming majority of convicted child abusers operating in gangs have been.\n\nThe role of politicians is to defend the powerless and to get them justice. That can only be done by looking at the problems in the eye and calling them out for what they are.\n\nIn this country we have a major and nationwide problem of Muslim men grooming and abusing young vulnerable white girls and until we accept this it cannot be challenged.\n\nWe need to know why this has happened, stop hiding from the reality, call it for what it is and have a national action plan for dealing with it.\n\nThe substantive point that Sarah Champion has made is factually accurate. Her context is accurate, her knowledge is deep and her motivation is impeccable.\n\nIt is time Labour had the guts to back Sarah Champion\n\nI have seen when others have bravely spoken out, Ann Cryer in Keighley and Khalid Mahmood in Birmingham have both been attacked and rubbished.\n\nThere is a cowardice amongst some on the left, unwilling to leave their cappuccino bubble, outspoken on women in Saudi Arabia but gutless about tackling the abuse of young girls in our own towns and cities.\n\nAnother courageous Labour woman Barbara Castle, brought up in Bradford and representing Blackburn, would not have stood by and watched. As Barbara once said: 'in politics guts is all'.\n\nIt is time Labour had the guts to back Sarah Champion, back her crusade for the victims of child abuse and ask her to continue to say it as it is.\n\nJeremy Corbyn needs to reconsider his decision to accept her resignation and show the courage to reappoint her immediately.\n\nHe needs to stand up for the voiceless, those girls who have been

I thought her article was absolutely right. There is an issue with British \u00adPakistani men and on-street grooming, without any doubt.\"\n\nAdil, who was born in Birmingham to a Pakistani father and a Kenyan mother, added: \"She pointed out that the vast majority of abusers are white men.\n\n\"I don't feel tarred because I know she doesn't mean 2million men and I know more importantly there is a problem. I didn't read it as ALL.\n\n\"Like when I hear 'Millwall fans kicked off' I don't assume all -- importantly the issue must be abuse not language.\n\n\"It seems to me that there are more Pakistanis angry at language rather than the Pakistani men raping young girls.\n\n\"It's not a sweeping statement to admit there is an issue with Pakistani men abusing young girls.\n\n\"The whole community must accept there's an issue within. Like many other communities.\"\n\nRotherham MP Sarah quit as Shadow Women and Equalities Minister on Wednesday amid \u00adcriticism by Labour colleagues.\n\nLast night Jeremy Corbyn was hit by an angry backlash from his own Labour MPs which deepened after his spokesman confirmed Sarah had resigned only after he had demanded her head.\n\nHe accused her of \"demonising an entire people and an entire community\" and lashed out at the media with an extraordinary \u00adaccusation that journalists had twisted the facts about the gangs.\n\nHe told Channel 4 News: \"We are not going down the road of naming entire communities.\n\n\"What worries me is the way the media have spun this whole story when we should be dealing with the issues of abuse in our society.\"\n\nBut Sajid Javid, whose parents were from Pakistan, tweeted: \"Corbyn wrong to sack Sarah Champion. We need an honest debate on child sexual exploitation, including racial motivation.\"\n\nKATE HOEY, Labour MP for Vauxhall in central London, called Sarah's departure \"very sad\" and described her as \"an independent-minded and impressive MP who is needed in Shadow Cabinet\".\n\nHer Labour colleague, \u00adveteran Huddersfield MP BARRY SHEERMAN, said it was \"tragic that Sarah Champion has been forced to go\".\n\nAnd TREVOR PHILLIPS, former head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, was \"gobsmacked\" and \"dispirited\" by the news, adding: \"It feels to me like the Stalinists have decided to remind everyone that they are in charge.\"\n\nEntrepreneur and Apprentice winner MICHELLE DEWBERRY tweeted: \"SarahChampionMP wrote truth but then bottled it, backtracked + resigned. She should have had balls to stand by her words, she was right.\"\n\nJEMIMA GOLDSMITH, ex-wife of Pakistani cricket legend Imran Khan, tweeted: \"How do you tackle if you dare not discuss?\"\n\nBut Pakistan-born Shadow \u00adJustice minister YASMIN QURESHI called Sarah \"completely wrong\", insisting she had never encountered abusers in her community.\n\nIn the article for The Sun which was published last Friday, Sarah argued that \"by not dealing with the ethnicity of the abusers as a fact, political correctness has actually made the situation about race\".\n\nThe article was approved by her and her staff before publication.\n\nBut after criticism by some Labour MPs she apologised for her \"extremely poor choice of words\" and tendered her resignation so she did not \"distract from the crucial issues around child protection which I have campaigned on my entire political career\".", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T01:42:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5686274766921997,

She made her name once running a charity providing palliative care for sick kids in south Yorkshire and then, a second time over, as a campaigner on an issue which other politicians were too scared to approach.\n\nHer comments in The Sun last week - when she wrote that \"Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls\" - were prompted by the conviction of 17 men and a woman of mainly Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Middle Eastern ancestry over child sex crimes. They were inflammatory and ill-judged, leading to anger among some of her colleagues in the parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). Backbencher Naz Shah warned of the impact of \"blanket racialised loaded statements\".\n\nChampion's political problems escalated when The Sun's columnist Trevor Kavanagh piled in on Monday with a dreadful piece that referred to \"The Muslim Problem\" and was likened to something from Germany in the 1930s.\n\nWhile Champion got it wrong, and resigned her position as shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, her mistakes over the last week should not obscure the fact that she has been a dedicated campaigner for the rights of sex abuse victims and tried to prevent more children falling prey to such evil. She spoke out on one of the most uncomfortable and politically toxic issues - not out of a desire to win votes or earn a promotion - but because of her mounting horror at the number of lives \"absolutely destroyed\" and the reluctance of many in Westminster and the media to talk about it.\n\nBy last night, Jeremy Corbyn was clearly frustrated. He had quickly condemned Kavanagh - who is detested by many Labour politicians - and accused him of \"inciting Islamophobia\" as Shah co-ordinated a letter of complaint to the tabloid from more than 100 MPs.\n\nCorbyn had, clearly, been put in an exceptionally difficult position. On an issue as politically loaded and culturally sensitive as Champion's comments, a Labour leader has to either issue his backing for a senior shadow minister or make it clear that he disagrees.\n\nSupport for Yorkshire MP Champion as child abuse race row causes division\n\nLast night, he chose the latter course and Champion quit, as well as apologising for her \"extremely poor choice of words\". Corbyn invited the BBC cameras into his Norman Shaw South office in the Commons and denied suggestions he had forced his women and equalities spokeswoman to resign, saying \"it was her choice\" to go.\n\nIt has left Labour back in the headlines for the wrong reasons. Over the past 10 days shadow cabinet ministers have published statistic after statistic on issues ranging from the NHS to inflation and rail fares as part of a summer blitz on the Tories. The opposition remains, we have been repeatedly told, in \"permanent campaign mode\" but that has now been overshadowed.\n\nMeanwhile Labour MPs are unsure what to say next. Many will be on holiday and perhaps grateful for the time to consider their response to an issue which embraces race, religion, class, gender and Labour's relationship with its heartland communities.\n\nLast night one prominent backbencher took to Twitter to describe her \"sadness\" at Champion's departure - only to delete the message some time later - and only a handful were willing to speak out. \"I don't understand the forced resignation of Sarah Champion & nor will my constituents,\" Barry Sheerman wrote on Twitter. Trevor Phillips, former chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, who has also served as Labour chair of the London Assembly, told the Telegraph he was \"absolutely gobsmacked... even in the darkest days I don't remember people being asked to stand down for trying to represent their constituents\".\n\nThe facts which prompted Champion's claims are hugely complex and cannot be covered in just one article - rather they require a book or an academic study. The latter is what was called for by The Times, which has highlighted the specific issue of the incidence of men of Pakistani origin convicted of street grooming sex crimes, while pointing out that the vast majority of child sex crimes are committed by white men.\n\nChampion got it wrong and has apologised but her work will go on. Corbyn used his television clip to pledge to continue to work with her because she is \"is totally committed to protecting vulnerable women and girls within our society\". That sober statement is, perhaps, a fair reflection of both Champion's mistake as well as her desire to protect the innocent and force the political class to think a bit harder about one of the most difficult issues imaginable.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T12:14:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3366482", "time":

Others who thought they knew their MP are left wondering.\n\nTaiba Yasseen, a Labour councillor for Rotherham town centre, has been a staunch ally of Champion since she pitched her hat into the parliamentary ring. But Yasseen never anticipated Champion writing a piece for the Sun that has left some in the South Yorkshire town, with its significant British Pakistani population, feeling betrayed. \"Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls,\" said the story's introduction.\n\nYasseen, exasperated with the former shadow equalities minister, said: \"People are asking where this has come from. Has she always had these views? It was unwise, in the most extreme sense, to betray an entire ethnic group and I still have no idea why she said it.\n\n\"Sarah's been an amazing advocate for Rotherham, she's worked very hard for the town, but this is inappropriate on every level.\"\n\nOthers have found it entirely appropriate. Standing outside a secondhand electrical store in College Street, John Keenogh, a 60-year-old factory worker, said: \"She's spot on. People are too scared about saying the truth these days; everybody knows that.\" Keenogh, who was born in the town, said: \"It's ridiculous that she was sacked for saying the truth, what's happened to freedom of speech?\"\n\nChampion's views appeared in the Sun on 11 August after 17 men and one woman were convicted of forcing vulnerable women and girls in Newcastle-upon-Tyne to have sex. Her words immediately polarised opinion, with some lauding her for speaking out on a politically awkward issue while others denounced her as racist.\n\nSimilarly, the piece caused convulsions within her party, a handful of Labour MPs venting their anger over claims that she had been forced to quit. Jeremy Corbyn had announced that she resigned from the shadow cabinet over what she had described as an \"extremely poor choice of words\".\n\nFew could have predicted that Champion would write what she did in the Sun. She was a prominent figure on a counter-demonstration against an English Defence League march in the town earlier this year, the latest far-right protest designed to whip up hostility towards Asian men over revelations about child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. Those who marched with her, many from the town's British Pakistani population, considered their MP an informed ally, a Westminster politician who was fighting their corner against the \"racialising\" of the debate on child sex grooming.\n\nAmong those who marched beside Champion that day was Zaiban Alam, a barrister born 43 years ago in Eastwood, one of Rotherham's main Asian neighbourhoods. Alam believes that Champion has a keen grasp of the debate's nuances, making the MP's intervention all the more unfathomable.\n\n\"Sarah knows the issue and she knows the dangers of racialising the issue; such comments are astonishingly unhelpful,\" said Alam. Rotherham has been a repeat target of the far right after a 2014 report by Professor Alexis Jay, chair of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, concluded that failures of political and police leadership had contributed to the sexual exploitation of 1,400 children by Asian men in the town.\n\nAlam, who represented a group of Asian men cleared of violent disorder after attending an anti-racism protest in Rotherham, said: \"We ought to expect our politicians to be held up to higher standards in the way they convey things. We'd also like our MPs not to convey things that aren't right.\"\n\nMany in the town point out that Champion's statements are contradicted by official reports into child exploitation, further undermining her credibility among some constituents. Others claim that such comments from the Labour MP, who resigned from the shadow cabinet last week, amounted to further evidence that Islamophobia was becoming respectable.\n\nStanding outside the town's Game store a British Pakistani student, Tayab Sadiq, 20, said: \"It's an absurd comment to make. She's basically calling me a rapist, that I was born a rapist. I could get beaten up over this, or bullied.\"\n\nAlam also points out that Champion knows well the ramifications of racism and was MP of the town when 81-year-old Mushin Ahmed was murdered in a racist attack in August 2015.\n\nZlakha Ahmed, chief executive of Apna Haq, a Rotherham group tackling violence against women and girls, said the MP had offended her three sons. \"My sons are British university educated and they have read that piece and said that Sarah is saying that anybody who is of Pakistani male heritage is a rapist. How does the Pakistani community now feel that they can approach Sarah? Her article and the way it was written is something that will take hold and has taken hold.\"\n\nYet some in Rotherham firmly back their MP's intervention on the issue. Shop worker Maureen Holgate, 53, said: \"She's right to call them out on this. If I see her I'll stop her and give her a round of applause. The only way you're going to stop them is outing them.\"\n\nNearby, in Church Street, call centre worker Chris Holden, 27, said that Champion should have stayed in the shadow cabinet: \"She could have worded the piece better but I don't think she should have been sacked.\"\n\nBut Alam argues that already Champion's wording has reinforced a prejudiced view of British Pakistani men. \"How on earth are we going to expect impartial juries here? We are in a situation now where there is a complete abrogation from the executive, the legislative, in relation to the issue of Islamophobia and we need a strategic response from government. Thinking about the things Sarah has said, it's almost like lighting the touch paper.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T21:29:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1441, "textStart": 1432, "imp": true,

A follow-up piece in the same newspaper by Trevor Kavanagh praised Champion and asked what the UK should do about \"the Muslim problem\".\n\nThis language has parallels with the terminology the Nazis used to discuss \"the Jewish question\" and its \"solutions\". It shows how the horrific abuse and exploitation of young girls at the hands of criminals is being used to fuel and mainstream Islamophobia and bigotry.\n\nIt should go without saying, of course, that the police and relevant authorities must investigate the perpetrators of these crimes fully and hold them to account. And yes, that should include an examination of whether their cultural backgrounds are factors in these crimes. Commentators on the left have been criticised for supposedly ignoring this point. So, again, I am not: it is an important part of any investigation. Crucially, however, it should not be the overwhelming focus, to the exclusion of all other factors. Reading Sarah Champion and Trevor Kavanagh, you could be forgiven for thinking that's precisely what they want.\n\nBecause there is a problem in this country, a very big problem with the sexual abuse of children, and the sexual exploitation of young girls. The causes of this problem are far more complex than the race and religious background of some perpetrators.\n\nTalk to any frontline worker trying to counter this abuse, as I have, and they will tell you that the culture that needs to be tackled is the one of failing to listen to or believe children when they eventually find the courage to speak out about abuse.\n\nThey will tell you online grooming and street grooming of young girls and boys is being carried out by men of all backgrounds, and that their victims are of all backgrounds too - what unites these victims is their vulnerability to being used by men as nothing more than sex objects.\n\nThey will also tell you that they need more funding and resources in order to keep children safe.\n\nFinally, they will tell you about the ongoing systemic failures by the authorities that means girls are often partly blamed for being sexually abused and are shamed into silence.\n\nIt is disingenuous to blame these systemic failures on political correctness and the fear of being labelled racist. It lets the authorities off the hook for their own ambivalent attitude towards the victims of these crimes. And it further fails the child victims of sexual abuse and exploitation.\n\nChampion is now being portrayed as the latest victim of political correctness, and has been called \"brave\" for not being afraid of being labelled a racist. \"There, I said it\" was one of the early lines. She had apparently chosen to start a piece on the complex, difficult question of sexual exploitation of girls with this single, eye-catching factor. Though she went on to raise the question of police failings, the \"dramatic\" opening gambit obscured any more nuanced discussion. (Champion has said the opening sentences were changed to make them more \"inflammatory\", but the Sun claims her aide emailed editors at the end of the process saying the MP was \"thrilled\" with the piece).\n\nThere is nothing brave about labelling British Pakistani men abusers without being any more specific, so that a whole vast section of the population is implicated in one go. It does nothing to safeguard vulnerable youngsters from abuse. Instead it polarises communities further and moves the focus away from the victims of these crimes.\n\nApparently, nobody wants to talk about the racial background of some of the perpetrators, because it is a taboo to do so. If it is so much of a taboo, why is it the only issue being talked about by media and politicians over the last week, and every time a new child sexual exploitation case involving non-white men hits the headlines?\n\nOne can only assume that the likes of the Sun believe there is something intrinsically deviant and savage about Pakistani and Muslim men that makes them more likely to be sexual predators and therefore confirms Kavanagh's theory there is a \"Muslim problem\".\n\nThere is very little that is original or new about racism. Bigotry is always recycled, as we have seen in Charlottesville, with the newly packaged white supremacists calling themselves the \"alt-right\" but waving the same old Nazi flags, giving the same old Nazi salutes and slogans and reusing the same old racism and antisemitism.\n\nHere in the UK we have the same old racist tropes being recycled by the Sun and others: Lock up your daughters; the dark-skinned men are coming to rape and attack our girls and women.\n\n* Shaista Aziz is a journalist and former aid worker", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T13:07:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.47843137383461, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3366482", "time": "13:07:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3366482", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "84560", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302532", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Police"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "score": 3}, {"id": "302813", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "score": 3}, {"id": "302901", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Crime"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "score": 3}, {"id": "302940", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "score": 4}, {"id": "302941", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Political correctness"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness", "score": 3}, {"id": "302970", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament", "score": 4}, {"id": "303325", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture", "score": 4}, {"id": "303332", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "score": 4}, {"id": "303629", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim", "score": 3}, {"id": "303726", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "score": 3}, {"id": "305931", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_people", "score": 2}, {"id": "305935", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rape"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "score": 3}, {"id": "309752", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Abuse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse", "score": 5}, {"id": "309983", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "score": 1}, {"id": "310173", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bigotry"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry", "score": 3}, {"id": "311306", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "score": 4}, {"id": "313196", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "score": 3}, {"id": "313679", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "score": 3}, {"id": "313792", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "score": 3}, {"id": "317636", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Taboo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo", "score": 2}, {"id": "332166", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shadow Cabinet"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet", "score": 4}, {"id": "643244", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Patrick Kavanagh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Kavanagh", "score": 1}, {"id": "679813", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Trevor Kavanagh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Kavanagh", "score": 4}, {"id": "726070", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sarah Champion (politician)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Champion_(politician)", "score": 5}, {"id": "1247904", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sarah Champion (journalist)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Champion_(journalist)", "score": 4}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a266d7da0712ff5147197beb9a71efcb5fffcfe/168_572_4796_2879/master/4796.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNi8wNy9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=a6a988c1111e74dfdb8586a089cf72b5", "timeCrawl": "13:16:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "The Sun wants to make child abuse all about race - that doesn't help the victims | Shaista Aziz", "originalArticle": null}

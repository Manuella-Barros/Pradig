Like most of California's reservoirs, the lake saw extremely dry periods in recent years due to the megadrought that gripped the region. However, its water levels now stand at about 900 feet tall, its full capacity, for the second year in a row.\n\n\"Big announcement incoming so drumroll please ... we are officially at full capacity at Lake Oroville for the second year in a row!\" the California Department of Water Resources wrote on Facebook. \"This is great news for ensuring adequate water supply for millions of Californians and environmental needs and we continue to manage both while maintaining flood protection for downstream communities.\"\n\nLake Oroville serves water to 27 million people in California, the department reports, meaning the amount it holds is crucial to the population.\n\nThe lake gets its water from snowmelt trickling down from the Sierra Nevada. The more snow in the mountains, the more water the lake receives when the snow melts in the spring and flows down from the peaks.\n\nThe healthy water levels follow two years of extremely wet winters for California. In 2023, Lake Oroville reached capacity after a record amount of snowpack accumulated in the Sierra Nevada. And this past winter, a slew of atmospheric rivers descended on the state, which also contributed to healthy levels of snowpack.\n\nLast year, the precipitation was so plentiful that California's drought ended.\n\nIn April, experts confirmed that the snowpack levels had made a comeback and were now above average. The confirmation followed the spring measurements -- which are the most important, as they determine how much snow can be expected to flow into the state's reservoirs.\n\nThe lake's water levels in the past two years mark a drastic change from the water levels recorded in 2021 and 2022, when the state was gripped by a drought.\n\nIn September 2021, the lake's water level dropped to a historic low when it reached 628 feet. The lake also saw low levels in 2022, an extremely dry year in which its water levels began to drop in July until it reached 658 feet in December.\n\nThe full water levels mean good news for the state's water supply.

Since that time, we have seen that extreme weather shift from very dry to wet conditions,\" said State Water Project Operations Manager, Molly White.\n\nSunday, the DWR's Data Exchange Center confirmed that Lake Oroville is just under 900 feet, with around 3.5 million acre-feet. Compared to last year this time, Lake Oroville sat at 55% of its total capacity, with 1.93 million acre-feet of water.\n\n\"Lake Oroville is the largest reservoir for the State Water Project, it provides adequate and sufficient water supply but also provides additional storage that we will be able to carry into 2025, should next year be dry,\" White told KRCR.\n\nWhite added that Lake Oroville reaching its maximum capacity didn't always seem like a possibility for this year. \"It wasn't looking great at the beginning of the water year.

In May 2020, the water level was at 800 feet. However, by the end of the year, it had gone down to 700 feet. By September 2021, it was near the bottom, sitting below 650 feet. Hydro power coming from the dam pretty much stopped as a result. While water restrictions and selective usage somewhat helped in 2022, it wasn't until the atmospheric river storms of early 2023 brought the Lake out of the drought and back up to full pool in only a few months. Lake Oroville literally went from below 30% capacity in the winter of 2022 to 100% capacity by the Spring.\n\nDrought conditions were erased throughout 2023, with California becoming completely drought free for the first time since 2020 in November 2023. While many scientists had warned that it was just a one-time fluke, rains returned across the state once again earlier this year. While there was some destructive flooding, it also meant that reservoirs were filled up once again, with a steady supply of water coming in through snowmelt. Groundwater levels also bounced back for the first time in 4 years.\n\nAt Lake Oroville, California's second largest reservoir and the most critical reservoir in the water system, the CDWR announced on Tuesday that Lake Oroville reached full capacity this month. Officials noted that, even if 2025 turns out to be a dry year, the amount of water in Lake Oroville, as well as snowmelt coming in through the rest of the year, the lake will have a sufficient enough water supply to give to residents through the next year at least.\n\n\"We experienced a string of drought years, starting in 2020 through 2022. Since that time, we have seen that extreme weather shift from very dry to wet conditions,\" said State Water Project Operations Manager Molly White on Tuesday. \"Lake Oroville is the largest reservoir for the State Water Project, it provides adequate and sufficient water supply but also provides additional storage that we will be able to carry into 2025, should next year be dry.\n\n\"Lake Oroville reaching its maximum capacity didn't always seem like a possibility for this year. It wasn't looking great at the beginning of the water year. It started out very warm and dry. Here we are, certainly Mother Nature turned the corner and provided a lot of good snowpack and run off into the lake that we have been able to fill.\"\n\nThe remarkable turnaround, from the barren reservoir being the symbol of the California drought only three years ago, to being 128% of it's historical average today, proved to many in the state on Tuesday that California can bounce back climate wise and can sustain it should they play it smart.\n\n\"It wasn't just the high amount of rain, but it was the state, as well as local municipalities, realizing they needed more storage space and better conservation methods during the last drought, the bad one, \" explained Jack Wesley, a water systems consultant for farms and multi-family homes, to the Globe on Tuesday. \"Well, the two years of heavy rain plus those measures pushed Lake Oroville to be full again in only a few years.\"\n\n\"But now the state needs to play it smart. Locally, they have tried and true emergency measures on the books now in case things get bad again, so we have that buffer. We also have more storage space and better methods of how to use the water supply, so there is another buffer. But what California really needs to do is to hold back on environmental releases, or at least limit the number of them, during drought years going into the future. Everything is at capacity and water needs to go out to help fish? Fine, two birds with one stone. But if there is not enough water from agriculture or urban use, then we need to figure the most precise way to limit such releases, as it is just a waste of freshwater otherwise. The releases in 2020 and 2021 proved that.\"\n\n\"California needs those buffers going forward. Especially at reservoirs like Oroville that also help generate electricity. In fact, since the state is trying to go green, new reservoirs being built need to have hydroelectric dams going in to help build up green energy, at least where it is feasible. But that's a conversation for another day.\"\n\n\"The big thing is that reservoirs are filled once again, and, at least for the next year or two, if California goes drought again, we'll have enough. We're back to where we should be. The goal should be to stay there for as long as possible and get water to those who need it.\"\n\nAuthor Recent Posts Evan SymonEvan V.

The sun is out and the lake level has reached 100% capacity with only less than a foot before it reaches 900ft in elevation. The 900 foot elevation is full capacity for the lake, putting it just below the lip of the emergency spillway.\n\nGiven the full lake, people are taking notice. Al Maurer a Lake Oroville visitor says he loves seeing the lake so full and it brings back memories of when he used to live in the area of watching kids play in the water without having to hike to the water's edge.\n\nRussell Schwab who was walking along the dam say it was great to have the lake fuller for longer and is nice to see, especially with the snowpack still in the mountains.\n\nOur visit to the lake was a bit windy limiting the number of people on the water and walking the dam but as the weather warms and winds calm down I expect that to change. Many people are extra relieved to see the high water for the 2nd year in a row given the rough few years the lake has seen from the disaster in 2017 and the multi-year drought which prevented the dam from producing power only a couple years ago. The last time Lake Oroville was at this level was in June of 2023.\n\nThe water was full behind the dam but also flying out of the spillway indicating a delicate balance taking place. There is still 125% of your snowpack for this time of year sitting in the northern Sierra and that will eventually make its way through our local waterways.", "source": {"uri": "kion546.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KION546"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cnn_newsource@kion546.com", "name": "Cnn Newsource", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Oroville", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lake Oroville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spillway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowpack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snowpack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Water_Skiing_and_Wakeboarding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Water Skiing and Wakeboarding", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Cryptozoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Cryptozoology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Railbikes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Railbikes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549303", "eventUri": "eng-9549303", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Police have said they believe the remains of Morgan Harris and Marcedes Myran are at a different, privately owned landfill outside of the city.\n\nThe location of an unidentified woman Indigenous leaders have named Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman, is unknown.\n\nCountrywide protests were held after police said they would not search the Prairie Green landfill for Harris and Myran, but last month the federal and Manitoba governments committed $40 million for a search.\n\nA U.S.-based psychologist who has studied jury bias told court this week she went over hundreds of media stories about the killings and found many used emotionally loaded language.\n\nChristine Ruva with the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee campus said persistent coverage could create an implicit bias in jurors. If a person is subjected to as few as 10 articles on a criminal case, Ruva said they become biased and it's nearly impossible to reverse that.\n\nCrown prosecutors took issue with Ruva's research, which focuses on the U.S. legal system. Joyal echoed those concerns.\n\nThe judge said the jurors who were selected last week for the trial were rigorously questioned and given specific judicial instructions.\n\nCourt heard a handful of those selected had never heard of Skibicki or the case.\n\nLeonard Tailleur, one of Skibicki's lawyers, told reporters that the judge's decision does not change how they'll approach the case.\n\nThe defence has told court they plan to argue Skibicki is not criminally responsible for the deaths because of a mental illness.\n\nA finding of not criminally responsible means a person was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act due to a mental disorder.

face jury", "body": "A Winnipeg man accused of killing four Indigenous women will have his trial heard by a jury - despite a second attempt by his defence to have the jury tossed.\n\nOn Friday morning, Manitoba Court of King's Bench Chief Justice Glenn Joyal dismissed a motion by Jeremy Skibicki's lawyers to have the quadruple-homicide trial heard by judge alone.\n\nSkibicki is charged with four counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Rebecca Contois, Morgan Harris, Marcedes Myran, and an unidentified woman who Indigenous have given the name Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe or Buffalo Woman.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty.\n\nWhile a first-degree murder charge automatically requires a jury trial, Joyal noted an accused can request their case be heard by judge alone, but Crown prosecutors must consent.\n\nIn this case, the Crown has not.\n\nSkibicki's lawyers have argued 'pervasive' media coverage in the lead-up to the trial may have led to a bias among jurors, and argued a jury trial would violate Skibicki's rights to a fair trial.\n\nThey pointed to an opinion poll they commissioned, which found a majority of respondents believe Skibicki is guilty and indicated they would find it unacceptable if he were to be found not criminally responsible by way of mental disorder.\n\nThe court also heard testimony from a U.S.-based cognitive psychologist who has studied the impact and influence pre-trial publicity can have on a jury's decision-making ability.\n\nShe said once a juror has formed an opinion of guilt based on the media coverage they consumed before the trial, it is unlikely - if not impossible - to change during the trial.\n\nHowever, in his decision, Joyal disagreed.\n\n\"Impartiality as it relates to the judicial system is not understood to mean the jurors do not hold any form of bias, nor does it suggest that jurors are artificially neutral,\" Joyal said.\n\nHe said it is the responsibility of the judicial system, through instruction to the jury, to cleanse any biases jurors bring with them.\n\nIn this case, he said there was rigorous questioning during jury selection, and there will be further instruction to the jurors about their role - to make a finding based on the evidence presented in court alone.\n\n\"While it is expected the jurors, much like judges, are shaped by the lived experience including the media they ingest,\" Joyal said. \"In the Canadian judicial system we believe jurors are able to rise to the heightened expectations required in their role in order to ensure a fair trial is provided to the accused person.\"\n\nSkibicki's defence lawyers made a similar push to have the trial proceed without a jury, but that too was dismissed earlier this year.\n\n\"We thought our arguments were impeccable... but the lordship made a decision and we'll take it from there,\" Leonard Tailleur, one of Skibicki's defence lawyers said outside the courthouse Friday.\n\nHe said this doesn't change anything going into the trial.\n\nWhen asked about their plan to argue Skibicki is not criminally responsible for the deaths by way of mental disorder, Tailleur said, \"That'll be elucidated further in the trial proper, so we'll leave it at that.\"", "source": {"uri": "winnipeg.ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV Newsnet                        "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They're expected to start hearing evidence on Wednesday.\n\n'Surreal' to see accused in court: estranged mother-in-law\n\nOutside the courthouse on Friday, Skibicki's lawyer Leonard Tailleur said the judge's decision doesn't change anything for the defence as they prepare to head into the trial next week.\n\n\"His lordship made a decision, we had vigorous testimony. We thought our arguments were impeccable,\" Tailleur told reporters. \"It's a long process, and here we are at Step 500. We're onwards and upwards.\"\n\nSkibicki lawyer Leonard Tailleur, standing next to defence lawyer Alyssa Munce, spoke to reporters outside the courthouse following the judge's decision on Friday to keep the trial scheduled to be heard by a jury. (Karen Pauls/CBC)\n\nSkibicki has has pleaded not guilty to four counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of three First Nations women -- Morgan Harris, 39, Marcedes Myran, 26, and Rebecca Contois, 24 -- and a fourth, unidentified woman, who has been given the name Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman, by community members.\n\nHis lawyers said this week they plan to argue he's not criminally responsible in those deaths because of mental disorder -- an approach Tailleur said on Friday will \"be elucidated further\" once the trial starts.\n\nSkibicki sat quietly in court and stared ahead with his ankles shackled throughout court proceedings this week, as some family members of the victims, supporters and members of the public listened from the gallery -- including Skibicki's estranged mother-in-law.\n\nLori, whom CBC is identifying only by her first name, said it was \"surreal\" to see the accused in court on Friday for the first time in years. She said while that time has been \"horrible\" and \"very stressful\" for her family, she's relieved the trial has finally arrived.\n\n\"It might be hard to hear, but it's necessary,\" she said, adding she was glad to hear the case will still be heard by a jury.\n\nJeremy Skibicki sat silently in the accused box near his lawyers on Monday. Skibicki has pleaded not guilty to four counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Morgan Harris, Marcedes Myran, Rebecca Contois and a fourth unidentified woman community members named Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman. (James Culleton)\n\nLawyers for the accused and the Crown made their closing arguments Wednesday on the judge-only motion, with the defence raising concerns about the potential for unconscious bias given how much publicity has surrounded the case.\n\nSkibicki's lawyers also argued that by not agreeing to allow the accused a judge-alone trial, prosecutors violated his Charter rights. The Crown's consent is required for a judge-alone trial on certain charges, including murder.\n\nProsecutors pushed back against those arguments, pointing out that all the jurors picked to hear the case told a judge they could be impartial, and that just under half said they had never heard about the case to begin with.\n\nExperts contradicted each other: judge\n\nThe defence motion leaned heavily on a poll Skibicki's legal team commissioned earlier this year, in which nearly all respondents said they had heard about the case, and a large proportion said they believed the accused is guilty.\n\nCourt also heard earlier this week from two experts called by the defence, including the pollster whose company conducted that survey. He testified the sample used was representative of Winnipeg and Manitoba.\n\nThe defence also called a U.S.-based expert on the effect of pretrial publicity on jury verdicts, who worked with Skibicki's defence team to create the questions asked in the poll. She testified the effects of pretrial publicity can be extremely difficult for jurors to overcome.\n\nHowever, Justice Joyal said Friday he found the two defence experts at times seemed to contradict each other.\n\nWhile the pollster said the opinions in the survey represent only a snapshot in time -- and people can change their minds later on with more information -- the jury expert was adamant that it can be nearly impossible for a juror to change their mind about a case once they form an opinion based on seeing media reports.\n\nThe judge also said he gave \"limited weight\" to the U.S.-based expert's testimony, since she lacked experience with the Canadian jury system.\n\nThe judge ultimately found Skibicki's lawyers didn't prove the trial was \"one of the clearest of cases\" where the requirement for Crown consent for a judge-alone trial should be overridden.\n\nJurors were asked 'unusually high' number of questions\n\nJustice Joyal also pointed out that jurors were selected to hear the case \"only after they were subject to a rigorous challenge for cause, consisting of an unusually high number of questions.\"\n\nThose questions, submitted by Skibicki's defence, included whether potential jurors had heard anything about the case, participated in protests or vigils related to the victims, and whether they'd be open to finding someone not criminally responsible.\n\nJurors also got specific instructions from the judge, including to set aside any bias they may have and to not consider anything outside of what's presented in court -- including media coverage of the case -- when making their decision.\n\nPolice initially arrested Skibicki roughly two years ago, after partial human remains later identified as Contois's were found in a garbage bin near a Winnipeg apartment building in mid-May 2022. The following month, police recovered more of her remains from the Brady Road landfill in south Winnipeg.\n\nPolice said their investigation determined the three other women were killed between March and May 2022 -- before Contois died. Police said they believe Myran's and Harris's remains are in the Prairie Green landfill north of Winnipeg.\n\nThey have said they believe Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe was Indigenous and in her mid-20s, but the location of her remains is unknown.\n\nPretrial motions in Skibicki's case are expected to continue next week with an application from the Crown to introduce similar-fact evidence in the trial.

Police have alleged he dumped the women's bodies in two Winnipeg-area landfills in 2022.\n\nFor three days this week, defence lawyers argued before Court of King's Bench Justice Glenn Joyal that there has been too much pretrial publicity for Mr. Skibicki's case to be heard by a jury. The legal team presented polling data and provided expert testimony to suggest that the 12 jurors selected last week do not have the capacity to be impartial.\n\nJustice Joyal said the motion asked the court to override the consent required from the Crown for a judge-alone trial. \"I've concluded, based on governing jurisprudence and the evidence before me, that this is not the clearest of cases required for me to override the Crown's discretion,\" he said Friday, as Mr. Skibicki sat quietly, wearing a grey T-shirt and jail-issue sweatpants with his ankles shackled.\n\n\"We believe jurors are able to rise to the heightened expectation required of the role in order to ensure a fair trial.\"\n\nThe jury will begin hearing opening arguments on May 8, Justice Joyal said. He added that he will provide detailed reasons for his decision in writing at a later date.\n\nThis was the second time Mr. Skibicki's lawyers had raised a formal motion for a judge-alone trial. The first was dismissed in January after pretrial deliberations, during which the defence said that denying him the right to be tried in the manner of his choosing was arbitrary and unconstitutional.\n\nBut after a jury comprised of three men and nine women was selected late last week, Mr. Skibicki's defence renewed efforts to change the mode of the trial, this time relying heavily on the results of an opinion poll commissioned by the lawyers in February.\n\nThe Mainstreet Research poll, which was submitted as an exhibit in court and released to media this week, surveyed 906 people in Manitoba during a four-day period. It found 81 per cent of respondents believed that, based on what they saw, read or heard about the case, Mr. Skibicki is guilty.\n\nQuito Maggi, president of Mainstreet Research, testified via video call about the veracity of the poll's data and sample size. Christine Ruva, a psychology professor at the University of South Florida, spoke about the questions she formulated with the defence.\n\nBoth Mr. Maggi and Dr. Ruva were challenged heavily by the Crown.\n\nProsecutor Ren\u00e9e Lagimodi\u00e8re said certain legal definitions were not provided in the poll. That created compromising results for respondents who may not know what terms such as \"self-defence\" and \"not criminally responsible\" meant, she said.\n\nMs. Lagimodi\u00e8re also argued that Mr. Maggi's firm did not have a stellar record of accurate polling. She cited his comments in a news story about a Mainstreet Research poll for Calgary's 2017 election, which declared a \"near-certain\" win for a candidate who ended up losing.\n\nMr. Maggi said, unlike this case, he had not conducted the research for the Calgary poll himself. \"I had a two-month-old at home at the time,\" he told the court. \"I'm sure my staff quoted me saying various things.\"\n\nHe added that the poll for Mr. Skibicki's case was seeking a \"snapshot of people's perception\" and did not require legal definitions. \"This is public opinion, not expert opinion,\" he said. \"People's inherent biases will come out regardless of logic or details.\"\n\nJustice Joyal noted his doubts to Mr. Maggi. He said if a group of people were given a \"more sophisticated understanding\" of what they were being asked, they would likely respond with different results when surveyed again a couple of weeks later.\n\nThe judge also questioned Dr. Ruva after she said \"it doesn't take a lot to bias jurors\" even on an \"unconscious\" level. He said he was not sure she was providing any viable alternatives to the court.\n\n\"So, the solution is what?\" Justice Joyal asked. \"Get rid of jury trials in high-profile cases?\"\n\nDefence lawyer Alyssa Munce said this is \"not a run-of-the-mill murder case.\" She argued that Mr. Skibicki's trial is \"unprecedented\" for Manitoba, given the scope of media attention it has received, which she said ignited a national outcry, including rallies and election platforms last year.\n\n\"The articles and the coverage of the press has been constant and consistent,\" Ms. Munce said. \"There is a reasonable probability that the potential jury pool was prejudiced.\"\n\nThe Crown countered by pointing out that last week's jury selection process found at least five of the vetted jurors had not heard of the case prior to being in court.\n\nPolice have alleged Mr. Skibicki is a serial killer who murdered 26-year-old Marcedes Myran, 39-year-old Morgan Harris, 24-year-old Rebecca Contois, and an unidentified woman whom Indigenous elders have named Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, meaning Buffalo Woman, in 2022.\n\nMs. Harris and Ms. Myran, both from Long Plain First Nation, were killed in spring of that year before their bodies were disposed of at Prairie Green landfill, a garbage dump north of Winnipeg, police said.\n\nMr. Skibicki, 35 at the time, was arrested in May, 2022, after Ms. Contois's partial remains were found in a garbage bin outside an apartment building in Winnipeg. More remains were later discovered at the separate Brady Road landfill in the southern outskirts of the city. She was a band member of Crane River First Nation.\n\nPolice have not shared information about the whereabouts of Buffalo Woman's remains, but have said she was Indigenous and in her mid-20s.",

She has been named Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe (Buffalo Woman) by Indigenous leaders.\n\nSkibicki's lawyers have said they will be arguing that he should be found not criminally responsible for the slaying by reason of mental disorder.\n\nIn a motion heard this past week, Skibicki's defence team argued extensive media coverage of the case has biased the jury pool to the extent that he would not receive a fair trial unless tried by a judge alone. In Canada, the Criminal Code mandates that absent consent by the Crown, murder trials are to be heard by a jury.\n\n\"I have concluded based on the governing jurisprudence and the evidence before me that this is not the clearest of cases requiring me to override Crown discretion,\" King's Bench Chief Justice Glenn Joyal said Friday. \"As a result, the defence motion is dismissed.\"\n\nDr. Christine Ruva, a U.S. psychology professor and expert on the issue of jury bias, testified for the defence that pre-trial media attention creates unconscous bias in a jury pool that is unlikely to be corrected by judicial safeguards and trial processes.\n\nRuva worked with Skibicki's defence team on a February poll that found 73 per cent of respondents who were aware of the case said they had a negative impression of Skibicki and 61 per cent said they had an opinion as to his guilt. Of those who said they had an opinion on guilt, 90 per cent expressed the opinion he was guilty.\n\nOf the 14 jurors (including two alternates) selected last week for Skibicki's trial, nine said they were aware of the case and five said they were not.\n\nJoyal said he gave \"limited weight\" to Ruva's testimony, citing her lack of experience and knowledge of the Canadian court system and her \"apparent rigid position\" that exposure to pre-trial publicity will inevitably lead to bias that is nearly impossible to overcome.\n\n\"Not only is that position not supported in Canadian jurisprudence, it appears to exist in contradiction\" to the evidence of pollster and defence witness Quito Maggi, who agreed under questioning that a juror's opinion could change over time if provided new information, Joyal said.\n\nCanadian courts have numerous safeguards to address juror bias, Joyal said, including screening at the selection stage, rules of evidence, instructions on the law and repeated reminders to base their verdicts only on the evidence.\n\n\"A (juror) faces a heightened civic responsibility when he, she or they take the juror's oath,\" Joyal said. \"It is the awareness and consciousness of this heightened responsibility which, in part, nourishes the presumption of impartiality. While it is expected that jurors, much like judges, are shaped by their lived experience -- including the media they digest -- in the Canadian judicial system we believe jurors are able to rise to the heightened expectation required of the role in order to ensure a fair trial is provided to a person.\"\n\nJoyal's ruling won't change how Skibicki's defence team handles the case moving forward, lawyer Leonard Tailleur said outside court.\n\n\"Onwards and upwards we go to the jury trial,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insanity defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisprudence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisprudence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_King's_Bench_(England)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Court of King's Bench (England)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal Code (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to a fair trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Joyal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Joyal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_system_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Court system of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evidence (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quito", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quito"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quito"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/2275238_web1_skibicki2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537662", "eventUri": "eng-9537662", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Jeremy Skibicki, 37, has pleaded not guilty to four counts of first-degree murder. His trial is to begin Wednesday.\n\nHere is a timeline of the case:\n\nMarch 15, 2022 -- Police say an unidentified woman is killed on or around this date.\n\nMay 1, 2022 -- Morgan Harris, a member of Long Plain First Nation living in Winnipeg, is last seen in the area of Main Street and Henry Avenue north of the city's downtown. Police say the 39-year-old is killed on or around this date.\n\nMay 4, 2022 -- Police say Marcedes Myran, 26, also of Long Plain First Nation and living in Winnipeg, is killed on or around this date.\n\nMay 14 or 15, 2022 -- Police say they believe 24-year-old Rebecca Contois of O-Chi-Chak-Ko-Sipi First Nation, also known as Crane River, is killed on or around these dates.\n\nMay 16, 2022 -- Officers find the partial remains of Contois in a garbage bin near an apartment building. They secure the Brady Road Resource Management Facility, a city-run landfill south of the city, where they believe there could be more remains. Police say they believe the remains of Harris and Myran were transported to the privately operated Prairie Green landfill, north of Winnipeg, on this day.\n\nMay 18, 2022 -- Skibicki is arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the death of Contois. Officers execute a search warrant at his apartment in the same area where her remains were found.\n\nMay 19, 2022 -- Police say remains found in the garbage bin near the building belong to Contois.\n\nJune 2, 2022 -- Police begin searching the Brady landfill.\n\nJune 20, 2022 -- Police say the remains of other victims are believed to be at the Prairie Green landfill.\n\nJune 21, 2022 -- Police say remains found at the Brady landfill are of Contois.\n\nDec. 1, 2022 -- Police charge Skibicki with three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Harris, Myran and the unidentified woman. They say the unknown woman is believed to be Indigenous and in her mid-20s. Indigenous leaders later name her Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe or Buffalo Woman.\n\nDec. 2, 2022 -- Skibicki appears in court and his lawyer, Leonard Tailleur, says Skibicki maintains his innocence. Police Chief Danny Smyth says the remains of Harris and Myran are believed to be at the Prairie Green landfill, but says no search is planned because too much time has passed.\n\nDec. 6, 2022 -- Police defend their decision not to search the Prairie Green landfill. Relatives of Harris share their disappointment and anger on Parliament Hill and say they are prepared to search on their own.\n\nDec. 8, 2022 -- Operations at the Prairie Green landfill stop as the Manitoba government and the City of Winnipeg decide how to proceed. First Nations leaders call for the police chief to resign.\n\nDec. 14, 2022 -- Smyth apologizes in a meeting with First Nations leaders and the victims' families for comments on not searching the landfill. Police are to be part of an Indigenous-led committee that will study the feasibility of a search.\n\nMay 12, 2023 -- The study says a landfill search is feasible but could take up to three years and cost $184 million. Family members and Indigenous leaders say it must go ahead.\n\nJuly 5, 2023 -- Manitoba's Progressive Conservative government says searching the landfill is too risky.\n\nJuly 6, 2023 -- Protesters at a camp set up at the Brady Road landfill begin blocking access to the site and demand governments search the Prairie Green landfill.\n\nJuly 14, 2023 -- A judge grants a temporary injunction to end the blockade and says demonstrators can continue to protest but cannot block the road.\n\nAug. 4, 2023 -- Relatives of Harris and Myran meet with federal Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Gary Anandasangaree. They later lead a round dance at a rally calling for a search of the landfill. Other rallies take place across the country.\n\nAug. 9, 2023 -- Manitoba's NDP promises a search if it wins the upcoming provincial election, which it does in October.\n\nJan. 26, 2024 -- Another study says a search could be done within one year and cost $90 million but searchers would face a health risk from asbestos.\n\nMarch 8, 2024 -- Family members of Harris and Myran and supporters rally outside the Manitoba legislature calling for a search.\n\nMarch 22, 2024 -- The federal and Manitoba governments say they will put up $20 million each to search the landfill.\n\nMay 2, 2024 -- A judge rules Skibicki's trial will be heard by a jury. The defence had argued jurors could be biased because of pretrial publicity.\n\nMay 6, 2024 -- Lawyers for Skibicki say he admits to killing the four women but is not criminally responsible because of mental illness. The Crown says due to complexities with the defence the trial can proceed without the jury.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 6, 2024.\n\nThe Canadian Press", "source":

First Nations leaders call for the police chief to resign.\n\nDec. 14, 2022 -- Smyth apologizes in a meeting with First Nations leaders and the victims' families for comments on not searching the landfill. Police are to be part of an Indigenous-led committee that will study the feasibility of a search.\n\nMay 12, 2023 -- The study says a landfill search is feasible but could take up to three years and cost $184 million.

The defence had argued jurors could be biased because of pretrial publicity.\n\nMay 6, 2024 -- Lawyers for Skibicki say he admits to killing the four women but is not criminally responsible because of mental illness.

He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges and had been due to stand trial this week.\n\nBut the surprise development on Monday prompted Crown prosecutors in the city of Winnipeg to agree to a judge-only trial, which could begin as early as Wednesday. Twelve jurors, who were selected last month, will be dismissed.\n\n\"At this point, the accused is now admitting that he killed all four women, and that is a new development,\" prosecutor Chris Vanderhooft told Manitoba's court of king's bench.\n\nSkibicki is believed to have left the bodies of at least two of his known victims at Winnipeg's Prairie Green landfill but police initially said that they did not have the resources to search the refuse at the facility, much of which is buried under tonnes of clay.\n\nPrevious reports suggested a search could take up to three years and cost anywhere between C$84m and C$184m (US$61m-$135m).\n\nIndigenous groups in Winnipeg have led marches and road blockades to pressure officials to approve a search.\n\nIn March, after the newly elected Manitoba premier, Wab Kinew, said he would make a search of Winnipeg's Prairie Green a priority for his government, Canada pledged tens of millions of dollars to aid in the effort.\n\nThe federal and Manitoba governments agreed to each contribute C$20m, but a recent report prepared by the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and ISN Maskwa, a company that provides emergency response training and services, suggests a thorough search could cost C$90m - more than double the figure offered by the governments - and would also put teams searchers at \"very high risk\" of encountering asbestos.\n\nThe admission from Skibicki's lawyers comes a day after the national day of awareness for missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls - also known as \"red dress day\".\n\nIn recent decades, at least 4,000 Indigenous women and girls have been murdered - or simply vanished, a reality described in a landmark 2019 report as a \"genocide\". And against a backdrop of systemic inequity and injustice, vulnerable Indigenous women continue to be victims of neglectful policies and state indifference.\n\nIt is unclear if Monday's revelations in court will give police and families a sense of where the bodies of Harris and Myran might be located, as well as the identity of Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leyland_cecco@theguardian.com", "name": "Leyland Cecco", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landfill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insanity defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manitoba"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manitoba"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_King's_Bench_(England)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Court of King's Bench (England)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crown attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_and_Murdered_Indigenous_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_Manitoba_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wab_Kinew", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wab Kinew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asbestos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad58b157915075b3b7a34399fe2d0e6515955d95/0_105_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=3a3dd80b406b8fea846ce32d5dc01143", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537662", "eventUri": "eng-9537662", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

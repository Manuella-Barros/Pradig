That decision will be taken over the next two days,\" the office-bearer added.\n\nThe AIFF sacked senior men's team head coach Stimac last month, terminating his contract exactly a year before it was to expire in the wake of the side's ouster from the second round of FIFA World Cup Qualifiers despite getting a relatively easy draw.\n\nStimac, who was appointed as the head coach in 2019, was last October given an extension until 2026 by the sport's apex body.\n\nTerming his sacking \"unilateral\", Stimac threatened to file a lawsuit against the national federation in the FIFA Tribunal if it failed to clear his dues within 10 days.\n\nSatyanarayan said, \"Now we must understand that the team is in a good space, we came very close to entering the third round (of World Cup Qualifiers).\n\n\"We have already finalised in October, the window whom we are playing, we are trying for September but we are not getting very good teams. But we need to finalise it, so as of now we are looking at teams that are a little lower than us, but we need to use that window.\n\n\"So let us see who the final candidates are then we will have to speak to them and then the decision will be taken, it will be an informed one.\"\n\nSatyanarayan, who is serving in the post since the removal of Shaji Prabhakaran last November, refused to reveal names of the candidates who have applied for the top job.\n\n\"I cannot tell because it will not be fair because some of the coaches who have applied are still in contract and they would not want to be named.\n\n\"It is just a matter of a few days so it is not a very simple thing to do because we had many applications, we are very happy to know that a lot of big coaches are keen to come to India which means the potential is there. so lets wait,\" Satyanarayan said.\n\nThe AIFF and Stimac often found themselves at loggerheads over important issues concerning the team, with the latter holding the federation's president Kalyan Chaubey responsible for India's failure to progress beyond the second round of the World Cup Qualifiers.\n\nAsked about the criteria for selecting the head coach, Satyanarayan said, \"Yes definitely, that is something we will zero in on, so depending on what we want and what they bring to the table, so that decision will happen, it should happen very soon.\"\n\nHe added, \"Right now we don't have anything up to next March so it also depends on what the coach also wants to do, maybe he has got a long-term plan so now we are at a very premature stage.\n\n\"What we have done with the ones we have got, there's also a difference, you have club coaches, you have national team coaches. There is a difference between them because the club coaches have the players with them almost a whole year, national coaches is a little different, so all those things will be discussed.\n\n\"We have got some competent people who can do that.\"\n\nThe retirement of the legendary Sunil Chhetri has left a huge void in the team and it does not look like it will be filled anytime soon.\n\nSpeaking further, Satyanarayan said, \"We also don't have time because if you are looking at September, then we have got the whole of August now and we would also like to move fast because the boys have also been playing well.\n\n\"We will see, this year Durand Cup is starting, maybe some names will come up so we will see.

But we need to finalise it, so as of now we are looking at teams that are a little lower than us, but we need to use that window.\n\n\"So let us see who the final candidates are then we will have to speak to them and then the decision will be taken, it will be an informed one.\"\n\nSatyanarayan, who is serving in the post since the removal of Shaji Prabhakaran last November, refused to reveal names of the candidates who have applied for the top job.\n\n\"I cannot tell because it will not be fair because some of the coaches who have applied are still in contract and they would not want to be named.\n\n\"It is just a matter of a few days so it is not a very simple thing to do because we had many applications, we are very happy to know that a lot of big coaches are keen to come to India which means the potential is there. so lets wait,\" Satyanarayan said.\n\nThe AIFF and Stimac often found themselves at loggerheads over important issues concerning the team, with the latter holding the federation's president Kalyan Chaubey responsible for India's failure to progress beyond the second round of the World Cup Qualifiers.\n\nAsked about the criteria for selecting the head coach, Satyanarayan said, \"Yes definitely, that is something we will zero in on, so depending on what we want and what they bring to the table, so that decision will happen, it should happen very soon.\"\n\nHe added, \"Right now we don't have anything up to next March so it also depends on what the coach also wants to do, maybe he has got a long-term plan so now we are at a very premature stage.\n\n\"What we have done with the ones we have got, there's also a difference, you have club coaches, you have national team coaches. There is a difference between them because the club coaches have the players with them almost a whole year, national coaches is a little different, so all those things will be discussed.\n\n\"We have got some competent people who can do that.\"\n\nThe retirement of the legendary Sunil Chhetri has left a huge void in the team and it does not look like it will be filled anytime soon.\n\nSpeaking further, Satyanarayan said, \"We also don't have time because if you are looking at September, then we have got the whole of August now and we would also like to move fast because the boys have also been playing well.\n\n\"We will see, this year Durand Cup is starting, maybe some names will come up so we will see. I don't want to say who it is but a handful of them who can fill in for him and we saw that in the last match, the boys played well without Sunil.\"", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_\u0160timac", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Igor \u0160timac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All India Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Asia_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's Asia Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Kaur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Kaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafali_Verma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shafali Verma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smriti_Mandhana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smriti Mandhana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Durand Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Chhetri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Chhetri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/default-img-02.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747733", "eventUri": "eng-9747733", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 280, "textEnd": 286}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

That decision will be taken over the next two days,\" the office-bearer added.\n\nThe AIFF sacked senior men's team head coach Stimac last month, terminating his contract exactly a year before it was to expire in the wake of the side's ouster from the second round of FIFA World Cup Qualifiers despite getting a relatively easy draw.\n\nStimac, who was appointed as the head coach in 2019, was last October given an extension until 2026 by the sport's apex body.\n\nTerming his sacking \"unilateral\", Stimac threatened to file a lawsuit against the national federation in the FIFA Tribunal if it failed to clear his dues within 10 days.\n\nSatyanarayan said, \"Now we must understand that the team is in a good space, we came very close to entering the third round (of World Cup Qualifiers).\n\n\"We have already finalised in October, the window whom we are playing, we are trying for September but we are not getting very good teams. But we need to finalise it, so as of now we are looking at teams that are a little lower than us, but we need to use that window.\n\n\"So let us see who the final candidates are then we will have to speak to them and then the decision will be taken, it will be an informed one.\" Satyanarayan, who is serving in the post since the removal of Shaji Prabhakaran last November, refused to reveal names of the candidates who have applied for the top job.\n\n\"I cannot tell because it will not be fair because some of the coaches who have applied are still in contract and they would not want to be named.\n\n\"It is just a matter of a few days so it is not a very simple thing to do because we had many applications, we are very happy to know that a lot of big coaches are keen to come to India which means the potential is there. so lets wait,\" Satyanarayan said.\n\nThe AIFF and Stimac often found themselves at loggerheads over important issues concerning the team, with the latter holding the federation's president Kalyan Chaubey responsible for India's failure to progress beyond the second round of the World Cup Qualifiers.\n\nAsked about the criteria for selecting the head coach, Satyanarayan said, \"Yes definitely, that is something we will zero in on, so depending on what we want and what they bring to the table, so that decision will happen, it should happen very soon.\" He added, \"Right now we don't have anything up to next March so it also depends on what the coach also wants to do, maybe he has got a long-term plan so now we are at a very premature stage.\n\n\"What we have done with the ones we have got, there's also a difference, you have club coaches, you have national team coaches. There is a difference between them because the club coaches have the players with them almost a whole year, national coaches is a little different, so all those things will be discussed.\n\n\"We have got some competent people who can do that.\" The retirement of the legendary Sunil Chhetri has left a huge void in the team and it does not look like it will be filled anytime soon.\n\nSpeaking further, Satyanarayan said, \"We also don't have time because if you are looking at September, then we have got the whole of August now and we would also like to move fast because the boys have also been playing well.\n\n\"We will see, this year Durand Cup is starting, maybe some names will come up so we will see.

That decision will be taken over the next two days,\" the office-bearer added.\n\nALSO READ | East Bengal signs Jeakson Singh from Kerala Blasters on four-year-deal\n\nThe AIFF sacked senior men's team head coach Stimac last month, terminating his contract exactly a year before it was to expire in the wake of the side's ouster from the second round of FIFA World Cup Qualifiers despite getting a relatively easy draw.\n\nStimac, who was appointed as the head coach in 2019, was last October given an extension until 2026 by the sport's apex body.\n\nTerming his sacking \"unilateral\", Stimac threatened to file a lawsuit against the national federation in the FIFA Tribunal if it failed to clear his dues within 10 days.\n\nSatyanarayan said, \"Now we must understand that the team is in a good space, we came very close to entering the third round (of World Cup Qualifiers).\n\n\"We have already finalised in October, the window whom we are playing, we are trying for September but we are not getting very good teams. But we need to finalise it, so as of now we are looking at teams that are a little lower than us, but we need to use that window.\n\n\"So let us see who the final candidates are then we will have to speak to them and then the decision will be taken, it will be an informed one.\" Satyanarayan, who is serving in the post since the removal of Shaji Prabhakaran last November, refused to reveal names of the candidates who have applied for the top job.\n\n\"I cannot tell because it will not be fair because some of the coaches who have applied are still in contract and they would not want to be named.\n\n\"It is just a matter of a few days so it is not a very simple thing to do because we had many applications, we are very happy to know that a lot of big coaches are keen to come to India which means the potential is there. so lets wait,\" Satyanarayan said.\n\nALSO READ | Mohun Bagan Super Giant signs Greg Stewart\n\nThe AIFF and Stimac often found themselves at loggerheads over important issues concerning the team, with the latter holding the federation's president Kalyan Chaubey responsible for India's failure to progress beyond the second round of the World Cup Qualifiers.\n\nAsked about the criteria for selecting the head coach, Satyanarayan said, \"Yes definitely, that is something we will zero in on, so depending on what we want and what they bring to the table, so that decision will happen, it should happen very soon.\" He added, \"Right now we don't have anything up to next March so it also depends on what the coach also wants to do, maybe he has got a long-term plan so now we are at a very premature stage.\n\n\"What we have done with the ones we have got, there's also a difference, you have club coaches, you have national team coaches. There is a difference between them because the club coaches have the players with them almost a whole year, national coaches is a little different, so all those things will be discussed.\n\n\"We have got some competent people who can do that.\" The retirement of the legendary Sunil Chhetri has left a huge void in the team and it does not look like it will be filled anytime soon.\n\nSpeaking further, Satyanarayan said, \"We also don't have time because if you are looking at September, then we have got the whole of August now and we would also like to move fast because the boys have also been playing well.\n\n\"We will see, this year Durand Cup is starting, maybe some names will come up so we will see. I don't want to say who it is but a handful of them who can fill in for him and we saw that in the last match, the boys played well without Sunil.\"\n\nLatest on SportstarAIFF has a shortlist of 20

The AIFF's technical committee is scheduled to meet in two days to discuss the matter.

Senior AIFF officials decided to terminate Stimac's tenure during a virtual meeting.\n\nDetailing the process for appointing the new coach, Satanarayan stated, \"The announcement will be made within a week. We have received numerous applications and have shortlisted around 20-25 candidates. Availability and suitability will be key factors. The committee will decide on the kind of coach they want in the upcoming meeting.\" He also emphasized the positive impact of the Indian Super League (ISL), which he described as an excellent platform for Indian football.\n\nSatanarayan added, \"Many renowned coaches are showing interest here.

A complication is that Marquez will remain the coach of FC Goa for the 2024-25 season, with the 55-year-old set to balance duties between club and country.\n\nAfter the departure of Igor Stimac, and the retirement of Sunil Chhetri, Marquez's appointment represents a new era for the Indian football team.\n\nHow will it go? There's no crystal ball to rely on, but years of Marquez's teams in the ISL (Hyderabad FC and FC Goa) are enough to make a prediction. Here's what his appointment means to Indian football:\n\nLet's leave aside the complexities of the role Marquez has chosen to undertake for now. The fact is that he is the best man for the job. In these very pages, Marquez had been dubbed as a 'pure fantasy' choice, given his role with FC Goa, but AIFF have made that a reality.\n\nMarquez brings with him a wealth of experience in developing young Indian players. The likes of Liston Colaco, Akash Mishra, Asish Rai, Jay Gupta, Nikhil Poojary and more all blossomed under him in the ISL and went on to feature for the Indian national team. Marquez has never been shy in blooding young players (and sticking with them) - given the generation of Indian footballers coming through, Marquez seems an ideal choice.\n\nHe's already familiar with India's squad - having either managed them or against them, so is intimately aware of their strengths and flaws. The familiarity extends to his dealings with the Indian football environment - Marquez has dealt with the media with an honesty (bordering on being too blunt) that has endeared him to the press, while also negotiating the backroom pitfalls ever present in Indian football.\n\nHe took a club with meagre resources like Hyderabad FC to the pinnacle of Indian football, and his ability to inspire his sides as an underdog is unmatched. Marquez is equally adept at a backs-to-the-wall style of play and front-foot football, which is perfect for the challenges the Indian football team will face in the coming years.\n\nThe AIFF had to deal with a lot of applicants for the role, and even 'bigger' names like Park Hang-Seo were reportedly in the mix. Putting aside salary constraints, Marquez would've still been the better choice over them simply because of his familiarity with Indian football.\n\nManolo Marquez's first task will be to replace the 94-goal sized hole in the Indian squad - Chhetri's departure has left a void, but Marquez has already proved he can adapt to such happenings. Like when Bart Ogbeche's scoring boots went missing in his final year with Hyderabad, but he still pushed his team to the playoffs. He focused on the collective then, and India will need a similar focus now.\n\nHowever, that may be easier said than done in the aftermath of Igor Stimac's sacking. The Indian dressing room was one that was very loyal to the Croatian and there may be fears within of Marquez favouring players who featured under him in the ISL. To give him his due, Marquez has never shied away from dropping under-performing big names, so there is hope that his will be a meritorious dressing room.\n\nIndia are also coming off some very disappointing results, with an air of divisiveness permeating as Stimac's reign came to an end. Unity and leadership is the need of the hour, and Marquez has quite the task here.\n\nThe elephant in the room that's been ignored until now is the complexity of the role Marquez has undertaken. Club football is a day-to-day grind, and there are very few days off at the top level. To juggle an FC Goa side that will feature in an expanded ISL (now with 13 teams), a Durand and Super Cup as well as an Indian team that will feature in friendlies/tournaments that the AIFF will arrange as well as the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers is quite taxing.\n\nWhile flitting between club and country is easy enough in FIFA Career Mode, real life isn't that easy. Marquez will have to switch up between different resources in his backroom staff (and perhaps even different personnel), and if Stimac's allegations post his sacking are to be believed, Marquez will have to deal with the inefficiencies of AIFF's operations to boot.\n\nGoa are a settled club doing plenty of things right behind the scenes, which is clearly not the case with the Indian national team. A fiasco like that of the lack of GPS vests before important World Cup qualifiers will not be tolerated by a coach who has those available at club level.\n\nThe AIFF have made the right appointment with Marquez, but the potential for it to go pear-shaped remains if the federation's inefficiencies continue.\n\nMarquez will be tied up in Goa's matchday preparations, which will not afford him the time to view other fixtures in person. Yes, he will play each ISL club twice, but the potential for scouting country-wide for emerging prospects will be reduced. Stimac barely attended domestic football in person, and it seems the trend will continue in a reduced way - one doubts Marquez will have the time to even consider players from the I-League.\n\nThere's also the issue of a conflict-of-interest if Marquez prioritizes his Goan players over others - or vice versa. What would an Akash Mishra think if Jay Gupta keeps being picked over him? Or how would a Jay Gupta react back in club football if he's dropped in favour of Akash Mishra?\n\nEven (the very unlikely) scenario where Marquez may opt to rest his club players in an international window to keep his ISL hopes alive will raise questions. The scenario that Marquez will operate under for the 2024-25 season is littered with these sorts of conflicts and they'll only serve to undermine him.\n\nWhile Marquez's legend in Indian football has grown year-on-year, it's also revealed that he possesses quite the temper on the touchline. Stimac's disciplinary issues on the touchline were well known, and a similar outcome with Marquez wouldn't do his team any favours.The Spaniard can also revert to dour, defensive football if his team is the underdog, which could be a scenario when India go through the AFC Asian Cup qualification cycle. It could turn away potential new fans of the national team.\n\nNonetheless, despite the complications, Marquez will be keen to bring success to a country he considers his 'second home', and that's arguably enough to not doubt his motivation for the role.\n\nGiven his success in the ISL, expectations are high - but so is the caliber of the coach AIFF has appointed.

In a press release, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) stated that Marquez will also remain head coach of FC Goa for the whole of next season as well.\n\n\"During the 2024-25 season, Mr. Marquez will continue his role as the head coach of first team at FC Goa, handling both responsibilities concurrently before assuming the national coaching role on a full-time basis,\" the release stated.\n\nEarlier, ESPN India had picked Marquez as a potential candidate to replace the outgoing Igor Stimac, but due to his club commitments, we'd kept him in the \"pure fantasy\" category - but it appears AIFF has worked out an arranged with Goa and Marquez.\n\nWhile Marquez's coaching acumen, and ability to get the best out of Indian youngsters, is unquestionable, it remains to be seen how he will be able to balance the demands of coaching a national and club side. This is especially heightened by the crossroads the national team finds itself in post Sunil Chhetri's retirement - addressing it would take the kind of hands-on approach that Marquez specializes in. But his attention will also have to be split toward a Goa side going through a similar transition (after the sales of Brandon Fernandes and Noah Sadaoui). Juggling the two interests will take quite the effort.\n\nMeanwhile, AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey said, \"We are delighted to welcome Mr. Marquez to this important role and are also thankful to FC Goa for their generosity of releasing him for national duty. We look forward to working with Mr. Marquez in the years ahead. The AIFF, FC Goa, and Mr. Marquez will collaborate closely to ensure there is minimal impact between the two jobs and strive to achieve the best possible results for all involved.\"\n\nOn their part, FC Goa released a statement with their CEO Ravi Puskur saying, \"We have always had the good of Indian football at our heart and have been keen supporters throughout. And we felt that this should be the step to take in the best interests of the Indian national team...\", and added, \"Manolo is a figure that commands respect in the Indian football fraternity - be it players, coaches, or other stakeholders. He is familiar with the Indian culture. I wish these qualities bring him and the national team success.\"\n\nMarquez has a stellar record of coaching in India. In his first stint, he transformed underdogs Hyderabad FC into ISL champions before he took over at Goa. Last season, Goa finished third in the league and reached the semifinals of the playoffs.\n\nBefore coming to India, Marquez had extensive experience coaching in Spain at clubs like Las Palmas (in La Liga), and Las Palmas B, Espanyol B, Badalona, Prat, Europa (third division).", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Goa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Goa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All India Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Sports (Indian TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_\u0160timac", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Igor \u0160timac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Goa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Sadaoui", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Sadaoui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Fernandes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Fernandes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Chhetri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Chhetri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UD_Las_Palmas_Atl\u00e9tico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UD Las Palmas Atl\u00e9tico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCD_Espanyol_B", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RCD Espanyol B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segunda_Divisi\u00f3n_B", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Super_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Super League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UD_Las_Palmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UD Las Palmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0308%2Fr1141358_1200x675_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747733", "eventUri": "eng-9747733", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Marquez retired professionally at the age of 28 after playing for clubs like CE Cerdanyola and Santfeliuenc FC. He started his managerial career with PB Anguera in 2002 and has not looked back since.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Marquez is not new to the Indian football circuit. He was the head coach at Hyderabad FC for three years from 2020 to 2023. Under him, in the 2021-22 season, the team won their first ISL title. He then moved to FC Goa, where he also had an impressive stint, leading the team to the semifinals of the ISL 2023-24 season.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how he crafts the Indian football team, which is once again facing a 'winning issue'. A few months back, the team lost to Afghanistan on home soil.

Senior officials of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) held a virtual meeting and decided to terminate Stimac's services as the head coach.\n\nSpeaking about the process of appointing a new coach, Satanarayan said, \"Maximum by a week (new coach announcement). We have received a lot of applicants and have shortlisted around 20-25. We have to see if they are available. Then, we will open up the talks. The committee in two days will meet to decide what kind of coach they want.\"\n\nHe also said that the Indian Super League (ISL), the top-tier football league in the nation, has worked as a fine advertisment for Indian football.\n\n\"A lot of big coaches are coming here. The boys have done really well,\" he added.\n\nIndia's run in the qualification for the FIFA World Cup 2026 ended on a controversial note after Qatar clinched a 2-1 win in the World Cup Qualifier Second Round Group A clash at the Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium in Doha. India led the game until the 72nd minute of the game but Qatar levelled the game following a controversial equaliser. Yousef Aymen found the back of the net after the ball had gone out of play. They scored another goal in the final minutes of the game to clinch a 2-1 victory and end Igor Stimac's side's run in the qualification race.\n\nQatar held onto their lead and ended India's hopes of making it into the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier. India slid down to number three position in Group A with five points in six games, having won only one game. Qatar (16 points) and Kuwait (7 points) are in the top two spots.\n\nStimac took over as India's coach in 2019 and led them to two SAFF Championship titles in 2021 and 2023, one Tri-Nation series title last year and one Intercontinental Cup title win last year.

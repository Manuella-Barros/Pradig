Check back here shortly after for full details.\n\nWill there be a Nokia 8 live stream?\n\nNokia has confirmed that there will be a live stream, which we will embed at the top of this page.\n\nWhen is the Nokia 8 release date?\n\nAlthough the phone is almost certainly going to be announced tomorrow, this does not mean it will be immediately available. After all, the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 that were announced at MWC back in February have only just gone on sale. We'll bring you full details when we know more.\n\nHow much will the Nokia 8 cost in the UK?\n\nVarious leaked information hints at a price tag of around \u00a3500 for the Nokia 8, which would make sense if the Nokia 9 is expected to have the better specification - most flagships in the UK today have RRPs between \u00a3600 and \u00a3650.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Nokia 8 and Nokia 9?\n\nMany of the rumoured specifications for the Nokia 8 and Nokia 9 are similar, but the Nokia 9 is thought to be larger and to feature a higher screen-to-body ratio. While the 5.3in Nokia 8 will likely feature a 16:9 panel, the 5.7in Nokia 9 could see a 18:9 virtually full-screen display. Both are said to be Quad-HD displays with protective Gorilla Glass 5.\n\nThe Nokia 9 may also feature an iris scanner, and extra helpings of memory and storage - at 6GB and 128GB respectively.\n\nWhat are the rumoured new features and specifications?\n\nOne of the highlights is expected to be a Carl Zeiss-branded dual-camera, with Zeiss reportedly \"rekindling its commitment to set new imaging standards for Nokia customers\".\n\nThere could be three 13Mp premium cameras in total, with one at the front and two at the rear. A leaked camera interface image suggests one of these rear cameras may have a monochrome sensor.\n\nThe core hardware is thought to be in line with other flagship Android phones, with the Nokia 8 likely running a 10nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor (with integrated Adreno 540 GPU), 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. It is possible that the Nokia 8 will get the Snapdragon 660 with the 835 reserved for the Nokia 9, but the latest information suggests otherwise.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will charge over USB-C, but it is not known whether or not it will also charge wirelessly. With the Snapdragon 835 inside it should support Quick Charge 4.0.\n\nWe had assumed that the Nokia 8 would be running Nougat with a timely update to Android O following its release. However, with rumours now suggesting Android O could be no more than a week away and a Nokia 8 popping up on Geekbench running the software, it's possible the company has teamed up with Google to put the new OS on its devices first.\n\nRumoured specifications Nokia 8 Display 5.3in Quad-HD (2560x1440), 16:9, Gorilla Glass 5 Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 (Adreno 540 GPU) RAM 4GB (6GB & 8GB options could follow) Storage 64GB Primary camera Dual 13Mp Carl Zeiss cameras Selfie camera 13Mp Connectivity 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4, USB-C, Quick Charge 4.0 Fingerprint scanner Yes, rear-mounted Waterproofing IP68 Dimensions 151.55x73.7mm What does the Nokia 8 look like?\n\nIt's anticipated that the Nokia 8 will look very much like the smartphones lower down the line - Nokia made a point of saying no matter the price point you'll get a premium design when it announced its earlier handsets.\n\nVentureBeat has published the following image. In line with the rumours, there is a dual-camera on the rear, and what looks to be a 16:9 screen with a physical home button below the screen.\n\nFour colour options are expected to include Blue, Steel, Gold/Blue and Gold/Copper, all of which should offer IP68 waterproofing protection.\n\nAlso see: Best new phones coming in 2017 & 2018\n\nFollow Marie Black on Twitter.", "id": "9302846", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Everything we know about the Nokia 8 ahead of its launch tomorrow", "image": "https://cdn3.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3652766/nokia_8_photo_800_thumb800.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 685, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 699}, {"textStart": 1902, "date": "-05-09", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1907}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}, "id": "306746", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}, "id": "307030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}, "id": "308363", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adreno"}, "id": "351564", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adreno"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "15:07:00"}

In line with the rumours, there is a dual-camera on the rear, and what looks to be a 16:9 screen with a physical home button below the screen.\n\nFour colour options are expected to include Blue, Steel, Gold/Blue and Gold/Copper, all of which should offer IP68 waterproofing protection.\n\nAlso see: Best new phones coming in 2017 & 2018\n\nFollow Marie Black on Twitter.", "id": "9294008", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Everything we know about the Nokia 8 ahead of its launch tomorrow", "image": "https://cdn3.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3652766/nokia_8_photo_800_thumb800.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 685, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 699}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}, "id": "306746", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}, "id": "307030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}, "id": "308363", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adreno"}, "id": "351564", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adreno"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "14:15:00"}

Could the flagship Nokia 9 be among them?\n\nWhen is the Nokia 9 launch?\n\nNokia's press event will take place in London at 7.30pm on Wednesday 16 August 2017. Check back here for full details after that time.\n\nWill there be a Nokia 9 live stream?\n\nNokia has confirmed that there will be a live stream of the event, which we will embed at the top of this page.\n\nWhen is the Nokia 9 release date?\n\nAlthough the phone may be announced tomorrow, this does not mean it will be immediately available. The Nokia 3, 5 and 6 that were announced at February's MWC have only just gone on sale. We'll bring you full details when we know more.\n\nHow much will the Nokia 9 cost in the UK?\n\nThe new Nokia 9 is thought to be priced at around $800 or \u00a3634 with 128GB of storage, and $950 or \u00a3753 with 256GB.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Nokia 8 and Nokia 9?\n\nMany of the rumoured specifications for the Nokia 8 and Nokia 9 are similar, but the Nokia 9 is thought to be larger and to feature a higher screen-to-body ratio. While the 5.3in Nokia 8 will likely feature a 16:9 panel, the 5.7in Nokia 9 could see a 18:9 virtually full-screen display, putting it in line with the Galaxy S8 and LG G6. Both are said to be Quad-HD displays with protective Gorilla Glass 5.\n\nThe Nokia 9 may feature an iris scanner, and is said to have an extra 2GB of RAM over the Nokia 8. It may also come with 128GB storage as standard.\n\nWhat are the rumoured new features and specifications?\n\nThe camera is now known to be a key selling point for the upcoming smartphone, with HMD Global confirming that Nokia's collaboration with Zeiss optics is back on. Zeiss is reportedly \"rekindling its commitment to set new imaging standards for Nokia customers\".\n\nWe should see a dual-camera - potentially 13Mp with separate RGB and monochrome sensors. A 13Mp selfie camera may also be found at the front.\n\nThe Nokia 9 is thought to be the flagship in Nokia's Android phone family, and as such will likely run the 10nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 with Adreno 540 GPU, plus 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.\n\nIt will likely feature IP68 waterproofing, as well as a fingerprint scanner, the aforementioned iris scanner, and a 3,500- to 3,800mAh battery with Quick Charge 4.0 support.\n\nWhy all the fuss over Nokia Android phones?\n\nApart from the fact Nokia used to be one of the biggest brands in the mobile market (Nokia was the Apple of the early 21st century), Nokia Android phones are interesting because they are said to be different to rival Android phones in three main ways:\n\n* Through Nokia's relentless focus on the everyday experience, whether that is seen in the display or the camera\n\n* Through its premium design and build quality that is present no matter where in the line-up a model sits\n\n* Through its use of the purest version of Android you have seen, with monthly security updates, fast Android platform updates and the implementation of the Google Assistant across the range\n\nAlso see: Best new phones coming in 2017\n\nFollow Marie Black on Twitter.", "id": "9302829", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Will HMD unveil the flagship Nokia 9 tomorrow?", "image": "https://cdn2.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3661463/nokia_9_rumours_thumb800.png", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 690, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 704}, {"textStart": 1814, "date": "-05-09", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1819}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}, "id": "307030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adreno"}, "id": "351564", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adreno"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 728, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems"}], "time": "15:07:00"}

The company is said to launch three new phones at an event set to be held in London.\n\nBefore making the announcement, the company has been teasing about the reveal of its \"next milestone\". This is an important aspect to note, given that HMD Global and Zeiss have teamed up to bring Carl Zeiss optics back on Nokia smartphones once again.\n\nWithout further ado, let's get to know more about the expected devices at today's event.\n\nNokia 8\n\nNokia in the past has been known for its breakthrough camera phones - the Nokia N8 and the Nokia 808 PureView are two standout examples.\n\nThis, coupled with the fact that the Nokia 8 had been spotted on one of the official websites of the company. That leak confirmed the front of the phone, but that doesn't say much really given that the main cameras were not revealed in the leak.\n\nHowever, since then there have been numerous leaks about the phone. Many recent reports suggest that the Nokia 8 will come with a 5.3-inch Quad HD AMOLED display, an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and feature Carl Zeiss optics. The phone is expected to run on Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box, which will obviously run the stock version of the OS.\n\nAs for the cameras, the Nokia 8 is expected to come with a dual-camera setup on the back, both being 13MP Carl Zeiss optics. The front camera is also expected to be a 13MP unit. The Nokia 8 may come in 4GB and 6GB memory variants, with the storage variants expected to be 64GB and 128GB.\n\nWhile we are pretty sure of the Nokia 8 launch, the company might also rumored to launch two more handsets today. All the signs point towards a new Nokia 2 and a Nokia 3310 3G variant.\n\nNokia 2\n\nOther than the Nokia 8, HMD Global is also preparing to launch the Nokia 2 at the London event. This will be an affordable entry-level smartphone with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 processor expected to power it. The display could measure 5-inches and come with HD (720p) resolution.\n\nNokia 3310 3G\n\nLastly, we are also expecting to see HMD Global launch a 3G variant of the new Nokia 3310. The one launched earlier this year supported only 2G networks, surprisingly, so HMD may be looking at making improvements in that regard with the Nokia 3310 3G.\n\nBoth the Nokia 2 and Nokia 3310 3G have been spotted on FCC's website. Additionally, the Nokia 3310 3G was also confirmed by an Irish retailer, so these two phones are all but confirmed.", "id": "9515052", "details": {"liCnt": 3}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia to launch its new phone today: what to expect?", "image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xMkADbGHVr3fYB3Wsuh4k4-1200-80.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1508, "date": "-05-08", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1513}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}, "id": "308710", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "3G"}, "id": "319925", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G"}, {"label": {"eng": "720p"}, "id": "322948", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}, "id": "329085", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 808 PureView"}, "id": "450512", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_808_PureView"}, {"label": {"eng": "S60 (software platform)"}, "id": "456644", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S60_(software_platform)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia N8"}, "id": "851404", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N8"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}], "time": "15:55:00"}

Nokia is all set to take the wraps off its first Android flagship smartphone at an in event in London at 7:30pm today (12am Thursday, IST). The Nokia 8 has been subject to various leaks and rumours over the past few months and has unquestionably been one of the most hotly anticipated smartphones of the year.\n\nWhen HMD Global, the company behind Nokia's resurgence, took to the stage at MWC 2017 to announce the Nokia 3, Nokia 5, Nokia 6 and the re-incarnation of the Nokia 3310, there was a certain aura of disappointment amongst ardent Nokia fans at the lack of announcement of a proper flagship.\n\nAll that is about to change - the Nokia 8 will not only be Nokia's first flagship smartphone in years, it will also be the first high-end smartphone from the Finnish company to run Android. Earlier rumours pointed towards the Nokia 9 being Nokia's first Android powered flagship smartphone but now it seems that the Nokia 8 will be announced first.\n\nAlso Read: Nokia 6 quick review: Stellar looks, stock Android and a whole lot of nostalgia\n\nThe Nokia 8 is expected to retain the company's tank like build quality, stock Android and Lumia-like design seen in the Nokia 6 while packing in high-end internals, Carl Zeiss branded dual cameras and a high-res display. Here is everything you should expect from the Nokia 8:\n\nAccording to images leaked by Evan Blass, the Nokia 8 will be made entirely out of metal and will carry forward the design language seen in the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 - modern yet a call back to Lumia smartphones of old. The smartphone is expected to come with a vertical dual camera setup at the rear, a physical home button at the front and a 16:9 screen - no Galaxy S8 like edge-to-edge screen here sadly. It will be available in four colours at launch, namely blue, steel, gold/blue and gold/copper.While the smartphone will not come with a bezel-less design, it is expected to continue Nokia's legacy of building extremely solid tank-like smartphones. Alasdair Mcphail, design director at HMD Global had this to say about designing the new Nokia smartphones to Forbes - \"The goal was to deliver fantastically durable and smart devices that are at the same time so beautiful you fall in love with them.\"The Nokia 8 is expected to be powered by Qualcomm's latest and greatest processor - the Snapdragon 835 paired with either 4 or 6 GB of RAM, the Adreno 540 GPU and 64GB of internal storage which will be expandable via a microSD card. The 10nm Snapdragon 835 is arguably one of the most powerful processors available in the market and is currently used by smartphones such as the OnePlus 5, HTC U11, Xiaomi Mi 6 and Samsung Galaxy S8. The smartphone is also said to come with support for Quick Charge 4.0.The Nokia 8 is set to come with a 5.3-inch Quad HD display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 which will be covered by Gorilla Glass 5 for protection against nicks and scratches. It might also come with Nokia's trademark ClearBlack display technology. On the multimedia front, the smartphone will come with a 3.5mm headphone jack which is fast becoming a rarity in today's flagships. It might also feature Dolby ATMOS audio and 'OZO audio' enhancements.Nokia has gives us iconic camera phones in the past like the Nokia N95, the first smartphone in the world to come with a 5MP rear camera and the Nokia 808 PureView which came with a whopping 41MP rear camera. The Nokia 8 is expected to continue the company's rich heritage when it comes to smartphone photography. It is set to come with a Carl Zeiss branded dual camera setup at the rear with two 13MP sensors and a dual-LED flash. New rumours claim that one of the sensors might be a monochrome sensor. On the front, there is expected to be a 12MP camera for selfies. The rear camera is expected to support 4K video recording.Just like the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6, the Nokia 8 will most definitely run on a 100 percent stock build of Android Nougat. HMD Global has promised that all Nokia smartphones will get monthly security updates and new versions of Android in a timely manner. Their motto is - 'Pure, Secure and Up to Date'. Unlike the Nokia 3, which ships with Android 7.0, the Nokia 8 is expected to ship with Android 7.1.1 out of the box.A sketchy rumours out there claims that Nokia might follow in the footsteps of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and equip the Nokia 8 with an Iris scanner. However, we have not heard much about this claim lately and latest images and renders do not point towards this being true. What does seem true is the fact that the Nokia 8 will come with a fingerprint sensor embedded in the home button up front. It will also support 4G LTE and dualSIMs.The Nokia 8 will be announced at an event in London at 7:30pm today. While Nokia has not revealed any official details about pricing yet, rumours claim that the smartphone will be priced at 589 Euros, which roughly translates to around Rs 43,600. At that price, the Nokia 8 will be cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy S8 an iPhone 7 Plus and upcoming flagship smartphones like the Galaxy Note 8.\n\nAlso Read: Nokia 8 with Snapdragon 835 processor, dual rear cameras set to launch today", "id": "9417469", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8: What to expect from Nokia's first Android flagship phone launching today", "image": "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/nokia-8_559_071817124444_081617114347.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Xiaomi Tech"}, "id": "314119", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi_Tech"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}, "id": "329085", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 808 PureView"}, "id": "450512", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_808_PureView"}, {"label": {"eng": "S60 (software platform)"}, "id": "456644", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S60_(software_platform)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia N95"}, "id": "687845", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N95"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft Lumia"}, "id": "1271128", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Lumia"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "06:46:00"}

Nokia 8 likely to be unveiled today as HMD Global gears up for flagship launchNokia 5 smartphone to go on sale from August 15: All you need to knowNokia 3310 with 3G support to launch in late September or early October\n\nHMD Global is gearing up to launch the Nokia 8 later today i.e. August 16, in London at 7:30pm BST (12:00am IST, August 17). Nokia 8, or whatever the Finnish company chooses to call the smartphone, will be a big update. Nokia 8 has been the subject of rumours and leaks, and it's already being hailed as the best ultimate Android smartphone to hit the market this year. From the design, to the specifications and dual cameras, Nokia 8's key features are pretty much confirmed. However, these rumours and leaks should be taken with a grain of salt until HMD Global confirms them.\n\nThat's said , here's everything we know about the Nokia 8, HMD Global's first ever flagship smartphone of the year.\n\nNokia 8 launch time and live stream\n\nNokia 8 will be officially launched later today in London. The launch event will kick off at 7:30 pm local time (12:00 am IST, August 17). Unfortunately, there will be no live stream available for the Nokia 8 launch. However, you can tune to indianexpress.com for the latest updates, hands-on, and pictures directly from the venue.\n\nNokia 8 release date and price\n\nSince the Nokia 8 is being positioned as a top-tier smartphone, it will cost a premium. While the price of the smartphone is still not out, some reports suggest that it will going to cost above \u20ac500 (or approx Rs 37,552). According to Vodafone Romania, Nokia 8 will be priced at \u20ac434.81 (or approx Rs 32, 656), excluding tax. After tax, it will cost somewhere around \u20ac517 (or approx Rs 38,829). So yes, Nokia 8 is going to be an expensive smartphone. Nokia 8 is expected to be made available in Europe in September. As for the India launch, we expect the announcement to happen at a later date.\n\nNokia 8 design and display\n\nVentureBeat's Evan Blass has already shared an image of the smartphone, which he claims to be of the upcoming Nokia 8. A good look at the leaked Nokia 8 image tells a lot about the design of the smartphone. The phone is not going to look like the the Galaxy S8, but yes, one can expect a slightly improved finish as compared to the Nokia 6. The side bezels of the Nokia 8 will be thin but the top and bottom bezels are going to be thick. The home button of the phone will be present on the front, while the back surely looks refreshing. Unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the metal and glass design, Nokia 8 will be carved from a single piece of aluminium.\n\nThis is the Nokia 8 http://t.co/YUUbFOgbBX pic.twitter.com/xrHBRx4H8I\n\n-- Evan Blass (@evleaks) July 17, 2017\n\nVarious reports in the past have claimed that the Nokia 8 will get a 5.7-inch QHD display, and more recently we've also heard that the screen is likely to around 5.3-inches (2K) in size. That's fairly small in size in comparison to the iPhone 7 Plus, which offers a 5.5-inch display.\n\nNokia 8 camera and battery\n\nThere's no hidden fact that HMD Global is bringing back the Carl Zeiss-branding on Nokia-branded smartphones. So yes, we can expect a great camera experience on the Nokia 8. Most likely, Nokia 8 will feature a dual-camera setup on the back, complete with the Carl Zeiss-branding. We're hearing that there will be a dual 13MP+13MP camera setup on the back. A 13MP camera will be housed in the front for selfies and video calling. We don't know anything about the battery just yet, so we have to wait until the company launches the smartphone.\n\nNokia 8 hardware and software\n\nSpeaking of the hardware, we can expect a Snapdragon 835 processor with either 4GB or 6GB RAM. The phone will be come with 64GB storage, however, some reports claim the 128GB model is also on the cards. The phone is likely to run Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box.\n\nAre you as excited as we are to see the Nokia 8?

Since then, it has now launched a fourth model, looking to sit at the top of its portfolio, whilst taking on the other Android flagships in the market.\n\nThe line-up includes the Nokia 8, Nokia 6, Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 models. The Nokia 6, 5 and 3 are designed to cut into the belly of Android, offering quality phones to those in the mid-range and budget market, while the Nokia 8 is the top dog with a higher price point.\n\nHere's how the specs of these phones break down and exactly what the differences are between them.\n\nThe Nokia 6 is the largest of the new Nokia smartphone family with 154 x 75.8 x 7.85-8.4mm dimensions; the Nokia 8 follows at 151.5 x 73.7 x 7.9mm; the Nokia 5 is 149.7 x 72.5 x 8.05-8.55mm and the Nokia 3 is smallest at 143.4 x 71.4 x 8.48mm.\n\nAll four phones start life as a solid block of aluminium and are machined from this block. The Nokia 8, Nokia 6 and Nokia 5 have full metal bodies, while the Nokia 3 gets a metal core with a polycarbonate back added. No antenna lines can be seen on the rear of the Nokia 8 for a more seamless finish.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is therefore the most sophisticated of the bunch, followed by the Nokia 6, while the Nokia 5 comes in a little rounder and the Nokia 3 loses some of the premium feel by opting for that plastic finish, though it still feels fairly solid. All have Gorilla Glass protecting the display.\n\nAll four models are also available in a range of colours, but the Nokia 8 has the most premium finishes with options like a polished copper and the Nokia 6 also offers an Arte Black special edition which is a little more exciting than the standard models.\n\nThe Nokia 8, Nokia 6 and Nokia 5 all have a fingerprint sensor on the front, while the Nokia 3 misses out on this feature. All four models have a 3.5mm headphone jack, though the Nokia 8 adds to its audio capabilities with Ozo on board.\n\nThe displays on the Nokia models are a fairly predictable stepped positioning in terms of resolution, though not necessarily in size.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has a 5.3-inch display with a 2560 x 1440 resolution that delivers a pixel density of 554ppi, making it the sharpest of the four models but not the largest. The Nokia 6 meanwhile, is the largest with a 5.5-inch display but it has a lower resolution than the Nokia 8 at 1920 x 1080, resulting in a pixel density of 403ppi.\n\nSmaller than both the Nokia 8 and Nokia 6 is the Nokia 5, which has a 5.2-inch 1280 x 720 pixel display, resulting in a pixel density of 282ppi, while the Nokia 3 is smaller still at 5-inches, with the same 1280 x 720 pixel display as the 5 for a slightly sharper 284ppi.\n\nAll four models opt for IPS LCD over AMOLED and they all feature the standard 16:9 aspect ratio. None of the Nokia devices, not even the Nokia 8, offers Mobile HDR.\n\nThe camera department is where the Nokia 8 hopes to shine the brightest, not only compared to its Nokia siblings, but compared to other flagship smartphones too.\n\nThe Nokia 8 features dual 13-megapixel rear cameras, consisting of one RGB sensor and one monochrome sensor like the Huawei P10, with phase detection autofocus, f/2.0 and 1.12\u00b5m pixels. There is also a dual-tone flash.\n\nOn the front of the Nokia 8, there is a 13-megapixel sensor with phase detection autofocus, along with f/2.0, 1.12\u00b5m pixels, a wide-angle lens and a display flash. Nokia has partnered up with Zeiss for all the lenses on the Nokia 8.\n\nBoth the front and rear cameras can be used simultaneously in a new feature called Dual-Sight camera mode on the Nokia 8. In this mode, you'll be able to take a picture or video or both yourself and your subject at the same time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nokia 6 has a 16-megapixel rear camera with phase detection autofocus, f/2.0, with 1\u00b5m pixels. It also has a dual tone LED flash.\n\nThe Nokia 5 gets the dual tone LED flash too, but drops down to a 13-megapixel sensor, keeping the PDAF, f/2.0 and growing the pixels to 1.12\u00b5m. The Nokia 3 settles for an 8-megapixel camera, with f/2.0, 1.12\u00b5m pixels and flash.\n\nThe Nokia 6, 5 and 3 devices all have an 8-megapixel front camera, which offers autofocus, 1.12\u00b5m pixels, f/2.0 and has a wide angle to capture your selfies.\n\nThe Nokia 8 sits at the top of the company's new smartphone portfolio, as we mentioned previously. It runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 platform, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage under its hood.\n\nThe Nokia 6 and the Nokia 5 both have the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 chipset, but the Nokia 6 has more RAM and storage than the Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 with 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage as standard, or 4GB and 64GB on Arte Black model.\n\nThe Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 both have 2GB RAM and 16GB storage, but the Nokia 3 is powered by a slightly less advanced processor with the MediaTek 6737 chipset running the show. All the Nokia phones offer microSD card support to expand storage.\n\nIn terms of battery, the Nokia 8 has a 3090mAh capacity, while the Nokia 6 and Nokia 5 have 3000mAh capacities and the Nokia 3 has the smallest capacity at 2630mAh. The Nokia 6, 5 and 3 are all charged via Micro USB, while the Nokia 8 is charged via USB Type-C with support for Quick Charge 3.0.\n\nThere's no difference in the main software offering across these four phones. All run pure Android Nougat and Nokia is promising the latest version of the software, with the benefit of monthly security updates.\n\nThere is no pre-loaded applications, except a Nokia support app, or bloatware, which means all devices offer stock Android. The only change that's made to vanilla Android is the camera app, which will be a little different on the Nokia 8 compared to the other three devices with the addition of some extra features, like the Dual-Sight mode.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will cost \u20ac599 and it will go on sale from the beginning of September.\n\nThe Nokia 6 will cost you \u20ac229 in its regular form. Opt for the Arte Black edition and you'll be asked to part with a little more at \u20ac299, for which you get that glossy black finish, more RAM and more storage.\n\nThe Nokia 5 will cost you \u20ac189, while the Nokia 3 is the cheapest at \u20ac139.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is unsurprisingly the winner on paper when compare to the other three Nokia devices, offering the most advanced processor, a dual camera setup with Zeiss lenses, a higher resolution display, the largest battery capacity and the most premium design.\n\nThat said, you pay a price for the Nokia 8, at least an extra \u20ac300 in fact. The Nokia 6 is the mid-ranger of the four devices, offering similar RAM and storage capacities to the Nokia 8, especially in the special edition model, while also offering a Full HD display, something the other two devices don't have.\n\nThe Nokia 3 meanwhile is the bottom of the Nokia bunch, but it is also the smallest and cheapest which might make it ideal for some. Ultimately, it depends on what your budget allows for and what features matter to you most.", "id": "9544635", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 vs Nokia 6 vs Nokia 5 vs Nokia 3: What's the difference? - Pocket-lint", "image": "http://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/1200x630/assets/images/140391-phones-feature-nokia-8-vs-nokia-6-vs-nokia-5-vs-nokia-3-whats-the-difference-image1-nk6ivq9wag.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia phone series"}, "id": "513559", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_phone_series"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia Lumia 920"}, "id": "707786", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_920"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "18:47:00"}

It is believed that Nokia 8 smartphone will get a slim design to grab all the user attention. However, HMD global is gearing up to launch Nokia 8 to reach high-end smartphone users.\n\nAccording to media invites sent by HMD Global, the Nokia 8 launch date is August 16. However, it is unclear that whether HMD global will live stream the Nokia 8 launch event or not. As the mobile maker has live streamed the Nokia event in MWC earlier, hopefully, the company may follow the same in the Nokia 8 launch event too.\n\nEarlier leaks suggest that the Nokia 8 features 5.3-inch QHD display with 1440 x 2560 pixels resolution. The smartphone runs on Android 7.1 Nougat out-of-the-box. It is expected the smartphone to be powered by a Snapdragon 835 SoC and will be made available in 4GB and 6GB RAM variants. On storage font, Nokia might offer 32GB and 64GB internal memory as per the RAM variant which user chooses.\n\nNokia 3 Android Phone is now available online with a Price Tag of Rs 9,499\n\nMoving to camera department, Nokia 8 packs dual 13-megapixel rear cameras with \\Carl Zeiss lens. Another 13-megapixel front facing camera is expected for selfies and video calls. The camera is capable of recording 4K videos. Nokia 8 may be available in four color options - Blue, Steel, Gold/Blue, and Gold/Copper. The device might be backed by a 3999mAh non-removable battery.\n\nRecent reports claim that Nokia 8 price starts at EUR 589 (roughly Rs. 43,400). Yet, this isn't an expensive when compared with the Apple and Samsung flagships. However, Nokia 8 performance does matter to justify Nokia 8 price in the premium bracket.", "id": "9526854", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 Launch: Know Specifications, Price in India, Nokia 8 launch date", "image": "https://techfactslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nokia-8.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1479, "date": "-05-08", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1484}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 521, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 530}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}, "id": "312003", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy Note (original)"}, "id": "321823", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Note_(original)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "07:56:00"}

This is thought to be an upgraded version of the Nokia 8 with a larger 5.7in 18:9 display and an extra 2GB of RAM. Here's what we know about the upcoming Nokia 9.\n\nWhen is the Nokia 9 release date?\n\nWith no announcement for the Nokia 9 at the company's 16 August event, we're still no clearer on when is the Nokia 9 will launch. The next natural date would be at the IFA tradeshow in a couple of weeks, though we know nothing of any Nokia press conferences scheduled to be held there.\n\nUnfortunately that could mean we are waiting until the end of February for a MWC 2018 launch. We'll update this article when we know more.\n\nHow much will the Nokia 9 cost in the UK?\n\nThe new Nokia 9 is thought to be priced at around $800 or \u00a3634 with 128GB of storage, and $950 or \u00a3753 with 256GB.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Nokia 8 and Nokia 9?\n\nMany of the specifications for the now confirmed Nokia 8 and rumoured Nokia 9 are similar, but the Nokia 9 is thought to be larger and to feature a higher screen-to-body ratio. While the 5.3in Nokia 8 has a 16:9 panel, the 5.7in Nokia 9 could see a 18:9 virtually full-screen display, putting it in line with the Galaxy S8 and LG G6. Both will be Quad-HD displays with protective Gorilla Glass 5.\n\nThe Nokia 9 may additionally feature an iris scanner, and is said to have an extra 2GB of RAM over the Nokia 8. It may also come with 128GB storage as standard.\n\nWhat are the rumoured new features and specifications?\n\nThe camera is now known to be a key selling point for the upcoming smartphone, with HMD Global confirming that Nokia's collaboration with Zeiss optics is back on. Zeiss is reportedly \"rekindling its commitment to set new imaging standards for Nokia customers\".\n\nWe should see a dual-camera - potentially 13Mp with separate RGB and monochrome sensors. A 13Mp selfie camera may also be found at the front.\n\nThis is the setup seen in the now confirmed Nokia 8, which also boasts Bothie photos - snaps that combine images from the front- and rear cameras to create a fuller picture.\n\nAlso new in the Nokia 8 is 360-degree Ozo audio recording, which we're sure will also make its way to the Nokia 9.\n\nThe Nokia 9 is thought to be the flagship in Nokia's Android phone family, and as such will likely run the 10nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 with Adreno 540 GPU, plus 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.\n\nIt will likely feature IP54 waterproofing, as well as a fingerprint scanner, the aforementioned iris scanner, and a 3,500- to 3,800mAh battery with Quick Charge 4.0 support.\n\nWhy all the fuss over Nokia Android phones?\n\nApart from the fact Nokia used to be one of the biggest brands in the mobile market (Nokia was the Apple of the early 21st century), Nokia Android phones are interesting because they are said to be different to rival Android phones in three main ways:\n\n* Through Nokia's relentless focus on the everyday experience, whether that is seen in the display or the camera\n\n* Through its premium design and build quality that is present no matter where in the line-up a model sits\n\n* Through its use of the purest version of Android you have seen, with monthly security updates, fast Android platform updates and the implementation of the Google Assistant across the range\n\nAlso see: Best new phones coming in 2017\n\nFollow Marie Black on Twitter.", "id": "9562961", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 9 is a no-show at 16 August event", "image": "https://cdn2.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3661463/nokia_9_rumours_thumb800.png", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 694, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 703}, {"textStart": 1693, "date": "-05-09", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1698}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}, "id": "307030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "IP Code"}, "id": "405233", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 728, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}], "time": "20:54:00"}

Well, now, the wait is over - the Nokia 8 is officially OFFICIAL.\n\nThe handset launched last night - August 16 - and was detailed in full by HMD and Nokia execs. As expected, this is NOT a mid-range phone - not by a long shot.\n\nInstead, the Nokia 8 represents HMD's first proper flagship phone, a phone that will do battle with Apple's iPhone 8 and Samsung Galaxy S8 at the top of the smartphone market.\n\nJuho Sarvikas, Chief Product Officer of HMD Global, said: \"We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media. People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own. It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance.\"\n\nThe only difference here, however, is the price - Nokia is asking for \u20ac600 for the Nokia 8 and that makes it A LOT cheaper than Samsung's incoming Galaxy Note 8, which is expected to retail for \u20ac999, and Apple's iPhone 8, which will be even more expensive at \u20ac1000+.\n\nLet's dive right into it and look at the key specs -\n\nDesign-wise it's looking about as gorgeous as we expected from Nokia (not to mention the leaks we'd seen already) with some great metallic colour choices, and curved glass edging meeting the metallic rear panel.\n\nNokia is offering the handset in two texture finishes, one is \"polished\" with a mirror finish and the other is a matte finish dubbed \"satin\" - your colour options are specific to those finishes, so polished will be for copper and blue, while satin will also see a blue option, plus a metallic grey \"steel\".\n\nThe Nokia 8 features quite a few USPs such as Carl Zeiss cameras on both the front and rear for optimum imaging performance, as well as OZO Audio, which utilises three microphones with exclusive Nokia acoustic algorithms to capture audio with immersive 360\u00b0 spatial surround sound.\n\nThis aspect is clearly aimed at content creators that like to shoot on their phones - YouTubers and the like. I like that, rather than try and simply beat Apple and Samsung on specs, Nokia is implementing new technologies that actually add utility to the phone.\n\nSome other interesting bits of info include the way in which Nokia's camera team has developed a \"Dual-Sight\" feature which allows users to livestream to Facebook and Youtube from both front and rear cameras. This also incorporates 360\u00b0 spatial surround binaural audio recording, which Nokia claims will capture sound to a quality level intended to match the 4K video recording.\n\nHMD has also partnered with Google to make Google Photos the default gallery application with unlimited cloud photo storage.\n\n\"Nokia smartphones always offer a pure Android experience,\" said HMD at launch, \"with no unnecessary apps slowing down the performance of your device. And with Nokia 8, pure Android combined with our innovative engineering processes unleashes the full potential of the SnapdragonTM 835 Mobile Platform. With monthly security updates, the Nokia 8 is safe and up-to-date. Your device is secured with biometric fingerprint authentication, delivering enhanced security and making Nokia 8 a versatile companion whatever your needs.\"\n\nHMD and Nokia have published a series of Nokia 8 promotional videos following the launch which give a really detailed look at the handset's design and features. In the first video we see the phone from every angle and also get a look at how Dual-Sight video capture works with the split-screen interface.Video of Introducing the Nokia 8\n\n\"Inside Tech\" shows off the processor hardware which powers all of the Nokia 8's high-end features.Video of Nokia 8 - Inside Tech\n\n\"Form and Function\" takes an in-depth look at design.Video of Nokia 8 - Form and Function\n\nAnd there are two videos showcasing the OZO audio recording.Video of Nokia 8 with Nokia OZO Audio - Experience the DifferenceVideo of Nokia 8 with Nokia OZO Audio - Behind the Scenes\n\nThe Nokia 8 has been given an RRP of \u20ac599 and will be available globally from September. It will ship with Android Nougat initially, but should get Android O after it is officially announced by Google. HMD is yet to reveal the update schedule, understandably.\n\nHead on after the jump for the pre-launch rumours to see how they compare to the final reveal!\n\nToday's the day people. The hotly anticipated Nokia 8 flagship is finally arriving today, August 16, with the official HMD event scheduled to take place imminently.\n\nThe lead model will be the crowning glory in the HMD-made, Nokia-branded, Android-running range of smartphones. Mid-tier models such as the Nokia 6 have already proben tremendously popular, and the Nokia 8 is expected to be packed with high-end tech, including dual-sensor Carl Zeiss camera and the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor.\n\nEvent invitations had previously been sent out for the August 16 date. TechRadar reported that the invites read; \"HMD Global invites you to an exclusive gathering to unveil the next milestone for Nokia phones.\"\n\nLeaked photos have appeared showing the Nokia 8 up and running - and not only is it running Android but it also shows benchmarking results on the display. The images leaked via Chinese social network WeChat.\n\nThe results show the model number TA-1012, which has previously been associated with the Nokia 8, along with two other numbers: TA-1004 and TA-1052. Presumably these denote different models for different regions, connectivity types, and/or storage models. The results also reiterate specs we've seen previously; a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, and a QHD display resolution.\n\nAccording to new details the Nokia 8 will have an RRP of around \u20ac520. The word comes from a Romanian website, reporting on a leaked internal document from Vodafone's Romanian branch. The document contains a table showing the pricing of several devices, including the Nokia 8, which is listed at \u20ac517.42; bearing in mind that this price may fluctuate between EU member states it could be anything between \u20ac515 and \u20ac520 across the continent. Either way, it's a good indicator of the approximate price bracket being closer to \u20ac500 than a previously rumoured RRP just shy of \u20ac600.\n\nFor a long while now there have been many rumours surrounding the HMD/Nokia flagship and much of it has been confusing. It's been variously the Nokia 8, Nokia 9, Nokia E1, and Nokia P1, and at times it hasn't been clear whether they've all been the same phone or multiple different editions.\n\nIt was previously thought both Nokia 8 and Nokia 9 handsets were in development - we wondered if we would see the Nokia 8 as a sort of high-mid-ranger, or a lower-tier flagship with slightly reduced specs from the Nokia 9 as a true leading model. But things have changed and it's now believed that the Nokia 8, and only the Nokia 8, will come out as the lead model. The Nokia 9, it seems, isn't even a thing, other than perhaps a codename or one naming option that was on the table during development.\n\nOne thing, however, was clear: this handset was the one everybody has been waiting for. In fact, I'd say there's as much hype around this phone as there was for LG's G6 and the OnePlus 5, which is pretty good going for Nokia, considering it's been out of the limelight for a good long while now.\n\nMost recently, as rumours began to coverage on the idea that one flagship was coming and it was called the Nokia 8, we also saw several leaks of the design emerging.\n\nThe phone has been pictured in dark blue, silver, and copper/gold, with only a blue/gold edition not yet seen from the range of colours already rumoured. The leaked images also confirm a dual-sensor camera, which carries Carl Zeiss branding following HMD's announcement of a partnership with the optics firm.\n\nLike the Google Pixel, Nokia's Android phones will run a stock version of Android, meaning there will no custom ROM on top of the software, which, for me, is a big USP for these handsets.\n\nHMD has also stated that it wants to work closely with Google in order to get Android updates out as soon as they're available. In this respect, given the price of some of Nokia's other handsets, one could say the company is aiming to become the new Nexus phones of the Android space.\n\nTo recap on the specs, the leaks says it will feature an all-metal build, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 13MP camera sensors in the dual-camera setup, 4GB or 6GB of RAM, and a 5.3in QHD touch display.", "id": "9706139", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 is FINALLY Here...

HMD Global, the Finnish company which manufactures phones under the Nokia brand, has announced an event in London today. The event seems to be directed towards the unveiling of the Nokia 8 flagship smartphone. However, since the launch event is scheduled in the United Kingdom, Indians will be able to see it by midnight. Recently, quite a few leaks of the Nokia 8 have been doing the rounds on the internet. Since this is a new flagship device by one of the most popular mobile brands, the Nokia 8 will expectedly come up with the top of the line specifications. Rumours have suggested that the phone will include the fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and dual rear camera with Zeiss optic.\n\nFull sized pictures of the Nokia 8 have already been leaked on the web. The phone was also spotted on the China website of the brand for some time, before being taken away. In July 2017, HMD Global and Zeiss had announced a partnership. The company had said that it will bring back the Zeiss brand to Nokia mobiles. Nokia had the feature in its Lumia smartphones. But now, Nokia apparently has decided to go with the latest sensation of dual rear camera setup. Zeiss lenses were the saving grace in the Lumia brand and it became quite popular. If it adds more to the dual cameras, Nokia could have something dramatic in hand this time.\n\nHMD Global, a startup from Finland, till now has been dealing with smartphones in the mid segment, with Nokia 6 and 5. But with a flagship device launch, the company is foraying into a premium segment occupied by several big players like Apple, Google and Samsung. This category also includes smaller players with budget pricing, like OnePlus and Honor.\n\nNokia 8 launch live streaming: The smartphone will launch today (August 16) in London at 7:30 PM. In India, the launch event will start at midnight tonight (12 AM). You can watch the live streaming of the event on HMD Global's official page.

HMD Global, the Finnish company which manufactures phones under the Nokia brand, has announced an event in London today.\n\nNokia 8 smartphone is all set to launch today. HMD Global, the Finnish company which manufactures phones under the Nokia brand, has announced an event in London today. The event seems to be directed towards the unveiling of the Nokia 8 flagship smartphone. However, since the launch event is scheduled in the United Kingdom, Indians will be able to see it by midnight. Recently, quite a few leaks of the Nokia 8 have been doing the rounds on the internet. Since this is a new flagship device by one of the most popular mobile brands, the Nokia 8 will expectedly come up with the top of the line specifications. Rumours have suggested that the phone will include the fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and dual rear camera with Zeiss optic.\n\nFull sized pictures of the Nokia 8 have already been leaked on the web. The phone was also spotted on the China website of the brand for some time, before being taken away. In July 2017, HMD Global and Zeiss had announced a partnership. The company had said that it will bring back the Zeiss brand to Nokia mobiles. Nokia had the feature in its Lumia smartphones. But now, Nokia apparently has decided to go with the latest sensation of dual rear camera setup. Zeiss lenses were the saving grace in the Lumia brand and it became quite popular. If it adds more to the dual cameras, Nokia could have something dramatic in hand this time.\n\nAlso read | Nokia 5 vs Xiaomi Redmi Note 4: How the smartphones compare in terms of specs, features and price\n\nHMD Global, a startup from Finland, till now has been dealing with smartphones in the mid segment, with Nokia 6 and 5.

This category also includes smaller players with budget pricing, like OnePlus and Honor.\n\nNokia 8 launch live streaming: The smartphone will launch today (August 16) in London at 7:30 PM. In India, the launch event will start at midnight tonight (12 AM). You can watch the live streaming of the event on HMD Global's official page.

Well, now, the wait is over - the Nokia 8 is officially OFFICIAL.\n\nThe handset launched last night - August 16 - and was detailed in full by HMD and Nokia execs. As expected, this is NOT a mid-range phone - not by a long shot.\n\nInstead, the Nokia 8 represents HMD's first proper flagship phone, a phone that will do battle with Apple's iPhone 8 and Samsung Galaxy S8 at the top of the smartphone market.\n\nJuho Sarvikas, Chief Product Officer of HMD Global, said: \"We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media. People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own. It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance.\"\n\nThe only difference here, however, is the price - Nokia is asking for \u20ac600 for the Nokia 8 and that makes it A LOT cheaper than Samsung's incoming Galaxy Note 8, which is expected to retail for \u20ac999, and Apple's iPhone 8, which will be even more expensive at \u20ac1000+.\n\nLet's dive right into it and look at the key specs -\n\nDesign-wise it's looking about as gorgeous as we expected from Nokia (not to mention the leaks we'd seen already) with some great metallic colour choices, and curved glass edging meeting the metallic rear panel.\n\nThe Nokia 8 features quite a few USPs such as Carl Zeiss cameras on both the front and rear for optimum imaging performance, as well as OZO Audio, which utilises three microphones with exclusive Nokia acoustic algorithms to capture audio with immersive 360\u00b0 spatial surround sound.\n\nThis aspect is clearly aimed at content creators that like to shoot on their phones - YouTubers and the like. I like that, rather than try and simply beat Apple and Samsung on specs, Nokia is implementing new technologies that actually add utility to the phone.\n\nSome other interesting bits of info include the way in which Nokia's camera team has developed a \"Dual-Sight\" feature which allows users to livestream to Facebook and Youtube from both front and rear cameras. This also incorporates 360\u00b0 spatial surround binaural audio recording, which Nokia claims will capture sound to a quality level intended to match the 4K video recording.\n\nHMD has also partnered with Google to make Google Photos the default gallery application with unlimited cloud photo storage.\n\n\"Nokia smartphones always offer a pure Android experience,\" said HMD at launch, \"with no unnecessary apps slowing down the performance of your device. And with Nokia 8, pure Android combined with our innovative engineering processes unleashes the full potential of the SnapdragonTM 835 Mobile Platform. With monthly security updates, the Nokia 8 is safe and up-to-date. Your device is secured with biometric fingerprint authentication, delivering enhanced security and making Nokia 8 a versatile companion whatever your needs.\"\n\nThe Nokia 8 has been given an RRP of \u20ac599 and will be available globally from September. It will ship with Android Nougat initially, but should get Android O after it is officially announced by Google. HMD is yet to reveal the update schedule, understandably.\n\nHead on after the jump for the pre-launch rumours to see how they compare to the final reveal!\n\nToday's the day people. The hotly anticipated Nokia 8 flagship is finally arriving today, August 16, with the official HMD event scheduled to take place imminently.\n\nThe lead model will be the crowning glory in the HMD-made, Nokia-branded, Android-running range of smartphones. Mid-tier models such as the Nokia 6 have already proben tremendously popular, and the Nokia 8 is expected to be packed with high-end tech, including dual-sensor Carl Zeiss camera and the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor.\n\nEvent invitations had previously been sent out for the August 16 date. TechRadar reported that the invites read; \"HMD Global invites you to an exclusive gathering to unveil the next milestone for Nokia phones.\"\n\nLeaked photos have appeared showing the Nokia 8 up and running - and not only is it running Android but it also shows benchmarking results on the display. The images leaked via Chinese social network WeChat.\n\nThe results show the model number TA-1012, which has previously been associated with the Nokia 8, along with two other numbers: TA-1004 and TA-1052. Presumably these denote different models for different regions, connectivity types, and/or storage models. The results also reiterate specs we've seen previously; a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, and a QHD display resolution.\n\nAccording to new details the Nokia 8 will have an RRP of around \u20ac520. The word comes from a Romanian website, reporting on a leaked internal document from Vodafone's Romanian branch. The document contains a table showing the pricing of several devices, including the Nokia 8, which is listed at \u20ac517.42; bearing in mind that this price may fluctuate between EU member states it could be anything between \u20ac515 and \u20ac520 across the continent. Either way, it's a good indicator of the approximate price bracket being closer to \u20ac500 than a previously rumoured RRP just shy of \u20ac600.\n\nFor a long while now there have been many rumours surrounding the HMD/Nokia flagship and much of it has been confusing. It's been variously the Nokia 8, Nokia 9, Nokia E1, and Nokia P1, and at times it hasn't been clear whether they've all been the same phone or multiple different editions.\n\nIt was previously thought both Nokia 8 and Nokia 9 handsets were in development - we wondered if we would see the Nokia 8 as a sort of high-mid-ranger, or a lower-tier flagship with slightly reduced specs from the Nokia 9 as a true leading model. But things have changed and it's now believed that the Nokia 8, and only the Nokia 8, will come out as the lead model. The Nokia 9, it seems, isn't even a thing, other than perhaps a codename or one naming option that was on the table during development.\n\nOne thing, however, was clear: this handset was the one everybody has been waiting for. In fact, I'd say there's as much hype around this phone as there was for LG's G6 and the OnePlus 5, which is pretty good going for Nokia, considering it's been out of the limelight for a good long while now.\n\nMost recently, as rumours began to coverage on the idea that one flagship was coming and it was called the Nokia 8, we also saw several leaks of the design emerging.\n\nThe phone has been pictured in dark blue, silver, and copper/gold, with only a blue/gold edition not yet seen from the range of colours already rumoured. The leaked images also confirm a dual-sensor camera, which carries Carl Zeiss branding following HMD's announcement of a partnership with the optics firm.\n\nLike the Google Pixel, Nokia's Android phones will run a stock version of Android, meaning there will no custom ROM on top of the software, which, for me, is a big USP for these handsets.\n\nHMD has also stated that it wants to work closely with Google in order to get Android updates out as soon as they're available. In this respect, given the price of some of Nokia's other handsets, one could say the company is aiming to become the new Nexus phones of the Android space.\n\nTo recap on the specs, the leaks says it will feature an all-metal build, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 13MP camera sensors in the dual-camera setup, 4GB or 6GB of RAM, and a 5.3in QHD touch display.", "id": "9643515", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 Flagship Android Phone OFFICIAL!

Under the guidance of HMD Global there's now a resurrected partnership with Zeiss pouring into the camera, there's innovation in the design and oh, there's that beautiful polished copper colour.\n\nBut in the hand, is this the Nokia smartphone we've been waiting for?\n\nNokia hasn't stopped talking about design since the announcement of the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6. Just as you'd expect, the story here is very much the same. The Nokia 8 starts life as a block of aluminium, hewn into smartphone form, with a soft curve across the back and rounded edges to make it sit comfortably in the hand.\n\nUnlike the Nokia 6, its larger but lesser-specced sibling, there are no sharp edges here, just a phone that nestles into your hand with a feeling of premium quality.\n\nOne of the things that HMD Global has tried to do is move the antenna lines so they don't break the visual appeal of the back of the phone. These move to the top and bottom of the phone, so there's a plastic area that's almost the same colour, but not quite. From a design point of view it saves the rear of the phone, but the colours don't quite match.\n\nIgnoring that fact, the biggest talking point about the Nokia 8 is likely to be the Polished Copper colour option. While Samsung is pushing its amazing Coral Blue, Nokia is punching hard with this copper phone. It looks wonderful and has been created through repeated anodisation and polishing. It's not quite the Solar Red HTC U11, but it's a unique look.\n\nBy contrast, the Nokia 8's other colours - blue in both matte and polished, as well as a steel colour - look a little reserved. Put us down for the copper please.\n\nThe front of the handset looks like any number of smartphones from the past few years with a bottom fingerprint scanner flanked by the recent apps and back touch controls and a fair amount of bezel top and bottom of the display.\n\nAs you'd expect, the Nokia 8 sits on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 platform. We've seen great things from this latest version of Snapdragon and the Nokia 8 joins the likes of the HTC U11 and Samsung Galaxy S8 in offering this premium hardware.\n\nIt means that there's going to be plenty of power on offer, and power is something that the Nokia 8 is going to need, because it has some intensive offerings like the ability to live stream video from both the front and rear cameras in Nokia's Dual-Sight feature - but more about that in the camera section.\n\nTo deal with the demands that might be put on the hardware, Nokia has opted for a water-cooled solution, with a big copper pipe running diagonally through the internals, combined with graphite head shielding. It sounds serious, and we can't wait to set it to task and see how it performs alongside 2017's top smartphones.\n\nFirst impressions don't mean much as they are on pre-release software, but we found it fast to respond to actions and quick to launch the camera, meaning it's a good way ahead of Nokia's other low-power devices.\n\nAdditionally, we've no idea how the 3090mAh battery is going to perform, although over a day has been mentioned to us, but thankfully there is Quick Charge 3.0 support on this device, from the USB Type-C on the bottom of the handset.\n\nWhile there have been some major moves to increase the screen to body ratio of some smartphones - with rumours of more to come - the Nokia 8 sticks to a conventional 16:9 aspect for the 5.3-inch display. That means it comes with bezel top and bottom, which HMD Global explained to use was to allow them to accommodate the camera and fingerprint scanner.\n\nAt 5.3-inches there's plenty of space, but you can see that the more aggressive 18:9 displays will catch the eye more readily. However, the LCD display in the Nokia 8 looks great. It's bright, rated at 700 nits, meaning it should cut through glare on sunny days without too much problem.\n\nNokia is also pushing the pixels with a 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution, so it's up there with the likes of the HTC U11 and Samsung Galaxy S8 in offering you plenty of detail. We can't tell too much about the performance of the display from our brief time with it, but first impressions suggest that the colour calibration is better than Nokia's previous Android phones - the whites appear whiter and the blacks appear deeper too.\n\nThere's also the return of Glance Screen. Nokia made a lot of noise about Glance Screen when it appeared on Windows Phone a few years ago and these days it's pretty common to have some element of an always-on display. It's in the Nokia 8 too, with a section at the top offering the time and some notifications, so you can glance and be immediately informed.\n\nNokia fans will welcome the sight of Zeiss branding on the rear of this Nokia smartphone. The new partnership sees Zeiss adding its expertise to ensure the quality that's coming out of this new dual camera arrangement, which adds some interesting options to the mix.\n\nTo be clear, this arrangement of lens is about quality rather than zoom or wide angle as you'll find on the iPhone 7 Plus or LG G6. That sees Nokia walking a line similar to Huawei and Leica, with two sensors capturing the same information, but on dedicated RGB (colour) and monochrome sensors.\n\nThe aim is to get better results no matter what the situation is, with the monochrome sensor being able to pull in details in low light conditions and preserve those without compromising the colour information. The really clever part is in how the camera uses this information, as it's the combining of the data to create a final image that really matters.\n\nHMD Global told us that the camera could also take multiple shots from both sensors and combine the information if the situation demanded it. As we said, the aim is quality. We're yet to test it, but we're keen to see if this is a camera that can be ranked amongst the best.\n\nThat's not all the camera has to offer. There's also a 13-megapixel camera on the front of the phone and Nokia wants to move beyond the selfie, into something it's calling to \"bothie\". Ok, we'll not say that again. Nokia wants you to use both cameras at the same time.\n\nThis isn't totally unique, as there's an increase push towards capturing both the subject in front of you and your reaction, which is one of the things that the so-called Dual-Sight camera mode will offer. You'll be able to take front and back photos, but the twist is that the Nokia 8 will also let you capture video from the front and back cameras at the same time.\n\nOh, and it will let you livestream this video too, so you can share your experiences. We can see this being popular with YouTubers looking to get their face in to tell the story that's unfolding.\n\nYou'll get access to Facebook and YouTube right from the video window, so you'll be able to get live reactions on your screen as your watches get involved.\n\nNokia is also bringing some special sound capture to the Nokia 8, teaming up with its team working on Ozo to add those audio skills to the new smartphone. That will mean that the phone can better capture surround sound audio to make video more immersive.\n\nThat's not unique, but Nokia wants to preserve this audio so it stays intact when you share it. Many devices will capture 3D audio but then lose it when the video is moved to a different platform. Nokia wants to preserve the Ozo Audio, so that anyone using a stereo setup to watch it can benefit from the more immersive audio.\n\nWe've seen moves towards binaural capture elsewhere, with the likes of Sennheiser announcing a binaural headset designed to do exactly the same job - and with no need for special codecs or decoders at the recipient's end.\n\nAs with Nokia's previous devices, this is a pure Android handset, with little changed by Nokia. It will launch on Android 7 Nougat, aiming to bring you rapid updates. That means you should have the latest Android security updates, but also that Android O should arrive promptly.\n\nTalking to HMD Global's Juho Sarvikas, chief product officer, it's clear that the aim is to have the Nokia 8 running Android O as quickly as possible after launch. While much of that depends on Google releasing the software and various stages of testing, the clean Android installation on the Nokia 8 should mean that Android O arrives promptly.\n\nAccording to Sarvikas Nokia should be \"one of the first\" to roll out the update.\n\nLeaving that to one side, the Nokia 8 is pure as the driven snow, with the only changes being to the camera app and the addition of a help app to provide support to Nokia handset owners. Otherwise, this is a stock Android experience.", "id": "9544677", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 preview: A flagship worth waiting for? - Pocket-lint", "image": "http://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/1200x630/assets/images/141922-phones-hands-on-nokia-8-polished-copper-image1-jotas465wm.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Touchscreen"}, "id": "312182", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Windows Phone"}, "id": "319197", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia Lumia 920"}, "id": "707786", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_920"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "18:47:00"}

In that short time we've seen a number of feature phones launched, including a remastered model of the classic 3310 mobile, not to mention four new Android smartphones covering a range of budgets.\n\nLatest to be released is the Nokia 8, the first flagship device from this brand to sport Google's Android OS. With some drool-worthy specs, including a dual-lens camera, premium processor and Quad HD 5.3-inch display, this handset is certainly for demanding users only. The phone's \u20ac599 asking price should make that all too obvious.\n\nThe Nokia 6 is the next handset in descending order of price, although it's well under half the cost of the Nokia 8. You still get a sleek aluminium body as well as a larger 5.5-inch display to gawp at, although the specs have understandably been cut back to save on cost.\n\nYou'll find a similar metal finish on the slightly cheaper Nokia 5, along with a more basic 5.2-inch screen. Finally, the Nokia 3 is the most affordable of the new Android bunch and also the most compact, with a dinky 5-inch display housed in a metal-and-plastic frame.\n\nSo how do these four Nokia Android blowers directly compare and which should you buy? Here's our in-depth look at the specs, features and design work, to help you decide, having spent some hands-on time with the Nokia 8.\n\nNokia 8 vs Nokia 6 vs Nokia 5 vs Nokia 3: Specs Phone Nokia 8 Nokia 6 Nokia 5 Nokia 3 Screen size 5.3-inches 5.5-inches 5.2-inches 5.0-inches Screen resolution Quad HD (2560x1440) Full HD (1920x1080) HD ready (1280x720) HD ready (1280x720) Water resistant? Splash Resistant (IP54) No No No Fingerprint sensor?

Yes Yes Yes Yes Rear camera 13-megapixel dual-lens 16-megapixel 13-megapixel 8-megapixel Price? \u20ac599 (\u00a3549) \u00a3220 (Arte Black \u00a3280) \u00a3180 \u00a3120 Nokia 8 vs Nokia 6 vs Nokia 5 vs Nokia 3: Design\n\nAlthough the Nokia 6, 5 and 3 models are a serious chunk of change cheaper than the flagship model, they all sport a metallic frame in one form or another. In fact, all but the most affordable Nokia 3 boast an aluminium unibody, while the cheapest handset still offers solid metal edging as well as a polycarbonate backing.\n\nOf course, the Nokia 8 is the most attractive of the four new Android phones, as you'd expect from a flagship. Not only is it pleasingly slender, but you can pick it up in a selection of finishes and colours, including matte blue and silver models and a stand-out polished copper version. This might be a bit of a fingerprint magnet, yet we love it all the same.\n\nThe standard Nokia 6's full metal body also comes in a choice of colours, including copper, black and tempered blue. You can actually get a glossy version of this handset also, in the special edition Arte Black model. However, that will cost you another \u00a360 on top of the standard asking price.\n\nBesides that, the Nokia 5, Nokia 6 and Nokia 8 all sport a similar design. While the more affordable models lose some of the finer detailing of the flagship and are a little chunkier, they still sport a clean finish as well as a centrally-located camera spine.\n\nAt the bottom of the new Android range is the Nokia 3, which rocks a metal rim despite that polycarbonate material around back. This means it feels less premium than the other two new Nokias, although it's not too off-putting given the low asking price.\n\nA fingerprint scanner is built into the home button of the Nokia 8, Nokia 6 and Nokia 5, for fast and convenient security. As for water resistance, you get simple IP54 'splash proofing' on the flagship and no kind of protection with the other handsets.\n\nNokia 8 vs Nokia 6 vs Nokia 5 vs Nokia 3: Screen and media\n\nThe Nokia 6 may be a piggy in the middle in many respects, yet it serves up the biggest display of these four new phones. That 5.5-inch Full HD panel sports a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, giving it a pixels-per-inch score of 403. In normal speak, that means you can expect quite crisp, clear visuals when checking your photo roll or streaming a spot of Netflix.\n\nNext in terms of sizing is the Nokia 8, which offers a 5.3-inch panel. This being the flagship device, you get a much sharper Quad HD (2560x1440) resolution, for impressively detailed image reproduction. You'll also enjoy a more powerful maximum brightness (topping out at 700 nits compared with around 450 for the next model down), although we personally haven't struggled when it comes to clarity on the other mobiles here.\n\nMeanwhile the Nokia 5 features a smaller 5.2-inch display and a 720p resolution (1280x720 pixels), giving it a lower pixel density of 282ppi. The Nokia 3 also sports this lower resolution for its relatively dinky 5-inch panel.\n\nAll four of these phone screens are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass, to keep scratches and other damage at bay. Good news if you're a bit of a butter fingers.\n\nLikewise, all of Nokia's handsets can have their available storage space expanded via a microSD memory card. That's especially important for the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5, which only give you 16GB of room - half of which is used up by Android and the other pre-installed apps. Thankfully storage is less of an issue with the 32GB Nokia 6 and the 64GB Nokia 8.\n\nNokia 8 vs Nokia 6 vs Nokia 5 vs Nokia 3: Features and OS\n\nAs you might expect, every Nokia smartphone launched this year serves up Google's Android OS. From flagship down to the most affordable device, this is a raw, vanilla version of Android Nougat, with no bolt-on extras or design tweaks to speak of.\n\nThat means you can expect smooth performance, as the software isn't bogged down by unnecessary UI overlays and extra bits. As an added bonus, the lack of adjustments means you can expect Nokia to rollout Android O updates for all of these devices soon after Google releases its new Pixel 2 handsets.\n\nNokia 8 vs Nokia 6 vs Nokia 5 vs Nokia 3: Performance and battery life\n\nIt's no surprise that the Nokia 8 is the most powerful handset here, well suited to the most demanding of users. That Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset is an absolute beast, offering performance that can rival almost any other handset out there (as well as strong energy efficiency and connectivity).\n\nStep down in price and you'll notice a big drop in specs when it comes to power. Both the Nokia 6 and Nokia 5 rock Qualcomm's more basic Snapdragon 430 chipset. The Nokia 6 comes with 3GB of RAM (4GB in the case of that funky Arte Black model) while the Nokia 5 offers a more meagre 2GB. We've noticed a fair few stutters on the Nokia 5, which you won't see anywhere near as often on the Nokia 6.\n\nA MediaTek 6737 processor and 2GB of RAM is crammed inside the Nokia 3, so this is definitely a handset for simple everyday use. Web browsing, messaging and the rest should be fine, although don't expect to play games with a smooth frame rate or enjoy a spot of video editing on the side. Even so, you'll not be enjoying a slick UI experience.\n\nWhen it comes to battery tech, the Nokia 5, Nokia 6 and Nokia 8 are almost a match, packing a cell size around the 3000mAh mark. Lower your budget a little and the Nokia 3 offers a smaller 2,650mAh capacity battery, although that smaller screen and energy-efficient processor means you should enjoy similar battery life.\n\nYou'll get Quick Charge 3.0 support on all but the Nokia 3, for recharging in a jiffy.\n\nNokia 8 vs Nokia 6 vs Nokia 5 vs Nokia 3: Camera tech\n\nIf you want memories to cherish, the Nokia 8 offers the best camera tech of the bunch.\n\nAs the only snapper here to boast two lenses, the Nokia 8's 'Dual Sight' 13-megapixel camera can capture pleasing bokeh shots as well as 'bothie' snaps using both the front and rear cameras at once. You can record up to 4K resolution video too, using the rear or the 13-megapixel selfie shooter, or even live stream your existence to Facebook or YouTube via Nokia's camera app. This is also the only Nokia smartphone from 2017 to offer OIS, for reducing blur and shakiness.\n\nTake a look at our Nokia 8 camera preview, following our hands-on session with the new flagship device.\n\nThe Nokia 6 might not boast two lenses, yet that 16-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture lens and two-tone LED flash is still a respectable and fast-action shooter (thanks in part to the nippy Phase Detection Autofocus). You have manual controls to tweak your snaps as well as the ability to shoot up to Full HD video, although gone is the 'bothie' mode, live streaming and live bokeh feature. Meanwhile the front-facing eight-megapixel wide-angle snapper, also f/2.0, will take care of selfies and video calls.\n\nNext up is the Nokia 5, which drops the main camera specs down to a 13-megapixel sensor, although you get the same two-tone flash, f/2.0 aperture lens and Phase Detection Autofocus. You also get another eight-megapixel front camera, for your selfie needs. Check out our in-depth Nokia 5 camera review for more info and samples.\n\nIf you're not too bothered about capturing crisp, detailed photos, the Nokia 3's 8-megapixel camera should suffice for simple, sharable shots. As for the front camera, this has the same resolution and f/2.0 aperture as the other Nokia phones here.\n\nCheck back soon for our full Nokia 8 camera review and our in-depth review of the full smartphone.", "id": "9578030", "details": {"gpCnt": 5}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 vs Nokia 6 vs Nokia 5 vs Nokia 3: Which Nokia Android phone is...", "image": "https://cdn2.recombu.com/media/mobile/Devices/Nokia/Nokia 8/Nokia8_PressThumb.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 4211, "date": "-05-06", "amb": false, "textEnd": 4216}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia Lumia 920"}, "id": "707786", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_920"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "18:33:00"}

Nokia has just taken the wraps off its first Android flagship smartphone at an event in London. Dubbed Nokia 8, the phone comes with a premium all-metal design, top of the line specifications, a Carl Zeiss powered dual camera setup at the rear, 100 per cent stock Android and more.\n\nAlthough happy at the return of their beloved brand, ardent Nokia fans were a bit disappointed back in February when HMD Global only announced budget and mid-range smartphones at MWC 2017. The Nokia 8 is one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year and rightly so - it is not only the first high-end Android smartphone from Nokia, but also the first flagship from the company's stable since the dark Windows Phone days.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will retail for 599 Euros and aims to compete with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S8, iPhone 7 and Google Pixel. There are a lot of expectations riding on Nokia's return to the high-end segment of the market. Let us examine the Nokia 8 in detail:\n\nSturdy all-metal design\n\nThe Nokia 8 is constructed entirely out of metal and carries forward the design language seen on the Nokia 3, 5 and 6. The smartphone looks modern yet pleasantly reminiscent of Lumia smartphones of old. The Nokia 8 is machined out of a single block of aluminium and is just 4.6mm thin at the edge.\n\nThe rear is dominated by the vertical dual camera setup below which sits the Nokia branding. On the front, there is a physical home button flanked by capacitive keys for back and recent applications. There is also a fingerprint sensor embedded into the home button\n\nIn a slightly disappointing move, the Nokia 8 does not come with an edge-to-edge display or a bezel-less design as seen in recent flagships such as the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8. It is available in four colours, namely Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue and Steel.\n\nTop of the line specifications\n\nThe Nokia 8 is powered by Qualcomm's latest high end chipset - the Snapdragon 835. The 10nm processor is found in most flagships of 2017 such as the HTC U11, OnePlus 5, Samsung Galaxy S8 and Xperia XZ Premium and is arguably one of the most powerful processors in the market currently. Additionally, the Nokia 8 comes with 4GB of RAM, the Adreno 540 GPU and 64GB of internal storage which can be expanded via a microSD card (of up to 256 GB).\n\nNokia 8 comes with a premium all-metal design, top of the line specifications, a ZEISS powered dual camera setup at the rear, 100 percent stock Android and more\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with a 3090 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 support. Nokia claims that the Nokia 8 comes with a very innovative heat management solution with a full-length graphite shielded copper cooling pipe that dissipates heat across the full length and breadth of the smartphone.\n\nDisplay\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with a 5.3-inch Quad HD IPS LCD display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 and 2.5D Gorilla Glass 5 on top for protection against nicks and scratches. The display is particularly bright with 700Nits of maximum brightness and comes with Nokia's trademark Glance Screen.\n\nPure and secure Android\n\nJust like the Nokia 6, 5 and 3, the Nokia 8 runs on a 100 percent stock build of Android and comes with the promise of timely monthly security updates and yearly Android version updates. The Nokia 8 runs on the latest version of Android - 7.1.1 Nougat with no unnecessary bloat and changes.\n\nNokia has promised that the Nokia 8 will be updated to Android O as and when it is released. In fact, Nokia claims that they will be the first or amongst the first non Google manufacturers to release Android O to their smartphones.\n\nCarl Zeiss optics\n\nNokia has had a long and storied history when it comes to smartphone photography. Along with Carl Zeiss, the company has given us iconic camera phones such as the Nokia N95 - the first phone in the world to come with a 5MP rear camera and the Nokia 808 PureView - which came with a 41MP rear camera.\n\nNokia 8 carries forward the legendary Nokia - ZEISS partnership. The Nokia 8 comes with a ZEISS powered dual camera setup at the rear - a primary 13MP RGB (color) sensor with optical image stabilisation paired with a 13MP secondary monochrome (black and white) sensor. Both cameras have an aperture of f/2.0 and the setup comes with phase detection auto-focus and a dual-tone flash. The rear camera(s) can also record video in 4K resolution.\n\nNokia 8 looks modern yet pleasantly reminiscent of Lumia smartphones of old\n\nNokia claims that the secondary monochrome sensor allows for the capture of depth information and helps improve low-light photography by capturing more data. On the front, there is a 13MP sensor with an aperture of f/2.0, display flash and phase detection autofocus.\n\nConnectivity\n\nOn the connectivity front, the Nokia 8 supports 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac with MIMO, GPS/AGPS, GLONASS, NFC, ANT+ and Bluetooth 5.0. Unlike many flagships of late, the Nokia 8 comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack which should please audio enthusiasts. Additionally, it has a USB 3.1 Type-C port for charging and data transfer.\n\nSpecial features\n\n#Bothie\n\nThe Nokia 8 is the first smartphone in the world which allows 'Dual-Sight' video to be live streamed natively and in real-time to social feeds such as YouTube and Facebook. Dual-Sight allows you to use the front and rear camera at the same time in a split screen view. This feature can be utilised for both photos and videos.\n\nOZO Audio\n\nNokia is promising a 360 degree fully immersive audio experience with the Nokia 8. The smartphone's three microphones and Nokia's acoustic algorithms allow you to capture 360 degree spatial surround sound. You can also share 4K videos with OZO audio with anyone - binaural codecs ensure high fidelity playback even on devices without OZO Audio.\n\nSplash resistance\n\nWhile the Nokia 8 does not come with IP68 dust and water resistance, it is splash proof (IP54) and will be able to withstand light rains and splashes of water.\n\nPrice and availability\n\nThe Nokia 8 will go on sale globally in early September for 599 Euros, which roughly translates to around Rs 45,500. While there is no official word on the Indian launch, the smartphone is set to arrive in the country sometime in the month of September itself. The Nokia 8 is expected to be priced at Rs 39,999 in India to compete with the likes of the OnePlus 5.\n\nAlso Read: Nokia 8 launched with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor & 13MP Zeiss dual cameras, may come to India in September", "id": "9602208", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8: Specs, ZEISS dual cameras, expected India launch, price and everything to know", "image": "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/nokia-8-spec-559_081717081259.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}, "id": "306746", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}, "id": "308363", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "LTE (telecommunication)"}, "id": "313094", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Windows Phone"}, "id": "319197", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}, "id": "329085", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "GLONASS"}, "id": "357079", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 808 PureView"}, "id": "450512", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_808_PureView"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia N95"}, "id": "687845", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N95"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft Lumia"}, "id": "1271128", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Lumia"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "03:11:00"}

The company has already launched three Android-based phones (and one feature phone, the revamped Nokia 3310) this year and the Nokia 8 now becomes the fourth. But unlike the Nokia 6, the Nokia 5 and the Nokia 3 that came before, the Nokia 8 is a high-end flagship phone with high-end flagship hardware specs. It also costs substantially higher than HMD's other Nokia branded phones, which isn't all that surprising, considering its hefty spec-sheet.\n\nNokia 8\n\nThe Nokia 8 is HMD's top-tier phone right now and unless the company launches something even bigger -- which now seems unlikely -- the Nokia 8 will remain its top-tier flagship phone for the year 2017. HMD and Foxconn have built it that way, after all. Unlike the Nokia 6 -- which was until now the company's most expensive Nokia phone -- the Nokia 8 looks and feels every bit a flagship phone. It may look a lot like the Nokia 6 -- when you look at it for the first time -- but make no mistake, it's nothing like it. Unlike the Nokia 6, the Nokia 8 looks and feels like a solid product that has been given ample time and effort on the drawing board. The Nokia 6 was kind of rough around the edges literally as well as figuratively. The Nokia 8 is a lot more polished.\n\nUnlike the Nokia 6 that came with sharp edges, the Nokia 8 comes with subtle curves that seamlessly wrap around the front. The front, meanwhile, is chamfered -- and comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection -- to enhance grip and ergonomics. The Nokia 8, much like the Nokia 6, is an all-metal smartphone carved out of 6000 series aluminum but two of its variants -- Polished blue and Polished copper -- have been polished to near perfection so they look like all-glass phones. They are glossy. The Tempered blue and Steel variants are meanwhile meant for someone who likes it sober.\n\nThe Nokia 8, much like the Nokia 6, has a physical home button on the front that also houses a fingerprint scanner, and is flanked by touch-based capacitive keys which are backlit. The power button and the volume rocker lie on the right, while the SIM card slot rests on the left. It comes with USB Type C port for charging and data syncing. The Nokia 8, in addition, comes with IP54 certification which makes it splash-proof (but not water-proof). It comes with an always-on display -- Glance Screen -- as well.\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with a 5.3-inch quad-HD IPS display with 700 nits of brightness, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor clubbed with up to 6 gigs of RAM under the hood, and up to 128GB of internal storage which is further expandable by up to 256GB via a hybrid micro-SD card slot. While the Tempered blue, Steel, Polished copper variants will come with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage, the Polished blue version will come with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage. The phone is backed by a 3,090mAh battery and supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 fast charging.\n\nAlthough the Nokia 8 doesn't ship with stereo speakers (or Dolby audio like the Nokia 6) it packs in Nokia's OZO spatial 360 degree audio technology. It comes with three microphones that allow for 360 degree spatial audio capture while recording videos.\n\nOn the camera front, the Nokia 8 comes with a dual camera system on the rear -- 13MP RGB+13MP Monochrome sensor -- assisted with Optical Image Stabilisation, laser and phase detection autofocus along with a dual-LED flash. The dual camera system has been fine tuned by Carl Zeiss. The front camera -- which is the same 13MP as the primary sensor on-board the rear -- has been given a similar treatment. This is to allow for Dual-Sight, a feature that lets a user to simultaneously use both the rear and front cameras to take stills/record videos. Think of it as picture-in-picture. If that wasn't enough, the phone also allows for live broadcast of videos shot using Dual-Sight on to social media platforms like Facebook.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has been launched at 599 Euros which roughly translates to Rs 45,000. The Nokia 8 should come to India by the end of September or early October.\n\nNokia 6\n\nThe Nokia 6 is also an all-metal smartphone carved out of 6000 series aluminum with chamfered edges and curved 2.5D Gorilla glass on the front. It has a physical home button on the front that also houses a fingerprint scanner, and is flanked by touch-based capacitive keys which are backlit. The power button and the volume rocker lie on the right, while the SIM card slot rests on the left. It comes with a standard Micro USB 2.0 port (and no USB C-Type) and also supports USB OTG.\n\nAlso Read: Nokia 6 quick review: Stellar looks, stock Android and a whole lot of nostalgia\n\nThe Nokia 6 comes with a 5.5-inch 1080p display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor clubbed with 3GB of RAM under the hood, and 32GB of internal memory which is further expandable by up to 128GB via a micro-SD card slot. The speaker setup on-board the Nokia 6 comes with dual amplifiers and supports Dolby Atmos sound technology. The phone is backed by a 3,000mAh battery and supports fast charging.\n\nOn the camera front, the Nokia 6 comes with a 16-megapixel shooter on the back with f/2.0 aperture, Phase Detection Autofocus and dual-LED flash. The rear camera is capable of recording 1080p videos. On the front, the Nokia 6 comes with an 8-megapixel camera that's also capable of recording 1080p videos.\n\nThe Nokia 6 will be available in India exclusively via Amazon India for Rs 14,999.\n\nNokia 5\n\nThe Nokia 5 is simply a smaller, more affordable variant of the Nokia 6. The Nokia 5 -- just like the Nokia 6 -- also comes with an all-metal body and has a front-mounted fingerprint scanner. It comes with a 5.2-inch 720p display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor clubbed with 2 gigs of RAM under the hood, and 16GB of internal memory which is further expandable by up to 128GB via a micro-SD card slot.\n\nUnlike the Nokia 6, the speaker setup on-board the Nokia 5 doesn't come with dual amplifiers and doesn't support Dolby Atmos sound technology. The phone is also backed by a 3,000mAh battery.\n\nOn the camera front, the Nokia 5 comes with a 13-megapixel shooter on the back with f/2.0 aperture, Phase Detection Autofocus and dual-LED flash. The rear camera is capable of recording 1080p videos. On the front, the Nokia 5 also comes with an 8-megapixel camera.The Nokia 3, meanwhile, will be the most affordable smartphone in Nokia's line-up.\n\nThe Nokia 5 is available in India via offline channels for Rs 12,499.\n\nNokia 3\n\nThe Nokia 3, unlike the Nokia 6 and Nokia 5, comes with an all-polycarbonate body. It also doesn't have a fingerprint scanner.\n\nThe Nokia 3 comes with a 5-inch 720p display, a quad-core MediaTek MT6737 processor clubbed with 2 gigs of RAM under the hood, and 16GB of internal memory which is further expandable by up to 128GB via a micro-SD card slot. The phone is backed by a 2,650mAh battery.\n\nAlso Read: Nokia 3 review: Nokia plus Android is a winning combination\n\nOn the camera front, the Nokia 3 comes with an 8-megapixel shooter on the back with f/2.0 aperture, autofocus and LED flash. On the front, the Nokia 3 comes with an 8-megapixel camera.\n\nThe Nokia 3 is also available in India via offline channels for Rs 9,499.\n\nNokia and pure Android\n\nAlthough in terms of specifications the Nokia phones look competent they don't exactly blow away the other phones in the market the way a Xiaomi or a Samsung or an HTC phone does. Instead, Nokia is relying on the overall experience to woo buyers. The Nokia 8, is of course, about some high-end specs and high-end features as well. That overall experience is something that the company is hoping to offer with three elements: design, the brand appeal and pure Android.\n\nOf the three, the pure Android part is the most exciting because this is something that other phones except the Motorola phones or the Google Pixel don't offer. By using clean and pure Android Nougat aka Android 7.1 in its phones Nokia is hoping to offer to consumers something that will make their smartphone experience better. At the same time, Nokia is also hoping that its design expertise will help it create phones that look different and unique in a market where almost every phones looks similar to the next one.\n\nAs for brand appeal, well, you can't deny the fact that the Nokia 8, 6, 5 and 3 are very nostalgic phones.\n\nAlso Read: Nokia 8: The good and bad about this flagship Android phone", "id": "9826718", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Nokia 8 Vs Nokia 6, 5 and 3: All the differences", "image": "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/1_559_081817101615.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Xiaomi Tech"}, "id": "314119", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi_Tech"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Foxconn"}, "id": "322094", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia phone series"}, "id": "513559", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_phone_series"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "05:18:00"}

Ardent Nokia fans have been waiting for this day for a long time. With the Nokia 8, Nokia fans can finally look forward to a combination of the company's premium hardware with top of the line specifications and 100 percent stock Android.\n\nNokia's comeback into the smartphone game has been the stuff of legends. Nokia is a brand that is still loved and respected by millions across the globe. While Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 were great smartphones, they did not show us what the new Nokia was truly capable of. The Nokia 8 though is a flagship in every sense of the word.\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with a striking all-metal design, dual cameras at the rear with Carl Zeiss optics, OZO 360 degree audio, high-end internals, a high-resolution display and more. The smartphone, which will retail for 599 Euros, aims to challenge the big boys of the smartphone world like the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S8.\n\nNokia smartphones of old were always known for their design and build quality. With the Nokia 8, HMD Global has managed to create a smartphone that looks contemporary whilst at the same time pleasantly reminiscent of past Nokia smartphones. The precision and attention to detail are impressive. The Nokia 8 is crafted out of a single block of series 6000 aluminium and is just 7.3mm thin. Nokia claims that the device is put through a 40-stage process of machining, anodizing and polishing. Few variants also come with a high-gloss finish which takes over 20 hours to perfect.When it comes to specifications, the Nokia 8 does not disappoint. The internals are exactly what you would expect of a 2017 flagship. The smartphone is powered by Qualcomm's latest and greatest processor, the Snapdragon 835 paired with 4GB of RAM, the Adreno 540 GPU and a 3,090mAh battery with QuickCharge 3.0 support. It comes with 64GB of internal storage which can be expanded via a microSD card (of up to 256GB). Many flagship smartphones do not offer expandable storage, so brownie points to Nokia for that.The Nokia 8 comes with a unique and innovative heat management solution that prevents the Snapdragon 835 processor from overheating. It comes with a full-length graphite shielded copper cooling pipe that dissipates heat across the full length and breadth of the smartphone. Nokia claims that this allows the phone to run cool even during intensive tasks.One of the distinguishing features of Nokia's entire Android smartphone line-up is the fact that it runs on a 100 percent stock build of Android. Unlike many OEM's who heavily skin Android and fill the OS with bloat, Nokia believes in the motto - 'Pure, secure and up-to date'. The Nokia 8 runs on stock Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box and according to HMD Global, will be updated to Android O as and when it is released. In fact, Nokia claims that they will be amongst the first, if not the first non Google manufacturers to update their smartphones to Android O. Nokia is also promising monthly security updates for the smartphones.The Nokia 8 carries forward Nokia's proud partnership with Carl Zeiss which has given us iconic camera phones like the Nokia N95 and Lumia 1020 in the past. The Nokia 8 comes with a dual camera setup at the rear with ZEISS optics - a 13MP primary color sensor paired with a 13MP monochrome sensor. According to Nokia's claims, the secondary sensor improves low-light photography by capturing more data and also allows for the capture of depth information. The dual camera setup comes with a dual-LED flash and phase detection autofocus and can record videos in 4K resolution. On the front, there is a 13MP sensor with ZEISS optics with phase detection autofocus and a display flash.\"Be less Selfie, be more #Bothie\" - that is the marketing term used by HMD Global to sell the Nokia 8's most unique and arguably most gimmicky feature. The Nokia 8 is the first phone ever which allows 'Dual-Sight' video - video from both the front and rear camera at the same time - to be streamed natively and in real time to your social feeds such as YouTube. The Dual-Sight feature can also be used to take still pictures.The Nokia 8 has two features that will please audio enthusiasts out there. Not only does the smartphone come with a 3.5mm headphone jack- a port which is fast becoming extinct on flagships these days, it also has a feature called OZO Audio which basically allows you to capture 360 degree audio. How it works is simple -360 degree sound is captured via Nokia's acoustic algorithms along with the smartphone's three microphones. Nokia claims that binaural codecs ensure that the sound is retained even when played back on devices without OZO Audio.The Nokia 8 comes with an extremely high-resolution QuadHD display with a very high maximum brightness of 700 Nits. The display is 5.3-inches in size and comes with 2.5D Gorilla Glass 5 on top for protection against nicks and scratches. The extra resolution comes in handy while watching 2K content in apps like YouTube and also makes the phone VR ready. The Nokia 8 has been priced at 599 Euros (roughly Rs 45,500) and will go on sale globally in September. It is expected to make its way to Indian shores in the month of September itself for a price of Rs 39,999.\n\nAlso Read: Nokia 8: Specs, ZEISS dual cameras, expected India launch, price and everything to know", "id": "9643439", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8: 8 key features of Nokia's new Android flagship smartphone", "image": "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/nokia-8-key-features-559_081717011403.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}, "id": "307030", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}, "id": "329085", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "S60 (software platform)"}, "id": "456644", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S60_(software_platform)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia Lumia 1020"}, "id": "525752", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_1020"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia N95"}, "id": "687845", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N95"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 521, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "08:35:00"}

But the most-expensive model, the Nokia 6, still had a mid-range Snapdragon 430 processor. With HMD/Nokia's clean Android ROM and competitive pricing, many hoped for a true flagship model to be released. Now the time has come, as HMD has taken the wraps off the Nokia 8.\n\nThis phone has been in the rumor mill for months, usually referred to as the Nokia 7 or Nokia 8 in various leaks. The official site now confirms that the Nokia 8 has a Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of expandable storage, and a 5.3\" 2048x1080 Gorilla Glass 5 display. The design is mostly unchanged from the Nokia 6, so if you were hoping for an edge-to-edge display or smaller bezels, I'm sorry to disappoint.\n\nAll four Nokia 8 colors, from left to right: Blue Satin, Blue Polished, Steel, and Copper\n\nThe Nokia 8 has 13MP dual back cameras, as well as a 13MP phase detection auto-focus front camera. Both are equipped with f/2.0 optics from ZEISS, who helped develop the PureView camera used on old Nokia phones (like the Nokia 808 and Lumia 1020). None of the early hands-on posts and videos contain camera samples, so we don't know how photos from the device look yet.\n\nNokia is also heavily advertising the phone's \"bothie\" functionality, which allows you to capture photos/video from the front and back camera at the same time. The name is supposed to be a combination of \"both\" and \"selfie,\" but comes across as HMD trying to be hip with the youth. You can also start live-streaming directly to Periscope and Facebook from the camera app. Finally, the Nokia 8 ships with OZO spatial 360-degree audio, so videos should sound pretty good.\n\nAs you might expect from HMD/Nokia, this phone comes with a near-stock version of Android 7.1.1 and will presumably be updated quickly. The phone will go on sale in Europe for \u20ac599 (about $700), and Engadget reports that there is no immediate plan to sell it in the United States.", "id": "9556006", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 is official with Snapdragon 835 and 4GB RAM, likely not coming to the US", "image": "http://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nexus2cee_bang_cameras-dual_sight.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "PureView"}, "id": "450511", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PureView"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 808 PureView"}, "id": "450512", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_808_PureView"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia Lumia 1020"}, "id": "525752", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_1020"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "20:03:00"}

The handset was long in the rumours, but Wednesday's launch finally put an end to all those speculations about the phone and its specifications.\n\nNokia has chosen the specifications carefully so it can hold a steady ground despite competition from rivals such as Samsung and Apple. The biggest highlight of the Nokia 8 is that the phone brings back the best of Lumia days with Carl Zeiss optics.\n\nPrice and availability in India\n\nNokia 8 will be available globally in early September. It carries a price tag of EUR 599, which roughly translates to Rs. 45,000, but don't expect this to be final price when the handset arrives in India. In case you are wondering when that might happen, a company spokesperson confirmed to Gadgets360 that Nokia 8 will launch in India in early October.\n\nCamera\n\nNokia 8 features a dual camera setup at the back, which uses two 13MP RGB and monochrome sensors with f/2.0 aperture, laser autofocus and dual LED flash. Both sensors help capture pictures and fuse them together to produce a detailed image. But that's just the surface of what Nokia 8's camera is capable of.\n\nNokia 8Nokia\n\nHMD Global has added state-of-the-art technology that allows Dual-Sight video streaming on Facebook and YouTube. The company is calling this feature \"bothies\" - short for capturing selfies and videos from both cameras.\n\nNokia 8Nokia\n\nNokia 8 is also equipped with high dynamic range microphones to capture surround sound using Nokia Ozo Audio algorithms while shooting videos, which ensure quality effects even while sharing videos on social media.\n\nFor selfie lovers, there's a reliable 13MP front snapper with 4K recording support on both front and rear cameras.\n\nDesign and display\n\nNokia has picked top-of-the-line materials for the Nokia 8. The flagship is built with 6000-series aluminium and has a splash-proof IP54 rating. The handset comes in four colours, glossy Polished Copper and Polished Blue, and matte Tempered Blue and Steel, which gives a varied choice for buyers.\n\nNokia 8Nokia\n\nThe handset has been designed in such a way that users won't have heating complaints, thanks to the copper pipe solution and graphite shield to transfer heat.\n\nNokia 8Nokia\n\nMatching the requirement of a flagship smartphone, the Nokia 8 comes with a 2K resolution display measuring 5.3 inches diagonally and has a Gorilla Glass 5 for protection. The overall design of the phone is a reminiscent of existing Nokia 6.\n\nPerformance\n\nUnder the hood, Nokia 8 packs a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset with 4GB RAM, 64GB expandable storage up to 256GB and a 3,090mAh battery. There's a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack.

Nokia 8's specifications and features had been leaked online extensively, and for the most part there were no surprises in the phone. However, there's the 'Bothie' in the Nokia 8, which is basically the option of using the front and rear camera at the same time to stitch together one image, video and even live stream.\n\nWe had a chance to experience the Nokia 8 extensively before the phone was officially announced, and here's our first impressions and hands-on of the Nokia 8.\n\nNokia 8 Design, Display\n\nNokia 8 sports a 5.3-inch 2K LCD IPS display and has a metal unibody design, though there are two polished colour variants of the phone, which have a glossy finish. Nokia 8 is launching in four colours: polished blue and polished copper, tempered blue and steel. The latter two have a matte finish. It seems HMD Global wasn't content with just launching black and white and gold coloured phones.\n\nFrom a design perspective, HMD Global's new flagship resembles the standard Nokia phones that we have seen in the past. There are no reduced bezels on the display, no curved edge display, which granted was not expected either. Nokia 8 has a slight curved design, which makes the phone easy to hold and use. There's also Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on the front, and a fingerprint resistant coating at the back.\n\nMade of 6000 series aluminium, this is one good looking flagship. Is this the most unique looking in the market? As far as colours go yes, and this is a pretty sleek phone. But other than that, the design of the Nokia 8 still plays it very safe.\n\nThe glossy versions of the phone are slippery, and prone to turning into smudge city very quickly. The 2K display for its part should be adequate for most users, and this is vivid and bright enough. Again we will have more on this once we have spent some time with the device.\n\nNokia 8 Specifications, Software\n\nHMD Global is clear that it is not playing the specifications war, even though this phone comes with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, which is the latest from the chipset maker. But there's no 6GB or 8GB RAM variant, instead what you get is standard 4GB RAM and 64GB storage which is expandable.\n\nDoes this lack of extra RAM put this flagship in danger of losing out to others in the market? HMD Global doesn't think so because they are convinced the lack of bloatware, coupled with their clean UI gives the phone a smooth performance. They are also confident Nokia 8 will do well in benchmark tests. Of course, we all don't need 6GB RAM on our phones. However, the lack of 128 GB variant raises some serious questions, especially since the phone's front and rear camera both support 4K video recording.\n\nSoftware wise, the clean UI of the Nokia 8 is an advantage, and the company claims this will be the fastest phone to get Android O updates as they are already in development on this. For fans of clean, stock Android, the new Nokia 8 will seem appealing.\n\nNokia 8 Camera, Audio\n\nSo HMD Global has taken the plunge into the dual-rear camera trend. The phone has a vertically stacked set of dual rear cameras (13MP Colour sensor with OIS + 13MP Mono sensor), and there's a front 13MP camera all well. Nokia 8 has PDAF, IR range finder, dual tone flash on the rear camera, and yes there's the Zeiss Optics branding as well that used to be standard on older Nokia phones.\n\nLike most other dual cameras, the Nokia 8 is capable of shooting a bokeh mode, for portrait pictures where the background is blurred. Is this 'bokeh' perfect? Based on what I saw I would say not yet. The rear camera by itself is not bad, and below are some sample shots captured with it.\n\nBut HMD Global has done something more than launch a smartphone with dual rear cameras. It's also added a new option for dual usage, where both the front and rear camera can be used at the time, for videos, pictures and live streams on Facebook and YouTube. The native camera also supports live video streaming. Nokia 8's camera also get a manual mode. Nokia 8 also comes with OZO Audio, which promises to capture and playback all ambient sound on your video.\n\nWhen it comes to the camera, Nokia 8 is packed with features. Are all of these absolutely necessarily and likely to be used by users? Perhaps not.\n\nNokia 8 First thoughts\n\nFor HMD Global, this is the first flagship phone. The phone will be available globally in September though the India availability is around early October. The pricing isn't as exorbitant as with other flagships, given the average of Euro 599. For now, the phone looks as solid as any other Nokia phone from the past. Then there are features like Dual-Sight in the camera, Ozo Audio to name a few.\n\nBut flagships aren't an easy terrain. Apple and Samsung dominate this space, and any phone commanding a premium price will have a tough competition in these two brands. Nokia for its part has great brand recall value, but in the end that won't be enough in deciding the success of the Nokia 8.\n\nFor all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: nokia", "id": "9597024", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 first impressions: Great design, new camera features and the bothie", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/nokia8_big_3.jpg?w=759", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 38, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 53}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tower Bridge"}, "id": "339071", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Bridge"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bokeh"}, "id": "404967", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "02:10:00"}

Here's everything you need to know about the Nokia 8.\n\nAll the Nokia Android phones start life as a block of 6000 series aluminium, and the Nokia 8 flagship is exactly the same. As with Nokia's previous Android phones, the story is very much about the care and attention that goes into creating the handset, including the anodisation and polishing needed to create the Polished Copper glossy finish.\n\nThere's no mention of waterproofing, however.\n\nThere's a front fingerprint scanner sitting between the back and recent apps touch controls, meaning that the full space of the 16:9 display is available for you to use. It might not be shifting form factor like Samsung and LG, but it's a high quality phone.\n\nThere's USB Type-C on the base and a 3.5mm headphone socket on the top.\n\nThe Nokia 8 offers a 5.3-inch display on the front, using an IPS LCD panel. This is rated at 700 nits, so it has a lot of brightness.\n\nNokia has also made the step to Quad HD, meaning a 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution, resulting in 554ppi - right up there with the sharpest of flagship phones.\n\nDriving the phone is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 platform with 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage, as well as microSD expansion for those who want more space. That's a flagship loadout, so should give the handset the power to handle everything with ease.\n\nThere's a 3090mAh battery from which it's claimed you'll get over a day of use, with support for Quick Charge 3.0, so if you do go flat, you should be back in the game in no time at all.\n\nNokia has also used a liquid cooling system for the Nokia 8, with a large copper heat pipe running through the internals and a graphite heat shield to enable the SD835 to run to the best of its abilities.\n\nWhere HMD Global is looking to differentiate is in the camera. The Nokia 8 has a dual 13-megapixel camera on the rear, offering one sensor that captures RGB colour data and a second that captures monochrome data. Combining this information should lead to better quality results whatever the conditions.\n\nThe front camera is also 13-megapixels and offers the same specs, as all have an f/2.0 aperture, 1.12\u00b5m pixel size and feature phase detection autofocus.\n\nOne of the unique offerings is being able to capture from the front and rear cameras at the same time, with the ability to stream these live to Facebook or YouTube.\n\nThere's no wide angle or zoom offering, instead this is all about quality.\n\nThe Nokia 8 launches on Android 7 Nougat and is unfettered, with no bloatware and no changes from Nokia.\n\nThe only addition is a support app for owners of the phone and Nokia has used its own camera app to support the advanced functions that it offers.\n\nThere's also the ambition to bring Android O to the Nokia 8 as soon as possible.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will also be able to capture 360 audio with an Ozo Audio feature.\n\nThe Nokia 8 was announced on 16 August at a launch event in London. The Nokia will be available globally in September.\n\nThe Nokia 8 price is \u20ac599. There's no word on UK price or networks.", "id": "9544645", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8: Release date, specs and everything you need to know for Nokia's flagship - Pocket-lint", "image": "http://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/1200x630/assets/images/137751-phones-feature-nokia-8-release-date-specs-and-everything-you-need-to-know-for-nokias-flagship-image1-37iqcclfvn.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 3226, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3235}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel"}, "id": "315167", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}, "id": "360548", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile World Congress"}, "id": "367449", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_World_Congress"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "18:47:00"}

Our first look Nokia 8 review takes a close look at the design, performance, features and specs, as well as that 'Dual Sight' snapper.\n\nNo one can accuse HMD Global of being layabouts, that's for sure. In less than a year since they snapped up the right to use the Nokia name, we've seen the launch of several feature phones (including the nostalgia-packed 3310 reboot), plus three smartphones. Now you can add one more smartphone to that total, this time a flagship model known as the Nokia 8.\n\nThe Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 were unveiled at MWC 2017, all of them affordable value-packed handsets. We certainly liked the low asking prices, yet we all clamoured for the first Nokia flagship phone in yonks. A fresh new premium blower that could rival the likes of the OnePlus 5, Samsung's Galaxy S8 and the LG G6. Now we have it.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has just launched here in Europe, to be released in September 2017. We had the chance to go hands-on for this first look review and so far we're definitely seeing the potential, although whether it can beat off attention from rivals remains to be seen.\n\nCheck out our in-depth comparisons between HMD's Nokia phones and the biggest competition:\n\nNokia 3 vs Nokia 5 vs Nokia 6\n\nNokia 8 vs Nokia 6 vs Nokia 5 vs Nokia 3\n\nNokia 8 vs OnePlus 5\n\nNokia 8 vs Galaxy S8\n\nHands-on Nokia 8 review: Specs Phone Nokia 8 Screen size 5.3-inches Screen resolution 2560x1440 Fingerprint sensor? Yes Water resistant? Splash resistant only (IP54) OS Android 7.1.1 Processor Snapdragon 835 Memory 4GB Storage 64GB microSD? Yes Battery 3080mAh Rear camera 13MP dual-lens Front camera 13MP Hands-on Nokia 8 review: Design\n\nWe love how the new HMD handsets retain that classic Nokia look and feel, while updating just enough to keep them modern and stylish. The Nokia 8 is unmistakably a Nokia mobile from the moment you pick it up, even before you turn it on and hear that distinctive four-note tone.\n\nAround the rear, a seamless aluminium backing offers a minimalist design that certainly looks sleek. The Nokia 8 is just 7.9mm at its thickest point (around the camera lens) and 7.3mm otherwise, with a curved edge for a more comfortable grip.\n\nThat said, you don't quite get an edge-to-edge finish here; those bezels above, below and to the sides of the 5.3-inch screen are a little chunky, making this Nokia flagship a similar size to the OnePlus 5. The rectangular finish is definitely reminiscent of those glorious old Lumias, although skinnier and taller. There's more than a hint of Sony Mobile about it too.\n\nBeneath the display you'll find hard back, home and recent apps buttons, built into the frame. That narrow home button doubles as a fingerprint sensor, which certainly seems responsive in our early tests.\n\nYou can pick the phone up in a matte or glossy finish, depending on your personal tastes. At launch the four choices are matte silver, matte blue, polished blue and the lovely polished copper finish. We definitely love the shiny models although they're total fingerprint magnets. Sadly there's no full waterproofing, only splash resistance with an IP54 rating.\n\nHands-on Nokia 8 review: Screen and media\n\nSo far, the 5.3-inch Quad HD display seems to be of true flagship quality. It's certainly punchy, producing vibrant visuals that stand out from the screen. Thankfully images aren't overly vibrant or saturated, so photos retain a degree of realism.\n\nBrightness levels, viewing angles and other aspects of the panel are all solid, as you'd expect at this price point. And with its 2560x1440-pixel resolution, you can expect glorious detail levels and not a hint of a pixel in sight.\n\nGot a massive media collection? The Nokia 8's 64GB of built-in storage is mostly free for your personal use, with 15GB given over to the OS and pre-installed apps. Thankfully Nokia hasn't laden the flagship phone with pointless additions, as you'll see in the next part of this review. Also, you can easily expand when needed via the microSD memory card slot, which supports up to 256GB of extra storage.\n\nHands-on Nokia 8 review: OS and features\n\nHMD is going for a 'pure, secure and up to date' version of Android OS here, as it did with the other Nokia Android phones from 2017. In other words, you can expect quite a vanilla Android experience, with no tinkering from the manufacturer.\n\nThat's something seen on few Android phones these days, which often pack an overlay that changes the look and feel of Google's OS while adding new features. Besides Google's Pixel handsets, only Motorola mobiles tend to offer a similar 'no frills' interface.\n\nAndroid 7.1.1 certainly runs smoothly on the Nokia 8, as you'd expect given the powerful specs on offer and pure OS. You get all of the usual features on tap, including split-screen multi-tasking and full resource management. Plus, an update to Android O is hopefully going to happen soon after launch.\n\nHands-on Nokia 8 review: Performance and battery life\n\nPowering the Nokia 8 is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835, the chipset of choice for premium handsets. Not only is it more powerful than pretty much any other mobile platform right now, it's also impressively energy efficient and packs all kinds of support for smartphone cameras, security and more besides.\n\nIn our hands-on Nokia 8 session, we certainly didn't notice any kind of slowdown. Apps open instantly and browsing swiftly through the Android OS is a smooth experience. Stay tuned for our in-depth review, to find out how the handset handles everyday life and more demanding applications.\n\nThe Nokia 8 doesn't seem to heat up either, thanks to the built-in 'liquid cooling' mechanism (reminiscent of the old Lumia 950 flagship handsets). Combined with a graphite shield that disperses the heat throughout the handset, you shouldn't feel a hotspot even during heavy use.\n\nYou can charge the Nokia 8's 3080mAh battery up via Type-C USB and there's full support for Quick Charge 3.0. That should give you close to a full charge in roughly an hour. No wireless charging in sight, however.\n\nHands-on Nokia 8 review: Cameras\n\nThe camera experience is one of the features that HMD has closely considered. The Nokia 8 comes packing a 13-megapixel 'Dual Sight' mobile snapper, crafted in collaboration with optics expert Carl Zeiss (now a long-standing partnership). This dual lens juts only ever so slightly from the surface of the phone and offers some strong photography chops, continuing Nokia's focus on strong mobile camera tech.\n\nCheck out our full Nokia 8 camera preview for what we think of the flagship's shooter, as well as a closer look at the various features.\n\nHands-on Nokia 8 review: UK price and release date\n\nYou can expect the Nokia 8 to hit Europe in early September (no exact release date just yet, but stay tuned). The flagship phone costs 599 Euros SIM-free. We're still waiting on the UK pricing, although we're fairly confident you'll be paying \u00a3549 for your own slice of Nokia pie.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will not be available in the US at the time of launch, although we're expecting the phone to come to American markets early in 2018.\n\nStay tuned for our full Nokia 8 review and camera review, coming soon.", "id": "9578032", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 hands-on review: Nokia's 2017 flagship phone ticks all the boxes", "image": "https://cdn1.recombu.com/media/mobile/Devices/Nokia/Nokia 8/Nokia8_Thumb.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1061, "date": "2017-09-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1075}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Motorola"}, "id": "324217", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}, "id": "329085", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "IP Code"}, "id": "405233", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft Lumia"}, "id": "1271128", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Lumia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony Mobile"}, "id": "1276530", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Mobile"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "17:33:00"}

HMD Global, the company behind Nokia's comeback into the smartphone game, unveiled the Nokia 8 at an event in London today. The smartphone is priced at 599 Euros and comes with an all-metal design, ZEISS optics, OZO audio and top of the line internals.\n\nTo say that the Nokia 8 is one of the most hotly anticipated smartphones of the year would be an understatement. The Nokia 8 is not only Nokia's first flagship smartphone since its Windows Phone days, it is also the first high-end smartphone from the Finnish company to run on Android.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor paired with 4GB of RAM, the Adreno 540 GPU and a 3090mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 support. The smartphone comes with 64GB of internal storage expandable via a microSD card (up to 256GB) and a fingerprint sensor embedded into the home button up front.\n\nAdditionally, The Nokia 8 comes with a 5.3-inch QuadHD display with 2.5D Gorilla Glass 5 on top for protection against nicks and scratches. The display has a maximum brightness of 700 nits and comes with Nokia's trademark Glance Screen. The smartphone also has a very innovative heat management solution with a full-length graphite shielded copper cooling pipe that dissipates heat across the full length and breadth of the smartphone.\n\nJust like the rest of Nokia's Android smartphone line-up, the Nokia 8 runs on a 100 percent stock build of Android. Unlike the Nokia 3 which ships with Android 7.0 out of the box, the Nokia 8 comes with the latest version of Android Nougat - 7.1.1. Nokia has promised that the Nokia 8 will be updated to Android O in the future.\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is fast becoming a rarity in today's world. It also comes with support for OZO Audio - thanks to Nokia's acoustic algorithms and the smartphone's three microphones, you can capture 360 degree spatial surround sound.\n\nOn the imaging front, the smartphone carries forward Nokia's proud association with Carl Zeiss which has given us iconic camera phones like the Nokia N95 and Lumia 1020 in the past. It comes with a ZEISS powered dual camera setup at the rear with a primary 13MP color sensor with optical image stabilisation and a secondary 13MP monochrome sensor. Both sensors have an aperture of f/2.0.\n\nNokia claims that the secondary sensor helps capture depth of field information and improves low-light photography. The rear camera setup comes with phase detection auto focus and a dual-LED flash and supports 4K video recording. On the front, there is a 13MP camera with an aperture of f/2.0 and phase detection autofocus for selfies.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is the first phone in the world which allows 'Dual-Sight' video to be live streamed natively and in real-time to social feeds such as Facebook. The feature allows you to use the front and rear camera at the same time for both photos and videos. Nokia calls this feature #Bothie.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has been priced at 599 Euros which roughly translates to around Rs 45,000. It will be available in four colour options - Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue and Steel and will go on sale globally throughout September.\n\nWhile Nokia has not officially announced details regarding the smartphone's Indian launch, it is expected to go on sale in country in the month of September itself.

The phone has been launched at a price of EUR 599, according to The Verge, which is approximately Rs 45,000 at the time of writing. It is rumoured that the phone will be hitting the Indian markets by October this year.\n\nImage Courtesy: Nokia\n\nThis is the first time HMD Global has partnered up with Carl Zeiss for making a smartphone. The Nokia 8 has an interesting camera setup. There are three cameras in total, the rear being a dual camera. All three use 13 MP sensors with f/2.0 lenses. The rear features an RGB sensor with optical image stabilisation (OIS) paired with a monochrome sensor without OIS. The front and rear cameras feature PDAF and the rear camera even features an IR range finder. The latter should help with improving focus speed in the dark as well as to improve depth perception for a portrait-mode-like feature.\n\nNokia is also introducing, we kid you not, a #Bothie photo mode. In this mode, you'll use the front and rear cameras to take an image or video. Better yet, it looks like you can live stream in this mode. Check out the demo below!\n\nThe Nokia 8 has 4K streaming capabilities and employs Nokia OZO Audio for spatial 360 degree audio recording. OZO is the brand name that Nokia employs for its spatial audio and VR video recording platform. This includes the OZO+ VR camera used by many Hollywood studios.\n\nHello #Bothie! The world's first smartphone to broadcast live with both cameras simultaneously. Meet the #Nokia8. pic.twitter.com/nMLl8h6YZe\n\n-- Nokia Mobile (@nokiamobile) August 16, 2017\n\nThe phone has an aluminum unibody design housing a 5.3 inch, 2K, polarized display covered with Corning gorilla Glass 5. Nokia 8 will be running on Android 7.1.1 Nougat and employs an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor along with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage expandable to 256 GB via a micro-SD card. The phone uses a full-length copper cooling pipe with a graphite shield to dispense of heat across the metal body of the phone.\n\nThe device has a 3,090 mAh battery and 4G dual-SIM support with one slot acting as a hybrid SIM slot. It also has an IP54 rating, making it splash proof. The phone comes with a 3.5 mm jack and a type-C port (USB 3.1 Gen 1), NFC and Bluetooth 5.0 for connectivity. Bluetooth 5.0 allows for streaming audio to two other Bluetooth devices, among other things. Only a handful of phones use the feature, including the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the HTC U11.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will be available in four colours namely matte silver, polished blue, matte blue, polished copper.\n\n#Hmd global #Ip54 #Nokia 8 #Nokia 8 bothie mode #Nokia 8 camera #Nokia 8 carl zeiss #Nokia 8 features #Nokia 8 launch #Nokia 8 price #Nokia 8 specifications #Nokia ozo audio #Vr

Today, the company is launching its beta program for that update, and said that \"if you were chosen, you'll receive an email with instructions on how to download the update and get started.\"\n\nCoinciding with the start of the beta, Sony announced details of what the 5.00 update will bring to all PS4 owners when it rolls out later this year.\n\nSony said that it's redesigning its master/sub-account system with a new Families on PlayStation Network system, which will make it easier to set up accounts for children. This will include:\n\nFamily Manager, parents/guardians and child accounts\n\nEach family on PSN will now have a Family Manager. In turn, the Family Manager can promote any other adult in the family to be a parent or guardian.\n\nFrom there, each parent or guardian can customise the parental control levels of each child account, such as restricting certain age ratings or online access.\n\nIndividual parental controls\n\nBefore this update, the same parental controls were applied to all users on the same console, including adults. But with 5.00, all controls (including game age ratings) can be individually controlled for each child account.\n\nThese are the other features and improvements that PS4 owners will have to look forward to in the 5.00 update:\n\nFriend list management\n\nIn place of the current 'Favourite Groups' tab, we're adding a new 'Custom Lists' tab on the 'Friends' screen.\n\nThis will allow you to create and edit custom lists of your friends and arrange them into specific groups, based on the games you play, or groups of friends you like to hang out with online. For example, you can create a custom list of your Destiny teammates and easily send them raid invites.\n\nBroadcast feature updates\n\nCommunities\n\nIf you've set up a community on your PS4, you can now link your community to your live gameplay broadcast. When a broadcast is linked to a community, the community button appears on the 'Live from PlayStation' spectator screen, allowing any spectator to jump directly into your community page to check out the details or join.\n\nPlayStation VR\n\nWe've added a new setting in PlayStation VR: 'Display Message to Spectators and Spectators' Comments'. Once this is enabled, spectator comments sent during a broadcast are displayed not only in cinematic mode, but also in VR mode - so you'll be able to read comments and interact with spectators from within your PS VR headset.\n\nPlayStation 4 Pro\n\nGood news for Twitch users: with this update, PS4 Pro will support 1080p 60fps streaming on Twitch.\n\nMessage improvements\n\nYou've already been able to share your favourite music to Twitter and Facebook via Spotify and PlayStation Music, but now you'll also be able to share individual tracks by sending a message on PS4.\n\nYour friends will be able to listen to the track directly from the message you send, and if they're on their mobile device, they can jump directly to their Spotify app from the PS Messages app to check out the song and add it to their own playlist.\n\nNotifications updates\n\nWe've added a new setting that allows you to disable pop-up notifications while you're watching a movie or TV show on your PS4. This setting is set to 'off' by default, so go to Settings > Notifications to enable it.\n\nFurthermore, you now have the option to turn off message previews on your pop-up notifications. If you turn this setting off, the pop-up notification will hide the message senders' online ID and will display a generic user icon and message instead.\n\nLastly, you'll have the option to change the colour of your pop-up notifications to either white (default) or black.\n\nQuick Menu updates\n\nIf you want to keep an eye out on what's happening in your Notifications tab - like game download progress or new invitations - you can now access this directly from the Quick Menu without leaving your game.\n\nAlso, we've added a 'Leave Party' option in the Quick Menu, so you can easily exit a party and go right back to playing your game.\n\nVirtual surround sound on PS VR\n\nPlayStation VR now supports 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound through your headphones when watching Blu-rays and DVDs in Cinematic Mode, making for an even more immersive viewing experience.\n\nImproved tournaments bracket viewer\n\nWe've added a new 'bracket viewer' that shows full tournament brackets for Single Elimination and Double Elimination tournaments on PS4, making it easier for you to see the current tournament standings.\n\nIn addition to those new features and improvements, Sony is also introducing language support in the PS4 interface for Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Romanian, Thai, and Vietnamese.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @NeowinGaming to stay up to date with the latest gaming news and reviews.\n\nSource: Sony", "id": "9696730", "details": {"liCnt": 12}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Sony launches PlayStation 4 system software 5.00 beta -

The brand has been revived by HMD Global, but the company's first flagship -- the Nokia 8 -- won't be available in the U.S. for you to enjoy.\n\nIt's hard to think of HMD Global as \"a startup.\" The company launched in early 2017 and skyrocketed into the spotlight due to its licensing partnership to use the Nokia brand name for its smartphones. Other than a handful of feature phones, the company launched three budget smartphones: The Nokia 3, the Nokia 5, and the Nokia 6. The latest to join the family is also HMD's first flagship smartphone -- the Nokia 8.\n\nSmartphones from HMD Global have to follow certain design guidelines from Nokia and the company works with Foxconn to manufacture its devices. A strong partnership with Google means these phones run a pure version of Android straight from Google and it also gets version and security updates much faster than any other manufacturer. With the Nokia 8, there is a rekindled partnership with Zeiss, a company known for its expertise in imaging and optics. As such, the latest Android flagship phone's special features lie in its camera application but before we dive in, let us take a look at its specifications and design.\n\nAngular design, high-end specs\n\nThe Nokia 8 looks similar to HMD Global's budget Nokia Android smartphones but not much like the Nokia Lumia days of old. There is no 2017 bezel-less design here; it looks like a standard smartphone. Its edges are curved and the screen is protected by 2.5D curved Gorilla Glass 5.\n\nThe aluminum unibody looks sleek, especially if you opt for the polished blue or polished copper colors -- they offer a \"high-gloss mirror finish.\" If the glossy look is not for you, there are two more color options: Tempered Blue and Tempered Steel. The rear also houses a vertical dual-camera setup and the Nokia brand logo in the center.\n\nThe front looks traditional, with somewhat chunky edges around the display that house the selfie camera, as well as the capacitive Android navigation buttons and the fingerprint sensor. The only buttons are on the right edge, where the volume rocker sits on the top above the power button.\n\nThe phone features a graphite-shielded cooling pipe that \"dissipates the heat\" along the full length and width of the phone.\n\nIts spec sheet is similar to other 2017 flagship smartphones. For starters, it is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor and comes paired with 4GB of RAM. To ensure you get the best performance out of the Nokia 8, HMD said the phone features a graphite-shielded cooling pipe that \"dissipates the heat\" along the full length and width of the phone, making sure it will not overheat when powering intensive processing tasks.\n\nYou get 64GB of internal storage, but there is a MicroSD card slot that lets you add up to 256GB of additional storage. The 5.3-inch LCD display offers a Quad HD resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels, and HMD has packed a 3,090mAh battery to keep it running for a while. It supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 technology, meaning you can utilize the fast-charging technology via the USB Type-C port.\n\nSadly, unlike most flagship smartphones, it only has a dust- and water-resistance rating of IP54, which makes it nothing more than splashproof.\n\nLike most of HMD's Nokia phones, you will find Android 7.1.1 on the Nokia 8. The company told Digital Trends it is already working on the upcoming Android O update, which will roll out to the Nokia 8 as soon as it is ready.\n\nA camera built for live-streaming\n\nBoth the front and rear camera of the Nokia 8 feature Zeiss optics. The two rear cameras pack 13-megapixels each with f/2.0 apertures and they have specific functions. One takes photos in color and features optical image stabilization, while the other only shoots monochrome photos -- just like the Huawei P9 and P10. The front camera also has 13-megapixels, with a f/2.0 aperture.\n\nBut the killer feature is how you can live-stream to apps like Facebook Live and YouTube Live, directly from the Nokia 8's camera app. HMD said it worked closely with Qualcomm, and also collaborated with Google and Facebook to get the implementation right. There's also Dual-Sight, a feature that lets you share content from both the front and rear camera at the same time.\n\nThese videos will also be accompanied with stellar sound, as HMD has partnered with Nokia to use a similar audio setup as the Nokia Ozo virtual reality camera. The Nokia 8 features three microphones that utilize the same algorithm used with the Ozo camera to \"capture audio with immersive 360-degree spatial surround sound.\" When you share a video, the audio still offers hi-fi surround sound even when played on devices without Ozo Audio.\n\nAvailability and price\n\nUnfortunately, the Nokia 8 will never make its way stateside as the company said the U.S. and China required special treatment. It would have to devote a lot more time and money bringing the phone here into a well-established market, where Samsung and Apple reign king.\n\nInstead, the Nokia 8 will launch in Europe and other markets starting in September and it will cost a flagship price of 600 euros (about $704).", "id": "9577948", "details": {"liCnt": 5, "pinCnt": 6}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "With 'pure' Android and Zeiss optics, the Nokia 8 does its badge proud", "image": "https://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/nokia-8-family-flat-510x0.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphite"}, "id": "307290", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flagship"}, "id": "320976", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Foxconn"}, "id": "322094", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook features"}, "id": "332330", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_features"}, {"label": {"eng": "IP Code"}, "id": "405233", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft Lumia"}, "id": "1271128", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Lumia"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "17:33:00"}

It will take place in London and will start at 7:30PM local time.\n\nBefore we get to the question marks let's take a look at what's more or less certain - the unveiling of the Nokia 8.\n\nThe phone is expected to have a 5.3\" QHD display, a Snapdragon 835 chipset likely paired to 6GB of RAM. Finally, there should be a Zeiss-certified dual camera on the back.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will come in three clors - Silver, Copper Gold and Tempered Blue as leaks suggest.\n\nNokia 2\n\nThe Nokia 2 could share the spotlight with the Nokia 8. We know the phone is getting ready to become official - as evidenced by its leaked renders and a live photo.\n\nHere things become very debatable as Nokia itself insists this device isn't real. A 3G-enabled version of the resurrected Nokia 3310 (2017) has been rumored (and denied) but we wouldn't count it out just yet.\n\nAnd if there is 3G version of the Nokia 3310 (2017) it could very well be announced later today.\n\nUnlikely\n\nIt's highly unlikely that Nokia will announce any other smartphones today. If it were, they would likely be the bigger (to the Nokia 8) Nokia 9 and a middle-of-the-road Nokia 7 with a Snapdragon 660.\n\nGiven the lack of solid recent leaks, we expect the Nokia 9 at a later time. The rumors and leaks are even scarcer when the Nokia 7 is concerned so we wouldn't bet on it being unveiled today either.\n\nStay tuned on GSMArena.com for the complete coverage of Nokia's event later today.", "id": "9564596", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia has a big event today, here's what to expect", "image": "http://cdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/17/08/nokia-8-event-what-to-expect/-728x314/gsmarena_000.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "3G"}, "id": "319925", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "21:06:00"}

The smartphone will be announced at an event to take place in London at 7:30PM, which is at 12AM on August 17 as per Indian timing. The launch event will be live streamed either on the company's global website or its YouTube channel. The live stream link is yet to be out; we will link it as an when the company updates on it. Ahead of the launch, the premium phone has been subjected to several leaks and rumours almost reveal a rough sketch of how the handset is going to be. Several live images and renders of the Nokia 8 have also been leaked online.\n\nSome renders reveals that Nokia 8 will come in a new colour, which will be Copper. While other renders suggest that Nokia 8 will be the first phone by HMD Global (a company responsible for manufacturing Nokia phones) which may come with Qualcomm's latest processor - Snapdragon 835 chipset and dual pair of rear cameras.\n\nNokia 8 is also tipped come with Carl Zeiss lens. To recall, Nokia and Zeiss joined hands again. Last month, HMD Global together with Carl Zeiss, a company known for its high-end photography lenses equipment, announced a strategic partnership. That's when rumours started flooding in that Nokia 9 could be the first phone to come with Carl Zeiss lens. However, some rumours circulating the web suggest that it is the Nokia 8 and not Nokia 9 that will be the first phone to come under the HMD Global - Carl Zeiss partnership. Although, the company is yet to reveal details on the same, which it will during the launch of the Nokia 8 today.\n\nAlso Read: Nokia 8 with Android 7.1.1 Nougat leaked in live images ahead of August 16 launch\n\nThe smartphone - Nokia 8 was spotted on GeekBench recently which revealed the complete specs details of the phone. As per the benchmark listing, Nokia 8 will come with the latest software - Android 8.0 aka Android O. However, it is noteworthy that in the benchmark results displayed on the new live image of the Nokia 8 it shows that the phone will be running on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. This means that Nokia 8 may launch with Android Nougat OS, and will later be updated to the new Android O software like other Nokia Android phone.\n\nGoogle at the I/O event confirmed that the next software update - Android O will be officially out this fall, which is, sometime around the month of September. However, some rumours making rounds on the web reveal that the latest software may be official ahead of the scheduled time. Chances are that Android O may come in August itself.\n\nEarlier, HMD Global confirmed the new software will also land to other Nokia smartphones that have been lately - Nokia 6, Nokia 5 and Nokia 3. \"The smartphones will get the Android O update once the new release is available from Google for their OEM partners, the same way HMD Global is committed to the monthly Android security updates,\" said HMD Global. This means that all the smartphones by Nokia will be eventually upgraded to Android O aka Android 8.0 software system.\n\nIn terms of specifications, Nokia 8 will come with a 5.7-inch 2K display, Snapdragon 835 processor, and two cameras at the rear with 13-megapixel sensor each. The phone is further said to come with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. As per the pricing details, Nokia 8 may come with a price tag of 589 Euros, which roughly estimates around Rs 43,660.

It brings 1080p and 60fps broadcasts to PS4 Pro and more.\n\nWe're overhauling the current master/sub-account system, and introducing the new \"Family on PlayStation Network.\" This new system will offer a more flexible experience for families on PS4 by making it easier to setup PSN accounts for children and customize parental control settings. Below are the new features that will be introduced with family on PSN:\n\nFamily on PSN will allow multiple adults to be part of a single family. The Family Manager can promote another adult inside the family to a Parent/Guardian, who can then customize parental control levels of children's accounts.\n\nBefore this update, the same parental controls were applied to all users on the same console, including adults. But with 5.00, all controls (including game age ratings) can be individually attuned for each child.\n\nIn place of the current 'Favorite Groups' tab, we're adding a new 'Custom Lists' tab within Friends, which allows you to create and edit custom lists of your friends. This makes it easier for you to manage your friends and access specific groups. For example, you can create a custom list of your Destiny teammates and easily send them raid invites.\n\nIf you own a community, you can now bind your community to your broadcast. When a broadcast is linked to a community, the community button appears on the Live from PlayStation spectator screen. Once a spectator clicks on the community button, they'll be able to jump directly to your community page to check out the details.\n\nWe've added a new setting in PlayStation VR: Display Message to Spectators and Spectators' Comments. Once this is enabled, spectator comments sent during a broadcast is displayed not only in cinematic mode, but also in VR mode. This makes it much easier for VR broadcasters to keep up on comments and communicate with their viewers.\n\nGood news Twitch users: with this update, PS4 Pro will support 1080p 60fps streaming on Twitch.\n\nYou've already been able to share your favorite music to Twitter and Facebook via PlayStation Music, but now you'll also be able to share via messages using your PS4. If your friends are on PS4, they can listen to the track right inside the message by booting up Quick Menu, and if they're on their mobile device, they can jump directly to the Spotify app from the PS Messages app to check out the song.\n\nIn addition, if you're part of multiple message groups, you can now easily leave several groups at once. Just open up Options in the message list, select Leave, and choose the message groups you want to leave.\n\nWe've added a new setting that allows you to disable pop-up notifications while you're watching a movie or TV show on your PS4. This setting is off by default, so go to Settings > Notifications to disable notifications and go uninterrupted during your videos.\n\nFurthermore, you now have the option to turn off message previews on your pop-up notifications. If you turn this setting off, the pop-up notification will hide the message senders' online ID and will display a generic user icon and message instead.\n\nLastly, you'll have the option to change the color of your pop-up notifications to either white (default) or black.\n\nIf you want to keep an eye out on what's happening under Notifications, like the progress of your game downloads/installations or new party invites, you can now access this directly from the Quick Menu so you don't have to step away from your game every time you want to check your notifications.\n\nAlso, we've added a 'Leave Party' option in the Quick Menu, so you can easily exit a party and go right back to playing your game.\n\nIn addition, now you'll see the system clock in the upper-right corner of the screen when you pop open the Quick Menu.\n\nPlayStation VR now supports 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound on your headphones when watching Blu-rays and DVDs in Cinematic Mode, making for an even more immersive viewing experience.\n\nWe have a new bracket viewer that shows full tournament brackets for Single Elimination and Double Elimination tournaments on PS4. This makes it easier for you to see the current tournament standings.\n\nWith this update, we're adding the following system language options on PS4: Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Romanian, Thai and Vietnamese.\n\nThe PlayStation 4's system software update 5.00's beta will be available for those who signed up. Those were were selected will receive an email with instructions on how to download and get started.", "id": "9693247", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "PS4 System Software 5.00 \"Nobunaga\" Releases Its Beta Today, Here's What's New - Siliconera", "image": "http://www.siliconera.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/35765204673_3646f26389_o_thumb.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Music"}, "id": "302636", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop music"}, "id": "303105", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television program"}, "id": "303532", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video game console"}, "id": "304421", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}, "id": "307034", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spotify"}, "id": "307723", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}, "id": "308708", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "DVD"}, "id": "318168", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD"}, {"label": {"eng": "Surround sound"}, "id": "333958", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}, "id": "340359", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitch (website)"}, "id": "349819", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(website)"}, {"label": {"eng": "7.1 surround sound"}, "id": "371798", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "System software"}, "id": "396377", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental controls"}, "id": "398807", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop-up notification"}, "id": "650501", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_notification"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blu-ray"}, "id": "1197211", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 64, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 201, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}], "time": "13:07:00"}

Nokia fans and loyalists have been waiting for years for Nokia to release a high-end smartphone running on Android. The Nokia 8 is crafted from a single block of aluminium, runs on a pure version of Android Nougat, has a crisp and sharp display and comes with dual cameras at the rear with ZEISS optics - Nokia surely seems to have left no stone un-turned with their first flagship smartphone in years.\n\nThe Nokia 8 arrives in an extremely mature and competitive marketplace dominated by the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S8, iPhone 7 and Google Pixel. While a lot of leeway was given to the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 due to their price, no such allowances can be given to the Nokia 8 which aims to compete in the ruthless high-end market.\n\nThe Nokia 8 looks like a fairly accomplished product and an excellent first Android flagship smartphone from HMD Global. However, it does have its share of weaknesses. Here are the 5 ways the Nokia 8 succeeds and 5 areas where the smartphone is lacking:\n\nWhere it shines\n\nExquisite looks and craftsmanship\n\nCarrying forward Nokia's heritage of excellent smartphone design, the Nokia 8 is carved out of a single block of series 6000 aluminum and looks very retro chic. With the Nokia 8's design, HMD Global has managed to retain the soul of Nokia smartphones of old while making it look contemporary and modern.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is an excellent first Android flagship smartphone from HMD Global. However, it does have its share of weaknesses\n\nThe level of craftsmanship is impressive. Each smartphone goes through a 40-stage process of machining, anodising and polishing. Nokia claims that the high-gloss finish on certain variants takes over 20 hours to perfect. If the build quality of the Nokia 3 and Nokia 6 is anything to go by, the Nokia 8 is also sure to continue Nokia's tradition of building smartphones like a tank.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is only 7.3 mm thin in average and 4.3mm thin at the edges. It is available in four colour variants - Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue and Steel.\n\nTop of the line specifications\n\nThe internals of the Nokia 8 are on par with any 2017 flagship out there - that is to say they do not disappoint. The smartphone is powered by Qualcomm's latest flagship processor, the Snapdragon 835 paired with 4GB of RAM, the Adreno 540 GPU and a 3,090mAh battery with QuickCharge 3.0 support.\n\nAdditionally, the smartphone comes with 64GB of internal storage which can be expanded via a microSD card (of up to 256GB) and a fingerprint sensor embedded into the home button up front. Many flagship smartphones as of late do not feature any sort of expandable storage so Nokia should be lauded for that.\n\nNokia 8 also comes with an innovative heat management solution - a full-length graphite shielded copper cooling pipe dissipates heat across the full length and breadth of the smartphone. Nokia asserts that this allows the smartphone to stay cool even while being pushed.\n\nPixel perfect display\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with a 5.3-inch Quad HD display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440. It is covered by 2.5D gorilla Glass 5 for protection against scratches. Aside from the Quad HD resolution, what makes this display stand out is the fact that it has a particularly high maximum brightness of 700 Nits and comes with Nokia's trademark Glance Screen which we used to see in Lumia smartphones of old.\n\nAdditionally, because of the relatively smaller size of the display, the pixel density (544 ppi) is higher than most smartphones out there with QuadHD displays. This should help the Nokia 8 display sharper text and images.\n\nStock Android\n\nOne of the biggest talking points of Nokia's entire Android smartphone line-up is the fact it runs on stock Android. Unlike many other smartphone manufacturers who choose to skin Android to a point that it fails to look like Google's operating system altogether, Nokia has decided to leave Android untouched.\n\nAlso Read: Nokia 8 launched: Specs, top features, expected India price and everything you must know\n\nThese OEM skins are full of bloat, tend to lag with time and worst of all, do not get timely Android version updates. Bucking this trend, the marketing for Nokia's Android line-up reads - 'Pure, secure and up-to date'. The Nokia 8 runs on a 100 percent stock build of Android 7.1.1 Nougat right out of the box with no extraneous third-party apps and overlays.\n\nNokia has also promised that the smartphone will be updated to Android O in the future. While it is just a promise for now and we will have to see how Nokia lives up to it, the company does boldly claim that they will be one of the first, if not the first non Google manufacturers to release Android O to their smartphones.\n\nA generous dose of multimedia features\n\nNokia, through their partnership with lens-maker Carl Zeiss has always been known for making great camera phones - just look at the Nokia N95, Lumia 1020 and Nokia 808 PureView for proof. With the Nokia 8, HMD Global aims to add another chapter to this storied history.\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with a dual camera setup at the rear with ZEISS optics - a 13MP primary RGB (color) sensor paired with a 13MP monochrome (black and white) sensor which allows for the capture of depth of field information and helps in low-light photography. The rear camera setup can also shoots videos in 4K and comes with phase detection auto-focus and a dual-LED flash.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is carved out of a single block of series 6000 aluminum and looks modern yet pleasantly nostalgic\n\nUnlike many other smartphones where the secondary sensor is reduced to being a gimmick that shoots just bokeh shots, the secondary camera on the Nokia 8 actually improves low-light shots by capturing more data. On the front of the smartphone is a 13MP sensor with phase detection autofocus which is also made in conjunction with ZEISS optics.\n\nThe Nokia 8 also comes with OZO Audio which allows for the capture of 360 degree spatial surround sound via the phone's three microphones and Nokia's own acoustic algorithms. Nokia claims that these clips can also be played back on other phones which do not have OZO audio. Audio enthusiasts will also like the fact that the Nokia 8 comes with a 3.5mm jack, a port which is fast becoming extinct in today's flagship smartphones.\n\nWhere it lacks\n\nLack of proper waterproofing\n\nWhile most flagships these days such as the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 come with IP68 dust and water resistance, the Nokia 8 is only IP54 certified. Thus while the Nokia 8 is only splash proof, IP68 smartphones can be dunked in up to 1.5 metre of water for up to 30 minutes making them much more water resistant.\n\nEven the iPhone 7 comes with IP67 water resistance, which while not as good as IP68, still allows you to immerse the phone in water. The Nokia 8 on the other hand is only protected against light splashes of water. Nokia claims that in order to achieve a higher IP rating, they would have had to make trade-offs with the design that they were not willing to take.\n\nWireless charging\n\nThe lack of wireless charging in the Nokia 8 is a bit disappointing. Many smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 feature the 'Qi' wireless charging standard which allows the smartphone to be charged wirelessly when placed on a wireless charging pad.\n\nWhile wireless charging has not taken off that much as of now, many people are big fans of the feature. Also, wireless charging might become mainstream in the coming months with Apple set to include the feature in the upcoming iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 8.\n\nBezels in 2017\n\nWhile the Nokia 8 looks very sleek and classy, it does not come with a bezel-less design seen in recent flagships such as the Samsung Galaxy S8 or the LG G6. The bezels on top and bottom are quite substantial in a day and age where smartphone design is moving towards edge-to-edge displays and minimal screen to body ratios. Even the upcoming iPhone 8 is expected to come with a striking bezel-less design.\n\nStereo speakers\n\nConsidering that the Nokia 8 comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack and audio centric features like OZO Audio, it is disappointing that the smartphone does not come with stereo speakers.\n\nImaging, audio and video has always been the strong points of Nokia and the company could have really capitalised on the same in a way that HTC has done with the U11. Stereo speakers, good earphones out of the box and audio features like Dolby ATMOS would have gone a long way in helping the Nokia 8 stand out from the crowd.\n\nSay no to Hybrid SIM slots\n\nNo one likes a Hybrid SIM slot. What is the point of making a person choose between expanding storage or using his secondary SIM card? Considering how much HMD Global stresses on the importance of a stress free user experience, the use of a Hybrid SIM Slot on the Nokia 8, which basically holds a user to ransom, is very puzzling.\n\nAlso Read: Nokia 8 launched: Ozo Audio, Zeiss camera, good design are 3 of its top 8 features", "id": "9816333", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Nokia 8: The good and bad about this flagship Android phone", "image": "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/nokia-8_559_081817083402.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Operating system"}, "id": "307345", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics display resolution"}, "id": "312179", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel density"}, "id": "317242", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}, "id": "329085", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inductive charging"}, "id": "345265", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 808 PureView"}, "id": "450512", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_808_PureView"}, {"label": {"eng": "S60 (software platform)"}, "id": "456644", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S60_(software_platform)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia Lumia 1020"}, "id": "525752", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_1020"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia N95"}, "id": "687845", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N95"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft Lumia"}, "id": "1271128", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Lumia"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 197, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 521, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 785, "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Store Fixtures", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Store_Fixtures"}], "time": "03:35:00"}

Historical significance aside, does the Nokia 8 represent the return to form that legions of Nokia fans have been waiting for? Well, it certainly looks and feels a whole lot like a 2017 flagship and like many flagships, it has a killer feature to set itself apart. Let's dive right in.\n\nAs Nokia has been known to do in the past, they're putting the major emphasis on the camera - or should I say cameras - and the addition of some unique tricks should make it a great choice for content creators and the Instagram generation. HMD themselves have described the Nokia 8 as the 'ultimate device for documenting your life', which will certainly appeal to a specific audience.\n\nBut will that be enough to compete with existing heavy hitters?\n\nFor those not in the know, HMD Global is a Finnish company that acquired the Nokia brand license just eight months ago and has already given us the Nokia 3, 5 and 6. This is their first stab at a real flagship though, and having just reviewed the Nokia 5, I was eager to see how a high end model would hold up and whether HMD would be able to fly the flag proudly for the Nokia brand (no pun intended!).\n\nTo look at, the Nokia 8 is off to a good start. The Nokia 8 has most of the hallmarks of a modern flagship, while continuing the design language of the last three models. It has an attractive and very slim all-aluminum design with an average thickness of 7.3mm. It's 4.6mm at its thinnest point and 7.9mm at its thickest.\n\nThe design supposedly curves like this in order to pack maximum performance into a sleek body and HMD says you 'won't find a straight line' in the design. The Nokia 8 comes in matte silver, matte blue, polished blue and an eye-grabbing polished copper, colors which adorn the back of the device but not the front.\n\nOn the front is a 5.3-inch QHD 2,560 x 1,440 IPS LCD display with 700 nits of brightness. It certainly looked very vibrant, bright and crisp in my brief testing period (admittedly only indoors). There's also a fingerprint sensor around the front on an indented home button - which is my personally preferred placement, but your mileage may vary.\n\nWhile rather stunning from the rear, the Nokia 8 is also something of a fingerprint magnet and is very slippery. Those bezels are also starting to look a little bit like last year compared to some other top-of-the-range phones now available.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is also not waterproof but rather only splash-proof with an IP54 rating. That's something that some users have come to expect from flagships (much like bezel-less displays) so this might be a blow for some. While the Nokia 8 is a great looking phone, it's not Galaxy S8 great...\n\nSpecs-wise, the Nokia 8 puts up a good showing and is able to trade blows with other flagships. It's powered by a 2.45 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and is backed up by 4 GB of RAM. This duo should make it more than capable of handling even the most demanding tasks.\n\nWhat might also help out here is some advanced cooling that makes use of a copper pipe and graphite shielding in order to disperse heat evenly across the phone. That means there should be no 'hot spot' under stress which will reportedly allow you to push the performance harder for longer.\n\nAnother thoughtful design choice was placing the antennae at the top and bottom of the phone, which should prevent them from getting covered by your hand while you use it. This should also allow for some of the best signal sensitivity in the industry and potentially better battery life. We'll have to get back to you on this in the full review though.\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with 64 GB of internal storage. There will be both a single SIM and a dual SIM version, with the second SIM tray accepting an SD card to expand storage by up to 256 GB. The battery is a 3,090 mAh cell with Quick Charge 3.0 via USB Type-C, but better signal sensitivity and a stripped-down Android experience means this should last you a decent amount of time.\n\nYou can expect an entirely clean Android experience from the Nokia 8 and Nokia promises owning one will be one of the fastest ways to get Android O.\n\nWhich brings us to software. You can expect an entirely clean Android experience (Android 7.1.1 out of the box) with no additional customization or bloatware. Everything from the dialer and keyboard to the contacts uses Google's Mobile Services and HMD explains that it wouldn't have been adding anything by making changes 'just to be different'.\n\nThe stock Android experience also means that the device will receive quicker updates; Nokia promises that owning the Nokia 8 will be one of the fastest ways to get Android O in your hands. Reportedly, the new OS is already being tested on the handset. Personally, I quite like to see customizations from OEMs to add a little unique flavour to the experience, but I know I'm largely in the minority there.\n\nSaving the best for last, the star of the show here is the camera. The Nokia 8 camera is the result of a partnership between HMD and Zeiss and is the core experience the phone is designed around.\n\nThe rear shooter utilizes two sensors: one color and one monochrome. The two images are then combined into a single shot with greater contrast using 'Image Fusion Technology'. This is essentially what we have seen from several other handsets recently, such as the Honor 9 and Huawei P10. There's also a two-tone flash and both apertures are f/2.0.\n\nBoth rear sensors are 13 MP, but in a unique twist, so too is the front-facing camera which, in fact, utilizes the exact same camera module. That means you also get auto focus, which is another rare feature for a selfie-camera (though it was something we also saw in the S8, slightly dodgy though the implementation there was). The reasoning behind this is to support what the company sees as the Nokia 8's 'killer feature': the 'bothie'.\n\nBoth rear sensors are 13 MP, but in a unique twist, so too is the front-facing camera, which also has auto focus.\n\nNokia wants this phone to be the 'ultimate device for telling your story'. Thus, it's bothie feature allows users to snap photos or record video using footage from both the front and rear cameras, split down the middle 50/50.\n\nThis 'bothie' mode is intended to allow users to 'tell the whole story'. Whether shooting in this mode or just recording regular video, both can be streamed directly to Facebook Live or YouTube natively from the camera app. I found the Nokia 8 camera to be a good shooter capable of some detailed, contrasty shots, but I was unable to get the photos off the device, so we'll need more time to test before we can make a final verdict.\n\nI was a little disappointed not to see more features in the camera app (which was developed in-house) and particularly at the lack of manual settings. Though perhaps you'll be able to tweak these with a third party solution, as with the Google Pixel.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is the first time we've seen Ozo Audio on a mobile device, which is usually reserved for Hollywood VR cameras.\n\nWhat also makes the Nokia 8 a good choice for content creators is top-tier audio recording, with the phone using Ozo Audio. This is an audio solution found in VR cameras previously only used by Hollywood and is the first time we've seen it on a mobile device.\n\nUsing multiple microphones, it can capture a high dynamic range and record binaural audio. This means that someone watching your Facebook livestream with headphones will be able to hear stereo sound with no need to own specific software themselves. In theory, the audio quality should be able to match the video when capturing your story on the move and if you're someone who enjoys live streaming, this will be a big boon.\n\nFor a killer feature, I'm not sure that the bothie mode is really anything that couldn't be accomplished on any other device with the right app (*cough* gimmick *cough*), but having the feature so readily available means that more users will be likely to try it and it is a good way to showcase what the phone is really all about.\n\nWhether bothie video becomes something content creators will adopt into their videos will remain to be seen. I personally don't see how having my gurning mug take up half the screen is going to add value to my videos... but your mileage may vary there.\n\nMore to the point though, a 13 MP front-facing camera with auto focus is a compelling feature and one that will no doubt appeal to vloggers, backpackers or anyone else who enjoys turning the camera on themselves. And when you couple that with the sleek design, the 'pure' Android experience and the top of the range specs, I'm sure there will be a large audience for the phone.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will be available globally on September 6 for a price of 599 EUR (details on US pricing to come). We'll have the full review ready for you then, so we can find out if this is a truly competitive flagship from Nokia and whether the Nokia 8 really is the ultimate phone to document your life with.", "id": "9544740", "details": {"liCnt": 20, "gpCnt": 5}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Hands-on with the Nokia 8", "image": "http://cdn04.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Nokia-8-Feature-Image.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 8792, "date": "2017-09-06", "amb": false, "textEnd": 8803}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Instagram"}, "id": "303287", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}, "id": "308708", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dual SIM"}, "id": "322106", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_SIM"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook features"}, "id": "332330", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_features"}, {"label": {"eng": "IP Code"}, "id": "405233", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "18:48:00"}

With the launch of the first Nokia branded Android flagship, the company has put an end to the rumors and leaks those have been hitting the web all this while.\n\nUnlike the other Nokia smartphones launched earlier this year, the Nokia 8 flaunts a premium design and high-end specifications as it is the flagship smartphone launched by the company. Most details of the Nokia 8 are known to us previously via the earlier leaks and speculations. But there are many new features on the Nokia 8.\n\nStay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Design\n\nNokia 8 features an unibody design and is built using a single block of 6000 series aluminum. The pure design is claimed to be refined through a 40-stage process of machining, anodizing and polishing to give it a premium finish. The smartphone measures 7.3mm in thickness on an average.\n\nSpecifications\n\nNokia 8 bestows a 5.3-inch IPS 2K resolution display with the Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection on top. Under its hood, the smartphone makes use of a Snapdragon 835 SoC paired with 4GB RAM. There is 64GB default memory space that can be expanded up to 256GB using a microSD card. The device gets the power from a 3090mAh battery with the Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 support. The connectivity features on board include 4G LTE, Bluetooth 5.0, dual SIM support in select markets, 3.5mm audio jack and USB Type-C port.\n\nCamera\n\nThe highlight of Nokia 8 is its dual-rear camera setup. HMD Global and Carl Zeiss announced their partnership in the last month, stirring rumors that the Nokia 8 will feature the camera technology from the latter. Likewise, the Nokia 8 comes with a 13MP dual-lens rear camera setup for clicking photos in RGB and monochrome. The dual camera setup comes with OIS, PDAF, IR range finder and f/2.0 aperture. Up front, the Nokia flagship smartphone features a 13MP selfie camera with PDAF, f/2.0 aperture and display flash.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe Nokia 8 runs on stock Android like the other Nokia smartphones in the market. The device has been launched with Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box. HMD has already assured that the Nokia smartphones will receive OS support for two years so we can expect the Android O update to be rolled out to the Nokia 8 in the coming months.\n\nOther features\n\nBesides these technical specifications, the Nokia 8 comes with other features such as Liquid Cooling, Dual-Sight and Nokia OZO Audio. Also, the smartphone has the IP54 rating that makes it splash proof. The presence of Nokia OZO Audio was already tipped by the rumors and speculations and it captures spatial audio with the help of 4 or more microphones (if your smartphone has these many microphones). The Dual-Sight feature lets you capture images via both the front and back cameras at the same time in split screen and also live stream using the dual rear camera lenses. Liquid Cooling keeps the Nokia 8 cool under any circumstances.\n\nPrice and availability\n\nThe Nokia 8 has been launched at \u20ac599 (approx. Rs. 45,000).

This will probably bag you the 64GB model, with the firm also tipped to launch a more expensive 128GB variant.\n\nHowever, a Scandinavian retailer is claiming that the Nokia 9 will arrive slapped with a less expensive \u20ac589 (around \u00a3520) price tag.\n\nLatest news\n\n9/8/17: A new leak via Chinese social media website Baidu, which appears to show the 'About Device' screen on the phone, has revealed that the Nokia 8 will sport - as expected - a Snapdragon 835 CPU, 4GB RAM, an Adreno 540 GPU and Android 7.1 Nougat, debunking previous talk of the handset being among the first devices to run Android 8.0. The display is listed as having a QHD resolution with a pixel density of 559ppi, and the leak reveals the handset's 13MP front-facing camera.\n\n4/8/17: A Geekbench listing for a Nokia device, codenamed 'Unknown Heart', hints that the upcoming Nokia 8 could be the first phone to launch running Android 8.0. Confirming the phone as flagship devices, the listing also points to 4GB RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset.\n\n1/8/18: Nokia's soon-to-be-launched flagship might not be as expensive as first thought. A 'reliable source' has told Mobilissimo that Vodafone Romania will flog the Nokia 8 for \u20ac517.42 (about \u00a3465), cheaper than the previously-rumoured \u20ac749 SIM-free price tag.\n\n25/7/17: HMD Global has confirmed that it will unveil the Nokia 8 at an event in London on 16 August. Details remain thin, but the announcement will take place at 7.30pm UK time.\n\n20/7/17: HMD Global's official website in China has posted an official image of the Nokia 8, which suggests that it could launch later today. The listing (below) appears to match up with previous leaks, and shows the handset housed in a blue chassis, with top and bottom bezels and a physical home button, which likely will feature a baked-in fingerprint scanner.\n\n18/7/17: Evan Blass at VentureBeat has posted the first official-looking image of the Nokia 8, 'confirming' that it'll be HMD's first Android phone to sport a dual-lens camera with Carl Zeiss optics. The same report adds weight to earlier talk of a 5.3in display, Snapdragon 835 processor and Android 7.1.1 Nougat.\n\n17/7/17: A report from a from a Scandinavian retailer claims that HMD Global's next flagship - which it is referring to as the Nokia 8 - will be made official on 31 July. The same source claims that the handset will fetch \u20ac589 (around \u00a3520) when it goes on sale, less than the \u20ac749 price tag previously mooted.\n\n13/7/17: A leak on Baidu has reinforced previous speculation and 'confirmed' that the Nokia 8 will pack a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, while two lower-spec models - the Nokia 9 and Nokia 8 - will pack Snapdragon 630 and 660 CPUs, respectively.\n\n6/7/17: HMD Global has announced that Nokia has rekindled its decades-old relationship with Zeiss, hinting that the upcoming Nokia 8 could be the firm's first Android phone to pack Carl Zeiss optics.\n\n21/6/17: A listing at the FCC, spotted by Phone Arena, has hinted that Nokia has canned the 4GB version of the Nokia 8, and now plans to release 6GB and 8GB configurations.\n\n30/5/17: The Nokia 8 has been sighted at Geekbench, and the listing seems to suggest that the smartphone will be among the first to ship with 8GB RAM, despite previous rumours it would pack 4GB. Performance-wise though, the handset - codenamed 'Unknown Heart' - didn't fare too well, earning a 615 single-core score and 1116 multi-core score.\n\n22/5/17: An image of the Nokia 8 clad in a bulky blue protective case (above) has appeared online courtesy of Frandroid. It gives us our first proper look at Nokia's upcoming Android flagship, and all-but-confirms that it'll pack a 5.3in QHD display, a 13MP dual camera set-up, a USB-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack.\n\nThe prototype also appears to be running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, paired with 4GB RAM and 64GB built-in storage.\n\n15/3/17: Another leak has surfaced, and debunks speculation that the Nokia 8 will feature a high-end Qualcomm chip. Instead, it points to a mid-range Snapdragon 660 SoC.\n\n8/3/17: A mega-leak has revealed that the Nokia 8 will pack Qualcomm's 10nm Snapdragon 835 processor, a full-metal chassis and a camera weighing in at \"at least\" 23MP, which could come equipped with the Carl Zeiss technology seen in the now-defunct Nokia Lumia 920.\n\n14/2/17: Turns out, the Nokia 8 won't launch at MWC after all, with tipster Evan Blass revealing that the firm will instead focus on a new Nokia 3310.\n\n21/11/16: Nokia has confirmed that it will make its long-awaited comeback at MWC, hinting that the Nokia 8 could make its debut in February 2017. \u00b5", "id": "9451689", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 price, release date and specs: HMD Global to launch flagship device later today

(Nokia )\n\nEver since HMD Global brought the Nokia brand back to the smartphone market, people have been waiting for a premium Nokia smartphone with top-of-the-line specifications. So far, the company has launched the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 smartphones, which have been pretty much on par with the competition. Finally, Nokia on Thursday announced its flagship smartphone, the Nokia 8, which will take on a range of premium flagship smartphones such as the OnePlus 5, Honor 8 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S8.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is priced at \u20ac599 (Rs 46,000 approximately) and will go on sale in select markets from next month. There is no official word on the availability of the smartphone in India as yet.\n\nThe Nokia 8 doesn't look very different from the Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 smartphones but comes with subtle improvements such as curvier corners and better built. Featuring an aluminium body, the smartphone measures 151.5mm x 73.7mm x 7.9mm. This makes the Nokia 8 slightly slimmer than the Samsung Galaxy S8, which measures 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0mm. The Nokia 8 comes with IP54 certification, which makes it splash proof. The Samsung Galaxy S8, on the other hand, has a better IP68 dust and water-resistance rating. The Nokia 8 is available in Polished Blue, Tempered Blue, Steel, Polished Copper colour options.\n\nOne of the key highlights of the Nokia 8 is the Carl Zeiss cameras. It may be recalled Nokia and Carl Zeiss have been partners in the past as well. The first smartphone under the partnership between the two was the Nokia N90 in 2004. The Nokia N90 was rated as one of the best camera phones of its time. Later, the duo partnered for phones like the Nokia N95 and Nokia 808 PureView, which featured an overwhelming 41-megapixel sensor.\n\nIn the Android era, the Nokia-Carl Zeiss partnership brings a dual-camera setup featuring two 13-megapixel sensors. While the first sensor brings Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) and colour, the second one brings Monochrome. The setup is quite similar to what we have seen on the smartphones like the Huawei P9. Other camera features include PDAF, f/2/0 aperture and dual-tone flash. For selfies, the Nokia 8 comes with a 13-megapixel front camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, and display flash support. The camera can shoot videos in 4K resolution as well.\n\nWith the Nokia 8, the company has introduced a new feature called \"bothie\", which allows users to access the rear and front cameras at the same time. The smartphone also allows users to natively live stream videos from the device to Facebook and YouTube.\n\nAnother major highlight of the smartphone is spatial audio technology. Based on Nokia's critically acclaimed OZO audio technology, this feature allows the smartphone to channel sound in all directions as well as record high quality sound.\n\nNokia 8 Specifications\n\nAs said earlier, the Nokia 8 checks all the boxes for a top-end premium smartphone. It comes with a 5.3-inch IPS QHD display with 2560 x 1440, Corning Gorilla Glass 5 and 2.5D glass. The smartphone runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat out-of-the-box. Just like in the past, Nokia has promised to deliver regular firmware and OS updates with the Nokia 8. Nokia claims it will be providing the updates on the same day Google rolls out them.\n\nThe smartphone is powered by Qualcomm's top-end Snapdragon 835 processor coupled with 4 GB LPPDDR4X of RAM. It comes with 64GB of storage and supports expandable storage up to 256GB via a microSD card.\n\nConnectivity options include 4G, dual-SIM support (hybrid SIM slot), USB Type-C and NFC among others.

However, despite all that, the smartphone still does not have what it takes to beat the Galaxy Note 8 and the iPhone 8.\n\nThe Nokia 8 looks similar but not entirely identical to the Nokia 6, confirming the leaked Nokia 8 design that made the rounds online last month. Notable changes include a smaller 5.3-inch display compared to the 5.5-inch display of the Nokia 6, an improved resolution of 2,560 x 1,440, and an always-on display at the top of the screen that displays information such as the date, time, battery status, and notifications.\n\nThe smartphone will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 with 4 GB of RAM and will offer 64 GB of internal storage with expandable memory through a microSD card slot. The Gloss Blue variant, however, offers 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage.\n\nHMD Global promised that it will release Nokia 8 Android security updates on the same day that Google rolls them out and that the smartphone will be among the first devices to be upgraded to Android O.\n\nThe Nokia 8 price is currently set at 599 euros, which is equivalent to about $700. HMD Global has not specified any plans to bring the smartphone to the United States, but it will likely do so despite the looming shadows of the Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone 8.\n\nHMD Global is promoting three unique selling points for the smartphone, with these Nokia 8 features the first for any Android smartphone.\n\nIn July, HMD Global struck an exclusive deal with Zeiss to equip Nokia smartphones with Zeiss optics, and the Nokia 8 is the first benefactor of that arrangement with both the front and rear cameras co-developed with Zeiss.\n\nTaking advantage of the Nokia 8's amazing cameras is another new feature named Dual-Sight, which uses the front and rear cameras to capture a so-called bothie. The term, coined by HMD Global, refers to an image that combines the picture taken by the front and rear cameras at the same time.\n\nLastly, the Nokia 8 comes with Nokia OZO Audio technology, which will offer users a 3D audio experience optimized for headphones and spatial audio playback devices.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is certainly a very capable smartphone worthy of flagship status, but being able to shoot bothies is likely not enough to draw loyal Samsung and Apple users away from the Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone 8.\n\nThe significance of the Nokia 8, however, is that it shows that Nokia is back in the game. The Nokia 8 innovations show that HMD Global is at least trying to make a splash in what was becoming a boring market.", "id": "9702177", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 Offers 'Bothies' And Same Day Android Security Updates, But It Won't Beat The Galaxy Note 8, iPhone 8", "image": "http://images.techtimes.com/data/images/full/313068/nokia-8-bothies.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy Note (original)"}, "id": "321823", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Note_(original)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "S60 (software platform)"}, "id": "456644", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S60_(software_platform)"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 201, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 521, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "09:20:00"}

The Nokia 8 release date is set for Sept. 6 in select markets, and it will sell for 599 Euros or around $700 in the United States.\n\nThe Nokia 8 features a 5.3-inch IPS display with QHD (1,440 x 2,560) screen resolution. The handset features a design that closely resembles HMD Global's most recent Nokia Android smartphones with its metal body and those thick top and bottom bezels. The handset still features capacitive back and menu buttons and the front-mounted fingerprint sensor.\n\nAlthough the handset's design may seem dated compared to other \"bezel-less\" flagships, its internals and set of features are truly flagship-worthy. The Nokia 8 is being powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor along with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. There's also a gloss blue variant which comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, according to 9To5Google. Storage is also expandable through its hybrid microSD/SIM card tray. The device is packing a 3,090mAh battery, which also supports QuickCharge 3.0 via USB Type-C port.\n\nWhere the Nokia 8 truly shines is with its inclusion of a set of dual cameras on its back. Both cameras feature 13-megapixel sensors, but one is for color and one is for monochrome (B&W). These cameras work together to produce sharp and vibrant images. The Nokia 8's camera software combines the B&W and color photos to produce a single image.\n\nBoth cameras are also outfitted with Zeiss lenses with a wide f/2.0 aperture. The Nokia 8's dual cameras also support optical image stabilization and phase detection autofocus. It's a bit too early to tell how the dual-camera setup on the Nokia 8 will perform against its rivals, but judging on specs alone, it seems like it has a good chance.\n\nAlthough the the Nokia 8's dual cameras may already seem impressive, the same can also be said of its front-facing shooter. The front-facing camera also features a 13-megapixel sensor and a wide f/2.0 aperture lens. That may already be enough for selfie enthusiasts to pick up the Nokia 8, but HMD Global has also included support for a feature that's nicknamed \"bothie.\" This feature's proper name is Dual-Sight, and it allows users to take photos and stream video with the front and back cameras at the same time, according to Ars Technica.\n\nVideos and photos taken using Nokia 8's Dual-Sight feature will come in a 16:9 aspect ratio, so that it's equally split down the middle to show both views. HMD says that users will be able to stream live to Facebook and YouTube using the Dual-Sight format.\n\nOn top of all those camera features, the Nokia 8 also comes with Ozo Audio. The Nokia 8 has three microphones that allow users to record 360-degree audio. Ozo Audio may have been a technology taken by HMD from Nokia's Ozo 360-degree video camera.\n\nOn the software side of things, the Nokia 8 runs the pure and latest version of Android Nougat. This means that there's no heavy skin or other extra software features added by Nokia. This also means that the Nokia 8 will get software updates as soon as possible. HMD Global also said that the Nokia 8 will be one of the fastest ways for users to get Android O.\n\nHMD Global hasn't set a specific release date yet for the U.S., nor did it confirm pricing. All we have now is its European price of 599 Euros, which is around $700. Android Authority pointed out that phones are typically cheaper in the U.S., so it's possible that the Nokia 8 might cost somewhere between $600 and $650.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has been officially announced by HMD Global.

(Image: Siddhartha Sharma/ Newa18) Nokia which is a brand that's now owned by HMD Global announced their flagship device for the year 2017 in London. Keeping it simple the company has named this device Nokia 8. The Nokia 8 comes with a 6000 series aluminium body and has four colour options to it. Two are glossy finish and two are matte finish. The colours that are available are Polished Copper, Polished Blue, Tempered blue and Steel.\n\nThe device also comes with OZO audio that let's you capture surround audio quality for video recording. The Nokia 8 sports a 5.3-inch 2K display with brightness levels as high as 700 nits. It also gets Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection and a 3090 mAh battery. This is a flagship device so it gets the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC and 4GB RAM. The device will be available in both dual-SIM and single-SIM options depending on markets. There is a 13-megapixel dual camera setup on the Nokia 8 with one sensor being RGB and the other being Monochrome. The front camera is also rated at 13-megapixels.\n\nOne look at the Nokia 8 and you know that the heritage belongs to the Finnish brand. It has a solid build quality and is slim too. The average slimness being 7.3mm. At it's highest point which is a tiny camera bump at the back the phone sports a slimness of 7.9mm. The 5.3 inch display is bright enough for both indoor and outdoor usage. The device will appeal to people looking for a premium phone option in the market.\n\nOne of the major USP of the device is the dual-camera setup at the back of the Nokia 8. The modules come with optical image stabilisation and also a laser range finder to make the device focus fast on moving objects.\n\nThe dual-camera's and the front camera on the Nokia 8 also use Zeiss optics. The dual-camera setup comes with regular things link a Bokeh effect and an effective resolution of 13-megapixel for an image with an aspect ratio of 4:3. The camera is also capable of shooting 4K videos. What's new on the Nokia 8's dual-camera setup is a Dual-Sight camera mode. What it does is that it splits the display into two and give you frames for both the rear and the front camera.\n\nThis makes the person who's capturing an image or a video also participate in capturing memories. Another interesting thing is that you can also live stream your video recording on Facebook as well as on YouTube right from the camera app. This is what guys at HMD say is the birth of Bothie. The camera is quite capable in terms of capturing images and recording videos. Also the front camera on the Nokia 8 also sports the same module that's on the primary camera. This ensures selfies that are as crisp and detailed as images that are captured from the rear camera of this device.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is a smartphone that comes with stock android on it. out of the box users will get Android 7.1.1 Nougat OS and HMD also says that this will be one of the first devices to get Android O update as well.\n\nWhat Do We Think?\n\nNokia 8 looks like a very promising device from HMD and Nokia. The device is expected to launch in global markets in the month of September. The India launch of the Nokia 8 will be somewhere in the first week of October 2017. The biggest concerning factor here is that HMD says that the average price of the Nokia 8 will be at 599 euros, that's basically roughly Rs 45,000. If that's the price point for Nokia 8 in India, it will most definitely face a tough competition from the likes of OnePlus 5 and also Samsung Galaxies and Pixels of the world.\n\nThere are a few things on the camera front as well that HMD needs to work on with regards to Nokia 8 like, fixed focus and RAW image option. Having said that closer to the India launch these things should be order for the Nokia 8. Nokia 8 did impress us with what it can do with it's optics. Also this is a phone that many stock Android lovers will like to consider on their list. For us initially the Nokia 8 left us with mixed bag emotions for it.\n\nWatch this space for the full review of the Nokia 8.\n\n(The author attended the Nokia 8 unveiling event in London on the invite of HMD India)", "id": "9615067", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 First Impressions Review: Will You Buy it For Rs 45,000 in October?", "image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/08/Nokia-8-review.jpeg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3261, "date": "2017-10-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3273}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "69", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}, "id": "312003", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (robot)"}, "id": "316849", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(robot)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dual SIM"}, "id": "322106", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_SIM"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}, "id": "368054", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 670, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 917, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Video", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Video"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1380, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques and Styles", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques_and_Styles"}], "time": "02:26:00"}

Notably, the Nokia 2 was spotted recently on the FCC website revealing the design and few specs. The 3G variant of Nokia 3310 was also leaked tipping that its release could happen soon.\n\nNokia 8 believed to be the flagship smartphone to be launched by HMD is said to feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC and arrive with a dual lens rear camera setup at its rear with the Carl Zeiss branding. The dual lens camera is said to feature different shooting modes, suggests a recent leak of the camera interface. The Nokia 8 is likely to feature a 13MP front camera for selfies and there are claims that the selfie camera can shoot in 4K resolution.\n\nWhen it comes to the Nokia 2, the smartphone is said to be the most entry-level offering to be launched by HMD Global. It is said that this smartphone will make use of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 processor under its hood. The device is also likely to flaunt a 5-inch display with HD 720p resolution. A few days back, four variants of the Nokia 2 were spotted on FCC.\n\nBesides these two smartphones, HMD Global is also expected to unveil the 3G variant of the Nokia 3310 feature phone at the event today. The drawback of the Nokia 3310 (2017) is that it supports only 2G networks. The device was recently confirmed by an Irish retailer on Twitter and also passed the FCC certification tipping its imminent launch.\n\nNokia 8 38,000(Expected Price) Specs Competitors Images +57", "id": "9427408", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8, Nokia 2 and Nokia 3310 3G variant to be unveiled today by HMD", "image": "https://www.gizbot.com/img/2017/08/nokia8nokia2andnokia33103gvarianttobeunveiledtodaybyhmd-16-1502868940.jpg?16082017131602", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}, "id": "308589", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}, "id": "312003", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}, {"label": {"eng": "Federal Communications Commission"}, "id": "316305", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "2G"}, "id": "319918", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G"}, {"label": {"eng": "3G"}, "id": "319925", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G"}, {"label": {"eng": "720p"}, "id": "322948", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia phone series"}, "id": "513559", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_phone_series"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "07:46:00"}

We've posted the notes for you below straight from Sony.\n\nFamilies on PlayStation Network\n\nWhen the update is live, it will make it easier to set up PSN accounts for children and customize parental control settings for each user.\n\nFamily Manager, parents/guardians and child accounts: Each family on PSN will now have a Family Manager which can promote another adult in the family to be a parent or guardian which can customize parental control levels of each child account. Individual parental controls will also be available.\n\nThe Favorite Groups tab will be replaced by a tab called Custom List on the Friends screen. Here, users can create and edit custom lists of friends when can be arranged into specific groups. These can be based on games played or groups such as teammates, or just friends in general. Game invites can be sent to groups as well.\n\nMusic can already be shared on PS4 using Twitter and Facebook via Spotify and PlayStation Music, but once the update is applied, individual tracks can be shared by sending a message on message on PS4. Shared tracks can be listened to directly from the message or through the Spotify app from the PS Messages app on mobile and added to a playlist.\n\nNotifications updates\n\nNew setting allows the user to disable pop-up notifications while watching a movie or TV show on PS4. This setting is set to off by default but can be enabled if the user wishes. The update allows for turning off message previews on pop-up notifications. Turning the setting off the pop-up notification will hide the message senders' online ID showing a generic user icon and message instead. The pop-up color can also be changed from white to black.\n\nQuick Menu updates: The Notifications tab, which shows download progress or new invitations, can now be accessed directly from the Quick Menu without leaving a game.

If you were old enough to own a cell phone in the early 90s or 2000s, odds are you owned a Nokia phone at some point, even if you skipped the Windows Phone era entirely. For many Android fans, our imagination has run wild over the years envisioning what exactly a Nokia-powered Android flagship might be like. It's been a long time coming, but we no longer have to wonder anymore -- the long-daydreamed Nokia Android flagship is finally upon us!\n\nAfter giving us several entry and mid-range Nokia handsets, today HMD Global finally unveiled the long anticipated Nokia 8. Here are the key takeaways you'll want to know about the newly unveiled Nokia 8:\n\nIt's all about the camera. In an ever-competitive marketplace, Nokia needs to bring more than nostalgia to the table if they really want to see sales success with their first Android flagship. Nokia's big play here comes in the form of a partnership with Zeiss. This relationship brings us a dual 13 MP rear camera setup that combines a color and monochrome sensor, shots from which are combined into a single shot with greater contrast using \"Image Fusion Technology\". The front camera is 13 MP, and includes auto-focus and actually utilizes the same camera module as the rear configuration. Other camera features include two-tone flash, apertures of f/2.0, and a special mode called \"Boothie\".\n\nNokia's bothie feature allows users to snap photos or record video using footage from both the front and rear cameras, split down the middle 50/50. Whether shooting in this mode or recording regular video, the footage can then be streamed directly to Facebook Live or YouTube natively from the camera app.\n\nSound recording quality is also a win here. It's not just a great camera, the recording mics are also superb with the Nokia 8, thanks to the use of Ozo Audio. This solution previously was found in 360-degree VR cameras used by Hollywood and other professionals, and is a first for mobile. Basically the phone uses multiple microphones to capture high dynamic range and record binaural audio, which means that you'll get high-quality stereo sound when you go to share the video with your friends, family, or YouTube/Facebook fans.\n\nSpec-wise, it stands reasonably well against other 2017 flagships. The Nokia 8 is powered by a Snapdragon 835 with 4 GB RAM. It also has a 5.3-inch QHD display, 64 GB storage, microSD support, and a 3,090 mAh battery. When it comes to core specs, the Nokia 8 certainly holds its own when compared to flagships like the OnePlus 5, Samsung Galaxy S8, and others.\n\nAt the same time, Nokia's design decisions are somewhat dated. The Nokia 8 might have great under-the-hood specs but it sits things out when it comes to a lot of 2017's big tech trends. There's no waterproofing here, with just IP45 splash resistance. There's also no 2:1 display like the G6 or S8, and the bezels here are also pretty big. Lastly, the Nokia 8 has physical buttons in a world where even Samsung is switching things up.\n\nOne trend that Nokia does embrace? As already mentioned, it has a rear-camera, and one that - on paper at least - looks very impressive.\n\nAbout as pure as Android gets, outside of AOSP. Even Google's Pixel line and the OnePlus 5 add at least a few tweaks to the pure Android formula. Not Nokia.\n\nNokia defaults to Google's vision of Android in almost every aspect from settings to default apps, and beyond. Nokia also is said to already be testing Android O on their phones with a promise of quick updates. We've heard \"quick update\" promises from other brands that have failed to deliver, so we recommend at least a little healthy skepticism. However, sticking with near-pure Android certainly will make quick updates an easier reality for Nokia than a brand like Samsung.\n\nFour colors from day one. The Nokia 8 will launch in four colors - Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue, and Steel. Keep in mind some of these colors could be specific to certain regions or carriers.\n\nIt's not a 'budget' flagship, and it's coming next month. In many ways the Nokia 8's spec sheet somewhat reads similar to the OnePlus 5, but unlike that device, the Nokia 8 is priced similarly to more expensive flagships. Nokia's flagship will debut on September 6th globally for a price of 599 Euros. While the US price tag hasn't been revealed yet, the European pricing translates to around $700. Unless the US price ends up much lower than the European, that means it might be a bit cheaper than the iPhone or S8, but it is within similar range to HTC, LG, and several other premium flagships.\n\nWhile the key points above give you a pretty solid idea of what Nokia is bringing to the table, if you want to know even more -- we have your back!", "id": "9544755", "details": {"liCnt": 32, "gpCnt": 34}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 is here: the company's first true Android flagship", "image": "http://cdn04.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Nokia-8-prebrief-front-holding.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 4306, "date": "2017-09-06", "amb": false, "textEnd": 4319}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Windows Phone"}, "id": "319197", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook features"}, "id": "332330", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_features"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "18:48:00"}

This sleek new Android smartphone uses a milled and tapered aluminium unibody design that enables the device to be just 4.6mm thin at the edge with an average thickness of 7.3mm, yet it packs a QHD 5.3-inch touchscreen with Gorilla Glass 5, powerful Snapdragon 835 processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage (up to 256GB microSD card support). And while we expected the slim body to indicate Nokia has skimped on the battery size, the actual 3,090mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 is actually very decent.\n\nEver since HMD Global bought out the Nokia name, they've taken pains to ensure that their Nokia devices maintain the innovative features that the traditional Nokia (before Microsoft bought the brand) mobiles were known for, and the Nokia 8 comes packed with three Nokia 'world's-firsts'. It is the first new generation Nokia device to feature ZEISS optical camera lenses - restoring a collaboration that saw iconic digital-photography smartphones like the Nokia N90 and Nokia 808 PureView.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will also be the first Nokia smartphone to use Dual-Sight video that enables users to livestream from both the front and back cameras simultaneously in real time to Facebook adn YouTube, creating a split screen visual for both photos and videos.\n\nFinally, with the Nokia 8 the brand is returning to its audio prowess with the inclusion of Nokia OZO Audio, which brings spatial 360-degree sound capture for an immersive audio experience to match your 4K videos.", "id": "9779884", "details": {"liCnt": 3, "pinCnt": 3}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 brings Zeiss optics and real-time Dual-Sight livestreaming to the mobile", "image": "http://wimages.vr-zone.net/2017/08/HMD_Nokia-8_Packshot3.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Photography"}, "id": "302979", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Touchscreen"}, "id": "312182", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 808 PureView"}, "id": "450512", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_808_PureView"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia Lumia 920"}, "id": "707786", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_920"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia N90"}, "id": "1160240", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N90"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "21:25:00"}

We've already seen a few mid-range phones designed by the company, but the new Nokia 8 is the first time we've seen a flagship since the brand's return.\n\nThe phone features a dual-sensor camera, a powerful chipset and a luscious new design, so read on below to learn everything you need to know about the new Nokia 8.\n\nMore new Nokia phones: Nokia 3 | Nokia 5 | Nokia 6 | New Nokia 3310Cut to the chaseWhat is it? A flagship Nokia phoneWhen is it out? Announced August 16, released in SeptemberWhat will it cost? Expensive at \u20ac599 (about \u00a3550, $700, AU$890)Nokia 8 release date and priceLaunched on August 16, release coming in SeptemberSimilar price to a lot of other flagships, not as low as expectedImage 1 of 3\n\nImage 2 of 3\n\nImage 3 of 3\n\nThe Nokia 8 is coming out around the world in September this year. An exact release date for the phone is currently unclear and we should hear more in the coming weeks.\n\nWe know for certain the Nokia 8 will be coming to the UK but there's no word on whether it will be launching in the US and Australia. Once we know more we'll be sure to update with more details.\n\nNokia has announced an official price of \u20ac599 (about \u00a3550, $700, AU$890), so it's going to be on the expensive end of phones, when we had initially expected it to be a bit less than that.\n\nWatch our hands on video review to see the Nokia 8 in action\n\nNokia 8 screenA 5.3-inch screen, LCD panelA QHD resolution, equaling 554 pixels-per-inch\n\nThe Nokia 8 features a strange size screen of 5.3 inches, which we're not really used to on modern phones. It means it's a little bit bigger than the screen on the Honor 9 and a bit smaller than the OnePlus 5 display.\n\nIt has a QHD resolution though which equals 554 pixels-per-inch, which is a high resolution, especially for a screen of that size. It can also reach a brightness high of 700 nits, which should mean it's super bright and will be easy to read in bright sunlight.\n\nSadly the rumored edge-to-edge display hasn't become a reality on the Nokia 8, with a representative for HMD Global saying that was to allow space for the front-facing fingerprint scanner and a super high-res sensor in the front camera.\n\nNokia 8 designSlim metal shell design, with two different effectsComes in two shiny effects or two matte designs\n\nDesign-wise the Nokia 8 comes with a slim metal shell that is 7.9mm at its thickest point and goes down to under 5mm at the edges. It's a full-metal unibody so looks premium and has metal edges that make it look sleek overall.\n\nIt's splashproof - IP54 rated to be exact - but not waterproof, so it will be okay in a slight rain shower but we wouldn't recommend dipping this phone in the sink.\n\nThere are four different color options for the Nokia 8, two of which come with a shiny effect on the rear that are either blue or copper. There's also a less shiny matte effect version of the phone that comes in either blue or silver.\n\nThe top edge of the phone has a 3.5mm headphone port while the bottom has a USB-C connector and that's where the speaker sits too.\n\nUnder the screen there are buttons for navigation, and a fingerprint scanner in the center to help you unlock the phone quickly and securely.\n\nNokia 8 camera and batteryA dual-lens 13MP cameraMade in collaboration with ZeissA 3,090mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0\n\nThere's a dual-sensor camera on the Nokia 8, which is a first for the company and should take some much better photography than the mid-range phones we saw earlier this year.\n\nIt uses an RGB (color) 13MP sensor in tandem with a monochrome 13MP sensor and combines the images taken from each to allow for better low-light photography. The monochrome sensor should pick up more detail as it's only in black and white and should fold that into the full color image.\n\nYou'll be able to shoot with just the monochrome camera too, but expect the resolution to be a little less as it's just a 13MP sensor.\n\nThe front-facing shooter on the phone is also a 13MP sensor, which should allow for some phenomenal selfie shots. There's a camera mode that allows you to shoot from both the front and rear cameras at the same time too, which Nokia is annoyingly calling #Bothie.\n\nThe battery on the Nokia 8 doesn't sound great with it only being a 3,090mAh one, which may struggle considering the high-end spec and QHD resolution screen.\n\nThere's Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 tech in here too and it all works through the USB-C port at the bottom of the phone. Don't expect to be able to wirelessly charge the Nokia 8 though.\n\nNokia 8 internal specs and OSA Snapdragon 835 chipset4GB of RAM64GB of storage with 256GB microSD support\n\nQualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon 835 chipset is here and should mean you get a snappy experience while using the Nokia 8. That's working alongside 4GB of RAM in the phone too.\n\nStorage-wise you'll have 64GB on board while there's also microSD support of up to 256GB. The phone is also running Android 7.1.1 software and looks near enough stock, so if you've used a Google Pixel you'll know the software inside out here.\n\nWe've already got a full review of the Nokia 6", "id": "9566738", "details": {"liCnt": 5, "gpCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 release date, news and features", "image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qJhCsuu6cGARHW66Em4bpf-1200-80.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 676, "amb": false, "textEnd": 685, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-16"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Photography"}, "id": "302979", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint recognition"}, "id": "314740", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel density"}, "id": "317242", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inductive charging"}, "id": "345265", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging"}, {"label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}, "id": "360548", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model"}, {"label": {"eng": "IP Code"}, "id": "405233", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia phone series"}, "id": "513559", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_phone_series"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "21:20:00"}

Fitted with high-end components, a premium camera and a 5.3-inch OLED display, it could have enough to take on the market's biggest players.\n\nThere's still a lot of affection and interest in the Nokia brand, as the relaunch of the Nokia 3310 proved earlier this year. HMD Global is made up of ex-Nokia executives, who will be hoping that the brand's history is enough to put this on a lot of people's shopping lists.\n\nThe 5.3-inch display is just about par for the course for 2017 flagships, making use of LCD technology and running at a QHD resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. Under the hood, the Snapdragon 835 processor, Adreno 540 GPU, and 4 GB of RAM is enough to keep the most demanding phone users happy. Storage is set at 64 GB but can be expanded via microSD.\n\nOne of the phone's standout features is the 13 MP dual-lens camera with optical image stabilization, built with Carl Zeiss optics - that's a partnership that harkens back to the days of Nokia Windows Mobile phones. The camera quality of those handsets was one of the few positives to come out of Nokia and Microsoft's brief partnership.\n\nPhoto and video quality can't be judged off a specs sheet, but the camera promises 4K video recording and a \"bothie\" mode that allows you to capture pictures or movies from both the front and rear cameras simultaneously, split-screen style (handy for those live streams, perhaps). 360-degree audio can also be recorded from the phone.\n\nAt 7.3 mm thick on average across its curved frame, the phone is almost as thin as the iPhone 7, which is no mean feat. It keeps the chunky bezels on the front though, bezels that phones like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 have been moving away from.\n\nThe phone is only splashproof, carrying an IP54 certification, and comes with a 3,090-mAh battery that should last you through the day and beyond. Again though, we'll need to reserve judgment until we've had chance to actually test a Nokia 8 out.\n\nAndroid 7.1.1 Nougat is on board, and Nokia (or rather HMD Global) says it's pretty much the stock version of the mobile OS, and that Android O will be arriving soon. Let's hope it gets updates as fast as Google's own Pixel and Nexus phones do.\n\nThe phone fits in ahead of the budget and mid-range Nokia 3, Nokia 5, and Nokia 6 handsets that have already been unveiled this year, so there's something for everyone from the rebooted brand.\n\nAs for the all-important price, it's set at \u20ac599 for when the phone goes on sale in September. That works out at around US$705 with a quick currency conversion, but as yet Nokia hasn't confirmed whether or not the phone will make its way to the United States.

From 'Bothie' cameras to Ozo Audio, here are the best features in the new device.\n\nNokia 8 flagship smartphone was launched yesterday by HMD Global at an event in London. This Nokia mobile will be available globally from September this year. The Nokia 8 is expected to be sold at an average price of Euro 599. In India, the phone is expected to be priced around Rs 45,000, when it hits stores by early October. HMD Global chief product officer Juho Sarvikas informed about the availability at the event. The Finnish company launched the device at the iconic London Tower Bridge, and the product has some top of the line specifications. One of the most interesting features in the Nokia 8 is the 'Bothie' camera. This camera setup will allow you to take pictures from both the front and the rear camera. With this feature, Nokia is clearly aiming at the live streaming and stories features currently popular on most of the social media websites. Additionally, there is OZO Audio, which will enhance your video recording, but more on that later. Here is a list of top 5 features in the Nokia device which stand out in the flagship smartphone.\n\n1. Premium build quality: The Nokia 8 device reminds of the sturdy Nokia phone of yesteryears. It has the design and aesthetics of an old Nokia device, along with modern technology. The Nokia 8 sports a 5.3-inch 2K LCD IPS display with 700 nits brightness. The phone has Gorilla Glass 5 on top and will launch with two glossy and two matte variants. There are no reduced bezels on the display, no curved edge display, which granted was not expected either. Nokia 8 has a slightly curved design, which makes the phone easy to hold and use. There's also a fingerprint resistant coating at the back. Made of 6000 series aluminium, this is one good looking flagship.\n\nCapture the world as you see it - and hear it.

Specifications: The phone comes with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. You get a standard 4GB RAM and 64GB storage which is expandable. However, HMD Global is convinced that a lack of bloatware, coupled with their clean UI gives the phone a smooth performance. The only hitch is that the front and rear camera both support 4K video recording, so we might have needed a 128GB internal storage model. Software wise, the clean UI of the Nokia 8 is an advantage, and the company claims this will be the fastest phone to get Android O updates. For fans of clean, stock Android, the new Nokia 8 will seem appealing.\n\n3. OZO Audio: Nokia 8 comes with OZO Audio, which promises to capture and playback all ambient sound on your video. It is offering 360-degree spatial audio experience in video recordings. With this, you can record 4K videos with 360-degree spatial audio with Audio Focus.\n\n4. Camera: Nokia 8 has taken the plunge into the dual-rear camera trend. It has a vertically stacked set of dual rear cameras (13MP Colour sensor with OIS + 13MP Mono sensor), and there's a front 13MP camera all well. Nokia 8 has PDAF, IR range finder, dual tone flash on the rear camera, and yes there's the Zeiss Optics branding as well that used to be standard on older Nokia phones. The native camera also supports live video streaming. Nokia 8 camera also gets a manual mode.\n\nHello #Bothie! The world's first smartphone to broadcast live with both cameras simultaneously.

Bothie: HMD Global has also added a new option of 'dual sight mode', where both the front and rear camera can be used at the time, for videos, pictures and live streams on Facebook and YouTube.", "id": "9617642", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 launched: From 'Bothie' cameras to Ozo Audio, top 5 specs and features to watch out for", "image": "http://images.financialexpress.com/2017/08/nokia-8-phone.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2057, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2072}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ceremonial ship launching"}, "id": "302960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_ship_launching"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flagship"}, "id": "320976", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tower Bridge"}, "id": "339071", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Bridge"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "05:34:00"}

Its launch marks the return of Nokia, the once dominant phone company that was pushed out by the likes of Apple and Samsung.\n\nThe new phone is the first smartphone that can simultaneously livestream a selfie while also using its main camera, called a \"both-ie\". It also has a dual lens camera, now a signature of flagship phones, and a Snapdragon 835 processor.\n\nThe Nokia 8 phone will go on sale in early September with a price of around \u20ac599 (\u00a3545). HMD is yet to confirm the UK release date and pricing.\n\nBest features\n\nThe Nokia 8 has been designed as a rival to high-end Android smartphones including the Galaxy S8, OnePlus 5 and HTC U11. It is cheaper than Samsung's \u00a3689 Galaxy S8, which currently sets the bar for Android devices.\n\nThe HMD release comes shortly before the highly anticipated launch of the iPhone 8, which is expected to cost significantly more than many other leading devices.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Nokia 8 has a 5.3-inch LCD screen with a full aluminium back, which curves slightly. It will come in four colours: polished copper, polished blue, steel and tempered blue.\n\nThe screen design keeps the function keys away from the main display, unlike the new iPhone which is expected to integrate its home button into an edge-to-edge screen.\n\nThe phone's camera bump sits flush to the back of the phone, with a slight 7.3mm raise, making its case almost entirely smooth.\n\nBoth-ie camera set up\n\nA key feature that sets the Nokia 8 apart is its camera, developed with manufacturer Zeiss. The phone has a dual lens 13MP camera on the back and a 13MP selfie camera.\n\nUnique to the Nokia 8 is the camera's both-ie technology, which lets the phone simultaneously film what is in front of the device while also recording selfie videos. This could be used for live video, such as Facebook Live or messaging apps, HMD said.\n\nIt's \"less about selfie, more about both-ie\", the company said.\n\nProcessor and battery\n\nThe phone has a Snapdragon 835 processor, and a fast-charging battery. It can charge to 50 per cent in 30 minutes, providing more than a day and a half of use, according to HMD.\n\nThe phone is fitted with specially designed cooling systems, needed due to the power consumption of the \"both-ie\" camera software.\n\nAndroid O\n\nThe Nokia 8 will initially ship Android Nougat. Google is expected to soon release its new operating system, known as Android O. HMD confirmed it is working with the tech giant to bring the new software to the latest Nokia phone as soon as it is available.\n\n\"We are committed to being one of the first with Android O,\" said Juho Sarvikas, chief product officer of HMD.\n\nSnake\n\nMuch to our disappointment, HMD said the Nokia 8 will not come with Snake, the classic mobile phone game made famous by the Nokia 3310. Although users can download and play a version of the game, it will not be pre-installed.\n\nNokia reborn?\n\nNokia's new phone is produced by HMD, a Finnish smartphone company with a licencing agreement to make devices under the Nokia brand.\n\nHMD led the reboot earlier this year with the Nokia 3310, a hugely popular device originally launched in 2000 which sold more than 100 million units. The next generation 3310 proved a nostalgic hit. HMD is determined to attract new, younger customers with the Nokia 8, rather than those drawn to Nokia's legacy products.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is the brand's first major flagship product since the Windows-powered Nokia Lumia series, which last launched a smartphone in 2014.\n\nHMD released a range of cheaper Android smartphones, the Nokia 3, 5 and 6, earlier this year.\n\n\"It's so far so good. It feels like a great start,\" said Sarvikas. \"So far we have shipped millions of units of the 3, 5 and 6. Demand is far outstripping supply.\"", "id": "9550245", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 best features: What is a 'both-ie' and does it have Snake?

The device looks pretty damn nice, and it has solid specs to boot. It keeps the thick bezels and physical home button with embedded fingerprint sensor that newer high-end phones are moving away from, but makes up for its somewhat antiquated design in other areas.\n\nThe Nokia 8 sports a 5.3-inch, 2K resolution display (2560 x 1440), machined aluminum back, Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 CPU, 4GB of RAM, OZO spatial 360-degree audio, and 13 MP dual-lens rear and front-facing cameras with Zeiss optics for a feature called \"bothie.\"\n\nBack to the, uh, \"bothie\" (a term I hope no one will ever use in real life). The Nokia 8's dual-sight feature allows you to shoot from the front and rear cameras simultaneously. The result is a fun split-screen view that can also be used to live-stream video directly to YouTube Live and Facebook Live right from the camera app. This seems like a feature with limited appeal, but it could wind up being a game-changer for live video.\n\nNokia 8\n\nThe 8 is the first premium Nokia-branded phone under the Finnish company HMD Global, which licensed the brand with a few former Nokia execs and pieced together this phone. The company also produced three mid-range handsets, the Nokia 3, 5 and 6, earlier this year. Technically, these phones are Nokia in name only. After the company went all-in with Microsoft's failed Windows-based phone platform, its fate was sealed. But HMD Global still believes in Nokia -- or at least the Nokia brand.\n\nNokia 8 isn't coming to the U.S., at least not in the immediate future. The phone will be available in Europe next month for 599 euros, or about $700.\n\nSee Also : Most Anticipated Phones of 2017\n\nThe Best Smartphone CamerasSmartphone Buying Guide: 9 Tips for Finding the Right PhoneHere's How Qualcomm Will Improve Your Smartphone's Camera", "id": "9577956", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Meet Nokia 8: A Phone Made For Livestreaming", "image": "https://img.purch.com/w/500/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9JLzcvNzAzMDg3L29yaWdpbmFsL05va2lhOC5KUEc=", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}, "id": "305049", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook features"}, "id": "332330", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_features"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "19:33:00"}

Check it out below.\n\nWe're overhauling the current master/sub-account system, and introducing the new \"Family on PlayStation Network.\" This new system will offer a more flexible experience for families on PS4 by making it easier to setup PSN accounts for children and customize parental control settings. Below are the new features that will be introduced with family on PSN:\n\nFamily on PSN will allow multiple adults to be part of a single family. The Family Manager can promote another adult inside the family to a Parent/Guardian, who can then customize parental control levels of children's accounts.\n\nBefore this update, the same parental controls were applied to all users on the same console, including adults. But with 5.00, all controls (including game age ratings) can be individually attuned for each child.\n\nIn place of the current 'Favorite Groups' tab, we're adding a new 'Custom Lists' tab within Friends, which allows you to create and edit custom lists of your friends. This makes it easier for you to manage your friends and access specific groups. For example, you can create a custom list of your Destiny teammates and easily send them raid invites.\n\nIf you own a community, you can now bind your community to your broadcast. When a broadcast is linked to a community, the community button appears on the Live from PlayStation spectator screen. Once a spectator clicks on the community button, they'll be able to jump directly to your community page to check out the details.\n\nWe've added a new setting in PlayStation VR: Display Message to Spectators and Spectators' Comments. Once this is enabled, spectator comments sent during a broadcast is displayed not only in cinematic mode, but also in VR mode. This makes it much easier for VR broadcasters to keep up on comments and communicate with their viewers.\n\nGood news Twitch users: with this update, PS4 Pro will support 1080p 60fps streaming on Twitch.\n\nYou've already been able to share your favorite music to Twitter and Facebook via PlayStation Music, but now you'll also be able to share via messages using your PS4. If your friends are on PS4, they can listen to the track right inside the message by booting up Quick Menu, and if they're on their mobile device, they can jump directly to the Spotify app from the PS Messages app to check out the song.\n\nIn addition, if you're part of multiple message groups, you can now easily leave several groups at once. Just open up Options in the message list, select Leave, and choose the message groups you want to leave.\n\nWe've added a new setting that allows you to disable pop-up notifications while you're watching a movie or TV show on your PS4. This setting is off by default, so go to Settings > Notifications to disable notifications and go uninterrupted during your videos.\n\nFurthermore, you now have the option to turn off message previews on your pop-up notifications. If you turn this setting off, the pop-up notification will hide the message senders' online ID and will display a generic user icon and message instead.\n\nLastly, you'll have the option to change the color of your pop-up notifications to either white (default) or black.\n\nIf you want to keep an eye out on what's happening under Notifications, like the progress of your game downloads/installations or new party invites, you can now access this directly from the Quick Menu so you don't have to step away from your game every time you want to check your notifications.\n\nAlso, we've added a 'Leave Party' option in the Quick Menu, so you can easily exit a party and go right back to playing your game.\n\nIn addition, now you'll see the system clock in the upper-right corner of the screen when you pop open the Quick Menu.\n\nPlayStation VR now supports 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound on your headphones when watching Blu-rays and DVDs in Cinematic Mode, making for an even more immersive viewing experience\n\nWe have a new bracket viewer that shows full tournament brackets for Single Elimination and Double Elimination tournaments on PS4. This makes it easier for you to see the current tournament standings.\n\nWith this update, we're adding the following system language options on PS4: Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Romanian, Thai and Vietnamese.", "id": "9772747", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "PlayStation 4 Firmware 5.00 Beta Out Today, Features List Unveiled", "image": "http://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PlayStation-4-Slim.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Music"}, "id": "302636", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop music"}, "id": "303105", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television program"}, "id": "303532", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video game console"}, "id": "304421", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}, "id": "307034", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spotify"}, "id": "307723", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}, "id": "308708", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "Surround sound"}, "id": "333958", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}, "id": "340359", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Firmware"}, "id": "345389", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitch (website)"}, "id": "349819", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(website)"}, {"label": {"eng": "7.1 surround sound"}, "id": "371798", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 3 system software"}, "id": "395526", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_system_software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental controls"}, "id": "398807", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop-up notification"}, "id": "650501", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_notification"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blu-ray"}, "id": "1197211", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Games"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1096, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms"}], "time": "20:33:00"}

The Nokia 8 will go on sale in Europe in September for 599 euros (~$700), but there is no word yet on a US release.\n\nHaving been the subject of dozens of leaks in the weeks and months leading up to its official unveiling, we already know most of what there is to know about the Nokia 8. HMD's Android phone features a 5.3-inch Quad HD display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (with microSD support). Reasonable specs for a 2017 flagship, but the design isn't quite as contemporary.\n\nHMD's Nokia 8 retains the display bezels that Samsung and LG have eliminated in their latest offerings, as well as a traditional home button with a fingerprint scanner under the display. Rather than attempt to compete with the Galaxy S8 or the LG V30 on design, HMD is instead packing the Nokia 8 with intriguing hardware. For example, the phone feature Zeiss lenses on both the front and back cameras, both of which are 13-megapixel sensors with a dual-camera array on the back.\n\nImage Source: HMD\n\nThe camera software is mostly untouched, but HMD has added a \"bothie\" mode which allows both the front and rear cameras to capture photos or videos at the same time. HMD also implemented Nokia's Ozo Audio, which gives users the ability to capture 360-degree audio while recording videos.\n\nHMD Global plans to launch the Nokia 8 in four different color options: glossy blue and copper, as well as matte blue and grey. It will be available in Europe next month for 599 euros, joining the Nokia 6, Nokia 5 and Nokia 3.

Nokia is also stealing a march on Samsung which is gearing up to reveal the Galaxy Note 8 smartphone next month.\n\nHMD's Nokia 8 has the following key specs:\n\n5.3-inch display. A camera that contains sensors made by Zeiss. Dual camera mode that allows users to take pictures and videos using the front and back camera at the same time. HMD is calling this \"bothie\" mode rather than \"selfie\". Ozo Audio which is three microphones to capture 360 degree sound. Ozo is the name of Nokia's expensive virtual reality camera used by Hollywood film studios. HMD has used the audio technology in their phone. Four colors: matte silver, polished blue, matte blue, polished copper\n\nThe Nokia 8 will run Google's latest mobile operating system called Android O. HMD said that the phone will have pure Android, meaning that the company has not modified the software in any way, like many manufacturers do.\n\n\"We think with the Nokia brand and the combination of industry leading performance as well as immersive and innovative consumer experience, we will be immediately able to make a mark in the high end segment,\" Florian Seiche, acting chief executive of HMD Global, told CNBC in an interview ahead of the launch.\n\nHMD was created last year by ex-Nokia execs who acquired the intellectual property required to make phones from Nokia. This included branding and technology. It has partnered with Foxconn to manufacture the devices.\n\nIn the last eight months, the company has released eight devices -- five feature phones, and three smartphones. The Nokia 8 will be the ninth device. The three smartphones -- the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 -- are all mid range handsets. But the Nokia 8 is seen as crucial if HMD is going to make a mark on the global smartphone market.\n\n\"HMD Global needs a successful Nokia-brand flagship smartphone to re-establish the Nokia brand in the smartphone market, because the Nokia brand was always viewed as innovative and high quality. It's almost impossible to meet the expectations of the Nokia name offering only a selection of feature phones and low to mid-range smartphone models,\" Ian Fogg, head of mobile at IHS, told CNBC by email.\n\nThe Android smartphone market has become incredibly competitive not only from the likes of Samsung, but also Chinese players like Huawei and Oppo stepping up their game. HMD will be hoping to differentiate itself through some of its unique features, especially as it launches ahead of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and next generation iPhones.\n\n\"It is very clear that HMD Global needs to position Nokia branded devices as an alternative option for consumers who don't want the expense of a top of the line iPhone or Samsung Galaxy device,\" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC by email.\n\n\"Nokia remains a widely recognized mobile phone brand and HMD needs to capitalize on that as quickly as possible. The Nokia 8 is another important milestone as the company adds breadth to its portfolio of devices in an effort to broaden its appeal to consumers.\"\n\nThe company said its initial smartphones are performing well. In India, the Nokia 6 device received over 1 million registrations on Amazon of people interested in the handset. Seiche said HMD is confident it can meet the demand for its phones, despite being a young company.\n\n\"We have significantly ramped up our supply, however, we are still catching up with the demand but we feel that is a positive thing as it helps to sustain the momentum,\" Seiche told CNBC.\n\nHMD did not release the specific markets it would be releasing the Nokia 8 in yet, but told CNBC that it would launch in countries which are accustomed to higher average selling prices of phones. These include core western European markets, areas of the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nBut Seiche told CNBC it would not launch in the U.S. or China.\n\n\"The U.S. requires a separate strategy, even a separate portfolio and tech investment so we are not in a rush today around that because we are seeing such strong demand across the globe,\" Seiche said.\n\nHMD has already launched the Nokia 6 in China, selling through e-commerce giant JD.com. Seiche said reception to the device was \"beyond our expectation.\" While the new Nokia 8 will not launch in China, the company said it is crafting a specific strategy around the world's biggest smartphone market, and will launch specific devices tailored to consumers there.\n\n\"China is a big focus market and we will make announcements on those dedicated products there in the future,\" Seiche told CNBC.", "id": "9553725", "details": {"liCnt": 11}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 launch: HMD Global unveils $702 flagship Android smartphone", "image": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/08/16/104656453-Nokia_8_Polished_Blue_and_Polished_Copper.1910x1000.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Email"}, "id": "302685", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "CNBC.com"}, "id": "306255", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile operating system"}, "id": "308235", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Foxconn"}, "id": "322094", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy Ace 3"}, "id": "325064", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Seiche"}, "id": "691491", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiche"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 196, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "19:48:00"}

After doing rounds in rumor mills, the Finnish company has finally unveiled its first high-end phone since jumping to the Android family.\n\nPrevious reports had claimed that the company would release a flagship phone known as the Nokia 9, but we now know the name of this phone. In addition to unveiling it, the company also confirmed the pricing as well as availability details alongside the expected list of specs.\n\nFrom what we know, the Nokia 8 price in Europe will be \u20ac599. This translates to about $700, however, a report by Engadget claims that the company has no immediate plans to release the phone in the U.S. This, however, doesn't mean the Nokia 8 won't be coming to the U.S., it only means that fans might be facing a longer wait than expected.\n\nAs for the rest of the globe, the Nokia 8 release date is set for early September. Of course, this will not happen in all markets at the same time, but the company says that availability will spread out through the month of September and probably beyond.\n\nNokia 8 specs and features\n\nYou are probably asking what the Nokia 8 brings to the table in terms of specs and features. Given that this is a high-end phone, you won't be disappointed by what the phone, especially on the hardware front.\n\nSimilar to other 2017 flagship phones, the Nokia 8 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor clocked at 2.5GHz and mated with 4GB RAM. The storage stands at 64GB with room to expand it, but this microSD card slot is also the same one used as the SIM 2 slot. The display size is not massive, coming in with a decent 5.3-inch panel with a QHD resolution and 2.5D Gorilla Glass 5 on top.\n\nAlso Read : Nokia 8 Specifications, Release Date and What to Expect in the Flagship?\n\nIt had already been confirmed that HMD Global will be working with Carl Zeiss on the camera department of the Nokia 8 and this is exactly what you get. The back has a dual 13MP sensor, where one is a color unit and the other a monochrome unit, while the front has a single 13MP shooter that is also backed by Zeiss optics.\n\nThe battery on board is a 3090mAh non-removable unit that should do well to see you through the entire day on a single charge. In case it dies on you, the Nokia 8 supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 technology that promises to give your phone a day's power in just a few minutes of charging. Like many other high-end phones, HMD Global went for a USB Type-C port for charging and PC connectivity purposes, but the company kept the 3.5mm audio jack.\n\nNokia has been a proponent of the pure Android ROM since coming on board. The Nokia 6, Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 are all based on a near-stock Android OS, which allows for faster software updates. This is the same thing you get on the new Nokia 8, which is powered by Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box. With such a clean interface, the phone should always be among the first to receive software updates from Google. In fact, don't be surprised if the update to Android 8.0 O comes out a few weeks after the phone's release.\n\nPotential buyers of the Nokia 8 will be able to choose from four color options of Steel, Polished Blue, Polished Copper and Tempered Blue.

We know for certain it'll be coming to the UK, but there's no clear release in the US or Australia yet.\n\nWe also know the price is set at \u20ac599 euros, which works out to be around \u00a3550 ($700, AU$890). That price would put it under the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S8, but still very much in high-end territory.\n\nSo far we don't know what networks and carriers will be stocking the phone around the world, but we hope to see some deals information coming soon.\n\nYou can see our hands on video review of the Nokia 8 below\n\nThe design of the Nokia 8 is one of the key elements and it's one of the most - if not the most - beautiful phones we've ever seen with the Nokia branding emblazoned on the rear.\n\nThere's an aluminum unibody design that includes metal edges around the phone, but while the back is metal too, the feel on the rear will change depending on what version you buy.\n\nThere's tempered blue and steel available, but both have a matt feel and are a little bit boring when put next to the shiny options of polished copper and blue that you can also buy.\n\nThe body of the phone is thin, coming in at 7.9mm at its thickest point, but the edges curve down, so it sits comfortably in the hand.\n\nThose with smaller hands may also enjoy this device, as it comes with a 5.3-inch screen. It's an LCD panel that has a QHD resolution and 700 nits of brightness. That's high for a smartphone and should mean your phone's display is easily viewable even in particularly glaring sunlight.\n\nAntenna bands on the Nokia 8 are visible along the top and bottom of the phone, but each fits in with the look of the phone. The company has placed them on the top and bottom to try and give you a better signal when you're holding the phone in your hand.\n\nBelow the screen is a fingerprint scanner between the two navigation buttons that seemed in an easy to reach position to tap to unlock the phone.\n\nThe Nokia 8 seemed to be snappy under the finger and because it's toting the best-in-class Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset we'd expect it to be able to handle anything you want your phone to do.\n\nIt comes with 4GB of RAM to power that along, making it a match for most other flagships, while there's also internal storage of 64GB and microSD support of up to 256GB, so you'll be able to fill it full of your favorite apps and games too.\n\nThe Snapdragon 835 seemed to be speedy and we'll put it through its paces for our full review. We think it should allow for some great battery life as well considering how we've seen this chipset perform on previous Android handsets.\n\nThat said, Nokia has only included a 3,090mAh battery in here so it may struggle to power a QHD screen. But Nokia has also included a liquid cooling system that it seems particularly proud of, which should mean the phone runs smoother and won't get too hot and therefore use a lot more power.\n\nWe'll be sure to fully test the battery on the Nokia 8 for our upcoming full review. The phone is charged up via the USB-C port at the bottom and there's also Quick Charge 3.0, which should pump up the cell quickly, but there's no wireless charging option.\n\nNokia wants to particularly highlight the camera tech on this phone and it's no wonder, as it looks like an impressive setup. Much like most of the major phones in 2017, Nokia has opted for a dual-sensor here that uses two 13MP shooters.\n\nOne is an RGB lens and the other is a monochrome shooter and the two combine their images to offer better photos in low light. You can also shoot from just one of the lenses if you wish, but you'll likely only want to use the monochrome one to do this, as it allows for true filter-free black and white shots.\n\nOur testing showed some promise in the camera on the Nokia 8 with sharp and speedily shot photos, but we'll be sure to dive deeper into the camera abilities for our full review.\n\nThere's a 13MP front-facing camera as well that should give you some sharp selfie shots, and you can also livestream to either Facebook or YouTube from both cameras at the same time.\n\nNokia has given this feature the awful name of #Bothie, but the idea is you can shoot what you see in front of you as well as your reaction. This is a feature that some apps already offer, but having it ready and waiting on your phone makes you much more likely to actually use it.\n\nThe Nokia 8 seems like the full package with an attractive design, QHD display, powerful internals and some interesting camera features.\n\nThere's little here that stands out though and that could cause the phone to struggle, particularly in a year like this when a lot of phones are fantastic and the Nokia 8 doesn't come with an edge-to-edge display or something that truly distinguishes it from the crowd.\n\nEspecially given that the OnePlus 5 and Honor 9 offer very similar propositions for a lot less money, so it may end up being hard to recommend the Nokia 8 over them.", "id": "9596842", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 review", "image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eDcyA3uFSkLUXJqLHvy37n-1200-80.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inductive charging"}, "id": "345265", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "17:37:00"}

(Image credit: HMD Global) Nokia 8 launched: Expected India launch, pricing and other questions answeredNew Nokia 8 phone targets surging demand for video-streamingNokia-maker mixes with Apple, Samsung in new smartphone launch\n\nHMD Global's first flagship, the Nokia 8, is aiming beyond conventional features to stand up against the likes of the iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S8 and OnePlus 5. The Nokia 8 is being pitched as a device catering to content creators, giving them the ability to record crisp sound and video while on the move.\n\nHMD Global says Nokia 8 is the world's first smartphone to feature Nokia OZO Audio, which simply means with the help of three microphones a user can capture audio with 360-degree spatial surround sound. Interestingly, the device offers hi-fi surround sound even when played on devices without Ozo Audio. For journalists, for instance, it solves the long-standing problem of poor audio quality while recording interviews or events.\n\nHMD Global also claims the Nokia 8's camera is built for live-streaming. I think this is a bold claim coming from the Finnish company, which recently started selling Nokia-branded smartphones into the market. I was expecting the Nokia 8 to feature advanced camera capabilities, even before the launch. The company has recently rekindled its partnership with Carl Zeiss, so front and rear camera co-developed with the German lens optics firm were expected. So, the phone packs a dual-camera setup (13MP +13MP, f2.0 aperture) on the back. One takes snaps in colour and even features optical image stabilisation, while the other takes photos in monochrome, similar to the Huawei P10. The front camera also has 13-megapixels, with a f/2.0 aperture.\n\nNokia smartphones have generally had good cameras and the new phones are no exceptions. But the selling point here, which I think will be crucial for a professional content creator, is the ability to record and share live broadcast video from a smartphone for a large user base to watch in real time.\n\nThere's also something called the new Dual-Sight technology that uses the front and rear cameras at the same time to capture a Bothie. The feature lets you use both the front and back cameras at the same time. And yes, the option will also allow users to share photos and video content to apps like Facebook and YouTube, directly from the smartphone itself.\n\nAlso read: Nokia 8 first impressions: Sleek design, new camera features and the 'bothie'\n\nBut is the price good enough to make this phone attractive to all the creative professionals out there? Unfortunately, the answer is 'No'. Although HMD Global hasn't announced the price for the Indian market, in Europe, Nokia 8 will cost \u20ac599 (or approx Rs 45,000). At this price, at least, Nokia 8 is obviously not on the lower side. To be honest, this is the hardest part to justify. The biggest challenge for the marketing team over at HMD Global will be to position the phone against the OnePlus 5 and Honor 8 Pro, the latter one is selling for under Rs 30,000.\n\nThe phone has similar top-end specifications as other high-end flagship smartphones. I'm even ready to buy the fact that the Nokia 8 offers an improved camera experience, Dual-Sight capture, live-sharing, and spatial audio taken from Nokia's super expensive 360-degree camera. The only thing I still don't understand is the rationale behind the high price. It's hard to tell where the Nokia 8 will find an audience.\n\nFor all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: HMD Global Nokia 8", "id": "9639092", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 is made for content creators, but the price is hard to digest", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/nokia-8-main2.jpg?w=759", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 46, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 61}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "54715", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Surround sound"}, "id": "333958", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}, "id": "368054", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "S60 (software platform)"}, "id": "456644", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S60_(software_platform)"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "08:09:00"}

Nokia 8 rumoured specifications and features The Nokia 8 may be HMD Global's first smartphone to come with dual rear cameras. As the mobile maker has live streamed the Nokia event in MWC earlier, hopefully, the company may follow the same in the Nokia 8 launch event too. The display will be QuadHD with 559 PPI pixel density. A new and exciting premium smartphone is expected of Nokia soon enough, and until recently we all thought that it would be the Nokia 9. The listing (below) appears to match up with previous leaks, and shows the handset housed in a blue chassis, with top and bottom bezels and a physical home button, which likely will feature a baked-in fingerprint scanner. The smartphone will run on Android 7.1.1 Nougat out-of-the-box. The device will be powered by SD 835, with at least 4 GB RAM and 64/128 GB onboard storage. There were talks about a 6GB and 8GB RAM model but nothing has been confirmed yet.\n\n6/7/17: HMD Global has announced that Nokia has rekindled its decades-old relationship with Zeiss, hinting that the upcoming Nokia 8 could be the firm's first Android phone to pack Carl Zeiss optics. Full sized images of the device are already floating on the internet, and the Nokia 8 was also spotted on the China website of the company for a brief while before it was taken down. It has also been previously leaked that the smartphone will be equipped with a dual rear camera setup.\n\n22/5/17: An image of the Nokia 8 clad in a bulky blue protective case (above) has appeared online courtesy of Frandroid.", "id": "9596859", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 Will Put Up A Good Fight", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 84, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 93}, {"textStart": 197, "freq": 2, "date": "-05-08", "amb": false, "textEnd": 202}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "id": "302869", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint recognition"}, "id": "314740", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel density"}, "id": "317242", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}], "time": "11:37:00"}

The smartphone is the first product the Finnish startup has developed under the ambit of the Carl Zeiss partnership announced last month. As a result, the big highlight of the Nokia 8 is its cameras - the phone packs dual 13-megapixel rear sensors, and a single shooter of the same resolution on the front.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will be available \"globally\" in early September, priced at equivalent of EUR 599 (approximately Rs. 45,000). A HMD Global representative told Gadgets 360 the phone will launch in India in early October, and the Nokia 8 price in India will be known closer to launch.\n\nThe unibody Nokia 8 is built out of 6000-series aluminium and it will be available in glossy Polished Copper and Polished Blue colours, as well as matte Tempered Blue and Steel finishes. The Nokia 8 is IP54 rated, which means it is splash-proof.\n\nJuho Sarvikas, Chief Product Officer, HMD Global explained that the Nokia 8 is fitted with an elaborate heat management solution: a copper pipe that runs from the upper right corner of the device to the lower left has liquid evaporating in the middle, and condensing on the edges. A graphite shield enables heat transfer to the aluminium unibody and its eventual dissipation to the air.\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with dual 13-megapixel f/2.0 RGB and monochrome sensors at the back, and while that setup has been seen on several other phones, HMD is betting big on (the unfortunately named) \"bothies\" - the ability to capture images and videos from front and rear cameras at the same time.\n\nApart from capturing still images from both sensors at the same time and fusing them into a single picture, the Camera app on the Nokia 8 will let you stream these 'bothies' as full-HD live videos to Facebook and YouTube. HMD says it worked closely with Qualcomm to enable Dual-Sight video streaming on the Nokia 8, while minimising the thermal impact of the processing required.\n\nHMD is also leveraging its relationship with Nokia to bring some technology from the latter's 360 VR camera to the Nokia 8. The smartphone comes with high dynamic range microphones, which enables it to record surround sound using Nokia Ozo Audio algorithms. HMD says its software encoding will preserve the virtual surround sound even when users share these videos on social media.\n\nAt this stage, Nokia 8's Dual-Sight streaming and Ozo Audio recording features will be available only via the stock Camera app on the phone and won't be opened up to third-party apps.\n\nThe front camera is the same 13-megapixel RGB shooter seen on the rear, and both front and rear cameras are capable of recording 4K video on their own. The rear camera comes with laser autofocus and dual-tone LED flash.\n\nIn terms of specifications, the Nokia 8 is a powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, which powers nearly all other Android flagships of this generation. There is just one variant - with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, though the phone will release in single SIM and hybrid dual SIM options, depending upon the markets. It comes with support for microSD cards of up to 256GB capacity and a 3090mAh battery.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has a 5.3-inch 2K LCD display with Gorilla Glass 5 protection. It features USB 3.1 Type-C connectivity as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone is just 4.6mm thick at the edges, and 7.9mm thick at the height of its camera module.\n\nIt was rumoured that the Nokia 8 might ship with Android O out of the box, and while a HMD Global representative confirmed that the company is in advanced stages of testing Android O build for the Nokia 8, the smartphone will ship with Android 7.1.1 out of the box.\n\n\"One of the fastest ways of getting [Android] O will be to get our new flagship,\" HMD Global's Sarvikas added.", "id": "9577974", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 With Dual Zeiss Camera, Snapdragon 835 Is

And now the company has unveiled a high-end device in its mid-range offering.\n\nMore in News: Nokia is Working as Hard as Google to Keep its Devices Secure\n\nCorroborating with earlier rumours, the Nokia 8 is powered by Qualcomm's latest offering, the Snapdragon 835 processor. But Nokia has kept the bigger bezels and capacitive buttons inspite of the industry-wide trend of thin bezels on flagship devices.\n\n\"We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media. People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own. It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance,\" said Juho Sarvikas, Chief Product Officer of HMD Global.\n\nThings to Know About the Nokia 8\n\nDisplay: The Nokia 8 features a 5.3-inch (2560 x 1440) liquid crystal display (LCD) protected by Gorilla Glass 5. Design: The device is packed in an aluminium casing and is 7.3mm thin. The 3.5mm headphone jack is located at the top and the charging port at the bottom with the fingerprint sensor at the back panel. Processor: The device is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset which clocks at 2.45 GHz and is supported by Adreno 540 GPU. Memory and Storage: The Nokia 8 comes with 4GB RAM and 64GB of internal storage. Camera: HMD's flagship sports a dual-lens camera on the rear with 13MP and a 13MP front camera. Both the front and the rear camera sport Zeiss optics.\n\nThe device is backed by 3090mAh battery supported with QuickCharge 3.0 tech.\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with Bluetooth 5 and NFC. It will come in blue and copper glossy colours and blue and grey matte colours.\n\nThe device will be available in two variants -- single and dual sim -- and will run on Android Nougat 7.1.1 out-of-the-box.\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with an always-on display which displays notifications for calls, SMS and email, alongside the clock, day, date and battery percentage.\n\nWhile video calling on the Nokia 8, users have the option to switch on the video feed from both the front and the rear camera at the same time.\n\nIt's still unclear exactly when the Nokia 8 will make it to the Indian market, but it will receive stiff competition from the likes of OnePlus 5 which is placed in almost the same price bracket.\n\nNokia 8 India launch is expected around October.

HMD products are built by a unit of Foxconn, which acquired the manufacturing and distribution assets of the former Nokia phone business from Microsoft last year. Once the world's dominant phonemaker, Nokia Oyj sold its handset operations to Microsoft in 2014, leaving it to focus on telecoms network equipment.\n\nHMD is owned by Smart Connect LP, a private equity fund managed by Jean-Francois Baril, a long-serving former senior vice president of Nokia. It took over the Nokia feature phones business in December and has a licensing deal giving it sole use of the Nokia brand on all phones and tablets. It has so far launched four smartphones and five feature phones, including the 3310.\n\nRantala said he was happy with initial sales of the previous smartphones, but declined to disclose any sales figures yet. HMD will pay Nokia royalties for the brand and patents. Last month, HMD announced that its CEO Arto Nummela, a former Nokia executive, was leaving the company for personal reasons, without elaborating.\n\nFor all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: HMD Global Nokia 8", "id": "9623716", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "New Nokia 8 phone targets surging demand for video-streaming", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/nokia-8-bloomberg-copy.jpg?w=759", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 35, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 50}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Helsinki"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "20263", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki", "label": {"eng": "Helsinki"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "id": "302588", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}, "id": "308489", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Foxconn"}, "id": "322094", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "06:26:00"}

The story took a new turn this week with the arrival of a flagship, the first for three years, from the brand's custodians HMD. We spoke to the top executives behind the venture about their plans.\n\nStrictly speaking, this Nokia flagship comes from an entirely new entity, HMD. The old Nokia, which licensed the brand to the company created to sell Nokia phones again, isn't even an investor. However, it is an active supporting partner - the new Nokia 8 takes pride of place on its homepage. HMD handles portfolio management, industrial design, and sales and marketing.\n\nA flagship had been anticipated since May last year, when HMD Global stepped blinking into the sunlight. So far to date its three models have been low and mid-tier (the budget Nokia 3 starts at \u00a3129 SIM-free).\n\n\"We have a big job to become relevant and stay relevant,\" HMD president Florian Seiche told us, but it had a huge advantage over much of the competition in a saturated, cut-throat marketplace.\n\n\"The market has moved on so much. There are so many entrants, but the Nokia brand has that trust, that aura, to it,\" says Seiche. The president is acting chief after the surprise departure of Arto Nummela last month. Seiche built up HTC in Europe in the Noughties, and joined Nokia for the final 18 months of the Elop years as head of EMEA.\n\nI wondered why with the brand resonating most strongly with over-35s, the company was chasing fickle millennials so hard. The front-facing self camera sensor is as good as the main colour sensor on the rear, giving the phone \"Dual Sight\" capability. It can livestream to Facebook in this split-screen mode, as social media scrolls by. This is not a situation that very many well-adjusted over-40s would ever find themselves in, is it?\n\n\"The older generations like to feel like millennials at heart,\" says Pekka Rantala, CMO, who has the job of reviving the brand and worked for Nokia from 1994 to 2011, ending up as its head of marketing. \"The phones resonate well with older generations - we're not excluding them.\"\n\nSo far most of the attention lavished on the \"New Nokia Phones\" has been for its remake of the 3310, a retro 2G phone. This tells us nothing about the prospects for Nokia-branded 'Droids, but HMD is undaunted.\n\n\"Perhaps our assumption was that we'll have a tough job to turn ourselves from an under-the-radar brand. But all of them are aware of us. Some are neutral but they all feel for the brand. Even if they've never had a Nokia,\" says Rantala.\n\n\"We are not planning to go on a nostalgia trip. We haven't been campaigning too much yet. Everything is moving out quite quickly and fast. Now with the Nokia 8 we can.\"\n\nThe new Nokia's biggest competition comes from aggressive Chinese models, particularly from Huawei, and the \"Shenzhen generics\" given a Western brand.\n\nHuawei has no signs of giving the Nokia phone team an easy ride. The recently launched Honor 9 cannibalises most of this year's \"flagship\" technology (OIS 20MP dual camera, 6GB RAM, Kirin 960) and pushes it out for \u00a3379.\n\nBut there's nothing like Nokia, HDM insists.\n\n\"With respect many people coming from that part of the world are working on a trademark level. They don't have a brand equity we can leverage. We think that combining the product approach and brand we can provide something the others can't,\" Rantala argues.\n\nHMD will provide support not associated with Chinese manufacturers: zero day and monthly patches for the Nokia phones, for example.\n\nIn the past Nokia was associated with some eye-catching technology. Some fanbois were disappointed that here Nokia hasn't even use Nokia's launcher - it's as close to stock as can be.\n\n\"Lots of people are expecting things Nokia used to have in the past. With the design we're definitely bringing some of that. The phone is designed largely in London. Nokia 3,5, and 6 customers are definitely feeling that. Almost in darkness people can guess the Nokia 5 is a Nokia,\" Rantala told us.\n\n\"Nokia are partners, but it's so much more than a licence,\" says Seiche. \"With OZO Audio the technology is coming from Nokia.\"\n\nBut not even a lightweight Nokia launcher?\n\n\"I expected those coments to come about creating your own skin, but they didn't,\" Rantala tell us.\n\nThe old Nokia is back in the consumer electronics game with its Withings purchase - analogue watches with a bit of smart (notifications and activity) but a vastly superior month-long battery life to so-called \"smartwatches\". Recently these were all rebranded \"Nokia\". This has possibilities for Rantala.\n\n\"I hope that after a while the perception of the brand will be wider and digital health will contribute to that innovation. We don't mind if Nokia is doing things there. It might be good to combine with a Nokia smartphone!\"\n\nThe Nokia 8 ships in the first week of September. We'll soon find out how well it can turn curiosity into cash. \u00ae", "id": "9881633", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "So, Nokia.

It took over the Nokia feature phones business in December and has a licensing deal giving it sole use of the Nokia brand on all phones and tablets.\n\nNokia 3310 launched in Pakistan\n\nIt has so far launched four smartphones and five feature phones, including the 3310.\n\nRantala said he was happy with initial sales of the previous smartphones, but declined to disclose any sales figures yet.\n\nHMD will pay Nokia royalties for the brand and patents.\n\nLast month, HMD announced that its CEO Arto Nummela, a former Nokia executive, was leaving the company for personal reasons, without elaborating.", "id": "9622113", "details": {"liCnt": 56}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 launches to take on Apple and Samsung", "image": "https://c.tribune.com.pk/2017/08/1483619-download-1502949325-195-640x480.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "178", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}, "id": "308489", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Foxconn"}, "id": "322094", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "06:14:00"}

If you're an Android fan, there are definitely no shortage of choices for you to choose from. However, there's one brand that still has some people waiting just a little bit longer to upgrade: Nokia. HMD Global, the company that licensed the Nokia brand to rebuild the company's smartphone portfolio, has finally revealed the Nokia 8 which seems to have the specs and price to compete against the other heavy hitters in the Android smartphone space.\n\nFirst the all important specs: The Nokia 8, like most 2017 flagships, is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. It has a 5.3-inch 2560\u00d71440 IPS screen, 4GB of memory, 64GB of storage, and a Carl Zeiss branded dual-camera setup (more on that later).\n\nUnlike most 2017 flagships, the Nokia 8 eschews the trend towards thin bezels and includes a fingerprint reader below the display. At the bottom of the device is a USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C port for data transfer and charging. Inside is a decently sized 3,090mAh battery which should be good for around a full day of normal use. And yes...there is a headphone jack.There are glossy blue and copper colors, along with matte(!) blue and grey options.\n\nLet's go back to that camera though. There are two 13 megapixel sensors on the back -- one color, one monochrome -- which have optical image stabilization, phase detection autofocus, and a wide f/2.0 aperture. Similar to the iPhone 7, the dual-sensors use their combined data to help improve low light photography, and allow for enhanced depth-of-field tricks such as the \"bokeh\" effect.\n\nHowever, Nokia is clearly trying to position the Nokia 8 as a content creator's phone. Dubbed \"bothie\" (technically it's called Dual-Sight), the Nokia 8 has the ability to stream both the front and rear cameras simultaneously. You can even stream straight to Facebook Live or YouTube right from the camera app. The video is automatically split down the middle to show both viewpoints which could be useful in order to see live reactions to some important event.\n\nHello #Bothie! The world's first smartphone to broadcast live with both cameras simultaneously. Meet the #Nokia8. pic.twitter.com/nMLl8h6YZe -- Nokia Mobile (@nokiamobile)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nIn addition to the \"bothie\" feature, the Nokia 8 also includes \"Ozo Audio\" which uses three microphones to capture 360 degree (or binaural) audio for those wearing headphones. The Ozo algorithms used stem from the actual Ozo 360-degree VR camera that Nokia unveiled in 2015.\n\nRegarding Android updates, Nokia seems to be committed to making sure customers are covered. Security updates are promised the same day Google releases them and Nokia seems to be delivering on that promise. The Nokia 8 ships with a bone stock version of the latest Android Nougat update with Nokia promising that its phones will be one of the \"fastest ways\" to get hold of Android O.\n\nThough the Nokia 6 is a competent mid-range Android phone, many were holding out for HMD Global to release a true competitor with the likes of the Galaxy S8, LG G6, HTC U11, and the iPhone. With Apple, Samsung, and LG releasing newer phones later this year along with new player Essential in the mix, Nokia is going to have a tough time standing out among the crowd. However, perhaps brand recognition, killer specs, and promise of timely Android updates will be enough for Nokia to rise from the ashes.\n\nIt will go on sale in Europe in September priced at \u20ac600 (around $703), but it's not clear if this handset will be sold in the United States.", "id": "9781763", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Flagship Nokia 8 phone unveiled, coins the term \"bothie\"", "image": "https://techspot-static-xjzaqowzxaoif5.stackpathdns.com/images2/news/bigimage/2017/08/2017-08-17-image-15.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2296, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2311}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Photography"}, "id": "302979", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "LG Corp"}, "id": "307493", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook features"}, "id": "332330", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_features"}, {"label": {"eng": "Depth of field"}, "id": "355372", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field"}, {"label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}, "id": "368054", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bokeh"}, "id": "404967", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "21:40:00"}

The Nokia 8 will go on sale in Europe in September for 599 euros (~$700), but there is no word yet on a US release.\n\nDon't Miss: T-Mobile just took a huge step towards beating Verizon once and for all\n\nHaving been the subject of dozens of leaks in the weeks and months leading up to its official unveiling, we already know most of what there is to know about the Nokia 8. HMD's Android phone features a 5.3-inch Quad HD display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (with microSD support). Reasonable specs for a 2017 flagship, but the design isn't quite as contemporary.\n\nHMD's Nokia 8 retains the display bezels that Samsung and LG have eliminated in their latest offerings, as well as a traditional home button with a fingerprint scanner under the display. Rather than attempt to compete with the Galaxy S8 or the LG V30 on design, HMD is instead packing the Nokia 8 with intriguing hardware. For example, the phone feature Zeiss lenses on both the front and back cameras, both of which are 13-megapixel sensors with a dual-camera array on the back.\n\nThe camera software is mostly untouched, but HMD has added a \"bothie\" mode which allows both the front and rear cameras to capture photos or videos at the same time. HMD also implemented Nokia's Ozo Audio, which gives users the ability to capture 360-degree audio while recording videos.\n\nHMD Global plans to launch the Nokia 8 in four different color options: glossy blue and copper, as well as matte blue and grey. It will be available in Europe next month for 599 euros, joining the Nokia 6, Nokia 5 and Nokia 3. It's still unclear if the Nokia 8 will follow the Nokia 6 to the US.\n\nTrending right now:\n\nT-Mobile just took a huge step towards beating Verizon once and for allWinter is here: Game of Thrones season 7, episode 6 just leakedApple is making a $1 billion bet on its next big business\n\nSee the original version of this article on BGR.com", "id": "9578797", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Meet the Nokia 8: Specs, price and release date revealed", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/J9AGWXF4h4jgLmJ3fGwwVw--/aD02NjA7dz05NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_US/News/BGR_News/nokia-8.jpg?quality=98&strip=all", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "69", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "LG Corp"}, "id": "307493", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics display resolution"}, "id": "312179", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint recognition"}, "id": "314740", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}, "id": "319921", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "22:55:00"}

The new so-called computational photography technique is similar to that employed by Apple, Google, Huawei and LG in their latest smartphones.\n\nThe new phone has spatial audio technology that was previously used in Nokia's high-end OZO 360 camera, which can play back sound in multiple directions, imitating how it was captured during recording.\n\nBen Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said: \"The Nokia 8 has some innovative features including the dual-sight function on the camera and the 360-degree audio recording but it's not yet clear whether these are game-changing features that will lure consumers away from established rivals such as Apple and Samsung.\"\n\nComing off the back of the launches of the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 smartphones aimed at the low-end smartphone market, HMD said the Nokia 8 will cost \u20ac599 (\u00a3546) and will go on sale in early September, placing it in the middle of the launch season for new smartphones from both Samsung and Apple.\n\nWood said that aggressive pricing and marketing would be needed for the Nokia 8 to successfully compete with established market leaders. He said: \"The Nokia 8 is an extremely important product for HMD Global: its first attempt to move into the more lucrative, higher-tier smartphone segment, a notoriously challenging part of the market dominated by Apple and Samsung.\n\n\"The company will be hoping that the widely recognised Nokia brand will help it stand out from rivals such as HTC, Huawei, LG and Sony, which are also trying to compete with Apple and Samsung.\"\n\nThe launch of the Nokia 8 comes a week before Samsung is expected to unveil its next top-end Note smartphone, following on from the disastrous Note 7 debacle in 2016, which caught fire due to battery issues and had to be recalled and discontinued. Apple is also expected to announce a new version of its iPhone in September.\n\nFrom boom to bust\n\nNokia dominated the mobile phone market for the more than a decade from the late 1990s, but was left trailing behind Apple and Samsung in the smartphone era following the launch of the iPhone in 2007. The Finnish company sold its loss-making mobile devices division to Microsoft in 2013 to focus on its telecoms network equipment business.\n\nNow a group of former Nokia executives, backed by private equity, have formed a new company called HMD Global and bought back their former employer's feature phone business from Microsoft, aiming to bring the Nokia handset brand back to its former glory with a range of new smartphones.\n\nNokia was founded in 1865 as a pulp mill near the town of Tampere and once made everything from toilet paper to car tyres, before the Espoo-headquartered company moved in to communications technology in the 1980s. In 1985 Nokia launched its first mobile phone, the Mobira Talkman, but it was 1987's Cityman which shot to fame when pictured in use by Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nBy 1998, Nokia had overtaken mobile phone pioneer Motorola to become the bestselling global mobile phone brand, manufacturing its 100-millionth phone by December that year, with revenues of $20bn (then \u00a313bn) and 55,000 staff by the year 2000.\n\nThe Nokia 3310 was launched in 2000, with the world's bestselling phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, appearing in 2003. Nokia also launched the first camera phone in the US in 2003, partnering with the German optics manufacturer Carl Zeiss in 2005.\n\nNokia launched the world's first smartphone in 1996 - the Nokia 9000 Communicator - and a series of popular smartphones using its Symbian operating system followed in the early 2000s. But Nokia's long slide from relevance started with the launch of Apple's iPhone, which used superior touchscreen technology and left the Finnish firm's keypad-based handsets looking decidedly vintage.\n\nNokia struggled to make competitive Symbian-based smartphones and in 2011 partnered with Microsoft to develop handsets using the Windows Phone operating system, such as the Lumia 800. But with shrinking market share and mounting losses, Nokia bowed out of the mobile handset business two years later. Microsoft discontinued the Nokia brand for mobile phones in November 2014.", "id": "9546205", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 hopes to beat Apple and Samsung with 'bothie', a new version of the selfie", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/900e692502d59e83039c595b3cb3608a605a958a/0_275_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNi8wNy9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=77734a3d4e94415f5aece422b9f4fc1d", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 5899, "date": "2014-11-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 5912}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Espoo"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "20300", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espoo", "label": {"eng": "Espoo"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Operating system"}, "id": "307345", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile game"}, "id": "307682", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_game"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}, "id": "308708", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Motorola"}, "id": "324217", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}, "id": "329085", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 1100"}, "id": "351565", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_1100"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "358688", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian", "label": {"eng": "Symbian"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "18:45:00"}

Nokia has a new phone designed specifically for you.\n\nWith the newly unveiled Nokia 8, you can livestream your breakfast, lunch, dinner and everything in between straight from the camera to either Facebook or YouTube. Not only that, but you can use split-screen (or \"dual sight\" in Nokia parlance) to show your own face and what you're looking at simultaneously thanks to the front and back 13-megapixel cameras built in partnership with imaging specialist Zeiss.\n\nThe focus on livestreaming underscores where the new Nokia is headed as it targets a younger crowd more likely to use the feature on Snapchat or Instagram. It marks the latest comeback attempt from the brand, which was once the largest phone maker in the world by far but was ultimately crushed by newer players like Apple, Google and Samsung.\n\nNowadays, Finnish startup HMD Global has licensed the rights to build Nokia phones and is putting a lot of stock in livestreaming and dual sight. \"It is revealing the missing part of the story,\" Pekka Rantala, HMD's chief marketing officer, said of the split-screen's ability to share a different kind of video. Rantala's remarks came during a briefing Tuesday.\n\nWith all its eggs in this on-trend basket, HMD is looking to go after a younger crowd than consumers old enough to fondly remember the old Nokia phones.\n\n\"Nokia is a brand for everyone, but we definitely want to stay laser-focused on the next generation,\" said Rantala. \"We know that these people are really the creators sharing their lives on a daily basis on social media.\"\n\nA phone for every user\n\nBut has the Nokia 8 got the goods to persuade power users across the board, and not just millennials, to ditch their iPhones and Samsung Galaxy S8s?\n\nGiven the importance of social media on phones, it makes sense to include features like \"dual sight,\" and the features won't put others off, said Ben Wood of market researcher CCS Insight.\n\n\"I don't think there is any risk this will alienate other potential buyers of the product,\" Wood said in an interview. \"The core attributes of the Nokia brand will ensure that the device will get wide consideration from a wide spectrum of consumers.\"\n\nThere's plenty to like, even if you're not an Instagram Live-obsessed, always-Snapchatting socialite.\n\nBack in February when Nokia staged its comeback at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, I lamented the lack of a flagship phone that would relight the fire in Nokia fans and early adopters. Six months later, it's finally arrived: The Nokia 8 is a high-performing, high-end phone that makes a statement about what Nokia phones of 2017 are all about.\n\nFrom what we can glean, this means strong and simple across the board, thanks to a classic design and clean Android, but with minimal, carefully thought-out flare and embellishments that set it apart from rivals.\n\nThis can be seen not only in the camera features, but in the glossy copper and blue versions of the phones, which stand out from the sea of black or grey phones. Also, if you've been in a homewares store recently, you'll know 2017 is all about the copper.\n\nThat's not to say the Nokia 8 is only for the fashion forward -- it's also available in matte grey and blue, which might suit those who have to toe the corporate line during the week.\n\n\"You can easily use it as a business device, but the way we've defined and designed the features is very much around the creator,\" said Florian Seiche, president and acting CEO of HMD.\n\nIs the price right?\n\nOne thing that could still potentially put buyers off the Nokia 8 is the price, which at $599 is just under the iPhone 7's starting price of $650, but above the discounted prices of the now months-old Galaxy S8 and LG G6. The specs justify the cost of the phone though, according to Wood, and just having a phone as high end on the market is an important step for the Nokia brand.\n\n\"Apple and Samsung's stranglehold on the market is proving notoriously difficult to displace, but the Nokia 8 is certainly a step in the right direction,\" Wood added.\n\nIndeed, the handset field is littered with rivals that have tried, and failed, to overcome the stranglehold that Samsung and Apple have over the premium phone market.\n\nYet people's awareness of Nokia phones could well help, Wood said. HMD will have to shout from the rooftops to let people know there's a new flagship Nokia phone in town, but once it does, brand recognition -- something rivals like Huawei are still struggling with -- could kick in and convince consumers to give the Nokia 8 a second look.\n\nThe Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things around you, smarter.\n\nCNET en Espa\u00f1ol: Get all your tech news and reviews in Spanish.\n\nTags Phones Nokia", "id": "9552610", "details": {"liCnt": 6}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 phone was built to help you overshare", "image": "https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/X-cJX2WKuyPzPzYfTVLw8rdFJAg=/670x503/2017/08/15/fc159342-6569-4cfd-83b6-2e622034b042/nokia-8-flagship-product-photos-hero-7.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "id": "302718", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Evan Spiegel"}, "id": "303286", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Instagram"}, "id": "303287", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "19:43:00"}

What is it that gives this phone the credentials to take on the biggies such as the iPhones and the Samsung Galaxy devices? Read on.\n\nThe all-metal aluminum body gives the Nokia 8 the premium look it needs. The company claims it has spared no efforts at giving the phone's outer surface the glossy finish, particularly in some of the color variants. The metal has been processed using many techniques to arrive at the final finish.\n\nTo round off the design and external appearance aspects, the rear panel of the Nokia 8 houses the dual camera setup with the sensors placed in the vertical position and in the front, you have the physical home button with the fingerprint sensor integrated beneath it.\n\nNokia has not opted for the bezel-less or edge-to-edge display. For the record, it's a 5.3-inch display and screen resolution is 2560x1440p and the description of the display is Quad HD IPS LCD. The screen receives protection from a 2.5D curved Gorilla Glass 5.\n\nThe latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC is the CPU on the Nokia 8, which places this smartphone among the elite club of phones released this year with this chipset. The graphics department gets taken care by an Adreno 540 GPU and 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage help with making the phone challenge the very best in the business. A microSD card can expand this to 256GB.\n\nNokia has turned to the Android Nougat version 7.1.1 out of the box, pure and simple. An update to the next version Android O is also assured by the company. There is even a mention of a partnership between Nokia and Google under which the Nokia 8 might be one of the first devices to get the Android O OS.\n\nAnother partnership that is being exploited is the one between Nokia and Zeiss, which has existed for a long time. The camera setup in the Nokia 8 will benefit from this association. The dual 13MP camera arrangement in the rear (one RGB sensor and one black & white) will have autofocus, dual tone flash and optical image stabilization and so on.\n\nVideo recording in 4K is also enabled adding to the premium credentials of this flagship from HMD Global in the Nokia brand. The third sensor, fitted in the front of the phone is also the same 13MP and developed within the same Zeiss partnership.\n\nSo, if you are keen on the camera specifications of a smartphone, you can expect a wholesome experience with the Nokia 8.\n\nA unique feature with this phone is 'Bothie', with which the user can live-stream videos and images from the phone simultaneously form both the rear and front cameras to social media sites like Facebook or YouTube.\n\nThe Google partnership comes in handy to backup unlimited number of images from the device to Google Photos.\n\nThe phone has all the connectivity options you would want and Nokia has stuck to the good old 3.5 mm jack for audio output. And the Nokia 8 also boasts of a 360 degree surround sound quality audio output that must make the phone the favorite with the music lovers.\n\nUnlike the Samsung Galaxy S8 that comes with the IP 68 certification for water and dust resistance, the Nokia 8 only has a splash resistance feature for which it comes with a IP54 certification.\n\nLastly, the Nokia 8 is being released in four color variants; polished blue, polished copper, tempered blue and steel.\n\nAnd as for pricing, there is no official confirmation yet. However, the international price is expected to be around 599 Euros (Roughly 45, 500 Rupees)\n\nIn the same breath, the experts predict that the price in India would be less at around the 40K mark. It is expected that the Nokia 8 will go on sale in India also around September this year.", "id": "9736046", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 launched with dual Zeiss 'bothie' camera and Snapdragon 835 processor", "image": "http://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/nokia-8_ZEISS.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Video"}, "id": "302573", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}, "id": "305049", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}, "id": "307030", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}, "id": "312003", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adreno"}, "id": "351564", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adreno"}, {"label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}, "id": "360548", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model"}, {"label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}, "id": "368054", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "09:15:00"}

Today, its first flagship smartphone was announced.\n\nHMD Global has released three smartphones and five feature phones in its young life to date. Last month I tested the low cost Nokia 6 as an Amazon Prime exclusive phone and was impressed by its capability at a price less than $200.\n\nThe new Nokia 8 is a true Android flagship with the latest high end specifications, a few unique features, and a pure Android experience with timely software updates and regular security releases. It will be available starting in September for a MSRP of \u20ac599.\n\nCNET's initial reviews were strong:\n\nThe Nokia 808 PureView was the best Nokia camera phone available, but that was five years ago and I honestly thought we would never see a Nokia phone again with Zeiss optics. It is encouraging to see HMD Global move ahead with the Nokia brand and I hope to try out the new Nokia 8 at some time in the future, even though it is not targeted to the US at launch.\n\nJuho Sarvikas, Chief Product Officer of HMD Global, stated:\n\nWe know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media. People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own. It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance.\n\nHMD Global is promoting three unique aspects of the Nokia 8: Zeiss optics, Dual-Sight capture and sharing, and advanced Nokia OZO Audio.\n\nThe Zeiss partnership was just announced on July 6 and is sure to bring advanced optical performance from Nokia's future products. The front and rear cameras of the Nokia 8 were co-developed with Zeiss optics.\n\nThe new Dual-Sight technology uses the front and rear cameras at the same time to help you capture a Bothie, HMD Global's term that captures both the front and back experience rather than the selfie capturing just the front-facing camera environment. The Dual-Sight option lets you share photos and videos via livestream services. You can now share the complete story, rather than just the story with you or without you.\n\nNokia OZO Audio uses three microphones and Nokia acoustic algorithms to capture audio with 360 degree spatial surround sound. Advanced encoding of the audio lets people enjoy high fidelity playback even on devices without OZO Audio.\n\nUSB Type C is used for the charging port and there is a headphone jack on the Nokia 8.

It has licensed lens technology from camera maker Zeiss.\n\nIt is the most high-end phone so far from HMD, which was set up late last year and made a splash in May when it revived Nokia's classic 3310 feature handset in new brightly coloured versions.\n\nOther features of the Nokia 8, which will also compete with Huawei's recently launched P10, include surround-sound audio technology made for Nokia's own virtual reality camera OZO for Hollywood professionals.\n\n\"This is especially meant for millennial creators, people who want to share what's happening every day,\" HMD's chief marketing officer Pekka Rantala said.\n\nHMD products are built by a unit of Foxconn, which acquired the manufacturing and distribution assets of the former Nokia phone business from Microsoft last year.\n\nOnce the world's dominant phonemaker, Nokia Oyj sold its handset operations to Microsoft in 2014, leaving it to focus on telecoms network equipment.\n\nHMD is owned by Smart Connect LP, a private equity fund managed by Jean-Francois Baril, a long-serving former senior vice president of Nokia. It took over the Nokia feature phones business in December and has a licensing deal giving it sole use of the Nokia brand on all phones and tablets.\n\nIt has so far launched four smartphones and five feature phones, including the 3310.\n\nRantala said he was happy with initial sales of the previous smartphones, but declined to disclose any sales figures yet.\n\nHMD will pay Nokia royalties for the brand and patents.\n\nLast month, HMD announced that its CEO Arto Nummela, a former Nokia executive, was leaving the company for personal reasons, without elaborating.", "id": "9618731", "details": {"liCnt": 9}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 phone unveiled, targets surging video-streaming demand", "image": "http://www.khaleejtimes.com/storyimage/KT/20170817/ARTICLE/170819216/AR/0/AR-170819216.jpg&NCS_modified=  &imageversion=1by1&exif=.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}, "id": "308489", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Foxconn"}, "id": "322094", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "05:42:00"}

The new Nokia 8 will be available in early September across Europe, priced at 599 euros ($705). As we saw with the leaks, the Nokia 8 has a 5.3-inch display (2560 x 1440), and is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage.\n\nThe specs are mostly what you'd expect from any top phone this year, but HMD is sticking with capacitive keys and larger display bezels despite an emerging industry trend to slim bezels down and move the fingerprint sensor to the rear. In terms of design, the Nokia 8 is slim at 7.3mm on average across its curved frame, and it places the antennas at the top and bottom with a full aluminum back like we've seen from Meizu, Apple, and even OnePlus / Oppo. There are glossy blue and copper colors, and matte blue and grey options too. During a brief closer look at the handset, I personally preferred the matte colors.\n\nInstead of design superiority, HMD is offering some camera tricks. This is the first Nokia-branded Android phone to feature Zeiss optics on the front and rear cameras. Both are 13-megapixel sensors, with a dual-camera array at the rear that also includes a monochrome camera. HMD isn't customizing the camera software very heavily here, but it has added what it calls a \"bothie\" mode.\n\nThe bothie mode (yes, really) is similar to what we've seen Samsung and LG do in the past, and it will activate both the front and rear cameras to capture photos or video. What's slightly different here is that the Nokia 8 will also broadcast this video (with the front and rear cameras) to Facebook or YouTube natively through the camera interface. Ultimately it's a camera gimmick, especially with the bothie naming, but it could prove popular for sports scenarios or even people attending and streaming protests.\n\nThe Nokia 8 also includes another trick, thanks to the integration of Nokia's Ozo Audio. Ozo has typically been reserved for Nokia's futuristic camera for filming virtual reality, but HMD is now bringing the audio portion over to the Nokia 8. In real terms, it means that videos will capture 360-degree audio, allowing for it to be broadcast live on streams. If you're listening to a Facebook live stream with headphones, you'll be able to hear the 360 audio.\n\nNokia was one of the first phone makers to embrace notifications and information on a phone display when it's off, and while others have followed HMD is now bringing back the always-on display. The Nokia 8 includes an LCD display, so this makes things more tricky than an OLED equivalent, but HMD has built a proprietary solution with a low-power mode for a small section of the display. It will show calls, emails, and text messages, and HMD plans to add social network notifications in the future.\n\nAfter my brief time with the Nokia 8, I wasn't left blown away by the handset. It's very much an average \"flagship\" compared to what we're expecting from Apple this year, and what we've seen Samsung achieve with the Galaxy S8. HMD isn't setting the bar high here with an uninspiring design, a lack of waterproofing or wireless charging, and a price point that doesn't make this a cheap Android phone with good specs. That's especially relevant when HMD has competition like the OnePlus 5.\n\nHMD's Nokia 8 joins the existing mid-range Nokia 6, Nokia 5, and Nokia 3 devices as the flagship handset in the range. It will go on sale across Europe in September priced at 599 euros ($705), but it's not clear if this handset will reach US shores like the Nokia 6 did.", "id": "9548690", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "The Nokia 8 flagship keeps the bezels, adds a 'bothie' camera", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OrEAZ9N_7sVDOBHCgPc8CFHmhVk=/0x76:1510x925/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56215713/twarren_nokia8__3.0.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"location": null, "score": 4, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "OLED"}, "id": "307342", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inductive charging"}, "id": "345265", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "18:45:00"}

In the past few of weeks, almost everything about the phone has been leaked, including official renders. Today, the company has finally unveiled the Nokia 8 at an event in London, which comes as the first true Nokia flagship after the Nokia Lumia 950 and 950 XL that were launched in November 2015.\n\nThe Nokia 8 flaunts a Series 6000 aluminium unibody design with IP54 certification for splash resistance. The phone comes with a 5.3-inch QHD LCD display with Gorilla Glass 5 on top. It features a physical home button that hides a fingerprint sensor beneath. Just like the latest flagships from rival brands, HMD Global has fitted the Nokia 8 with the top-notch Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC with a clock speed of 2.45GHz. The device packs in 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage. The phone runs Android Nougat, and we expect it to get the upcoming Android O update after the final build is ready.\n\nComing to the camera department, as the rumour-mill suggested, the Nokia 8 boasts a pair of 13-megapixel cameras at the rear with Carl Zeiss optics. One of the sensors is RGB while the other is monochrome. The rear camera setup also has 4K video support and optical image stabilisation for the main sensor. The camera app features an extensive manual mode as well as a customisable bokeh mode. For selfies, the Nokia 8 gets a 13-megapixel shooter with 4K recording support, autofocus and screen flash. The flagship's camera app comes with a feature called 'Dual-Sight streaming'. This provides a split-screen view in the viewfinder, capturing footage from both the front and rear cameras while shooting video. The feature lets you stream directly to Facebook and YouTube live in the Dual-Sight mode so you can capture both sides of the story.\n\nIn terms of connectivity, the Nokia 8 packs 4G LTE, dual-SIM slots, VoLTE, NFC, USB Type-C, Wi-Fi and GPS with GLONASS. Under the hood, the Nokia 8 features a 3,090mAh battery, which supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 fast charging technology. The device is equipped with Nokia OZO surround sound for audio capture.", "id": "9577990", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 with 5.3-inch QHD display, Snapdragon 835 and dual 13MP Carl Zeiss cameras goes official", "image": "https://hub.91mobiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Nokia-8_FB.png", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 511, "date": "2015-11-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 524}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ceremonial ship launching"}, "id": "302960", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_ship_launching"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}, "id": "308363", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi"}, {"label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}, "id": "308589", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}, "id": "312003", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}, {"label": {"eng": "LTE (telecommunication)"}, "id": "313094", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dual SIM"}, "id": "322106", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_SIM"}, {"label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}, "id": "360548", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model"}, {"label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}, "id": "368054", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bokeh"}, "id": "404967", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh"}, {"label": {"eng": "IP Code"}, "id": "405233", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "17:33:00"}

And with the new Nokia 8, that's exactly what we're getting.\n\nAll images: Nokia\n\nBack in the dark ages of dumb phones, Nokia was the undisputed king of mobile handsets. It seems everyone has a story about the how their colourful Nokia block survived a car crash or 20-storey fall, but after the company partnered with Microsoft in 2011 to put Windows Phone 7 -- not Android -- on Nokia smartphones, the company started down a path that would see it fade in significance as companies such as Apple and Samsung conquered the world of mobile devices.\n\nBut when former Nokia execs banded together to create Finnish startup HMD Global last year and bought the rights to the Nokia name back from Microsoft, the storied brand got a second lease on life. Almost immediately the company released three mid-range and low-end devices, but those devices seemed a bit like test runs. Now we're getting a look at the company's first flagship. The Nokia 8 is a beautiful phone with the specs, and importantly, an Android OS that will let it compete with top devices like Samsung Galaxy S8. The only question is: Does it bring enough to the table to make people who don't get teary-eyed about outdated bricks actually give a damn?\n\nIn a nod to Nokia's minimalist design heritage, HMD is keeping things super clean for its new phone. The Nokia 8 features a simple but boxy body with an aluminium frame, a pretty standard 5.3-inch QHD screen, a Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. (Roughly the same specs as other Android flagships including the Galaxy S8 and OnePlus 5.) Below the screen there's a home button with a built-in fingerprint reader, just as you would expect. And because HMD isn't stupid, the Nokia 8 features both a USB-C port and a headphone jack. What you won't get are things such as facial recognition or even water-resistance.\n\nOne feature with a bit flair is the dual 13-megapixel camera module on back, which features Zeiss optics and combines a typical colour camera with a monochrome sensor so the phone can capture sharper photos and adjust its depth of field. On top of that Nokia says the 8 is the first phone that can shoot and record using both the front and rear cameras to create a unique dual-sight view that can even be streamed out live to the net on YouTube or Facebook.\n\nAudio has also gotten a little extra attention thanks to OZO Audio, which borrows tech from Nokia's $US40,000 ($50,448) 360 camera so you can capture immersive spatial sound right on the phone.\n\nInside, HMD is sticking with the theme of simplicity by going with stock Android, something the company says it will do on all of its upcoming phones. This is a refreshing change from the bloated handsets we get from Samsung, LG and others, which should allow for more streamlined operation and faster updates. Nokia says the 8 will launch with Android 7.1, and that an update to Android 8 will be available shortly after that.\n\nWith a suggested price of \u20ac599 (Australian numbers TBA, but that translates to about $889), it looks like Nokia isn't shying away from other Android flagships either.\n\nBut the biggest takeaway from all this is to imagine what it would have been like if Nokia hadn't lost the last six years making hardware for a platform that never really had a chance. Dual-camera livestreaming and 360 audio are neat, but features like this would have been so much further along if HMD didn't have to spend time picking up the pieces and buying Nokia's own patents back from Microsoft.\n\nInitial specs and features look good, but we won't know truly how competitive the Nokia 8 will be until we can get it in for a full review. Stay tuned.\n\nWATCH MORE: Tech News", "id": "9598235", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "The Nokia 8 Is A Tantalising Peek At A Smartphone Future That Could've Been", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/aygthxtnlmtvxbioa0zi.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}, "id": "308708", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint recognition"}, "id": "314740", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Depth of field"}, "id": "355372", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field"}, {"label": {"eng": "S60 (software platform)"}, "id": "456644", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S60_(software_platform)"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}, {"label": {"eng": "Windows Phone 7"}, "id": "801666", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone_7"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "02:23:00"}

The Nokia 3, 5 and 6 are all budget offerings that feel severely underpowered, but the Nokia 8 is an actual flagship with features to match.\n\nIf you've been longing for a Nokia flagship running Android since the Lumia days, then this is as close as you will get.\n\nLike every company these days, Nokia is pushing the Nokia 8's camera as a key selling point. And to be honest, any high-end phone with a price-tag to match really needs to have fantastic optics to compete in today's market.\n\nThe phone has three cameras: two on the back and one on the front. They all boast 13-megapixel sensors and have been co-engineered by Zeiss. As with the Huawei P10, one of the rear cameras takes monochrome pictures and, according to Nokia, will help enhance low-light performance. I'm not entirely convinced this is the case, as the P10 is still one of the worst flagships in dim light.\n\nI snapped a few pictures looking out over the Thames and the camera felt fast and autofocus was accurate, but I wasn't completely convinced by the results. Colours were strong and vibrant, but the pictures lacked the depth you get from competing flagships, such as the Google Pixel and HTC U11. I'll need a lot more time with the phone to really see how it deals with differing conditions though.\n\nNokia's approach to the camera is also full of odd gimmicks that feel out of place for a brand which pitches its Android devices as being completely free of needless extras. There's a Dual-Sight mode that snaps a picture with both the front and rear cameras simultaneously, for example. Samsung and LG have tried and failed with similar features before, and I still can't think of a single situation where a Dual-Sight mode would be useful. It doesn't help that Nokia is calling the selfie mode 'Bofie'. Sigh.\n\nLive-streaming straight from the app to social networks is another gem Nokia has dredged up from the sea of pointless camera additions. The only bonus over using the apps' built-in streaming functionality is that the Ozo audio codec is supported. This means your streams will come across in a form of surround sound thanks to the phone's three microphones. I didn't have a chance to really try this, but better audio is always appreciated.\n\nRelated: Best Android phones\n\nGimmicks aside, there is a lot to like about the Nokia 8. It's easily the nicest looking and feeling HMD Nokia phone yet, with sloping sides and an aluminium back that I initially mistook for plastic. It's thin and light, and as it only packs a 5.3-inch display it doesn't quite feel as big as the HTC U11 or OnePlus 5.\n\nNokia is also shipping it in both matte and glossy colours, so you don't have to put up with a fingerprint magnet if you don't want to. The shiny copper instantly stood out as my favourite colour, but the matte blue is slick and a lot more subtle.\n\nThe performance problems that plagued budget Nokia devices recently shouldn't be a problem on the 8. Inside the phone there's a Snapdragon 835 SoC, 4GB of RAM and a water-cooling element inside that's supposed to disperse heat around the phone.\n\nIt's running an almost stock version of Android 7.1.1 too, that Nokia said will be updated to Android O very quickly. There are a few software additions, but most feel like they may actually be useful.\n\nA Glance screen, for example, is very similar to the LG G6's always-on display, showing you the time and notifications even when the screen is off.\n\nThe 5.3-inch LCD screen packs a quad-HD resolution and looks predictably sharp and colourful. It lacks some of the HDR tech of higher-priced phones, but it should still be able to reach 700 nits of brightness when it's trying to combat bright sunshine. You'll probably want to turn things down to make the most out of the 3050mAh battery, though.\n\nThe success of the Nokia 8 will come down to price, which currently sits at \u20ac599. If that translates to around \u00a3549, it's immediately taking on the OnePlus 5, and I'm not entirely convinced that's a battle the Nokia 8 can win.\n\nA lot rests on how well the camera performs and what exactly that Zeiss partnership offers other than a well-respected name. The Nokia 8 has plenty going for it, and of course it has the nostalgic Nokia name, but it'll need more than 'Bofie' gimmicks to really make a dent against the competition.", "id": "9596846", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 hands-on | Trusted Reviews", "image": "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/08/DSCF7369.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft Lumia"}, "id": "1271128", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Lumia"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "17:37:00"}

The handset saw its official unveiling at a low-key event held in London.\n\nThe launch of the Nokia 8 comes a few months after the company started selling the Nokia 6, Nokia 5, and Nokia 3 in several markets across the globe. However, there is no denying the fact that Nokia 8 was the most keenly awaited phone from the once-iconic brand. While we had a fair inkling as to the kind of spec sheet that the Nokia 8 would sport, now that we have the complete details, let's not waste any more time.\n\nAs you might have already read in the specifications section, the Nokia 8 is a serious player in the extremely crowded premium smartphones space. It is evident that the Nokia 8 packs enough punch to battle it out with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S8/S8 Plus, the LG G6, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, and, perhaps, the iPhone. It packs in the newest SoC from Qualcomm -- the all-powerful Snapdragon 835 chipset and ships with 6GB of RAM for the premium Gloss Blue variants. All the other versions get 4GB of RAM. The premium variant also packs in 128GB of onboard storage while the rest come with 64GB of storage space. Both options also get a microSD card slot for further augmentation of the storage capacity.\n\nThe Nokia 8 gets a 5.3-inch Quad HD panel that translates to an effective resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. This is an extremely sharp display and compares well with almost all the flagship Android smartphones out there. As far as the optics are concerned, the famed Carl Zeiss optics that used to make regular appearances on Nokia smartphones of the yore has made a comeback. This time, though, the primary camera at the rear happens to be a dual camera set up with both the cameras capable of shooting 13-megapixel images. One sensor, however, is dedicated to monochrome imaging. We have seen a similar kind of implementation on the Huawei P9 and the P10.\n\nThe primary camera also supports fast phase detection auto focus and a dual tone flash for those low-light shots. There is optical image stabilization for stabilized, less shaky videos. The secondary camera on the front is also capable of capturing 13-megapixel still images and also features a display flash for those low-light selfies. The Nokia 8 also boasts the Dual-Sight mode that lets you use both front and back cameras simultaneously for split-screen photos and video. The camera app also natively supports Facebook Live.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has not decided to go the way of Apple and features a 3.5mm audio jack for connecting your existing earphones and audio devices. It also features a three-mic setup for crystal clear audio. Moving on to cable connectivity, the Nokia 8 stays with the current times and uses the now-standard USB Type-C port and cable for physical connectivity. Other connectivity options also include support for a wide range of 4G LTE, 3G, and 2G networks, along with support for Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac networks.\n\nNokia also released a video talking about the technologies that went into the handset.\n\nThe handset also gets a fairly large 3090 mAh battery that should last you a day of nominal usage. The handset also happens to be 1P54 certified water resistant. Note that this is still not completely water proof and is resistant to minor spills. So, no, you cannot take the Nokia 8 into the pool with you.\n\nMoving on to the software, the Nokia 8 runs a near-stock Android UI. However, there are some nifty additions like Nokia OZO spatial 360-degree audio, which claims to offer an immersive video capture and a playback experience with spatial 360-degree audio built into its core.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is set to go on sale starting early September across Europe. It will set you back by approximately 599 euros ($705) for the unlocked version.", "id": "9562566", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia Officially Announces The New Nokia 8 Flagship Android Smartphone", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Nokia-8-Featured-Image.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}, "id": "308363", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}, "id": "312003", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}, {"label": {"eng": "LTE (telecommunication)"}, "id": "313094", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "3G"}, "id": "319925", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook features"}, "id": "332330", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_features"}, {"label": {"eng": "S60 (software platform)"}, "id": "456644", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S60_(software_platform)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 197, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 468, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "20:51:00"}

The event will see the unveiling of the true Nokia Android flagship smartphone, which will take its position atop the current Nokia portfolio, above Nokia 6, Nokia 5, and Nokia 3 mid-range and entry-level handsets. With the Nokia 8 launch, the company will have the arsenal to take on the likes of upcoming heavyweights iPhone 8 and Samsung Galaxy Note 8, along with the other major smartphones launching at IFA 2017. Interested in finding out more about the Nokia handset, and can't wait for the launch? We have you covered, with the Nokia 8 price, specifications, features, and other details you can look forward to in a couple of days.\n\nThe Nokia 8 launch event is scheduled to start at 7:30pm BST (12am IST), according to invites sent by HMD Global. While there is no confirmation of a live stream yet, the Gadgets 360 team will be on the ground to give you all the updates when the event starts at midnight.\n\nA recent report suggests that the Nokia 8 will be priced at EUR 589 (roughly Rs. 43,400). This is still not as expensive as the Apple and Samsung flagships, but does fall comfortably in the premium price bracket. It is also lower than the earlier tipped price of EUR 749 (roughly Rs. 55,300), while the India price was tipped to be at Rs. 44,999. In any case, nothing is certain till the official prices are unveiled at the event in August.\n\nRenders of the Nokia 8 have been leaked in abundance, and while the vertical dual camera strip at the back does grab our attention, the overall design is rather ordinary for a flagship. While other OEMs are launching slim bezel-less stunning smartphones, the renders suggest that the Nokia 8 will have sufficient bezel, capacitive buttons for navigation, and a Home Button underneath which the fingerprint scanner will be integrated. It does seem to sport a metal body and the biggest highlight is the camera strip at the back, courtesy Carl Zeiss optics. Interestingly, there are four holes in the camera ring - two for sensors, one for flash, and the last one is presumed to be for laser autofocus. However, that's just pure speculation, and the fourth hole could serve a completely different purpose.\n\nThe Nokia branding is seen on the front and back as well, and the volume and power keys are both housed on the right edge of the smartphone. The 3.5mm audio jack sits on the top edge, while renders suggest that the smartphone will sport a Micro USB port i.e. no fast charging. At launch, the Nokia 8 may be available in four colour options - Blue, Steel, Gold/Blue, and Gold/Copper.\n\nAs per earlier leaks, the Nokia 8 runs Android 7.1 Nougat out-of-the-box and packs a 5.3-inch QHD display; a variant with Android 8.0.0 has also been leaked online. It is expected to be powered by a Snapdragon 835 SoC. Nokia 8 might be launched with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage initially but the rumoured 6GB RAM and 8GB RAM variants are also expected to be launched later. In terms of optics, the smartphone is expected to sport two 13-megapixel rear cameras with optics from Carl Zeiss, and a 13-megapixel front camera is expected as well. The dimensions are tipped to be at 151.55x73.7mm.", "id": "9578028", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 Launching Today: Event Time, Price, Specifications, and More", "image": "https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/nokia_8_story_1500445636355.jpg?output-quality=80", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2644, "date": "-05-08", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2649}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Laser"}, "id": "310579", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}, "id": "312003", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint recognition"}, "id": "314740", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy Note (original)"}, "id": "321823", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Note_(original)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1255, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Optics", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Optics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1256, "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Optics", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Optics"}], "time": "10:33:00"}

The company is a full range player now, with devices that compete with everything under the sun. But does the Nokia 8 match up to competing flagships? We can only determine that once we review the device, but the Nokia 8 certainly has the specifications of a flagship-class phone.\n\nNot really. The Nokia 8 is priced at \u20ac599, which would stand around Rs. 45,000 if converted to rupees. Of course, that doesn't determine the India pricing for the phone, which will be known in October, when the Nokia 8 comes to India. However, we can safely expect the device to fall between the OnePlus 5 to Samsung Galaxy S8 range. The Nokia 8 doesn't have multiple variants, meaning it should have a single price point. Our expectations are that the smartphone will be priced around the Rs. 40,000 mark.\n\nOn the other hand, direct conversions of the EU pricing for the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 would have placed them at much higher price brackets than they are. So, HMD Global has already proved that it can cut margins to make products cheaper. Will the Nokia 8 battle against the OnePlus 5 and Honor 8 Pro then?\n\nThe bells and whistles\n\nFrom the looks of it, the Nokia 8 is a flagship class device, but it certainly lacks the gimmicks that flagships are known for. There's no curved display, Univisium aspect ratio etc. That may just act against the company, since flagships are no longer about simply putting the top specifications.\n\nOn the other hand, it would be unfair to say that the Nokia 8 doesn't offer the bells and whistles at all. HMD is touting the phone's binaural audio recording capabilities, leveraging technology used in the Nokia Ozo VR camera. We're just not sure how many users will actually recognise such a feature. After all, enhanced audio recording capabilities didn't work for the LG V20 last year.\n\nFurthermore, there's the \"Bothie\" camera feature, which falls squarely in the gimmick arena. Turning on front and rear cameras together isn't new, and has been done by Samsung and LG before, without much deference from users. HMD has added the ability to go live on Facebook or YouTube using this feature, which makes it useful for creators, at least on paper. Is it something you buy a phone for though?\n\nA Nokia flagship\n\nSince MWC, many have realised that their expectations from the Nokia brand may have been too high. Keeping in line with that, the Nokia 8 seems to be a flagship in terms of hardware, but not something you will really hold your breath for. Much like other Nokia smartphones, the Nokia 8 seems to be a functional approach at designing a flagship. But so is a OnePlus 5, Moto Z series and other phones.

And with the new Nokia 8, that's exactly what we're getting.\n\nBack in the dark ages of dumb phones, Nokia was the undisputed king of mobile handsets. It seems everyone has a story about the how their colorful Nokia block survived a car crash or 20-story fall, but after the company partnered with Microsoft in 2011 to put Windows Phone 7 -- not Android -- on Nokia smartphones, the company started down a path that would see it fade in significance as companies like Apple and Samsung conquered the world of mobile devices.\n\nBut when former Nokia execs banded together to create Finnish startup HMD Global last year and bought the rights to the Nokia name back from Microsoft, the storied brand got a second lease on life. Almost immediately the company released three mid-range and low-end devices, but those devices seemed a bit like test runs. Now we're getting a look at the company's first flagship. The Nokia 8 is a beautiful phone with the specs, and importantly, an Android OS that will let it compete with top devices like Samsung Galaxy S8. The only question is: Does it bring enough to the table to make people who don't get teary-eyed about outdated bricks actually give a shit?\n\nIn a nod to Nokia's minimalist design heritage, HMD is keeping things super clean for its new phone. The Nokia 8 features a simple, but boxy body with an aluminum frame, a pretty standard 5.3-inch QHD screen, a Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. (Roughly the same specs as other Android flagships including the Galaxy S8 and OnePlus 5.) Below the screen there's a home button with a built-in fingerprint reader, just as you would expect. And because HMD isn't stupid, the Nokia 8 features both a USB-C port and a headphone jack. What you won't get are things like facial recognition or even water-resistance.\n\nOne feature with a bit flair is the dual 13-megapixel camera module on back, which features Zeiss optics and combines a typical color camera with a monochrome sensor so the phone can capture sharper photos and adjust its depth of field. On top of that Nokia says the 8 is the first phone that can shoot and record using both the front and rear cameras to create a unique dual-sight view that can even be streamed out live to the net on YouTube or Facebook.\n\nAudio has also gotten a little extra attention thanks to OZO Audio, which borrows tech from Nokia's $40,000 360 camera so you can capture immersive spatial sound right on the phone.\n\nInside, HMD is sticking with the theme of simplicity by going with stock Android, something the company says it will do on all of its upcoming phones. This is a refreshing change from the bloated handsets we get from Samsung, LG and others, which should allow for more streamlined operation and faster updates. Nokia says the 8 will launch with Android 7.1, and that an update to Android 8 will be available shortly after that.\n\nWith a suggested price of 599 Euros (US numbers TBA but that translates to about $700), it looks like Nokia isn't shying away from other Android flagships either.\n\nBut the biggest takeaway from all this is to imagine what if Nokia hadn't lost the last six years making hardware for a platform that never really had a chance? Dual-camera livestreaming and 360 audio are neat, but features like this have been so much further along if HMD didn't have to spend time picking up the pieces and buying Nokia's own patents back from Microsoft.\n\nInitial specs and features look good, but we won't know truly how competitive the Nokia 8 will be until we can get it in for a full review.

An HMD representative said penetrating the US market is a \"long-term ambition\" for the eight-month-old company, but that it isn't equipped to compete there with a high-end phone just yet. To date, the company has only released one phone with the Nokia branding Stateside: the Nokia 6, a budget-level device that is sold exclusively through Amazon.\n\nHMD Global\n\nFor other markets around the world, the device will cost \u20ac599 and start rolling out in early September.\n\nIn any case, Nokia 8's design isn't likely to turn heads: It's clean, but not particularly thin or light, and HMD only says it's \"splashproof,\" not water-resistant. It also has big borders around its display at a time where more and more of its peers are maximizing screen space.\n\nThe phone may appeal to hardcore Android fans, though: Like the other Nokia-branded phones HMD has released in recent months, the Nokia 8 runs a virtually untouched version of Android 7.1.1.\n\nSince there's less superfluous software in the way, HMD is promising stronger performance and faster updates than most of its peers. (A company representative said an update to the forthcoming Android O release is currently \"well into development.\") It's too soon to say how true those claims will be, but HMD has generally done well to keep its other recent phones up-to-date with Google's monthly security patches.\n\nThe big grabby feature HMD is touting with the Nokia 8 is a camera trick called \"Dual-Sight.\" In short, the idea is to let you livestream video from both the front and rear cameras simultaneously. HMD says you can stream this kind of split-screen video Facebook or YouTube natively from the camera app itself. The company is branding these kind of videos as \"bothies\" (a variant of \"selfie\").\n\nHMD Global\n\nThat's unfortunate, but the idea is clever, and HMD says it has boosted the Nokia 8's mics and antenna system to make the phone better handle the workload of continuous livestreaming. Still, the feature will likely have little appeal to those who aren't regularly streaming their day-to-day lives.\n\nPerhaps the most relevant thing about the Nokia 8, though, is the fact that it has \"Nokia\" in its name. HMD, which is partially led by past execs from the former mobile phone giant, acquired the rights to use the Nokia name on its phones last year. It has steadily released a number of smartphones and feature phones in the months since, all of which are aimed at the more affordable end of the market.\n\nNokia, for the record, is still a multibillion dollar company; it's just left the consumer phone business after a failed partnership-turned-acquistion with Microsoft and the rise of Apple's iPhone and Google's Android platform. As a result, there hasn't been a top-tier smartphone bearing the Nokia name since 2014.\n\nAn HMD representative said its new Nokia phones have been selling \"in the millions,\" but the Nokia 8 represents its first real stab at the premium market. The device should be strong enough to compete with other high-end peers, and it's more affordable than devices like the Samsung Galaxy S8. But whether a few livestreaming tricks and a nostalgic name are enough to win over those with deeper pockets remains to be seen.", "id": "9552298", "details": {"liCnt": 8}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "The first high-end 'Nokia' phone in years has been announced", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/599466f6f1a8502b008b55c8-1190-625/the-first-high-end-nokia-phone-in-years-has-been-announced.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google Play Store"}, "id": "306750", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "19:41:00"}

It used to pack them with world renowned Carl Zeiss lens. But, sadly the new HMD Global Oy, probably to cut costs, refrained from using Carl Zeiss lens in Nokia 6, 5 and 3 series.\n\nNow, the Nokia 8's both front and rear-facing cameras have been co-developed with ZEISS optics thus assuring fans of top-notch photos.\n\nNokia 8 comes with two cameras-one 13MP (Colour + OIS: Optical Image Stabilisation) another 13MP (Mono). They come equipped with 1.12\u00b5m pixel size, f/2.0 aperture, 76.9-degree, PDAF (Phase Detection Auto Focus), IR (infrared) range finder, 4K video recording and assisted by dual tone flash for good quality images under low-light condition.\n\nOn the front, it boasts an equally impressive 13MP snapper with PDAF, 1.12\u00b5m pixel size, f/2.0 aperture, display flash and 78.4-degree field of view, which is enough to get big group selfies.\n\nAnother notable aspect of Nokia 8's camera capabilities is the newly coined feature: \"Bothie\". Don't mistake it for the Bokeh blur effect, the new Bothie is completely different. It allows users to record videos and take images from both front and the back simultaneous via Dual-Sight mode. Device owners can also live stream front-back videos with split-screen on Facebook, as well. We believe this feature will be a huge hit among social media savvy millennials.\n\nFurthermore, the company, in a bid to improve video experience, has incorporated proprietary Nokia OZO sound system which can record 360-degree audio. It also boasts Audio Focus mode that lets users adjust the right sounds while reducing the ambient sounds or background noise.\n\nNokia 8 is here: Top Five key features that will inspire you to buy HMD Global's Android flagshipNokia Official Website (Screen-grab) Bluetooth v5.0:\n\nThis is another major feature of the Nokia 8. With Bluetooth 5.0 certification, the device owners will be able to transfer files between connected phones for up to 2mbps speed wirelessly.\n\nAnd also the distance range has quadrupled, meaning the Nokia users can maintain connectivity between compatible headphones, speakers and fitness trackers, for up to a staggering 800 feet.\n\nAnother notable aspect of this feature is that the Nokia 8 will also be able to stream audio to two Bluetooth headsets or speakers at the same time.\n\nPure Android OS:\n\nLike Nokia 6, 5 and 3 series, the new Nokia 8 too runs stock Android 7.1.1 Nougat, meaning there will be no unnecessary apps and a second layer of custom UI (bloat-ware) like we see in rival brands.\n\nWith vanilla Android, Nokia 8 will be well optimised to run buttery smooth.\n\nFurthermore, Nokia 8, like Google's Pixel series will get two years of Android OS software support. With no bloatware, HMD Global need not have to tinker with the source code and will be able to streamline the update faster like Google does to the Pixel phones. We won't be surprised if the Nokia 8 gets Android O first than any third-party Android phones in the market.\n\nNokia 8Nokia Design language & build quality:\n\nThe Nokia 8 undergoes a rigorous 40-stage process of machining, anodizing and polishing to create aluminium-based unibody design language, the company claims.\n\nThe use of high-grade metal not only brings stability to the structure but also adds value in terms of visually appealing exterior looks and premium feel.\n\nOn the front, Nokia 8 boasts 5.3-inch QHD display with 2.5D curved glass at the edge and another additional layer of Corning's Gorilla Glass 5 shield with IP54 splash-resistant coating, meaning device owners can take calls or message in rain.\n\nNokia 8Nokia Processor:\n\nNokia 8 comes packed with the Snapdragon 835 (8 x Kryo core) octa-core, Qualcomm's most powerful processor to date. It can clock a maximum speed of 2.45GHz and comes with 4GB RAM LPDDR4X and 64GB storage. Some might ponder that Nokia 8's RAM capacity is low compared to rival brands such as OnePlus and Asus Zenfone AR, but the HMD Global device runs pure Android so it does not require extra physical memory to function efficiently.\n\nThe Snapdragon 835 also helps in conserving battery usage, as it is tuned to consume less power and work faster. Rest assured, Nokia 8 which comes with 3,090mAh cell will be more than enough to last one whole day under mixed usage.\n\nFollow us @IBTimesIN_Tech on Twitter for latest updates on Nokia products.\n\nDear readers, are you excited about the new Nokia 8?

Over the past decade or so, this publication has talked plenty about the company's smartphone ups and, in particular, its downs. Today, it lives on as a brand owned by fellow Finnish company HMD. Eight months since it started making Android phones in the Nokia name, it's revealing a big-screened \"flagship\" to go up against the Galaxy S8s and iPhones that dominate the smartphone world. As soon as you see the copper-finished Nokia 8, you'll probably agree it's a gorgeous device, as ever. It also offers plenty of camera tricks, again, and it's aimed at young creative types, yet again. But if the plan was to succeed, what was Nokia to do differently this time?\n\nIt's certainly a bigger Android phone for Nokia, but with a 5.3-inch screen, it's still not huge, in the grand scheme of things. (What we define as a big phone shifts annually, it seems.) Like the Nokia 5 and some of the latter-day Windows Phone Lumia handsets, this device has an aluminum unibody with a stylish contoured shape. It measures just 4.6mm thick near the top and bottom edges, and 7.3mm \"on average\" through the whole device -- that's a clever way of saying it'll be incrementally thicker in the center, but it feels as slender as any flagship phone you've tried over the past few years.\n\nWhile there are four colors launching early next month (Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue and Steel), it's the all-body, glowing, copper finish that most deserves your attention. It's beautiful, different, classy. In an interview, Nokia spokespeople noted how they had taken design cues from furniture, particularly lamps. Lamps can inspire sharp-looking smartphones -- who knew?\n\nUnder that glossy, fingerprint-magnet of a hood, is Qualcomm's heavyweight Snapdragon 835 processor. To ensure it can handle the strain, there's a \"copper cooling pipe\" -- seriously -- that runs across the phone from one corner of the device to the other. That's coupled with a layer of graphite to help dissipate heat and keep the device cool to the touch, even during heavy processing. But how might an Android phone -- one from a relative novice, at that -- realistically strain a high-end mobile processor anyway? To explain that, you need to look to the cameras.\n\nYep, Nokia is on-trend with dual rear-facing cameras (one monochrome, one color). It also splurged on a front-facing camera with the same 13-megapixel resolution as the other two. In addition to being capable of 13-MP stills, each camera is equipped with an /f2.0 Zeiss lens.\n\nI can't offer up a definitive judgement on how the Nokia 8 stacks up against other great smartphone cameras, but we do know that there's optical image stabilization on the rear-facing sensor, and I'm always quite taken by the imaging results of monochrome smartphone camera sensors. Huawei did a great job with this before Nokia decided to take a similar route. In short, the cameras seem pretty good, even if the company isn't centering its sales pitch on the image quality.\n\nThe combination of the three cameras and that cooling system enable one the Nokia 8's flagship features: Dual-Sight, wherein the phone displays and records from both the front- and rear-facing cameras at once. Yes, this has been done by Samsung and LG before, but there's more: Nokia has added a livestream button into its native camera app that will let users instantly broadcast to the (compatible) social network of choice. At the moment, that includes Twitter and Facebook.\n\nIn a recent demo Nokia showcased the feature with a perfectly lit reaction clip of a hapless boyfriend trying scorpion for the first time. This is where a feature like this might shine, but the camera concept, at least, has been done before. And, as I learned trying the feature out myself, it's pretty hard to frame yourself and what you're looking at in a decent way on both cameras at once -- let alone if you're playing with your newborn baby, or eating wacky street food. Also, stop trying to make #bothie happen, Nokia, please.\n\nRegardless, the livestream shortcut is a smart (and forward-thinking) addition to the camera, and it's bettered by another feature: OZO Audio. Combining three embedded microphones, the Nokia 8 records 360-degree spatial surround sound that will be encoded binaurally, ensuring that wherever your 4K \"bothie\" (ugh) videos go, listeners should get a more immersive experience when they listen back. Nokia is positioning its flagship smartphone as one aimed for creators -- even if they can't afford its pro-level 360-degree camera.\n\nThere are other smart Nokia touches. The company has managed to figure out how to make an always-on display on an LCD screen. Normally, this is done on OLED smartphones, as it's possible to switch individual pixels on and off. Juho Sarvikas, Chief Product Officer of HMD Global, explained that the engineering team designed their way around it -- without giving away exactly how it worked. Like second-screen displays we've seen, this one also shows some notifications, without excessive battery drain. It will also crank up to 700 nits, which is good for outdoor use, but the screen still isn't of the highest quality. At a time when smartphones routinely boast 4K displays, Nokia's gone for a humbler 2K (2,048 x 1,080) LCD screen that, while perfectly sufficient, isn't going to dazzle against the competition.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will launch in Europe early next month, priced at around \u20ac599 ($700) -- which puts it in flagship territory. HMD has no immediate plans to take the phone to the US. Does the brand carry the clout of a modern smartphone maker? Beautiful hardware and smart camera ideas still might not be enough against the likes of Samsung and Apple, but at first glance, Nokia got a lot right.

The Nokia 8 is the fourth 'Nokia' branded smartphone coming this year after the Nokia 6, 5 and 3. Priced at EUR 599 (roughly Rs 45,200), the device definitely comes at a more stratospheric price tag than the Nokia 6. It will be arriving in select markets starting September. India price and availability of the device has not been confirmed.\n\nBased on the specifications, HMD Global's Nokia 8 will be going against other flagship smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S8, HTC U11, LG G6 and even the upcoming iPhone 8 and the Galaxy Note 8 to some extent.\n\nBased on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, the Nokia 8 boasts of a 5.3-inch QHD (2560x1440 pixels) resolution screen with 2.5D curved display along with Corning Gorilla Glass 5. The processing power of the smartphone lies with the flagship octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, which is complimented by 4GB LPDDR4X RAM.\n\nLike what we saw in the rumours and leaks, the Nokia 8 comes with dual rear camera setup powered by 13MP sensors each. The camera lens comes from Carl Zeiss. While the first lens shoots coloured shots with OIS, the secondary rear camera shoots in monochrome. The primary camera has an aperture of f/2.0 along with PDAF and dual-tone flash. Nokia 8 is also the company's first to come with Nokia OZO audio, which is a 360-degree audio technology for better multimedia experience. The cameras can also capture videos in 4K resolution. At the front, there is a 13MP camera with f/2.0 aperture and display flash.\n\nOne of the most highlighted features of the device is 'Bothie' or Dual-Sight mode, which makes use of both front and rear cameras to show both angles on the screen. Users can use this feature to live stream on YouTube and Facebook Live as well.\n\nOn the storage front, the Nokia 8 features 64GB space (UFS 2.1), which can be bumped up to 256GB using a microSD card. There are no other variants of the handset based on RAM and inbuilt storage.\n\nWhat backs up the device is a 3090mAh non-removable battery with Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 tech. Also supported are Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Bluetooth 5.0, 4G VoLTE connectivity, NFC, GPS and dual SIM cards. For added security, Nokia 8 has a fingerprint sensor embedded in the home button at the front below the screen. It is also IP54 certified, which makes it water resistant to a certain level.\n\nMeasuring 151.5x73.7x7.9mm, the Nokia 8 will come in Polished Blue, Tempered Blue, Steel and Polished Copper colour variants.", "id": "9619510", "details": {"gpCnt": 3}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 Launch: Nokia 8 with dual rear cameras, Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 launched | Gadgets Now", "image":

The new so-called computational photography technique is similar to that employed by Apple, Google, Huawei and LG in their latest smartphones.\n\nThe new phone has spatial audio technology that was previously used in Nokia's high-end OZO 360 camera, which can play back sound in multiple directions, imitating how it was captured during recording.\n\nBen Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said: \"The Nokia 8 has some innovative features including the dual-sight function on the camera and the 360-degree audio recording but it's not yet clear whether these are game-changing features that will lure consumers away from established rivals such as Apple and Samsung.\"\n\nTuring's new Appassionato smartphone comes with a digital assistant called Sir Alan\n\nComing off the back of the launches of the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 smartphones aimed at the low-end smartphone market, HMD said the Nokia 8 will cost\u20acUS$599 and will go on sale in early September, placing it in the middle of the launch season for new smartphones from both Samsung and Apple.\n\nWood said that aggressive pricing and marketing would be needed for the Nokia 8 to successfully compete with established market leaders. He said: \"The Nokia 8 is an extremely important product for HMD Global: its first attempt to move into the more lucrative, higher-tier smartphone segment, a notoriously challenging part of the market dominated by Apple and Samsung.\n\n\"The company will be hoping that the widely recognised Nokia brand will help it stand out from rivals such as HTC, Huawei, LG and Sony, which are also trying to compete with Apple and Samsung.\"\n\nThe launch of the Nokia 8 comes a week before Samsung is expected to unveil its next top-end Note smartphone, following on from the disastrous Note 7 debacle in 2016, which caught fire due to battery issues and had to be recalled and discontinued. Apple is also expected to announce a new version of its iPhone in September.\n\nNokia dominated the mobile phone market for the more than a decade from the late 1990s, but was left trailing behind Apple and Samsung in the smartphone era following the launch of the iPhone in 2007. The Finnish company sold its loss-making mobile devices division to Microsoft in 2013 to focus on its telecoms network equipment business.\n\niPhone 8 rumours we hope are true\n\nNow a group of former Nokia executives, backed by private equity, have formed a new company called HMD Global and bought back their former employer's feature phone business from Microsoft , aiming to bring the Nokia handset brand back to its former glory with a range of new smartphones.\n\nNokia was founded in 1865 as a pulp mill near the town of Tampere and once made everything from toilet paper to car tyres, before the Espoo-headquartered company moved in to communications technology in the 1980s. In 1985 Nokia launched its first mobile phone, the Mobira Talkman, but it was 1987's Cityman which shot to fame when pictured in use by Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\n5 luxury phones that rival Samsung S8\n\nBy 1998, Nokia had overtaken mobile phone pioneer Motorola to become the bestselling global mobile phone brand, manufacturing its 100-millionth phone by December that year, with revenues of US$20bn and 55,000 staff by the year 2000.\n\nThe Nokia 3310 was launched in 2000, with the world's bestselling phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, appearing in 2003. Nokia also launched the first camera phone in the US in 2003, partnering with the German optics manufacturer Carl Zeiss in 2005.\n\nNokia launched the world's first smartphone in 1996 - the Nokia 9000 Communicator - and a series of popular smartphones using its Symbian operating system followed in the early 2000s. But Nokia's long slide from relevance started with the launch of Apple's iPhone, which used superior touchscreen technology and left the Finnish firm's keypad-based handsets looking decidedly vintage.\n\nNokia struggled to make competitive Symbian-based smartphones and in 2011 partnered with Microsoft to develop handsets using the Windows Phone operating system, such as the Lumia 800. But with shrinking market share and mounting losses, Nokia bowed out of the mobile handset business two years later. Microsoft discontinued the Nokia brand for mobile phones in November 2014.", "id": "9823146", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Nokia 8 says 'bothie' is the new selfie", "image": "http://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/images/methode/2017/08/18/fc39f51a-83bb-11e7-a767-bc310e55dd10_image_hires_120725.jpg?itok=1JgHvgXo", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 6116, "date": "2014-11-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 6129}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Espoo"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "20300", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espoo", "label": {"eng": "Espoo"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Operating system"}, "id": "307345", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile game"}, "id": "307682", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_game"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}, "id": "308708", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Motorola"}, "id": "324217", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}, "id": "329085", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 1100"}, "id": "351565", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_1100"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "358688", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian", "label": {"eng": "Symbian"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "04:10:00"}

A flagship phone from Nokia that could rival the likes of the iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy S smartphones. HMD Global has officially unveiled the brand new Nokia 8 that targets the same premium segment as the iPhones. The new Nokia phone will also be competing against Android vendors such as OnePlus, which has built a loyal fan base with its competitively priced premium smartphones. Let's take a look at the Nokia 8 vs OnePlus 5 comparison to find out which phone is a better buy.\n\nThe Nokia 8 doesn't disappoint loyal Nokia fans. It offers a glimpse of where Nokia could have been had it used Android rather than Windows Phone on its phones years ago. OnePlus 5, on the other hand, is an incredibly powerful smartphone that rivals the Samsung Galaxy S8. Considering the Nokia 8 and OnePlus 5 target the same segment, the phones have a few similarities.\n\nHMD Global's latest flagship has a unibody aluminum design. The company has used the series 6000 aluminum on the device. HMD sticks to Nokia's minimalist design language, which we have already seen on the Nokia 3, 5 and 6. During the London unveiling event, HMD claimed the Nokia 8 goes through a 40-stage process of machining and polishing.\n\nThe phone has a vertically arranged dual camera system on the back. The Nokia logo is placed right below the dual cameras. Nokia 8 sports a physical home button on the front, which houses the fingerprint scanner. OnePlus 5 has a similar design with a flat body that curves at the edges. The dual camera on OnePlus 5 is arranged horizontally at the top right corner. Just like Nokia 8, it has a physical home button with the fingerprint sensor on the front.\n\nNokia 8 (7.9mm) is slightly thicker than OnePlus 5 (7.3mm). The latest Nokia phone weighs 160g compared to OnePlus 5's 153g. You can get the OnePlus 5 in Midnight Black, Slate Gray, and Soft Gold colors. The Nokia 8 will be available in Polished Copper, Tempered Blue, Polished Blue, and Steel colors.\n\nThe latest Nokia flagship comes with a 5.3-inch IPS LCD screen with Quad HD resolution of 2560 x 1440. It features Corning's latest Gorilla Glass 5, which protects the screen from scratches and accidental drops. The display comes with the Finnish company's trademark Glance Screen, and has a brightness of up to 700Nits.\n\nOnePlus 5 sports a slightly bigger 5.5-inch AMOLED display. However, it lags behind Nokia in terms of resolution. The OnePlus flagship offers Full HD visuals at 1980 x 1080 resolution, which works out at 401ppi pixel density. The Nokia 8 has a pixel density of 554ppi. It means when checking out photos or watching videos, the Nokia phone gives you a more detailed, eye-pleasing experience than OnePlus 5.\n\nUnfortunately, both smartphones lack an edge-to-edge bezel-less display like Samsung's Galaxy S8. The Galaxy S8's bezel-less Infinity display was praised by users as well as tech experts around the world.\n\nBoth Nokia 8 and OnePlus 5 are powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor built using 10nm manufacturing process. Snapdragon 835 is the most powerful chipset available to Android vendors right now. Most of the flagship phones launched this year including the Galaxy S8 and HTC U11 use the same chipset. Both OnePlus 5 and Nokia 8 have the Adreno 540 graphics processor.\n\nWhere the two phones differ is RAM. The Nokia 8 comes with 4GB RAM, which is pretty standard for a premium Android phone. It offers 64GB of internal storage that you can expand by up to 256GB via microSD card. OnePlus 5 packs a huge 6GB RAM and 64GB storage. There is also an 8GB RAM version of OnePlus 5, which comes with 128GB storage.\n\nThe Nokia 8 offers a non-removable 3090mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 support. To prevent overheating, Nokia has used an innovative heat management technology with a graphite-shielded copper cooling pipe. It dissipates heat across the entire length and breadth of the device. OnePlus 5 includes a 3300mAh non-removable battery with Dash Charge technology. The battery is good enough to last a full day with normal usage.\n\nBoth the handsets feature a USB Type-C port, NFC connectivity, and a 3.5mm audio jack. Unfortunately, both phones lack water-resistance capabilities. They will not be able to withstand even light rains.\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with the OZO Audio technology that allows you to capture immersive spatial surround sound on your smartphone. It gives you the 360-degree audio experience. HMD Global says users can also share 4K videos with OZO audio with their friends. Its algorithms ensure that it delivers high fidelity playback even on phones that lack OZO Audio feature.\n\nYou've taken photos and videos with your phone. You have also taken selfies. Have you ever taken a \"bothie\"? Certainly not. Nokia 8 is the world's first smartphone to offer Dual-Sight bothie camera capabilities. It allows users to use the front and rear cameras simultaneously in a split-screen view. It lets you capture both photos and videos. You can also live stream video footage directly to social media.\n\nGimmicks aside, Nokia has an impressive history in smartphone photography. The Nokia 8 comes with dual 13-megapixel camera sensors on the back. Nokia has used Zeiss optics on its latest smartphone. The dual camera setup includes a 13MP RGB sensor with OIS and a 13MP monochrome sensor, which allows the device to capture sharper and crisper photos. Both lenses have an aperture of f/2.0. The Nokia 8 camera offers phase detection autofocus and a dual-tone flash.\n\nThe monochrome sensor allows users to capture the depth information. It also improves the low-light photography by collecting more data. Nokia has used a 13-megapixel sensor on the front.\n\nOnePlus 5 beats Nokia 8 in terms of camera, at least on paper. The real-life photography depends on other factors as well such as software optimization. OnePlus 5 also has a dual camera system on the back. It includes a 16MP lens with an f/1.7 aperture and a 20MP sensor with an f/2.6 aperture. It offers dual LED flash, 1.6x optical zoom, and phase detection autofocus. OnePlus 5 has a 16-megapixel camera on the front for selfies.\n\nBoth of them are Android smartphones. But HMD Global has differentiated its device by offering the pure Android experience. Android phones made by Samsung, LG, OnePlus, and others are loaded with bloatware that could slow the devices down. Since Nokia 8 runs the stock Android, it will receive timely security fixes and faster software updates.\n\nNokia 8 runs Android 7.1.1. Nougat, and will be one of the first phones to get the Android O when it becomes available. OnePlus 5 also runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat, but it has OnePlus's custom OxygenOS on top.\n\nOnePlus 5 is one of the most affordable premium smartphones you can buy. It retails for $479 for the 6GB RAM/64GB storage model.

(Image Source: Evan Blass) Nokia 5 smartphone to go on sale from August 15: All you need to knowNokia 3310 with 3G support to launch in late September or early OctoberNokia 2 variants get FCC certifications: Launch to take place soon?\n\nNokia 8, the new flagship smartphone from HMD Global, the Finnish startup with the license for Nokia brand, will be announced in London on Wednesday in all probability. HMD Global is hosting an event in London where it is expected to unveil the phone.\n\nIn the past we have seen quite a few leaks of this smartphone. Full sized images of the device are already floating on the internet, and the Nokia 8 was also spotted on the China website of the company for a brief while before it was taken down. Given this will be the new flagship, the Nokia 8 is expected to come with top of the line specifications, including Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor and dual rear camera with Zeiss optics.\n\nHMD Global and Zeiss announced a partnership in July this year, and the company has said it will bring back the Zeiss branding to Nokia phones. When Nokia was still manufacture its own smartphones, many of its high-end Lumia phones came with Carl Zeiss lenses. But with Nokia 8, the company will also take the plunge into the popular dual-rear camera trend like many of the other players in the market.\n\nFor HMD Global, launching its Nokia 8 flagship will be a key step. So far the company has introduced only mid-range phones like Nokia 5 and Nokia 6, but with this new device they will be playing in a different category. The competition here is the likes of Apple's iPhone, Samsung Galaxy S8 series, HTC U11, OnePlus 5 and others.\n\nLaunching a flagship by itself doesn't always guarantee success, given the tough competition in the high-end smartphone market, which is dominated by Apple and Samsung. While the specifications are expected to be high-end, the pricing itself will be closely watched. It is possible that Nokia will go for the mid-range with a pricing closer to the likes of the OnePlus 5 and the Honor 9. The other issue for HMD Global will be making sure enough units of the Nokia 8 and made available globally within a reasonable time.\n\nThere's no doubt that the design, specifications of the Nokia 8 have been discussed in great detail online. But, we will have to wait and see what the final product looks like when the company unveils the phone later tonight.\n\nDisclaimer: The reporter is in London attending the event at the invite of HMD Global.\n\nDisclaimer: The reporter is in London attending the event at the invite of HMD Global.\n\nFor all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: HMD Global nokia", "id": "9417039", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 likely to be unveiled today as HMD Global gears up for flagship launch", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/nokia-8-main.jpg?w=759", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 47, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 62}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 306, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 315}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "id": "302869", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "3G"}, "id": "319925", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flagship"}, "id": "320976", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft Lumia"}, "id": "1271128", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Lumia"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "06:42:00"}

This new system attempts to offer a more flexible system for those sharing a console, allowing you to set up PSN accounts for kids and customise parental control settings.\n\nFamily Manager, Parent/Guardian\n\nFamily on PSN now allows multiple adults to be made part of a single family of users. The Family Manager is able to promote a new adult within the family to a Parent/Guardian, who is then able to tweak the parental control level of a child's account.\n\nIndividualised Parental Controls\n\nPS4 update 5.00 now allows all controls to be tailored to each individual child, including game age ratings.\n\nFriend List Management\n\nThis replaces the current Favourite Groups tab with a new Custom Lists feature.

Just open up Options in the message list, select Leave, and choose the message groups you want to leave.\n\nNotifications Updates\n\nWe've added a new setting that allows you to disable pop-up notifications while you're watching a movie or TV show on your PS4. This setting is off by default, so go to Settings > Notifications to disable notifications and go uninterrupted during your videos.\n\nQuick Menu Updates\n\nIf you want to keep an eye out on what's happening under Notifications, like the progress of your game downloads/installations or new party invites, you can now access this directly from the Quick Menu so you don't have to step away from your game every time you want to check your notifications.\n\nVirtual Surround Sound on PS VR\n\nPlayStation VR now supports 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound on your headphones when watching Blu-rays and DVDs in Cinematic Mode, making for an even more immersive viewing experience\n\nImproved Tournaments Bracket Viewer\n\nWe have a new bracket viewer that shows full tournament brackets for Single Elimination and Double Elimination tournaments on PS4.

And not to forget a hybrid card slot to expand storage up to 256 GB.\n\nWith the Nokia 8 users will not find their smartphones heating up.\n\nNokia has added a cooling copper pipe, as seen in LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8 series, and graphite shield to disperse the system heat.\n\nNokia uses aluminum unibody shell design that is built with single block of 6000 series aluminum.\n\nNokia 8 will be available in matte and mirror finish forms in four colours.\n\nKeeping in mind preferences of users who do not always like big screens the Nokia 8 comes with screen size of 5.3\" compared to other flagships with screen size 5.5\" and above.\n\nThe screen sports a display resolution of 2k (2560 x 1440) IPS QHD.\n\nThis screen is protected by Corning Gorilla glass 5 and polarised display for easy visibility in sunlight, probably as seen in Lumia series.\n\nWe see most phones skipping 3.5 mm audio jack to keep the phone slim but the Nokia 8 stays with the 3.5mm audio jack in its 7.9 mm thickness body.\n\nNokia 8 includes the new reversible Type C port for quick charging and data transfer.\n\nNokia has invented a new buzzword '#Bothtie' or selfie 2.0 that boasts about its camera.\n\nSimply put, the camera comes with a feature that enables you to shoot photos/videos simultaneously with both front and rear cameras.\n\nThe same was seen on LG G6 as MultiView.\n\nWhat's more, all the camera sensors sport 13MP with f/2.0.\n\nOut of the two on the rear, one has OIS and the other Monochrome.\n\nThe rear camera shoots with the help of laser and PDAF (phase detection auto focus). The front camera also has PDAF.\n\nYou can shoot 4k videos using Nokia's OZO technology to record immersive sound in 360 degree with three microphones built into the phone.\n\nNokia 8 runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of box. As there are no UI enhancements or overlays like other flagship phones, users can have pure android experience.\n\nNokia promises to have regular updates for phone.\n\nWe hope to see the next Google Pixel built by HMD.\n\nThe only point which spoils the plot is that the phone is IP54 certified, that is, dust and splash resistant where as most flagship phone come with IP67 certification.\n\nWell, the Nokia 8's pricing, with all these specs is kept under Euro 600, roughly Rs 47,000, which is not a bad deal at all.", "id": "9820915", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Nokia 8: What's hot, what's not", "image": "https://im.rediff.com/300-300/getahead/2017/aug/17nokia8-01.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Display resolution"}, "id": "355654", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft Lumia"}, "id": "1271128", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Lumia"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "04:20:00"}

Unlike the Nokia Android smartphones already launched, this new device comes with premium design, top-of-the-line specs, and will compete in the high-end market segment.\n\nIn terms of design, the Nokia 8 shares a lot of similarities with the Nokia 5. It features an unibody design built using a single block of aluminum. The device is quite slim with an average thickness of 7.3mm, and 4.6mm at the edges. Despite the slim profile, HMD Global is ensuring there is no overheating, when the smartphone is being pushed to its limits. Underneath is a graphite shielded copper cooling pipe that dissipates heat across the length and breadth of the handset.\n\nThe highlight of the Nokia 8 is no doubt the dual-camera setup at the back. Back in July, HMD Global announced its partnership with Carl ZEISS, and the Nokia 8 is the smartphone to boast the camera technology. The camera setup includes a pair of 13-megapixel sensors - one clicking photos in RGB, and the other in monochrome. A similar setup is seen on smartphones like the Honor 8 Pro, and Huawei P9 to name a few. The primary sensor comes with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) and PDAF support, f/2.0 aperture, and IR range finder. Up front, there is a 13-megapixel snapper with PDAF support, f/2.0 aperture, and display flash.\n\nNokia 8 price, availability\n\nFor now, HMD Global has only launched one variant of the Nokia 8 that is priced at \u20ac599. When converted into Indian currency, it translates to approximately Rs 45,000. The smartphone will be available globally starting early September. Buyers will be able to choose from four color options - Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue, and Steel.\n\nNokia 8 specifications, features\n\nAs far as specifications are concerned, the Nokia 8 flaunts a 5.3-inch IPS 2K resolution display with an insane 700nits of brightness. Protecting the display is Corning's Gorilla Glass 5. Under the hood is Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 SOC paired with 4GB of RAM. There is also 64GB of storage on offer, which can be expanded up to 256GB using a microSD card.\n\nThe Nokia 8 also features three microphones for audio recording. It uses Nokia's OZO Audio technology to capture audio with 360-degree spatial surround sound. The rest of the specifications include a fingerprint sensor, 3,090mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 support, IP54 certification making it splashproof. Connectivity options include dual-SIM card slots (select markets only), 4G LTE, USB Type-C port, 3.5mm audio jack, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 5.0.\n\nAs is the talking point on Nokia smartphones, the Nokia 8 too runs on stock Android OS. The smartphone runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat out-of-the-box, but the company promises that Android O update will be rolled out as soon as Google releases it.", "id": "9577977", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 with Snapdragon 835 SoC, dual cameras launched: Price, specifications, features", "image": "http://st1.bgr.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nokia-8-launched.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "LTE (telecommunication)"}, "id": "313094", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "2K resolution"}, "id": "315858", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2K_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dual SIM"}, "id": "322106", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_SIM"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}, "id": "368054", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "IP Code"}, "id": "405233", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB Type-C"}, "id": "1270770", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_Type-C"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 402, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Tools and Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Tools_and_Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 521, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1140, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1533, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Audio", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Audio"}], "time": "17:33:00"}

The Finnish company finally took the wraps off the product yesterday showcasing its maiden Android flagship device.\n\nThe selling point of Nokia 8 is its cameras for which it has partnered with Zeiss. This gives us rear dual cameras of 13MP+13MP resolution and a 13MP selfie shooter. The rear cameras combine color and monochrome sensor shots into a single shot using \"Image Fusion Technology\". Other features include optical image stabilization, phase detection autofocus, 1.12\u03bcm pixels, and a wide f/2.0 aperture.\n\nTo take it a notch higher, Nokia has come up with a new camera feature called 'bothie'. This special mode allows users to click photos or record videos using footage from both the front and rear cameras (as can be seen above). This is done by splitting down the middle to show both viewpoints. That's not all. Users can also stream the photos or videos in 'bothie' mode directly to Facebook Live or YouTube from the camera app.\n\nAnother unique feature which Nokia 8 sports is \"Ozo Audio\". The technology for this has been borrowed from Ozo, which is Nokia's take on a 360-degree camera for creating VR content. The three microphones in the Nokia 8 capture 360-degree surround sound which is then attached to 4K video using algorithms first developed for the Ozo.\n\nBut what keeps a flagship phone ticking is the up-to-date software. Nokia 8 comes with Android 7.1.1 OS and with Nokia promising to upgrade it to Android O, things look bright. The company has also given a word to push out security updates the same day Google releases them.\n\nPacked in an aluminium body, the Nokia 8 is set to make its debut globally on September 6th (except US) with a price tag of 599 Euros (in UK). We have to admit, design-wise Nokia 8 has a lot of catching up to do. The thick bezels and physical buttons, which have become obsolete and found only in budget devices, have been incorporated in Nokia 8. Also without 2:1 display and IP68 rating, Nokia 8 fails to justify its place in the flagship domain.\n\nBut that is compensated by under-the-hood specifications and Nokia 8 stands a good chance of giving other flagship products a tough competition. Carrying a 5.3-inch QHD display, Nokia 8 is powered by Snapdragon 835. In terms of storage, the phone packs in 4GB RAM and 64GB ROM with microSD support.

It has licensed lens technology from camera maker Zeiss.\n\nIt is the most high-end phone so far from HMD, which was set up late last year and made a splash in May when it revived Nokia's classic 3310 feature handset in new brightly coloured versions.\n\nOther features of the Nokia 8, which will also compete with Huawei's recently launched P10, include surround-sound audio technology made for Nokia's own virtual reality camera OZO for Hollywood professionals.\n\n\"This is especially meant for millennial creators, people who want to share what's happening every day,\" HMD's chief marketing officer Pekka Rantala said.\n\nHMD products are built by a unit of Foxconn, which acquired the manufacturing and distribution assets of the former Nokia phone business from Microsoft last year.\n\nOnce the world's dominant phonemaker, Nokia Oyj sold its handset operations to Microsoft in 2014, leaving it to focus on telecoms network equipment.\n\nHMD is owned by Smart Connect LP, a private equity fund managed by Jean-Francois Baril, a long-serving former senior vice president of Nokia. It took over the Nokia feature phones business in December and has a licensing deal giving it sole use of the Nokia brand on all phones and tablets.\n\nIt has so far launched four smartphones and five feature phones, including the 3310.\n\nRantala said he was happy with initial sales of the previous smartphones, but declined to disclose any sales figures yet.\n\nHMD will pay Nokia royalties for the brand and patents.\n\nLast month, HMD announced that its CEO Arto Nummela, a former Nokia executive, was leaving the company for personal reasons, without elaborating.", "id": "9601378", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "New Nokia 8 phone targets surging demand for video-streaming", "image": "http://images.asianage.com/images/aa-Cover-ksg7q7o521dlbuumpk90dhoe72-20170718165716.Medi.jpeg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 225, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 234}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Private equity"}, "id": "306590", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_equity"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}, "id": "308489", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Foxconn"}, "id": "322094", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "03:00:00"}

A while back Sony opened sign-ups to participate in the testing of this firmware, and if you were selected, you should be receiving an email some time today.\n\nWhether you were selected or not doesn't matter. 5.0 is coming to everyone very shortly, and today Sony officially revealed all of the system features. Not shockingly, these line up almost exactly with our version 5.0 leak from a while ago. This is great news for some of you, and nasty news for most of you.\n\nWe're going to outline the new system 5.0 features in order of most importance. Sony thinks that the new family management system is the headlining feature. We think that's dumb. We're going to kick off with all of the new social bells and whistles, including broadcasting enhancements for your Twitch streams and community changes. Then we'll outline some exciting new features for PS VR owners and some quality of life improvements that we think everyone will enjoy. These are all pulled from the official announcement, so no more guess-work.\n\nLet's begin.\n\nPreviousSlide 1/6Next Broadcast Feature Updates Communities\n\nIf you own a community, you can now bind your community to your broadcast. When a broadcast is linked to a community, the community button appears on the Live from PlayStation spectator screen. Once a spectator clicks on the community button, they'll be able to jump directly to your community page to check out the details.\n\nPlayStation VR\n\nWe've added a new setting in PlayStation VR: Display Message to Spectators and Spectators' Comments. Once this is enabled, spectator comments sent during a broadcast is displayed not only in cinematic mode, but also in VR mode. This makes it much easier for VR broadcasters to keep up on comments and communicate with their viewers.\n\nPlayStation 4 Pro\n\nGood news Twitch users: with this update, PS4 Pro will support 1080p 60fps streaming on Twitch.\n\nPreviousSlide 2/6Next VR, Competitive Gaming, and Social\n\nVirtual Surround Sound on PS VR\n\nPlayStation VR now supports 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound on your headphones when watching Blu-rays and DVDs in Cinematic Mode, making for an even more immersive viewing experience\n\nImproved Tournaments Bracket Viewer\n\nWe have a new bracket viewer that shows full tournament brackets for Single Elimination and Double Elimination tournaments on PS4. This makes it easier for you to see the current tournament standings.\n\nNew System Language Additions\n\nWith this update, we're adding the following system language options on PS4: Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Romanian, Thai and Vietnamese.\n\nFriend List Management\n\nIn place of the current 'Favorite Groups' tab, we're adding a new 'Custom Lists' tab within Friends, which allows you to create and edit custom lists of your friends. This makes it easier for you to manage your friends and access specific groups. For example, you can create a custom list of your Destiny teammates and easily send them raid invites.\n\nPreviousSlide 3/6Next Messaging and Notifications Messages Improvements\n\nYou've already been able to share your favorite music to Twitter and Facebook via PlayStation Music, but now you'll also be able to share via messages using your PS4. If your friends are on PS4, they can listen to the track right inside the message by booting up Quick Menu, and if they're on their mobile device, they can jump directly to the Spotify app from the PS Messages app to check out the song.\n\nIn addition, if you're part of multiple message groups, you can now easily leave several groups at once. Just open up Options in the message list, select Leave, and choose the message groups you want to leave.\n\nNotifications Updates\n\nWe've added a new setting that allows you to disable pop-up notifications while you're watching a movie or TV show on your PS4. This setting is off by default, so go to Settings > Notifications to disable notifications and go uninterrupted during your videos.\n\nFurthermore, you now have the option to turn off message previews on your pop-up notifications. If you turn this setting off, the pop-up notification will hide the message senders' online ID and will display a generic user icon and message instead.\n\nLastly, you'll have the option to change the color of your pop-up notifications to either white (default) or black.\n\nPreviousSlide 4/6Next Quick Menu Updates Quick Menu Updates\n\nIf you want to keep an eye out on what's happening under Notifications, like the progress of your game downloads/installations or new party invites, you can now access this directly from the Quick Menu so you don't have to step away from your game every time you want to check your notifications.\n\nAlso, we've added a 'Leave Party' option in the Quick Menu, so you can easily exit a party and go right back to playing your game. In addition, now you'll see the system clock in the upper-right corner of the screen when you pop open the Quick Menu.\n\nPreviousSlide 5/6Next Family / Account Management Overhaul Family on PSN\n\nWe're overhauling the current master/sub-account system, and introducing the new \"Family on PlayStation Network.\" This new system will offer a more flexible experience for families on PS4 by making it easier to setup PSN accounts for children and customize parental control settings. Below are the new features that will be introduced with family on PSN:\n\nFamily Manager, Parent/Guardian\n\nFamily on PSN will allow multiple adults to be part of a single family. The Family Manager can promote another adult inside the family to a Parent/Guardian, who can then customize parental control levels of children's accounts.\n\nIndividualized Parental Controls\n\nBefore this update, the same parental controls were applied to all users on the same console, including adults. But with 5.00, all controls (including game age ratings) can be individually attuned for each child.\n\nPreviousSlide 6/6Are you excited about version 5.0?

But where can you find it? And what about the Nokia 8 price tag?\n\nIt'll launch in September. The Nokia 8 release date is on September 6th to select markets, and will rollout to more markets throughout the month.\n\nHow much will it cost? Right now we only have European Nokia 8 price information, with the phone set for 599 Euros. That translates out to around $700 in the U.S., but phones tend to be priced cheaper in the US than Europe, so it's possible the price tag could end up closer to the $600 - $650 mark. We'll update with specific regional pricing here, as it hits.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will be available globally. While Nokia hasn't given us an official U.S. Nokia price, the Nokia 8 is expected to make its way stateside, in addition to other global markets like Asia and Europe. Judging by how the brand has handled the Nokia 8's lower-end brothers, it's possible that the US launch could be a bit more delayed from the European -- but that's just speculation.\n\nWill it be offered by carriers?

Well that comes down to the camera.\n\nNokia has revived its partnership with Zeiss, with the precision optics company teaming up with HMD Global to work on the dual camera on the rear of the phone. This isn't a dual camera like the iPhone 7 Plus or LG G6, so there's no wide or telephoto lens, instead this is about quality first and foremost.\n\nIt offers the same approach as the Huawei P10, with two sensors, one capturing RGB colour data and the second concentrating on monochrome. Combining the data from the two sensors should result in better image quality - no matter what the shooting conditions are.\n\nBut that's not all: there's also a 13-megapixel front camera (so that's three 13-megapixel cameras on this phone), with the unique offering being the ability to not only take photos from both cameras at the same time (front and rear), but to be able to livestream video from both. That means you can have Facebook Live watching what you're filming and your reaction at the same time. Nokia calls this Dual-Sight.\n\nBeyond the camera, Nokia is offering Ozo Audio, with binaural audio capture, but aiming to preserve that, so when you capture a 360 audio and share a video, others get the benefit of that great audio too.\n\nComing in four colours - with Polished Copper very much being the most interesting and unique - the Nokia 8 runs pure Android 7 with the promise of a quick update to Android O when it becomes available.\n\nWhile the Nokia 8 isn't quite hitting the asking price of the likes of the HTC U11. Priced at \u20ac599 (UK prices still to be confirmed), the challenge is really competing with devices like the OnePlus 5, which is \u00a3449, a healthy bit cheaper.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will be available globally in September; UK prices and networks have not yet been confirmed.", "id": "9544650", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 official: Flagship power meets dual camera skills - Pocket-lint", "image": "http://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/1200x630/assets/images/141926-phones-news-nokia-8-official-flagship-power-meets-dual-camera-skills-image1-oc9leqwogy.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel"}, "id": "315167", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}, "id": "329085", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook features"}, "id": "332330", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_features"}, {"label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}, "id": "360548", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model"}, {"label": {"eng": "Telephoto lens"}, "id": "404956", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephoto_lens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia Lumia 920"}, "id": "707786", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_920"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "18:47:00"}

But does it have the mettle?\n\nFinnish brand Nokia is continuing its attempt to clamber up the ranks in the smartphone market with the Nokia 8, a flagship smartphone with a few interesting features.\n\nPerhaps most interesting is the Nokia 8's 'Dual-Sight'. You can snap photos and record videos using both front and rear cameras at the same time - and you can see how these look on the phone's display via its split-screen feature.\n\nYou can record 4K video on the Nokia 8, too. Plus the phone records 360\u00b0 audio, which means it should capture sound from all directions for more immersive playback.\n\nYou should be able to buy the Nokia 8 at some point in September, and it will cost around \u00a3550 to buy outright. This price tag places it among the more expensive smartphones we've seen, but is it worth considering over well-known models such as the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6?\n\nIt's made from aluminium for an expensive look, has a generous 64GB on-board storage and dual cameras on its rear. We can't wait until we get full results from our test lab, to bring you our definitive verdict.\n\nIn the meantime, we cover some of the phone's key specs, and whether it's shaping up to be one of the best smartphones of 2017, below.\n\nMobile phone reviews - get the best smartphone for your budget\n\nMore and more mobile phone manufacturers are sticking two camera lenses on the back of handsets, to try to improve photo and video quality.\n\nNokia has jumped on the bandwagon with the 8, with 13Mp colour and monochrome lenses. The theory behind this is that you'll get better detail even in low-light shots, and you'll be able to focus more quickly on your subject. It also has a 13Mp front-facing camera for selfie fans.\n\nWe test all phones for camera quality in a range of light conditions. We can't wait to see whether the Nokia 8 delivers on its grand claims.\n\nUnder the hood, the Nokia 8 has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. This is the latest Snapdragon chip in the series, and means that the new Nokia should speed through everyday tasks.\n\nIt should also be able to handle the latest, graphic-intensive games, and flitting between several different apps. This means the Nokia 8 could be a good choice both for people who use their phones mainly for texts and light web browsing, as well as people who use their phones for several hours a day.\n\nThe Nokia 8 runs on Google's Android operating system. Many manufacturers do the same, but modify how it looks for a more bespoke experience.\n\nHowever, Nokia is offering Android in its pure form with its new smartphone. Nokia says that this means there will be no unnecessary apps that you can't delete - instead, you have more storage space to fill with exactly what you want.\n\nThe Finnish brand also promises monthly security updates to the Nokia 8, which may give you peace of mind.\n\nAs you'd expect from a phone this expensive, it has a fingerprint scanner for so you can quickly unlock your device.\n\nMany expensive smartphones are designed with decent water-resistance. For example, you can submerge the Samsung Galaxy S8 for half an hour in 1.5 metres of water, and it should still work normally. It's somewhat disappointing that the Nokia 8 can only withstand 'splashes' of water, and that an accidental drop in the toilet could render it completely useless.", "id": "9886868", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Nokia 8 announced: a mobile phone designed for live streaming - Which?

It has licensed lens technology from camera maker Zeiss.\n\nIt is the most high-end phone so far from HMD, which was set up late last year and made a splash in May when it revived Nokia's classic 3310 feature handset in new brightly coloured versions.\n\nOther features of the Nokia 8, which will also compete with Huawei's recently launched [HWT.UL] P10, include surround-sound audio technology made for Nokia's own virtual reality camera OZO for Hollywood professionals.\n\n\"This is especially meant for millennial creators, people who want to share what's happening every day,\" HMD's chief marketing officer Pekka Rantala said.\n\nHMD is owned by Smart Connect LP, a private equity fund managed by Jean-Francois Baril, a long-serving former senior vice president of Nokia. It took over the Nokia feature phones business in December and has a licensing deal giving it sole use of the Nokia brand on all phones and tablets.\n\nIt has so far launched four smartphones and five feature phones, including the 3310.

These days the tech development curve moves at a frenetic pace and HMD Global might be fully of prodigious talent and a lot of Nokia IP it wasn't going to be an innovation machine at first brush. At that's what happened at MWC - they played the nostalgia card brilliantly with 3310, they had the great software and rock solid phones in the Nokia 6, Nokia 5 and Nokia 3; but neither of these were earth shattering. But now, HMD Global is turning up some levers as it has launched the new Nokia 8.\n\nThe new Nokia 8 is many things, but what it is not a flashy headline grabbing Android smartphone. It is purely Nokia in soul and it is a functional beast. Some elements which debuted on the phones like the Nokia 6 are ever present in arguably a grander way and then there are some unique things which hint at a better tomorrow.\n\nLet's start with the design. The Nokia 8 is a refinement of the design language HMD Global showcased with the Nokia 6 and Nokia 5. It has rounded corners, a slim profile of 7.3mm all in a solid series 6000 aluminium chassis. It is IP 54 certified and largely looks great especially in the polished blue and copper finishes.\n\nIt is also compact as it has a 5.3-inch screen not something which is outlandish in terms of size.\n\nThe screen itself is impressive though a tad washed out. It has a quad HD resolution and despite being an LCD panel it has natural colours and decent viewing angles apart from being very bright at 700 nits.\n\nInternally, this phone has some of the best specs one would find on an Android phone in 2017. It has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset, 4GB RAM and 64GB of internal storage which can be further bolstered with the microSD card slot.\n\nTo manage great performance, this phone also has a copper heat pipe embedded which should help alleviate stressful workloads and not make the phone burn like a furnace. The phone in the short while we tested performed well with it being on par with the Google Pixel and the OnePlus 5 in that department.\n\nOf course, HMD Global's commitment to providing a stock Android Nougat experience helps matters here, but its executives also say that they are working overtime on the Android O update and the Nokia 8 will be surely one of the first phones in the market to deliver that software experience.\n\nThe real innovation on the phone comes in form of its cameras. It has dual 13-megapixel sensors on the back augmented with Carl Zeiss optics and an optically stabilised RGB lens that also has a laser focusing system. HMD Global says this will ensure great image quality as it uses 1.12 micron sub pixels combined with some magic of computational photography and the fusing of an RGB image with a black and white image from the monochrome lens.\n\nIn PCMag India's short term with the phone, the experience was quite impressive. HMD Global has gone to great lengths to make sure the camera provides a differentiated experience. One of the interesting things it has done is a new feature called dual sight shot. Basically, this activates all three cameras - the two on the back and the one on the front which by the way is the same one as the RGB sensor on the back showcasing both perspectives of view in a split screen format.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Nokia 8 goes one step further by integrating live streaming on Facebook and YouTube on the stock camera app allowing people to not only live stream but also use this unique dual view mode on these platforms.\n\n\u200b\n\nVideo on this phone should be great as firstly all three cameras shoot in 4K and now this becomes the first phone in the world to incorporate Nokia's critically acclaimed OZO audio technology. For OZO integration, HMD Global is using high dynamic range microphones and also the OZO algorithm which could make it the best phone in the market to record loud video on. Imagine a techno party, a live concert, this should be the phone HMD Global says should be with you and going by Nokia's lineage we aren't doubting its capabilities.\n\nOther frills include a front mounted fingerprint scanner, a rather decent 3,090mAh battery with fast charging and a promise that it could come to India by October for around Rs 45,000, this could be actually the flagship Android everyone should be buying instead of the ostentatious and gimmicky Samsung Galaxy S8. But hey, wait for our review no, that will actually be the true test of the pudding that HMD Global is cooking up.\n\nDisclaimer: HMD Global paid for the writer's travel and stay in London to cover the Nokia 8 launch.", "id": "9596875", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 preview", "image": "http://sm.pcmag.com/pcmag_in/photo/default/nokia-8-4_zqwa.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Photography"}, "id": "302979", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Copper"}, "id": "306629", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Laser"}, "id": "310579", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint recognition"}, "id": "314740", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel"}, "id": "315167", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}, "id": "360548", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "17:37:00"}

An e-mail should be waiting in the inbox of those who signed up, so don't forget to check. Even if the opportunity was missed to check out the beta, it shouldn't be long before 5.0 comes to all PS4 owners.\n\nThe first major addition is the new \"Family on PlayStation Network.\" This will help ease the stress of managing media on the PS4 for parents everywhere. Now it's easier than ever to setup PSN accounts for kids, while also managing customization of parental control settings. PS4 understanding there are multiple adults in a household that should be able to manage the family features. No more one account control, giving thought to the actual family.\n\nManaging a friends list on any console is always a bit of a pain, PS4 is remedying that with the new feature of a 'Custom Lists' tab. PS4 owners will now able to specifically hone the group they want to be a part of, taking place of the 'Favorite Groups' tab which can feel bogged down at times with people one might not know.\n\nIf the head of a community on PS4 the option to bind that community to one's broadcast is now available. Having a broadcast linked to a community will have a button appear on the Live from PlayStation spectator screen. All a spectator needs to do is click the community button and they can jump right to the community page to check out any details.\n\nPlayStation VR has also been fine-tuned with new setting PlayStation VR: Display Message to Spectators and Spectator's Comments. Enabling either will show spectator comments sent during broadcast to display in cinematic mode and VR mode. Making it easier for a broadcaster to keep up with comments to communicate in a timely manner. PlayStation VR also supports 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound through headphones when watching Blu-rays and DVDs in Cinematic Mode adding that extra layer of immersive experience.\n\nThis next bit of news is a real cherry on top for broadcasters who have a PlayStation 4 Pro. PS4 Pro can now support streaming on Twitch at 1080p 60fps, it's easy to get jealous if still running on a PS4. It's a fantastic feature that anyone can be happy with.\n\nWith the ability to share music to Twitter and Facebook via PlayStation music now PS4 will support sharing music through messages as well. Friends on PS4 can listen to tracks shared inside the message by just going to the Quick Menu or if using a mobile devic, following the prompts to the Spotify app jumping to the PS Message app to check out those sweet tunes.\n\nThe new feature of dropping out of multiple message groups is now also available, making easier than ever to unclog what might be an overwhelming notifications mess that comes from being part of multiple groups. It's like being able to delete multiple games at once.\n\nThe new feature to disable pop-up notifications while watching movie's or Tv shows on the PS4 has become available. The setting is on by default, but if now going to Settings>Notifications the disable notifications will mean uninterrupted video bliss. PlayStation users will also have the option to turn off message previews on pop-up notifications. Turing the setting off the pop-up notification will hide the message senders' online ID, displaying a generic icon and message instead. The final feature for messaging is the changing of color of pop-up notifications with either white (default) or black.\n\nThe Quick Menu has seen some tweaks too making it even easier to access features without having to pause whatever one might be doing. Now players can check Notifications such as the progress of game downloads/installations or new party invites that be accessed with ease from the Quick Menu meaning less down time. The ability to 'Leave Party' from the Quick Menu has been added too, which again is less down time.

HMD Global's smartphone comes with premium design, top-of-the-line specifications, and it will be competing against other flagship devices in the high-end segment. The Nokia 8 is priced at \u20ac599 (approximately Rs 45,000), and is set to go on sale globally early September. Some of the publications got hands-on time with the new Nokia 8, and here's a look at their first impressions.\n\nSince the launch of the first Nokia-branded Android smartphones, HMD Global hasn't stopped highlighting the design. With the Nokia 8 it is no different either. As Pocket-lint puts it, \"The Nokia 8 starts life as a block of aluminium, hewn into smartphone form, with a soft curve across the back and rounded edges to make it sit comfortably in the hand.\"\n\nThe Nokia 8 will be available in four colors - Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue, and Steel. Two of the colors come with a glossy finish, while the other two come with a less glamorous matt finish, albeit with more grip. \"It's particularly smart of Nokia to let customers choose between matt and polished finishes - we like that a lot - because while the polished finish looks more striking, the matt finishes offer more grip. It's a tough choice, but good to let consumers make that decision,\" T3 says.\n\nUnder the hood is Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 SoC paired with 4GB of RAM. On paper at least the smartphone seems more than capable of handling any and every task thrown at it, and early impressions across publications are in line with that. What also aids in good performance is the fact that the Nokia 8 runs on stock Android 7.1.1 out-of-the-box. The company has promised Android O update as soon as Google rolls it out. ALSO READ: Nokia 8 vs Samsung Galaxy S8 vs HTC U11 vs Sony Xperia XZ Premium: Price, specifications, and features compared\n\nWhat's caught everyone's eye is however the cooling system underneath. HMD Global says that Nokia 8 comes with graphite shielded copper cooling pipes that dissipate heat across the length and breadth of the handset. As GSMArena notes, \"...we want to commend HMD on how cool the Nokia 8 runs. The heat pipe and graphite shield must be doing some work as we re-ran multiple benchmarks in quick succession and the phone didn't even feel warm. Seriously, we can't tell where the chipset is by feel (usually, it's obvious on phones with poor heat management).\"\n\nAmong the highlights of the Nokia 8 is the dual-camera setup at the back, and the smartphone is being touted as one that is aimed at content creators. The setup includes a pair of 13-megapixel snappers - one shoots in RGB, and one in monochrome. The camera has been developed in partnership with Carl ZEISS. But the company is focusing on a feature it calls 'Bothie'. In essence, the Nokia 8 camera lets users shoot photos or videos using both the front and back cameras simultaneously. There is also a feature to livestream on social media directly from the camera app.\n\nThe dual-camera setup, and the Bothie feature is clearly designed with the over-sharing millennials in mind. \"The focus on livestreaming underscores where the new Nokia is headed as it targets a younger crowd more likely to use the feature on Snapchat or Instagram,\" Cnet says. \"It marks the latest comeback attempt from the brand, which was once the largest phone maker in the world by far but was ultimately crushed by newer players like Apple, Google and Samsung.\" ALSO READ: Nokia 8 vs OnePlus 5 vs Honor 8 Pro: Price, specifications and features compared\n\nSo far, early impressions about the Nokia 8 have been quite positive.

The smartphone sports a full-metal unibody, which looks premium, thanks to its metal edges.\n\nThe smartphone is expected to be priced at \u20ac599 (approximately Rs 45,000). The device will be available globally starting early September. Before it goes on sale, here are the key features of the Nokia's recently launched flagship. Here are five noteworthy features of the Nokia 8:\n\nDual-camera setup with OIS\n\nOne of the USPs of Nokia 8 is its camera. The Nokia 8 features a 13-megapixel dual-camera setup at the rear with one sensor meant for RGB, while other captures monochrome information. The primary sensor comes with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) and PDAF support, f/2.0 aperture, and IR range finder. The dual-cameras are powered by ZEISS optics.\n\nOn the front, the device houses a 13-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies and video calling. The front camera is equipped with PDAF, 1.12um and f/2.0. ALSO READ: Nokia 8: Here's how the 'bothie' dual-camera setup works\n\nWith the Nokia 8, you can simultaneously shoot with the front and rear cameras. The company calls it the Bothie mode, which enables a split-screen with photo and video from the two cameras. It claims the Nokia 8 is a world-first phone to enable Dual-Sight video that can be live-streamed natively and in real-time to Facebook and YouTube.\n\nBrighter display\n\nThe Nokia 8 features a screen size of 5.3-inch IPS 2K resolution display and 554 ppi. Nokia says that the phone can reach a brightness of 700 nits which would allow you to read clearly under bright sunlight. In comparison, the new iPad Pro does 600 nits. The display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on top of 2.5D glass.\n\nOZO Audio for better spatial experience\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with OZO Audio offering a 360-degree spatial audio experience for video recordings. The feature allows users to record 4K videos with 360-degree spatial audio with Audio Focus. The company says it helps in reducing noise and ambient sound in videos. ALSO READ: Nokia 8 hands-on and first impressions roundup: Here's what previews say of the device\n\nLiquid cooling on a smartphone\n\nMoving on, HMD Global has introduced Liquid Cooling facility with the Nokia 8 smartphone. Now, considering Nokia 8 is running the Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 chipset paired with 4GB of RAM in the phone, the device is expected to heat up. However, to prevent that, the design, innovation engineers have come up with a solution to avoid over heating of the device. The company has inserted a graphite shielded copper cooling pipe that scatters the heat generated by the chipset and equally divides it throughout the device, hence keeping the device from bursting into flames. ALSO READ: Android O rollout to begin on August 21, Google Pixel first in line: Report\n\nPure Android because latest updates matter\n\nThe Nokia 8 runs pure stock Android 7.1.1 Android Nougat OS. However, HMD Global has promised to offer the latest Android O updates to its users without any delay. If reports are anything to go by, Nokia 8 will be among the first smartphones to get the Android O update as soon as it rolls out officially.

After months of anticipation for its first flagship smartphone, HMD Global has unveiled the Nokia 8 as promised. We first had an idea about this when early sketches popped up online. Some images were also leaked showing an iris scanner and a bezel-less display. We were almost certain about its final form when we saw some believable images, followed by that copper-colored Nokia 8 and the different variants listed on GFXBench and AnTuTu.\n\nOld and new fans alike of Nokia will want this new Nokia 8 because it's the most premium offering yet since the brand was given a new lease on life by HMD. You can say it's just another Android phone but it boasts of a new camera feature that the selfie addicts will love. The phone records with both cameras at the same time to show two images or videos in a single media file. The idea is nothing new because we've heard something similar before but Nokia is banking on this feature to sell the phone. Apparently, there are people who think there is a more practical way to show off your surroundings or the moment.\n\nThe feature is officially called as \"Bothies\". It sounds a bit awkward but at least we know it's Nokia that wants to make it a household name. The company has this tagline: Be less Selfie. Be more #Bothie. It's up to you how you will take advantage of this feature. If you think about it, it's actually a levelled-up selfie as made possible by the Dual-Sight mode, 4K video recording, and Nokia OZO spatial 360\u00b0 audio.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is equipped with a 5.3-inch IPS LCD screen, 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution, Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 4GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 processor, 64GB onboard storage, microSD card slot for storage expansion (up to 256GB), 13MP + 13MP dual rear cameras with ZEISS optics, Bluetooth 5.0, 3.5mm headphone jack, and a 3090 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 technology. The phone runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat OS out of the box but it can be upgraded to Android O once the latter is available.\n\nHMD Global will roll out the Nokia 8 next month. Europe will get it first on September 6 with a 599 Euro ($705) starting price. Feel free to choose among these color options: Polished Copper, Steel, Tempered Blue, and Polished Blue.

This phone is without a doubt a flagship level phone that is headed for Europe in September. It may never come to the US, but should it, you'll know about it, thanks to this post.\n\nThe Nokia 8 features a 5.3-inch QHD LCD display, Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, 3090mAh battery, Nokia OZO Audio, and dual rear 13MP cameras with ZEISS optics. It's packed, see?\n\nOutside of the specs, HMD says that the Nokia 8 has the \"most advanced aluminium unibody design to date.\" The process for creating this phone starts wit ha single block of 6000 series aluminium and is then refined over 40 stages that includes machining, anodizing, and polishing. Some models take over 20 hours to complete. That seems a bit much and also kind of cool. Like, I'd brag about that sh*t to my nerd friends all day, every day.\n\nThe phone also includes a Dual-Sight feature that uses both front and rear cameras to help you live stream to the world. HMD is referring to this as #Bothie, which is embarrassing on a number of levels. What's not embarrassing is the audio experience you should get with the OZO Audio I mentioned above. This 3-mic setup allows for spatial surround sound capture that'll make your 4K videos melt he hearts of ears.\n\nFinally, HMD reminds us in today's announcements that they ship pure Android on Nokia phones and the Nokia 8 is no different. With monthly security updates and regular additional updates, Nokia phones might be the non-Pixel choice for Android purists.\n\nAgain, the Nokia 8 is not headed to the US as far as we know, but should rollout in Europe throughout September.", "id": "9565956", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8, a Flagship Phone Made by HMD, is Official for Europe With ZEISS Optics | Droid Life", "image": "http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nokia-8-blue.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microphone"}, "id": "307750", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head-mounted display"}, "id": "308313", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-mounted_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Surround sound"}, "id": "333958", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anodizing"}, "id": "370540", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anodizing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia phone series"}, "id": "513559", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_phone_series"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "21:16:00"}

It took over the Nokia feature phones business in December and has a licensing deal giving it sole use of the Nokia brand on all phones and tablets.\n\nIt has so far launched four smartphones and five feature phones, including the 3310. [nL5N1GB0JW}\n\nRantala said he was happy with initial sales of the previous smartphones, but declined to disclose any sales figures yet.\n\nHMD will pay Nokia royalties for the brand and patents.\n\nLast month, HMD announced that its CEO Arto Nummela, a former Nokia executive, was leaving the company for personal reasons, without elaborating.

With only 4.6mm thin at the edge and 7.3mm slim on average, the flagship device's unibody is made from 6000 series aluminium with select models featuring a high-gloss mirror finish.\n\nThe Android device, due out in September, will potentially beat rivals on price but will still face fierce competition, with Apple's highly anticipated 10th anniversary iPhone also expected next month and Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 set to hit the market next week.\n\nBut apart from trying to rival Apple and Samsung, the company has another challenge at hand: fighting the brand's tumultuous past. Here is Nokia's story so far, as tracked in a piece by The Guardian:\n\nNokia dominated the mobile phone market for the more than a decade from the late 1990s, but was left trailing behind Apple and Samsung in the smartphone era following the launch of the iPhone in 2007. The Finnish company sold its loss-making mobile devices division to Microsoft in 2013 to focus on its telecoms network equipment business.\n\nNow a group of former Nokia executives, backed by private equity, have formed the new company HMD Global and bought back their former employer's feature phone business from Microsoft , aiming to bring the Nokia handset brand back to its former glory with a range of new smartphones.\n\nNokia was founded in 1865 as a pulp mill near the town of Tampere and once made everything from toilet paper to car tyres, before the Espoo-headquartered company moved in to communications technology in the 1980s. In 1985 Nokia launched its first mobile phone, the Mobira Talkman, but it was 1987's Cityman which shot to fame when pictured in use by Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nBy 1998, Nokia had overtaken mobile phone pioneer Motorola to become the bestselling global mobile phone brand, manufacturing its 100-millionth phone by December that year, with revenues of $20bn (then \u00a313bn) and 55,000 staff by the year 2000.\n\nThe Nokia 3310 was launched in 2000, with the world's bestselling phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, appearing in 2003. Nokia also launched the first camera phone in the US in 2003, partnering with the German optics manufacturer Carl Zeiss in 2005.\n\nNokia launched the world's first smartphone in 1996 - the Nokia 9000 Communicator - and a series of popular smartphones using its Symbian operating system followed in the early 2000s. But Nokia's long slide from relevance started with the launch of Apple's iPhone, which used superior touchscreen technology and left the Finnish firm's keypad-based handsets looking decidedly vintage.\n\nNokia struggled to make competitive Symbian-based smartphones and in 2011 partnered with Microsoft to develop handsets using the Windows Phone operating system, such as the Lumia 800. But with shrinking market share and mounting losses, Nokia bowed out of the mobile handset business two years later.

It has licensed lens technology from cameramaker Zeiss.\n\nIt is the most high-end phone so far from HMD, which was set up late last year and made a splash in May when it revived Nokia's classic 3310 feature handset in new brightly colored versions.\n\nOther features of the Nokia 8, which will also compete with Huawei's recently launched P10, include surround-sound audio technology made for Nokia's own virtual reality camera OZO for Hollywood professionals.\n\n\"This is especially meant for millennial creators, people who want to share what's happening every day,\" HMD chief marketing officer Pekka Rantala said.\n\nHMD products are built by a unit of Foxconn Technology Group (\u5bcc\u58eb\u5eb7), which acquired the manufacturing and distribution assets of the former Nokia phone business from Microsoft Corp last year.\n\nOnce the world's dominant phonemaker, Nokia Oyj sold its handset operations to Microsoft in 2014, leaving it to focus on telecoms network equipment.\n\nHMD is owned by Smart Connect LP, a private equity fund managed by Jean-Francois Baril, a long-serving former senior vice president of Nokia.\n\nIt took over the Nokia feature phones business in December last year and has a licensing deal giving it sole use of the Nokia brand on all phones and tablets.\n\nLast month, HMD announced that CEO Arto Nummela, a former Nokia executive, was leaving the company for personal reasons, without elaborating.", "id": "9740633", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "HMD's Nokia 8 handset aims to woo 'creators' - Taipei Times", "image": "http://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2017/08/18/thumbs/P10-170818-326.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business"}, "id": "302720", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}, "id": "308699", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Foxconn"}, "id": "322094", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "17:07:00"}

HMD Global's smartphone comes with premium design, top-of-the-line specifications, and it will be competing against other flagship devices in the high-end segment. The Nokia 8 is priced at \u20ac599 (approximately Rs 45,000), and is set to go on sale globally early September. Some of the publications got hands-on time with the new Nokia 8, and here's a look at their first impressions.\n\nSince the launch of the first Nokia-branded Android smartphones, HMD Global hasn't stopped highlighting the design. With the Nokia 8 it is no different either. As Pocket-lint puts it, \"The Nokia 8 starts life as a block of aluminium, hewn into smartphone form, with a soft curve across the back and rounded edges to make it sit comfortably in the hand.\"\n\nThe Nokia 8 will be available in four colors - Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue, and Steel. Two of the colors come with a glossy finish, while the other two come with a less glamorous matt finish, albeit with more grip. \"It's particularly smart of Nokia to let customers choose between matt and polished finishes - we like that a lot - because while the polished finish looks more striking, the matt finishes offer more grip. It's a tough choice, but good to let consumers make that decision,\" T3 says.\n\nUnder the hood is Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 SoC paired with 4GB of RAM. On paper at least the smartphone seems more than capable of handling any and every task thrown at it, and early impressions across publications are in line with that. What also aids in good performance is the fact that the Nokia 8 runs on stock Android 7.1.1 out-of-the-box. The company has promised Android O update as soon as Google rolls it out.\n\nWhat's caught everyone's eye is however the cooling system underneath. HMD Global says that Nokia 8 comes with graphite shielded copper cooling pipes that dissipate heat across the length and breadth of the handset. As GSMArena notes, \"...we want to commend HMD on how cool the Nokia 8 runs. The heat pipe and graphite shield must be doing some work as we re-ran multiple benchmarks in quick succession and the phone didn't even feel warm. Seriously, we can't tell where the chipset is by feel (usually, it's obvious on phones with poor heat management).\"\n\nAmong the highlights of the Nokia 8 is the dual-camera setup at the back, and the smartphone is being touted as one that is aimed at content creators. The setup includes a pair of 13-megapixel snappers - one shoots in RGB, and one in monochrome. The camera has been developed in partnership with Carl ZEISS. But the company is focusing on a feature it calls 'Bothie'. In essence, the Nokia 8 camera lets users shoot photos or videos using both the front and back cameras simultaneously. There is also a feature to livestream on social media directly from the camera app.\n\nThe dual-camera setup, and the Bothie feature is clearly designed with the over-sharing millennials in mind. \"The focus on livestreaming underscores where the new Nokia is headed as it targets a younger crowd more likely to use the feature on Snapchat or Instagram,\" Cnet says. \"It marks the latest comeback attempt from the brand, which was once the largest phone maker in the world by far but was ultimately crushed by newer players like Apple, Google and Samsung.\"\n\nSo far, early impressions about the Nokia 8 have been quite positive. But we will get a closer look at how good the smartphone is, once the first reviews are out.

The price of the Nokia 8 is expected to cross Rs 40,000 mark.\n\nWatch Video: Top 4 Dual Camera Smartphones", "id": "9578006", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 Set to Launch Today: Snapdragon 835, Dual Cameras And More in Store", "image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/07/Nokia-8-specs-price.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "id": "302869", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}, "id": "312003", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dual SIM"}, "id": "322106", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_SIM"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ampere-hour"}, "id": "345804", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere-hour"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia Lumia 920"}, "id": "707786", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_920"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 466, "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 468, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "06:33:00"}

In short, there are few huge features included in the update-which is out today for select beta testers-but lots of small improvements that should improve the system's functionality overall. The upcoming PS4 5.0 system update includes new family controls, improved notifications, new live gameplay broadcasts features and more.\n\nThe Quick Menu, which can be accessed by pressing and holding down the PS button on the DualShock 4 controller, has also been updated. Multiple parent/guardians can be part of the same family, all with parental controls over child accounts. You can also set different controls for individual child accounts, if little X is growing up fast and ready to play Helldivers (no, seriously, it's good) but little Y should stick to games that don't let you drop orbital pods on strangers. For example, you can create a custom list of your Destiny teammates and easily send them raid invites.\n\nIf the head of a community on PS4 the option to bind that community to one's broadcast is now available. When a broadcast is linked, a community button appears on the Live from PlayStation spectator screen. This allows any spectator to go directly to the community page to look over details or join. PS4 Pro users will be able to stream in 1080p and 60 FPS, provided their connection is strong enough, and PSVR users will be able to see new messages and comments coming through while broadcasting.\n\nWith the ability to share music to Twitter and Facebook via PlayStation music now PS4 will support sharing music through messages as well. With the new update, users will be able to directly send songs and Spotify links via the PlayStation 4's messaging system, in addition to the PlayStation mobile app.\n\nWe've added a new setting that allows you to disable pop-up notifications while you're watching a movie or TV show on your PS4. It should be noted this feature will be turned off by default, but can easily be flicked on by going into the system settings after verifying the PlayStation 4 is on firmware 5.00.\n\nYou can now turn off message previews on your pop-up notifications. If you turn this setting off, the pop-up notification will hide the message senders' online ID and will display a generic user icon and message instead.\n\nYou can now change the color of your pop-up notifications to either white (default) or black.\n\nPlayStation VR now supports 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound through your headphones when watching Blu-rays and DVDs in Cinematic Mode, making for an even more immersive viewing experience. Now, users will be able to view more notifications inside the Quick Menu.\n\nIf you want to keep an eye out on what's happening in your Notifications tab - like game download progress or new invitations - you can now access this directly from the Quick Menu without leaving your game.\n\nYou will also be able to \"Leave Party\" from the same menu during a gaming session. This makes it easier for you to see the current tournament standings.\n\nThe following system language options on PS4 have been added: Indonesian, Thai, Vietnamese, Czech, Greek, Romanian, and Hungarian.\n\nThe PS4 5.0 system update also adds a new tournaments bracket viewer.", "id": "9808945", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "PS4 Firmware Update 5.0 Beta Out Today", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Music"}, "id": "302636", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop music"}, "id": "303105", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television program"}, "id": "303532", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spotify"}, "id": "307723", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}, "id": "310704", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay"}, {"label": {"eng": "First-person shooter"}, "id": "314284", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter"}, {"label": {"eng": "DVD"}, "id": "318168", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD"}, {"label": {"eng": "Immersion (virtual reality)"}, "id": "325828", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_(virtual_reality)"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}, "id": "340359", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Firmware"}, "id": "345389", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware"}, {"label": {"eng": "DualShock 4"}, "id": "346338", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DualShock#DualShock_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "7.1 surround sound"}, "id": "371798", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental controls"}, "id": "398807", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual surround"}, "id": "526394", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_surround"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop-up notification"}, "id": "650501", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_notification"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blu-ray"}, "id": "1197211", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation VR"}, "id": "1270845", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_VR"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Games"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 201, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1096, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms"}], "time": "16:24:00"}

Watching the videos below, we learn how the Nokia phones design team at HMD Global planned the smartphone. Perhaps the phone's main selling point is the Dual-Sight mode that allows dual live-streaming or recording. The phone is able to show us both sides so you can be \"in the moment\" more.\n\nThe device is also said to take heat better with the bespoke heat pipe and graphite shield that remove the heat across the body. The result is an obviously cooler device for battery conservation.

The company, which is now under the brand HMD Global, announced the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 in March but the true flagship contender comes in the form of the Nokia 8.\n\nHow does the Nokia 8 compare to its tough competition though? We have put the company's flagship device up against the Android smartphone king - the Samsung Galaxy S8 - to see how the two devices stack up against each other.\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes complete with rounded corners, a softly-curved back and a premium metal design that oozes quality. It will be available in polished copper, polished blue, a matt temperate blue and a steel finish.\n\nIt measures 151.5 x 73.7 x 7.9mm and it features minimal branding, a rectangular button on the front below the screen that doubles up as fingerprint sensor, and a slim vertical dual-camera and flash array on the rear. The Nokia 8's display has very slim bezels on the sides, but quite large bezels at the top and bottom.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 features a metal and glass design with exceptionally slim bezels surrounding the dual-edged display. It's almost all-screen on the front, with no physical buttons in sight, while the rear has a single-lens camera with a flash module to the left and a rectangular fingerprint sensor to the right.\n\nSamsung's smaller flagship measures 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0mm and it hits the scales at 155g, making it smaller than the Nokia 8. The Galaxy S8 has IP68 water and dust resistance, something not specified for the Nokia 8, and it delivers an overall fabulous design that is available in six colour options.\n\nThere was talk of the Nokia 8 appearing in two sizes, like the S8 does, but instead it arrives in just one 5.3-inch screen size featuring a standard 16:9 aspect ratio, which is why it sits within a larger footprint than the S8 despite a smaller screen.\n\nNokia opts for an LCD display, coupled with a Quad HD resolution at 2560 x 1440, which puts the new flagship's pixel density at 554ppi. Nothing has been mentioned Mobile HDR compliancy so we assume it isn't on the new device but there is Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection is on board.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 features a 5.8-inch display within its relatively small footprint, thanks to its 18.5:9 aspect ratio. As we briefly mentioned previously, the S8 has a dual-edge display, making it more exciting than some flat-display devices, while it also offers Mobile HDR Premium technology.\n\nIn terms of resolution, the Galaxy S8 opts for Quad HD+, which translates to 2960 x 1440 for a pixel density of 570ppi, making it slightly sharper than the Nokia 8. Samsung also uses Super AMOLED panels in its flagship devices, meaning punchy, vibrant colours, even if not as realistic as LCD.\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes complete with dual 13-megapixel rear cameras, along with a 13-megapixel front camera, all of which feature Zeiss lenses. The rear cameras are made up of one RGB sensor and one monochrome sensor, like the Huawei P10, and they offer an aperture of f/2.0 and phase detection autofocus, as does the front camera.\n\nNokia has also launched a Dual-Sight camera mode on the Nokia 8, which allows users to use both the front and rear cameras simultaneously in order to capture a photo or video of both yourself and the subject to then upload to a social media platform like Facebook or YouTube.\n\nMeanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy S8 doesn't opt for a dual-rear camera setup. Instead, there is a 12-megapixel single lens rear camera with a f/1.7 aperture lens, optical image stabilisation and 8x digital zoom.\n\nThe front camera has an 8-megapixel sensor, also with an aperture of f/1.7 and it comes with autofocus. Both the front and rear cameras of the S8 produce excellent results so even if it wins the megapixel battle, the Nokia 8 has a big task ahead in terms of camera capability.\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 platform under its hood, coupled with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. Like the existing Nokia Android phones, the Nokia 8 also comes with a microSD slot for storage expansion.\n\nBattery capacity sits at 3090mAh, is non-removable and charged via USB Type-C with Quick Charge 3.0 supported. There is also a 3.5mm headphone jack at the top of the Nokia 8 and the device features Ozo audio that binaurally encodes the surround sound it captures so it will be available to everyone.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 runs on either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, or the Exynos 8895, depending on the region. Both devices come with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and they both have microSD support for storage expansion up to 256GB.\n\nThe S8 has a battery capacity of 3000mAh, a little smaller than the Nokia 8 and Galaxy S8+ that has 3500mAh, and it too is charged via USB Type-C. The S8 also has a 3.5mm headphone jack and it supports 32-bit audio playback.\n\nThe current Nokia Android phones all run on pure Android Nougat with Google Assistant and the Nokia 8 does the same.\n\nAside from a tweaked camera, there is no bloatware or pre-installed apps, aside from a support app, and Nokia has said it is aiming for the Nokia 8 to be one of the first devices to offer Android O.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 on the other hand, runs on Android Nougat with Samsung's TouchWiz user interface over the top. That means you'll get more bloatware on the Samsung than the Nokia and therefore a different experience, but the S8 interface is great.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will go on sale globally in early September for \u20ac599, which is around \u00a3550.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 is available now and costs \u00a3689, making it quite a bit more expensive than Nokia's new flagship.\n\nThe Nokia 8 and the Samsung Galaxy S8 both offer premium designs and flagship specs.\n\nThe Nokia 8 doesn't have as large a display as the S8, nor does it offer the latest technology like Mobile HDR, but it is a slimmer device overall, it offers a pure Android software experience with quick updates likely and it has a dual-camera setup on the rear.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 on the other hand has a larger, sharper display, a design that could be considered more exciting and although a single rear camera lens, it's an excellent one.\n\nThe decision between these two handsets will likely come down to budget, as well as which design tickles your fancy more, as well as which features matter to you most. we will update this feature when we have reviewed the Nokia 8.", "id": "9544640", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 vs Samsung Galaxy S8: What's the difference?

The smartphone has been making rounds on the web in the form of leaks and rumours. The smartphone was once also seen in a video posted by a former Nokia designer. Past rumours and leaks have given us enough news on how it would look like and what specifications it will include.\n\nNokia 8 launch details\n\nHMD has not yet given an exact time of the launch of its Nokia 8 . We would have to wait and see when the device finally gets unveiled. Nonetheless, the smartphone for sure will be arriving today. Based on the invitations, HMD Global will be launching the new smartphone in London.\n\nNokia 8's expected price\n\nWe are still far from assuming exactly how much the Nokia 8 will cost in the UK or anywhere else for that matter. The smartphone however, based on the leaked specifications will definitely have a more stratospheric price tag than the Nokia 6. The smartphone will definitely be hitting the Indian shelves but it might take a month or so, based on the track record of HMD.\n\nNokia 8 rumoured specifications and features\n\nThe Nokia 8 may be HMD Global's first smartphone to come with dual rear cameras. The handset, based on leaks and rumours, will be sporting a vertical dual rear camera setup powered by Carl Zeiss lenses. Unlike other flagships, the smartphone won't be sporting a bezel-less design. It could also be made available in four colour variants - Steel, Gold+Copper, Gold+Blue and Blue.\n\nAs for specifications, the Nokia 8 is said to run on Android 7.1 Nougat and includes a 5.3-inch QHD screen. The device may also get Android O later , like the case with the existing Nokia 3, 5 and 6. It is supposed to pack the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor under the hood, clubbed with either 4GB or 6GB RAM.

It has licensed lens technology from camera maker Zeiss.\n\nIt is the most high-end phone so far from HMD, which was set up late last year and made a splash in May when it revived Nokia's classic 3310 feature handset in new brightly coloured versions.\n\nOther features of the Nokia 8, which will also compete with Huawei's recently launched P10, include surround-sound audio technology made for Nokia's own virtual reality camera OZO for Hollywood professionals.\n\n\"This is especially meant for millennial creators, people who want to share what's happening every day,\" HMD's chief marketing officer Pekka Rantala said.\n\nHMD products are built by a unit of Foxconn, which acquired the manufacturing and distribution assets of the former Nokia phone business from Microsoft last year.\n\nOnce the world's dominant phonemaker, Nokia Oyj sold its handset operations to Microsoft in 2014, leaving it to focus on telecoms network equipment.\n\nHMD is owned by Smart Connect LP, a private equity fund managed by Jean-Francois Baril, a long-serving former senior vice president of Nokia.

The Nokia 8 brings three world-firsts to Android smartphones, including a debut collaboration with ZEISS optics. With performance and pure Android at its heart, as well as the most advanced aluminium unibody design to date, the Nokia 8 represents all the hallmarks of a true flagship Nokia smartphone.\n\nBe less Selfie, be more Bothie: The Nokia 8 introduces a world-first in enabling Dual-Sight video to be livestreamed natively and in real-time to social feeds such as Facebook and YouTube. Dual-Sight simultaneously harnesses both the front and rear cameras in a split screen visual for both photos and videos. With just one touch, this world-first livestream capability gives more immersive experiences for those who love to create and share special memories.\n\nNokia 8 is also the first smartphone to feature Nokia OZO Audio, placing exclusive Hollywood technology in the palm of your hand. OZO spatial 360\u00b0 audio brings a fully immersive audio experience to your 4K video. Leading-edge 360\u00b0 audio capture ensures the playback lets you truly relive the moment so your memories never fade.\n\n4.6mm thin at the edge and just 7.3mm slim on average, Nokia 8's seamless unibody is precision milled from a single block of 6000 series aluminium and its pure design has been refined through a 40-stage process of machining, anodizing and polishing. Select models feature a high-gloss mirror finish that has taken over 20 hours to complete to achieve a flawless look. The phone features Qualcomm's powerful SnapdragonTM 835 Mobile Platform and paired with the pure, secure and up to date Android experience ensures outstanding performance.\n\nBe less Selfie, be more #Bothie\n\nThere are two sides to every story and the Dual-Sight feature of Nokia 8 is designed to help you create and share the full picture. The front and rear-facing cameras on the Nokia 8 have been co-developed with ZEISS optics for an optimum all round experience. Content creators can natively broadcast their unique #Bothie stories to social media through the Dual-Sight functionality located within the camera app. Fans can also enjoy unlimited[i] photo and video uploads to Google Photos.\n\nA new dimension of sound with OZO Audio\n\nFeaturing OZO Audio, Nokia 8 combines three microphones with exclusive Nokia acoustic algorithms to capture audio with immersive 360\u00b0 spatial surround sound. Share your 4K videos with OZO Audio anywhere - binaural codecs enable high fidelity playback even on devices without OZO Audio.\n\nInnovation and precision engineering\n\nPowered by the Qualcomm\u00ae SnapdragonTM 835 Mobile Platform, Nokia 8 doesn't compromise on performance.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has been designed from the ground up with the consumer in mind to deliver unique content capture and sharing experiences. This requires it to be as meticulously designed on the inside as it is on the outside. To keep your phone working harder for longer, the design, innovation and engineering teams worked hand-in-hand to deliver. The result is a full-length graphite shielded copper cooling pipe that dissipates the heat generated by the high performing system across the full length and breadth of the handset. The Nokia 8 runs cooler in even the most demanding situations.\n\nNokia 8 is Qualcomm\u00ae Quick ChargeTM 3.0 compatible, meaning when your battery is running low you can get back to recording your important moments sooner.\n\nJuho Sarvikas, Chief Product Officer of HMD Global, said:\n\n\"We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media. People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own. It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance.\"\n\nAlways pure Android\n\nNokia smartphones always offer a pure Android experience, with no unnecessary apps slowing down the performance of your device. And with Nokia 8, pure Android combined with our innovative engineering processes unleashes the full potential of the SnapdragonTM 835 Mobile Platform. With monthly security updates, the Nokia 8 is safe and up-to-date. Your device is secured with biometric fingerprint authentication, delivering enhanced security and making Nokia 8 a versatile companion whatever your needs.\n\nAccessories\n\nWe offer a range of accessories perfectly tailored to suit the active lifestyle of any Nokia 8 owner. The Nokia 8 works beautifully with the Nokia Active Wireless Headset - a lightweight, water, sweat, and dust proof premium headset.

Since the brand returned to the smartphone market this year, it has concentrated on the mid-range sector. It's now turning its sights towards a premium product. The Nokia 8 is a phone designed for content creators, according to its own creator HMD Global. As with all the new Nokia Android phones, the handset isn't really built by the Finnish name. Chinese manufacturer HMD is behind the device but it has worked closely with the Nokia company to develop its design and features. This is most evident in one of the 8's headline hardware capabilities. It comes with support for Nokia OZO Audio, a spatial 360-degree sound solution derived from Nokia's innovative OZO camera. The Nokia 8 will make 4K video more immersive by including spatial sound, offering more accurate replication of the environment where it was shot. It uses three microphones and Nokia's acoustic algorithms to create the videos. They can be played on any device, including ones without OZO Audio built-in. READ NEXT: Next year's high-end smartphones might have AR as standard Design-wise, the Nokia 8 continues HMD's trend of blending classic Nokia lines with contemporary counterparts from the smartphone industry. The phone is built from an aluminium unibody which is passed through a 40-stage anodizing and polishing process. It incorporates a graphite shielded cooling pipe to dissipate heat and is available with an optional glossy mirror finish. The phone is 7.3mm thick at its highest point, tapering to 4.6mm at the sides. Underneath, Nokia has included a typical hardware configuration for 2017's flagship phones. The 8 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of expandable storage and an array of supporting hardware including a fingerprint sensor and USB Type-C. Both the primary and front cameras have 13MP sensors. A large 3,090mAh battery completes the package. HMD said the Nokia 8 is supposed to reflect the trends in mobile use towards ephemeral and live content. By creating a device focused on video, sound and streaming, it wants to appeal to people who use their phone to capture the world around them. With only a 5.3-inch QHD display, it's still relatively compact though, preserving a true mobile experience. READ NEXT: Samsung says the Galaxy Note 8 will 'do bigger things' \"We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media. People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own,\" said HMD Global Chief Product officer Juho Sarvikas. \"It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, and outstanding experience and powerful performance.\" The Nokia 8 will launch in September with an expected retail price of \u20ac599, varying by market. Four colours, Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue and Steel, will be available. Like Nokia's other Android phones to date, the 8 runs a stock version of the operating system and comes with monthly security updates. HMD said the use of Android 7.1.1 Nougat in an unaltered form offers a \"pure\" experience that makes the phone \"a versatile companion.\"", "id": "9715691", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia unveils its new flagship smartphone", "image": "http://www.digitaljournal.com/img/3/7/9/5/3/4/i/3/5/3/p-large/Nokia_8_Range.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microphone"}, "id": "307750", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile computing"}, "id": "326934", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_computing"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB Type-C"}, "id": "1270770", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_Type-C"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "14:58:00"}

the Nokia 8 - and it comes with one very unusual feature.\n\nThe new device, which the firm said will cost \u20ac599 (\u00a3546), comes with split screen camera feature called Dual Sight which combines a photo or video from the front and rear-facing cameras at the same time.\n\nThe result is what Nokia is calling a \"Bothie\", which the company hopes will offer a new take on selfies.\n\nThe Nokia brand is now under licence to Finnish start-up HMD Global, which sparked the firm's revival earlier this year with the launch of three mid-range Android phones - the Nokia 3,5 and 6, as well as a revamped version of the 17-year-old 3310.\n\nThe flagship Nokia 8 features dual 13-megapixel rear cameras, as well as a 13-megapixel front-facing camera, while both the front and rear cameras feature optics technology from imaging giant Zeiss, who announced a new partnership with Nokia and HMD Global last month.\n\nZeiss technology is also being used to help improve the quality of photos taken on the 8, Nokia said, with \"image fusion algorithms\" in place to combine images captured by the two rear lenses into single photos.\n\nThe new phone also houses spatial audio technology previously only used in Nokia's high-end OZO 360 camera, which can play back sound in multiple directions, imitating how it was captured during recording.\n\nThe phone's specifications place it as a rival to the likes of Apple's iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S8 in the current smartphone market.\n\nHMD Global confirmed the phone will go on sale in \"early September\" and said the device was aimed at social media users and video creators.\n\n\"We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media,\" HMD chief product officer Juho Sarvikas said.\n\n\"People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own.\n\n\"It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance.\"\n\nLive video captured using the 8's Dual Sight mode can be shared directly to Facebook or YouTube from within the phone's Camera app.\n\nNokia and HMD Global's unveiling comes a week before Samsung is due to announce its next Note 8 smartphone, the first since the Note 7 was discontinued last year over battery fires and safety fears.\n\nThe next iPhone, marking 10 years since the device first launched, is also expected to be announced in September.", "id": "9647038", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Forget selfies -

Nokia is putting a huge focus on the camera in this video, and also the phone's 'Nokia OZO' audio, that is actually more or less it as far as this main ad is concerned.\n\nThe second ad is called 'Nokia 8 - Form and Function', and you'll be able to see Alasdair Mcphail and Raun Forsyth talk about the design of the Nokia 8 in this video. Both of those people are a part of HMD Global's Nokia design team, and if you'd like to know more about the design itself, this is the video you should take a look at. The third clip is named 'Nokia 8 - Inside Tech', and it focuses on the phone's camera and its features. The Nokia 8 actually comes with the 'Dual Sight' feature, which essentially means that the Nokia 8 can fire up rear-facing cameras, and the phone's front-facing camera at the same time, and stream their content for you. Nokia actually claims that the Snapdragon 835 is one of the main reasons this is possible, while the company also talks about the cooling pipe and the graphite chip, which are here to ensure that such graphically-intensive tasks don't affect the Nokia 8's performance.\n\nThe fourth video Nokia released talks about the Nokia OZO Audio which is also a part of the Nokia 8. Nokia compares OZO Audio to regular stereo audio, and OZO Audio definitely takes the cake here. You will basically see a number of comparisons in this video, which should give you a better idea as to how powerful Nokia OZO Audio is. The last video also focuses on the Nokia OZO Audio, though in this video you actually get some behind-the-scenes info about the Nokia OZO Audio.", "id": "9735848", "details": {"gpCnt": 3, "liCnt": 15}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia Released Five Video Ads For Its New Nokia 8 Flagship | Androidheadlines.com", "image": "https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Nokia-8-Main-Press-01-1.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 57, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 615, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Production", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Production"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 655, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/AudioVisual", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/AudioVisual"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 762, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 869, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital Video", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital_Video"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 870, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Marketing Support Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Marketing_Support_Services"}], "time": "12:15:00"}

The phone it announced last night completes its modern reincarnation, which began at Mobile World Congress earlier this year.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is the HMD Global-owned brand's answer to the likes of Samsung Galaxy S8, OnePlus 5, Google Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus. And its pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance for now seems to be the 'bothie'.\n\nIt's not as self-obsessed as a selfie, that's what a bothie is. Where most smartphone cameras only let you shoot video from either its front or rear camera, at any given time, the Nokia 8 will allow you to shoot and stream live videos on Facebook and YouTube that turns on and captures video from both its front and rear camera.\n\nDual-Sight, to give bothie its proper technical term, is capable of capturing 4K widescreen videos from both cameras simultaneously, dividing the screen into two halves, where you can simultaneously view the selfie video side-by-side with the rear video. Pretty cool or completely pointless? The jury's out on that one. But apart from its unimaginative nomenclature, a bothie's success or failure will heavily depend on how entrenched Nokia 8 buyers will be on the online social circuit.\n\nBesides bothie, the Nokia 8 has several other talking points. It marks the return of Zeiss lenses in the smartphone fold, something that past Nokia phones were renowned for.\n\nThe Nokia 8 sports a unibody 6000 aluminium series shell, with four colour options with two matte and two glossy versions. It can withstand just a few splashes of water, and it isn't advisable to take it for a full dip in the pool.\n\nThere are two 13MP cameras on the rear panel of the Nokia 8 -- one colour, one monochrome -- with support for optical image stabilisation, phase detection autofocus, and a wide f/2.0 aperture built into the camera optics. Like the current crop of Android flagships in the market, the Nokia 8 will also be capable of shooting good low-light shots with enhanced portrait capture mode.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is powered by the best smartphone chip in the market, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, which is paired with 4GB of RAM. HMD Global's making available both single SIM and dual SIM variants of the phone -- but watch out, the dual SIM version has a hybrid slot, which means you'll have to toss a coin between the microSD card and a double SIM. The Nokia 8's QHD 5.3-inch display sports a 2560\u00d71440 resolution and is shielded from knocks, bumps and scratches by Gorilla Glass 5.\n\nNokia 8 has a 3090mAh battery with Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 support, and a USB-C port. It also comes with stock (bloatware-free) Android Nougat 7.1.1 baked in, and HMD Global claims it's going to be first smartphone to get Google's next Android O update. Thankfully, it also has a 3.5mm audio jack to plug in a headphone, if you wanted to.\n\nNokia 8 is also featuring Nokia OZO Audio, which brings OZO spatial 360\u00b0 audio to your 4K video. The technology has trickled down from old Nokia's OZO VR capture camera for professionals, and not for consumers. Thanks to high dynamic range microphones, the Nokia 8 will be able to capture distortion-free, spatial audio for enhanced immersiveness in 360\u00b0 videos.", "id": "9623760", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 Wants To Introduce You To A 'Bothie' Very Soon & Make You Fall In Love With It!", "image": "http://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2017/Aug/fb_1502949120_800x420.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dual SIM"}, "id": "322106", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_SIM"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile World Congress"}, "id": "367449", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_World_Congress"}, {"label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}, "id": "368054", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia phone series"}, "id": "513559", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_phone_series"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 57, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 655, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/AudioVisual", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/AudioVisual"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 762, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 869, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital Video", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital_Video"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "06:26:00"}

The fingerprint sensor moves to the back, because there's simply no room for it elsewhere.\n\nThere's no telling when the Nokia 9 will actually arrive, but hopefully it's sooner rather than later. It has been rumored to sport the Snapdragon 835 at the helm, 6 or 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, an iris scanner, and IP68 certification for water and dust resistance.

It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance.\"\n\nAside from the Nokia 3310, HMD Global has been working on a number of other handsets, including the Nokia 6, which debuted at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in February.\n\nQuiz: What do you know about Nokia?", "id": "9736041", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 Hopes Dual Camera Streaming Will Capture Android Market", "image": "http://www.silicon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Nokia-8-2.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Computer security"}, "id": "304781", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Operating system"}, "id": "307345", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Telecommunication"}, "id": "308796", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malware"}, "id": "311949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 151, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 760, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Slavic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Slavic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 922, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1057, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services"}], "time": "09:15:00"}

Parents or Guardians can restrict Child accounts in their \"use of online features and communication with other players, set restrictions for games, restrict the use of the internet browser, and set spending limits for PlayStation Store\".\n\nManaging a friends list on any console is always a bit of a pain, PS4 is remedying that with the new feature of a \"Custom Lists\" tab.\n\nIn place of the current \"Favorite Groups\" tab, a new \"Custom Lists\" tab has been added within Friends, which allows you to create and edit custom lists of your friends.\n\nWe've added a new setting in PlayStation VR: \"Display Message to Spectators and Spectators\" Comments'. Once this is enabled, spectator comments sent during a broadcast are displayed not only in cinematic mode, but also in VR mode - so you'll be able to read comments and interact with spectators from within your PS VR headset.\n\nNew setting allows the user to disable pop-up notifications while watching a movie or TV show on PS4. This setting is set to off by default but can be enabled if the user wishes. The color of the pop-up can also be changed to either white or black. PlayStation users will also have the option to turn off message previews on pop-up notifications. That way you can see the progress of a download, for example.\n\nWith the update, users can set up as many adults as they want per family to have administration rights over child/sub accounts on their console.\n\nThe Quick Menu has seen some tweaks too making it even easier to access features without having to pause whatever one might be doing.\n\nIt's a hefty update that brings some great features to the PS4 and PS4 Pro only improving upon the changes and features already added and built in. PSVR is also adding 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound support. This will work for Spotify and PlayStation Music. Shared tracks can be listened to directly from the message or through the Spotify app from the PS Messages app on mobile and added to a playlist.\n\nThe final piece for this update is new system language additions, update 5.0 giving PS4: Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Romanian, Thai and Vietnamese.\n\nSony's outlined the full list of features that you can expect to find in PlayStation 4 firmware update v5.00, and it's much the same as what leaked recently.\n\nChosen participants will start receiving an email today with instructions on how to download and install the update.", "id": "9808946", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "PS4 5.0 Update Fully Detailed, Beta Launches Today", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop music"}, "id": "303105", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television program"}, "id": "303532", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video game console"}, "id": "304421", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"}, {"label": {"eng": "Web browser"}, "id": "306026", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}, "id": "307034", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spotify"}, "id": "307723", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}, "id": "340359", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitch (website)"}, "id": "349819", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(website)"}, {"label": {"eng": "7.1 surround sound"}, "id": "371798", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental controls"}, "id": "398807", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Store"}, "id": "431033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Store"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual surround"}, "id": "526394", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_surround"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation VR"}, "id": "1270845", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_VR"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Music"}, "id": "1437736", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Music"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1096, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms"}], "time": "15:24:00"}

There's a 13MP dual setup on the rear of the phone, which - much like the camera on the Huawei P10 - pairs RGB and monochrome sensors for better image quality. There's also a 13MP sensor on the front of the phone.\n\nHMD has added what it calls a \"bothie\" mode (ugh) that will activate both the front and rear cameras to capture phones and videos. Unlike the similar functionality found on Samsung smartphones, the Nokia 8 is also capable of broadcasting this video to Facebook or Youtube.\n\nHMD has also added Ozo Audio, which means that much like Nokia's futuristic VR camera, the Nokia 8 will capture 360-degree audio, allowing for it to be broadcast live on streams.\n\nJuho Sarvikas, chief product officer at HMD Global, swooned: \"We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media.\n\n\"People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own. It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance.\"\n\nThe Nokia 8 will ship running Android 7.1.1, and HMD has said that it'll be updated to Android O once it becomes available. At launch, it will be available in Polished Blue, Polished Copper, and Tempered Blue and Steel colour options.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will be available in Europe from September, and will fetch \u20ac599 (around \u00a3550) SIM-free. Exact UK pricing details have not yet been announced. \u00b5", "id": "9702385", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8: Android 'flagship' official with Snapdragon 835, dual 13MP cameras | TheINQUIRER ", "image": "http://www.theinquirer.net/w-images/5694be85-88fe-4388-898b-b1c1445de4c1/3/fill/nok8copperbluepairb-370x229.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head-mounted display"}, "id": "308313", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-mounted_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}, "id": "360548", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB Type-C"}, "id": "1270770", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_Type-C"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "17:20:00"}

The premium smartphone with an all metal design, dual cameras and more 2017 specifications will go on sale in early September for 599 Euros (Rs. 45,000 approx.). After a string of mid-range Android smartphones, the Nokia 8 was highly anticipated for not just being a Nokia flagship, but the first flagship device since the Finnish company's Windows Phone days.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has an IP54 rating for splash resistance. Although, the smartphone does not look like a 2017 flagship with big bezels around the edges unlike the LG G6 or the Samsung Galaxy S8/S8+. The Nokia 8 sports a 5.3 inch 2560 x 1440 px display and 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for protection. Powering the device is a 3,090mAh battery with QuickCharge 3.0 support via USB Type-C port. Under the hood is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset and a 2.45GHz octa-core processor, the Adreno 540 GPU, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage which is expandable via microSD card. The Nokia 8 runs on stock Android 7.1.1 OS and the company has promised monthly security updates and yearly Android updates. The fingerprint sensor is housed inside the home button below the screen.\n\nThe new flagship is also the first Nokia Android device to feature Carl Zeiss optics. In a very 2017 move, the Nokia 8 boasts a Zeiss powered dual camera setup at the rear - a primary 13MP RGB (colour) sensor with optical image stabilisation paired with a 13MP secondary monochrome (black and white) sensor and an f/2.0 aperture. The dual-camera setup is capable of recording videos in 4K at 30 FPS and has a portrait mode for bokeh effect. On the front is a 13MP camera which can also record 4K videos at 30FPS.\n\nThe Nokia 8 comes with a feature called Bothie. It is the first smartphone in the world which allows 'Dual-Sight' video to be live streamed natively and in real-time to social feeds such as YouTube and Facebook. Dual-Sight allows you to use the front and rear camera at the same time in a split screen view. Another feature that the smartphone boasts is called OZO Audio in which the smartphone's three microphones and Nokia's acoustic algorithms allow you to capture 360-degree spatial surround sound. You can also share 4K videos with OZO audio with anyone - binaural codecs ensure high fidelity playback even on devices without OZO Audio.\n\nThere is no official word on the Nokia 8's availability in India as of yet. The Finnish brands' foray into Android smartphones has s far been through mid-rangers, but, with this flagship device, Nokia is ready to compete with the big boys of the smartphone industry.", "id":

Make no mistake, though, there's Finnish blood running through Nokia 8's veins. The new leadership tried to resurrect the qualities that were vital to the Nokia brand: quality, simplicity, trust and reliability.\n\nWe were hoping for a camera phone and we got a camera phone. It's the first fruit of the reformed partnership with Zeiss. Nokia has its own camera division now, OZO, which was brought in to design the microphones and capturing algorithms for the phone.\n\nListening to HMD, it was easy to tell that that the camera is the differentiating feature of the Nokia 8. The target audience is people steeped in social networking, especially video content.\n\nThe phone shoots 4K video, naturally, and you can livestream it to YouTube and Facebook. A unique feature is picture-in-picture mode that shows footage from both the front and the back cameras - live! This will allow you to \"tell both sides of the story\".\n\nCamera aside, the Nokia 8 is built out of aluminum and glass and offers IP54 resistance. HMD did make it a bit on the small side for a flagship - most Android top dogs are well past a 5.3\" screen. Of course, some will view this as a good thing, not everyone wants a large phone.\n\nThe company tapped Qualcomm for the Snapdragon 835 chipset and Google for the software. Really, HMD and Nokia tinkered with some internals (especially relating to camera image and audio processing), but the Android OS is as it came out of the factory. That will allow for fast updates when the time comes.\n\nWell, this brings back memories of the metal-clad Nokia N8 and its awesome camera.

The flagship device has been the center of attraction for the last few months. The smartphone has been launched at \u20ac599 (approximately Rs. 45,000) and will be available in the global markets starting from early September.\n\nWhile we are still drooling over the Nokia 8, HMD seems to have started working on another smartphone. Neil Broadley, Global Marketing Manager for HMD, has made this revelation in an interview to a Russian publication named 4pda.ru. The upcoming smartphone that is yet to be named, is likely to \"to meet the needs of absolutely all users.\"\n\nUnfortunately, he has not revealed any other information about the handset. While a larger display doesn't necessarily mean that, it could be a flagship. If this is the case, we are unlikely to see the unveiling of the smartphone this year.

HMD will rather \"focus on what will be best for users.\" Well, it does sound interesting. Apparently, the manufacturer is currently trying to bring back the glory days of Nokia.

Stock Android, monthly updates, decent imaging, and competitively priced. And really no other frills or gimmicks.\n\nThe phone does have some Nokia DNA, as it was designed largely in London with a team comprised of several ex-Nokia designers, and it shows. While we're waiting for the UK SIM-free price to be clarified, a global average of \u20ac599 means it should be around \u00a3100 cheaper SIM-free than the HTC and LG rivals, and \u00a3150 cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy S8.\n\nNokia has gone for \"as close to stock as possible\" here. The Camera app is the only home-grown app on the device, although it's not the only unique technology. The USP is a treat for audiophiles - the phone will capture 360 surround sound in the manner of the \u00a350,000 stereoscopic OZO camera sold partner-not-parent Nokia. How \"in the manner of\" we'll have to see.\n\nOnly three years ago the old Nokia was packing some of its phones with a very impressive audio capture subsystem called HAAC (High Amplitude Audio Capture). The dynamic range was so wide it could pick up whispers on a noisy street, as trucks rolled past. Or, it could record a rock band while standing next to the speaker stack, without distortion. The HMD-era Nokia describes \"OZO Audio\" as a successor to HAAC, which certainly invites high expectations.\n\nHAAC used four custom microphones, while Nokia execs I spoke to merely pointed out that it had specified what mics hardware partner Foxconn should use.\n\nZeiss-certified lenses are back, and the phone will be able to live-stream from both main camera and front-facing camera simultaneously, while the camera shows social media updates. For DIY broadcasters this is great, but you wonder how many others care about taking split-screen (front and back) images or movies.\n\nMore practically, new Nokia claims to have worked hard to optimise battery life, with a liquid-cooling pipe. \"We can run the latest SD harder and longer than what you see on the marketplace today,\" execs told us. And it should boast superior RF, since the cellular antennae are at the top and bottom, rather than worked into the sides - easy to cover with your hands in normal use, hence \"the Death Grip\". In a preview, I found the \"aggressively\" (their description not mine) curved design made the 8 very comfortable to hold and use - and it has real captive buttons, so it doesn't force you to slide up a navigation bar manually.\n\nWhat are you missing?\n\nThe Nokia 8 is only \"splashproof\" to a IP54 standard, rather than the more demanding IP67 standards met by the iPhone 7, and even more demanding IP68 tests passed by the Samsung Galaxy S8, LG G6 and HTC U11. There's no wireless charging, something the former Nokia pioneered and used to differentiate itself in 2012, in its Lumias.\n\nHowever, as readers have pointed out under our OnePlus 5 review, cheaper-than-flagship is an unforgiving place to be. If you're going to be paying a lot for a phone, why not pay a bit more? For one reader a Samsung Galaxy \"was between 50 and 100 quid more but a quality brand, waterproof, better camera and post processing and nice looking screen\".\n\n\"Consumers simply aren't interested in expensive but not top-end phones. If they want an expensive phone, they're going to pay a little bit more to get all the bells and whistles available, while if they're happy to compromise on features they simply don't want to pay that much.

The good news is that if you were looking forward to a flagship Nokia phone, HMD Global has officially taken the wraps off the Nokia 8 Android smartphone.\n\nJust like the rumors have suggested, the Nokia 8 comes packed with the latest specs which includes the use of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset. It will also be accompanied by 4GB of RAM, 64GB of onboard storage, a 5.3-inch QHD display with Corning's Gorilla Glass 5 screen, and a sizeable 3,090mAh battery that supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0.\n\nAs for the camera, it looks like we can look forward to seeing Carl Zeiss optics in Nokia phones again, especially after the report that HMD and Carl Zeiss had entered into a partnership similar to what Nokia and Carl Zeiss did back in the day. The result is a smartphone with dual 13MP cameras on the back, one which captures in color with OIS, while the other captures in mono. The front-facing camera will also be of the 13MP variety with phase detection autofocus.\n\nIt also seems that the Nokia 8 will come with improved audio technology thanks to the use of Nokia's OZO audio technology. This will see the phone come equipped with three microphones that rely on the acoustic algorithms of OZO to capture audio with immersive 360-degree spatial surround sound. The Nokia 8 will be available for purchase in September where it will be priced at \u20ac599 and will come in four different color options.", "id": "9586434", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 Announced With Zeiss Lens And OZO Audio", "image": "http://cdn2.ubergizmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Nokia_8_Range.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sound recording and reproduction"}, "id": "302809", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microphone"}, "id": "307750", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia phone series"}, "id": "513559", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_phone_series"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 402, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Tools and Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Tools_and_Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1533, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Audio", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Audio"}], "time": "00:06:00"}

The Nokia 8 features a 5.3-inch QHD display with a resolution of 2460\u00d71440. Under the hood is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, and there are variants with either 4GB of RAM or 6GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of storage. There's a microSD card slot for expandable storage, too.\n\nThe Nokia 8 also features a 3090mAh battery, a USB Type-C port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack on board. Android 7.1.1 Nougat is on board, too, as well as a fingerprint reader for good measure.\n\nThe standout feature for this device is the pair of 13-megapixel cameras on the back, which features Carl ZEISS optics. One camera is a color sensor while the other is monochrome. This setup offers PDAF, optical image stabilization, an IR range finder, and dual tone flash. Meanwhile, the front of the Nokia 8 features a 13-mgeapixel camera with PDAF.\n\nTied to the cameras is a new Dual-Sight mode, which allows the owner to take a photo or video using the front camera and the rear camera at the same time. Nokia calls this \"Bothies.\" The phone also features built- in live streaming to both YouTube Live and Facebook Live.\n\nThe Nokia 8 also features OZO spatial 360-degree audio, which HMD Global says \"accentuate the right sounds while reducing ambient sounds or background noise.\"\n\nThe Nokia 8's global launch will take place beginning in September and it'll be priced starting at \u20ac599 (about $703 USD). It will be available in Steel, Tempered Blue, Polished Copper, and Polished Blue.

The phone has been spotted in live image leaks, in certifications and various other listings. However, after months of wait, the Nokia flagship is now official. The company announced the phone just hours ago, and here's a complete look at the specifications and the features of the Nokia 8:\n\nLet us take a look at the build and design quality, the features and the pricing of the latest Nokia flagship smartphone -\n\nNokia's latest smartphone, the Nokia 8 comes out into the markets with an impressive body. It features a slim, all-metal build. The phone measures about 4.6 inches thick at the edges, while the maximum thickness is seen in the area of the camera bump, where the phone measures about 7.9mm thick. Thankfully the 3.5mm jack is still there!\n\nIn the front, the phone features a front facing camera on the top along with the proximity sensor. It comes with narrow bezels on the top and the bottom. The top bezel carries the Nokia branding. On the bottom we see a fingerprint scanner that doubles up as the home button. Two capacitive keys are present on either side. The phone offers USB Type-C connectivity.\n\nOn the back it offers a dual camera, which is one of the highlights of this phone. We will discuss the camera in detail when addressing the specifications below. Overall, the build looks really good. The phone is made by HMD Global and has been officially launched just hours ago, after months of anticipation.\n\nNokia's latest flagship device comes out into the markets with a 5.3 inched 2K display. The phone comes out with an IPS LCD display, which offers a resolution of 2560 x 1440. The display is protected by a 2.5D Curved Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. The design of the display resembles that of the Nokia 6. It was a little disappointing that Nokia did not introduce edge to edge display in this flagship smartphone of theirs.\n\nThe Nokia 8 runs on the Snapdragon 835 processor along with the Adreno 540 GPU. The phone comes out into the markets in only one RAM/Storage variant - featuring 4GB of RAM along with 64GB of storage space. However, the storage can be expanded with the help of MicroSD cards. It can be expanded up to 256GB. The phone runs on the stock Android 7.1.1 Nougat OS.\n\nNokia 8's cameras are one of its highlights. The phone comes with two 13MP + 13MP Zeiss cameras present on the back. These back cameras feature one RGB Lens and another Monochrome lens. Together, these two knit an image which offers the truest color experience possible. The front camera also comes out with a 13MP lens.\n\nNokia has stated that the global average retail price for the phone would be around 599 Euros ($700). However, the final price might differ based on various taxes and other charges which vary from region to region. The phone comes out in four color variants: Blue Satin, Blue Polished, Steel, and Copper.\n\nMoreover, it is speculated that the Nokia 8 might not launch in China and the US (at least as of now), as HMD Global has logistics issues there. Stay tuned with us for more details on this smartphone.", "id": "9596874", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 Is Now Official: Specifications, Price and Availability Details", "image": "https://www.newsient.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Nokia-8-Specifications-Nokia-8-Price-3.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "id": "302869", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}, "id": "307030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Operating system"}, "id": "307345", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint recognition"}, "id": "314740", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Capacitor"}, "id": "318005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flagship"}, "id": "320976", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adreno"}, "id": "351564", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adreno"}, {"label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}, "id": "360548", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model"}, {"label": {"eng": "Proximity sensor"}, "id": "377264", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximity_sensor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "2.5D"}, "id": "422764", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.5D"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB Type-C"}, "id": "1270770", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_Type-C"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "20:37:00"}

Nokia 8 launch today: Specifications, expected pricing and everything else to knowNokia 8 likely to be unveiled today as HMD Global gears up for flagship launchNokia 2 variants get FCC certifications: Launch to take place soon?\n\nNokia 8 flagship smartphone has been unveiled by HMD Global at an event in London. The new flagship phone will be available globally by September 2017, and is expected to retail at an average price of Euro 599, around Rs 45,000 on conversion. Nokia 8 will hit stores in India by early October, according to HMD Global's chief product officer Juho Sarvikas.\n\nNokia 8 is the new flagship smartphone from the company, and sports a 5.3-inch 2K LCD IPS display with 700 nits brightness, Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor coupled with 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage, which is expandable.\n\nThe phone has Gorilla Glass 5 on top and will launch with two glossy and two matte variants. The phone is launching in four colours: polished blue and copper which have a glossy finish, while there's the tempered blue and steel phones which have a matte finish. The new flagship is not entirely water and dust resistant, though it has an IP54 rating making it splash-proof.\n\nHMD Global will have dual-SIM and single-SIM variants of the Nokia 8 depending on the market. The dual-SIM slot is a hybrid one. HMD Global is not launching a 128GB variant of this phone for now. The battery is 3090 mAh, and there is support for USB 3.0 and fast charging with Quick Charge 3.0. With the design, Nokia 8 has a metal unibody design and muted antenna bands on top and a vertical rear camera setup.\n\nOn the software front, the company is sticking with its no-bloatware policy and the phone runs stock Android 7.1.1 version. Sarvikas said Nokia 8 would be the fastest way to get Android O. \"We are in a very advanced stage in Android O development. Of course, we are still waiting for some completion from the chipset vendor side, which in our case is Qualcomm. But we'll be one of the fastest to get Android O,\" he said.\n\nNokia 8 comes in four colour variants. This the polished copper variant\n\nThe new Nokia 8 also comes with a dual rear camera, the first to tout the Zeiss Optics branding since the relaunch. But there's a lot more going on here that just specifications. HMD Global has gone for a 13MP+ 13MP combination on the back with a monochrome and RGB sensor. The front camera is also 13MP with the same sensor being used as the one on the back. This one also has a Zeiss Optics branding, however, HMD Global is not revealing the actual vendor for the camera sensor. Both the front and back cameras will support 4K Video recording.\n\nNokia 8 has options for a dual-live stream with both the front and rear camera recording at the same time.\n\nHMD Global has also tweaked the camera software. The rear camera supports a 'bokeh' mode like many of the other dual cameras in the market. But the company has also added a feature for recording live videos from the native camera app. A user can stream live videos to Facebook, YouTube from the Nokia 8's camera app itself. There's also the option of having a dual-stream, where the front and rear camera can both be used at the same time in the live video. However, the dual feature won't work if you shoot the live video from the Facebook or YouTube app itself.\n\n\"Both cameras can be active at the same. A user will be able to tell both sides of the story. We also have the livestream option,\" explained Sarvikas on the reasoning behind this sort of feature in the camera. The Nokia 8 also comes with Ozo Audio and has high-dynamic range microphones. Ozo is the 360-degree virtual reality camera from the original Nokia firm. The company claims the phone is capturing surround audio which is then encoded with Ozo algorithms. \"We make this even more unique and meaningful for users. We are ensuring that whatever medium you get the file, even WhatsApp, you will get the surround experience of the audio when you listen to it,\" said Sarvikas.\n\nDisclaimer: The author is in London

The smartphone is HMD's highest-spec Android device to date, and it sets its sights on the likes of the Galaxy S8 and OnePlus 5 with its Snapdragon 835 internals, premium aluminium design and dual 13MP cameras, which come kitted out with Zeiss optics.\n\nIf you're looking to get your hands on the Nokia 8 we've rounded everything we know about the handset's UK availability below. We'll update this article as soon as we hear more.\n\nSpecs\n\n- 5.3in QHD LCD screen with 'Always On' display\n\n- 152x74x7.9mm, 160g\n\n- Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB RAM\n\n- 64GB storage with microSD support up to 256GB\n\n- 13MP dual cameras with optical image stabilisation, Zeiss optics and 4K video, 13MP front-facing camera\n\n- Unibody aluminium chassis with built-in fingerprint scanner\n\n- 3,090mAh battery, Quick Charge 3.0 support\n\n- Android 7.0 Nougat\n\n- USB-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack\n\n- Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue, Tempered Steel colour options\n\nRelease date\n\nThe Nokia 8 will be available in Europe from September, but no exact UK availability details have yet been announced.\n\nPrice\n\nHMD has said that the Nokia 8 will fetch \u20ac599 (around \u00a3550) SIM-free.\n\nLatest news\n\nThe Nokia 8 is official, with HMD Global unveiling the handset in London on Wednesday.\n\nAs expected, the 'flagship' smartphone packs a 5.3in QHD LCD display, and under the hood, you'll find Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB RAM and 64GB storage, which can be expanded via microSD. There's also a 3,090mAh battery, which HMD claims will get you more than a full day of usage, complete with support for Quick Charge 3.0.\n\nThere's a USB-C port on the bottom for charging, alongside a 3.5mm headphone jack.\n\nThe Nokia 8, which like its predecessors comes crafted from a single piece of aluminium, has shunned the recent shift towards bezel-less smartphones and comes equipped with a physical home button, which houses a baked-in fingerprint sensor.\n\nThe Nokia 8's standout feature, at least according to HMD Global, is its camera, as it's the first Android-powered Nokia phone to pack Carl Zeiss optics. There's a 13MP dual setup on the rear of the phone, which - much like the camera on the Huawei P10 - pairs RGB and monochrome sensors for better image quality. There's also a 13MP sensor on the front of the phone.\n\nHMD has added what it calls a \"bothie\" mode (ugh) that will activate both the front and rear cameras to capture phones and videos. Unlike the similar functionality found on Samsung smartphones, the Nokia 8 is also capable of broadcasting this video to Facebook or Youtube.\n\nHMD has also added Ozo Audio, which means that much like Nokia's futuristic VR camera, the Nokia 8 will capture 360-degree audio, allowing for it to be broadcast live on streams.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will ship running Android 7.11, and HMD has said that it'll be updated to Android O once it becomes available. At launch, it'll be available in glossy blue and copper colours, alongside matte blue and steel options. \u00b5", "id": "9578001", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 price, release

A big portion of the 5.00 software update is to the overall master/sub-account system that allows parents to control what kids see and do on the PS4. The overhaul includes a new \"Family on PlayStation Network\" system that aims to be more flexible.\n\nThis new system makes it easier to set up PSN accounts for kids and offers customized parental control settings. Multiple adults can be part of a single family and the Family Manager account can promote another adult inside the family to Parent/Guardian, who is then able to set custom parental controls for children's accounts. Whereas previous parental controls applied all settings to all child accounts, the new system allows for individual settings per child. That means a 6-year-old can be locked to \"E\" rated games only while a 17-year-old can have \"M\" rated games enabled on the same account.\n\nThe \"Favorite Groups\" tab has been replaced with a new \"Custom Lists\" tab within the friends setting, allowing you to create and edit custom friends lists. The goal with that change is to make it easier for users to manage friends and access specific groups. With this setting you can do things like create custom friends lists for your CoD squad and send them all invites at the same time.\n\nUpdates to Broadcasts allows the community owner to bind the community to your broadcast giving a community button on the \"Live from PlayStation\" spectator screen. A click allows the spectator to jump directly to the community page. A PS VR Display message to Spectators and Spectators' Comments section has been added that when enabled shows comments in cinematic mode and in VR mode.\n\nThe big change for PS4 Pro users is one that we mentioned before with support for streaming at 1080p 60fps resolution; which is the only specific callout feature for PS4 Pro users in this update. Other improvements include the ability to share music to Twitter and Facebook via PlayStation Music and to share messages using your PS4 to the social networks. You can also now leave multiple message groups from one screen and leave several groups at one time. Popup notifications can be disabled while watching a movie or TV show on the console and an option for turning off message previews is added.\n\nSony also added an option to change pop-up notification color between the default white or black colors. The quick menu has been updated for access to data on download progress and installations or party invites. These are accessible from the Quick Menu. Virtual Surround Sound is now supported on PSVR with support for 5.1 and 7.1 virtual surround sound. Tournament bracket viewer is now available that shows the full tournament brackets for single and double elimination tournaments. A handful of new languages have also been added to the system. The last major PS4 system update came back in March when system firmware 4.5 debuted.", "id": "9899416", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Sony Pushes PlayStation 4 System Update 5.0 Beta Packed With New Features | HotHardware", "image": "https://hothardware.com/ContentImages/NewsItem/41877/content/ps4-5-1.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Music"}, "id": "302636", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social network"}, "id": "302659", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television program"}, "id": "303532", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video game console"}, "id": "304421", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"}, {"label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}, "id": "305704", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}, "id": "307034", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "Surround sound"}, "id": "333958", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}, "id": "340359", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental controls"}, "id": "398807", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual surround"}, "id": "526394", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_surround"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop-up notification"}, "id": "650501", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_notification"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation VR"}, "id": "1270845", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_VR"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Music"}, "id": "1437736", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Music"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 64, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 413, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1030, "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Associations", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Associations"}], "time": "09:53:00"}

But with 5.00, all controls (including game age ratings) can be individually attuned for each child. PS4 Pro can now support streaming on Twitch at 1080p 60fps, it's easy to get jealous if still running on a PS4.\n\nManaging a friends list on any console is always a bit of a pain, PS4 is remedying that with the new feature of a \"Custom Lists\" tab.\n\nThis will allow you to create and edit custom lists of your friends and arrange them into specific groups, based on the games you play, or groups of friends you like to hang out with online.\n\nCommunities can now be linked to broadcasts, and PlayStation VR is getting a \"Display Message to Spectators and Spectators\" Comments' option which will show up comments from broadcasts even when you are in VR mode. All a spectator needs to do is click the community button and they can jump right to the community page to check out any details.\n\nFor those who own Sony's Virtual Reality platform, the new update also adds the ability to receive spectator comments during broadcasts. This makes it much easier for VR broadcasters to keep up on comments and communicate with their viewers. With the new update, users will be able to directly send songs and Spotify links via the PlayStation 4's messaging system, in addition to the PlayStation mobile app.\n\nPlayStation VR now supports 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound on your headphones when watching Blu-rays and DVDs in Cinematic Mode.\n\nIn addition, if you're part of multiple message groups, you can now easily leave several groups at once. Then you can use that list to easily message and invite your Helldivers squad (hey, Helldivers is still really good) without disturbing your Destiny raid buddies. The new update allows users to turn off message notifications when using apps such as Netflix. This can be enabled by going to the Notifications under Settings.\n\nYou can now turn off message previews on your pop-up notifications. For example, you'll be able to check on download progress and see new party invites.\n\nThe quick menu pop up side bar has also been tweaked, and users will now be able to change the colour from the default black to white, giving the option of contrast for whatever looks better to the user. A Leave Party option has also been added to Quick Menu. The system clock is also promptly displayed in the upper-right corner of the screen when accessing the Quick Menu.\n\nA new bracket viewer has been added that shows full tournament brackets for Single Elimination and Double Elimination tournaments on the console. Making it easier to see current tournament standing.\n\nIt's a hefty update that brings some great features to the PS4 and PS4 Pro only improving upon the changes and features already added and built in.\n\nUpdated language support: With firmware 5.0 the PS4 user interface now supports Czech, Hungarian, Romanian, Greek, Thai, Indonesian and Vietnamese languages.", "id": "9763396", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Home", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Netflix"}, "id": "302687", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop music"}, "id": "303105", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video game console"}, "id": "304421", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blog"}, "id": "305393", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}, "id": "307034", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spotify"}, "id": "307723", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headphones"}, "id": "314741", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones"}, {"label": {"eng": "DVD"}, "id": "318168", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}, "id": "340359", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitch (website)"}, "id": "349819", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(website)"}, {"label": {"eng": "7.1 surround sound"}, "id": "371798", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental controls"}, "id": "398807", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls"}, {"label": {"eng": "VR mode"}, "id": "409262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VR_mode"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual surround"}, "id": "526394", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_surround"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wii U system software"}, "id": "614413", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U_system_software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blu-ray"}, "id": "1197211", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation VR"}, "id": "1270845", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_VR"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 64, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 201, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems"}], "time": "16:54:00"}

It features Zeiss optics for the front and rear cameras, and support for recording 360-degree audio.\n\nBut the Nokia 8 doesn't come cheap: the phone is launching for 599 Euros in Europe. That's a little over $700 US, although HMD hasn't yet announced North American prices or release dates for the new phone.\n\nThe Nokia 8 features a dual camera system on the back, with 13MP color and monochrome cameras designed to capture high-contrast images. There's also a 13MP front-facing camera.\n\nWhat's a bit unusual is that the front camera is nearly as good as the one on the back of the phone. While the front-facing camera has just a single lens, it has the same camera module as the rear camera and supports auto-focus.\n\nHMD included a \"bothie\" mode that also lets you capture and combine photos or videos using both the front and rear cameras at the same time. It's a neat, if not entirely original idea... but let's hope the name doesn't catch on.\n\nYou can also stream bothie video to YouTube or Facebook Live in real-time.\n\nThe Nokia 8 should be available starting in September, and it's expected to ship with Android 7.1.\n\nIf you're looking for something (a lot) cheaper, the Nokia 6 recently launched in the US for $230 (or $180 if you buy the Amazon Prime Exclusive model).

Officially, no pricing has been confirmed by the company.\n\nThe phone has been subjected to a number of leaks and renders in the past few months. A recent image of the phones benchmarks spotted on Slashleaks tells us that Nokia 8 will be running on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. It will be powered by the Snapdragon 835 chipset along with 4 GB of RAM and an Adreno 540 GPU. The display will be QuadHD with 559 PPI pixel density.\n\nAlso, the Nokia 8 will probably have capacitive navigation buttons along with a home button, where presumably, the fingerprint sensor has been embedded. Reputed tipster Evan Blass had earlier in July tweeted a photo of the Nokia 8 camera module captioned with a hashtag 'teaser' and confirmed that the phone will have a dual-camera setup. Also, several other leaks have pointed to the fact that HMD Global is to bring Carl Zeiss camera optics with the Nokia 8 smartphone.\n\n#Android 7.1.1 nougat #Benchmarks #Carl zeiss #Dual-camera setup #Evan blass #Hmd global #Nokia #Nokia 8 #Youtube\n\nPublished Date: Aug 16, 2017 02:34 pm | Updated Date: Aug 16, 2017 03:01 pm\n\nTags : #Android 7.1.1 nougat #Benchmarks #Carl zeiss #Dual-camera setup #Evan blass #Hmd global #Nokia #Nokia 8 #Youtube", "id": "9577997", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "The Nokia 8 might be revealed at an HMD Global event in London on 16 August", "image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nokia-8.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 84, "amb": false, "textEnd": 93, "freq": 3, "date": "2017-08-16"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hashtag"}, "id": "305777", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}, "id": "307030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baidu"}, "id": "308704", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel density"}, "id": "317242", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}, "id": "320018", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nougat"}, "id": "329104", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nougat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Embedded system"}, "id": "336397", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adreno"}, "id": "351564", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adreno"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "07:33:00"}

In February HMD unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, priced at 139 euros ($163) and 189 euros respectively.\n\nJuho Sarvikas, HMD's chief product officer, said now was \"the perfect time\" to introduce the model, which he describes as a flagship product. The phone will feature a \"dual-sight\" photo and video function, in which images from the front and rear cameras will be displayed simultaneously on a split screen. HMD describes the feature as \"less Selfie, more Bothie\".\n\nHMD had chosen to release cheaper models first because 50 percent of global demand was for phones costing between 100 euros and 250 euros, Sarvikas said in an interview. \"We wanted to start there, where we know that we are highly relevant with our proposition. We're very eager to enter the flagship segment as well.\"\n\nAlso read: Nokia 8 first impressions: Sleek design, new camera features and the 'bothie'\n\nThe new device has Zeiss cameras, after HMD said in July that it had signed a partnership with the group, part of the German optics company Carl Zeiss AG.\n\nThe launch comes as Apple prepares to launch a new iPhone and Samsung rolls out its new Galaxy Note 8. Sarvikas said by phone that HMD was \"less concerned about competition; we're here to design for the consumers.\"\n\nDemand for the redesigned 3310 feature phone, unveiled in February, had been \"very strong.\" Sarvikas was unable to share detailed sales figures but said HMD had sold \"millions\" of smartphones and \"tens of millions\" of feature phones - of which the 3310 is just one model.\n\nNokia Oyj sold the handset business to Microsoft Corp. in 2014. In 2016 Microsoft sold it to HMD and FIH Mobile Ltd., a subsidiary of Chinese phone maker Foxconn Technology Group. HMD's Chief Executive Officer Arto Nummela, a former Nokia executive, left the company last month.\n\nFor all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Apple HMD Global Nokia 8 Samsung", "id": "9619149", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia-maker mixes with Apple, Samsung in new smartphone launch", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/nokia-8-comp.jpg?w=759", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 26, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 41}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}, "id": "308699", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}], "time": "05:47:00"}

This, without doubt and while reserving no rights to disagree later, is an attempt to compete with the likes of Samsung's Galaxy S8, Google's current Pixel phones and perhaps even the upcoming Pixel 2 phones and eventually the Apple iPhones as well. Priced at $700 (around Rs45,000), the Nokia 8 will roll out in some countries in September, with the India launch expected in the later months of this year.\n\nA quick look at the Nokia 8's basic specs reveal that it runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB RAM and will have 64GB internal storage as well as a microSD card slot that will support up to 256GB more storage space. While there is nothing to worry about on the processor front -- since that is the most powerful chip that Nokia could have used at the moment -- there might be some doubts about the RAM and storage space. For flagship phones and even the latest crop of more affordable flagship killer phones such as the OnePlus 5 and the Honor 8 Pro, 6GB RAM is becoming a standard spec which allows for better multi-tasking and more future-proofing. The 64GB storage space isn't flagship-level specification, where 128GB and 256GB storage options are now slowly becoming common. Yes, we might be nit-picking, but the question is -- will you buy the Nokia 8 for the here and now only, or are you looking at specifications that are future proof for your data and app requirements 24 months down the line, perhaps?\n\nThe 5.3-inch (2,560x1,440 resolution) IPS display is spot on in terms of size, and should appeal to the demographic of users who find 5.5-inch display phones a tad too big. There is a Gorilla Glass 5 layer on it too, which adds some amount of durability to it. At a time when Samsung and LG (and perhaps even Apple, with the next iPhone) are switching to the more visually appealing taller (or wider, if you hold the phones sideways) displays, Nokia has remained tethered to the more conventional.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has a 3,090mAh battery, and utilizes Qualcomm's QuickCharge 3.0 fast charging technology.\n\nHMD Global has preloaded the phone with an almost un-customized Android 7.1.1 (Nougat) operating system, and will get the Android O update in the near future too. HMD Global seems committed towards rolling out the security updates for the Nokia 8, and claims that any security updates that Google rolls out (barring the ones that modify the software that works with the modem in the phone) will be released on the same day as updates.\n\nIn terms of design, the Nokia 8 has an all-aluminium chassis, with no room for the potentially more fragile glass backs that are popular with some Android flagship phones. It is 7.9mm at its thickest point, and has a contoured shape that makes it feel even slimmer around the sides. It is splash-proof too, with the IP54 rating -- however, this is a step down from the IP68 ratings that the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 offer at the moment.\n\nHowever, the Nokia 8's party piece would perhaps be the Carl Zeiss cameras. There are two 13-megapixel cameras at the back (one is colour, one is monochrome), with optical image stabilization (OIS), have a 1.12um pixel size and f2.0 aperture. The front camera is also 13 megapixels, with similar pixel size and aperture. The company believes that the Nokia 8 will entice consumers with what is now known as the \"bothie\". Essentially, it is supposed to be the evolution of the selfie, and will use both rear and front-facing cameras at the same time to shoot video or photos simultaneously. These can also be shared for live streaming directly on platforms such as Facebook or YouTube. Well, you don't need to be standing next to someone anymore to take a selfie with the Nokia 8, but how much money would you bet on the idea of some neat third-party app offering this feature in your existing Android phone soon enough?\n\nFor audio recording, the Nokia 8 gets to utilize the 360-degree OZO technology used in Nokia's high-end OZO 360 camera -- there are three microphones in the 8, and they each pull 360-degree sound which is then joined together with a 4K video recording using complex algorithms. Whether consumers will genuinely be able to utilize this feature remains up for debate, but maybe the demographic who often claim that a smartphone can become their primary photography and video recording device may find this good enough -- if the camera can take good enough photos, that is.\n\nHMD Global has packed in a full-length copper cooling pipe with a graphite shield to dissipate system heat across the full body of the phone. It is designed to pull the heat away from the Snapdragon 835 chip, with the hope that it'll be able to perform better for longer, even under heavy workloads. It is a bit perplexing though, because no phone running the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chip (this includes the OnePlus 5, Sony Xperia XZ Premium and the HTC U11) has ever suffered from over-heating issues even when really stressed with the latest games, extensive camera use and intense multi-tasking. Could this be the complex algorithms of Nokia's camera and the bothie gimmicks that require this counter measure?", "id": "9665475", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8: Just a

However it seems that there is a chance that we could see a larger Nokia phone in the future, according to a report from Russian website 4Pda.\n\nThe report is in Russian but the folks at Nokiapoweruser managed to translate it into English and part of the report reads, \"Well, as a cherry on the cake representatives of HMD Global made a hint that in the future we are waiting for another smartphone - with a larger screen than in Nokia 8, to meet the needs of absolutely all users.\"\n\nAs to why HMD chose the size they did, the company's head of product marketing told the publication, \"The design of the Nokia 8 was the result of an excellent dialogue between us and consumers. We really got completely satisfactory feedback from users from our surveyed group who liked the display in the form that we did. So we believe that our decision regarding the display is absolutely correct.\"\n\nPrior to the Nokia 8's launch, there were rumors suggesting that there could be more than one flagship, and that the other device is the Nokia 9 which obviously was not announced, so perhaps this alleged device could indeed be the Nokia 9, but take it with a grain of salt for now.", "id": "9875080", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "HMD Reportedly Teases Larger Nokia Phone, Possibly The Nokia 9", "image": "http://cdn2.ubergizmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nokia-8-9.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marketing"}, "id": "303392", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inch"}, "id": "316866", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 550, "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Future"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 785, "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Store Fixtures", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Store_Fixtures"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1557, "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Human Interfaces", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Human_Interfaces"}], "time": "10:45:00"}

If you signed up for the beta and were selected to participate, you'll receive an email from Sony with instructions on how to download it and get started.\n\nWith Family on PSN, multiple adults can be part of a single family. This new system will also make it easier to set up PlayStation Network accounts for kids and customize parental control settings.\n\nMeanwhile, you'll also be able to create and edit custom lists of your friends. This way, \"you can create a custom list of your Destiny teammates and easily send them raid invites,\" Kelly wrote.\n\nAlso on tap are a bunch of broadcast feature updates, including the ability to pin your community to your broadcast, so spectators can jump right to your community page to find out about it. There's also a new setting that lets you view spectator comments in VR mode, which should make it much easier for VR broadcasters to communicate with viewers. And, as we mentioned earlier, the update will let PS4 Pro users stream on Twitch in 1080p at 60fps.\n\nIf you're listening to a song you think a friend would like, you'll be able to send it to them via messages. If they're also on PS4, they can boot up the Quick Menu and listen to the track right inside the message. If they're on a mobile device, they can jump to the Spotify app to check it out.\n\nSony is also adding support for a couple more languages, including Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Romanian, Thai, and Vietnamese. There's also a new bracket viewer that makes it easier to see the tournament standings. Finally, you'll be able to access Notifications from the Quick Menu, so you don't have to jump away from your game every time you want to see what's new.", "id": "9782759", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Sony Rolling Out PS4 System Update 5.0 Beta ", "image": "https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/551860-family-on-psn.jpg?thumb=y&width=810&height=455", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Hungary"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "99", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Hungary"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Email"}, "id": "302685", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television program"}, "id": "303532", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Greek language"}, "id": "304874", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}, "id": "305704", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}, "id": "307034", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spotify"}, "id": "307723", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify"}, {"label": {"eng": "Application software"}, "id": "308364", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}, "id": "308708", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device"}, {"label": {"eng": "Software testing"}, "id": "311084", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "Indonesian language"}, "id": "315293", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romanian language"}, "id": "332094", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitch (website)"}, "id": "349819", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(website)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental controls"}, "id": "398807", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony Interactive Entertainment"}, "id": "1283778", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 64, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 306, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 321, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 402, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Tools and Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Tools_and_Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 821, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific"}], "time": "21:33:00"}

Nokia dubs this not a selfie, but a \"Bothie\" -- wonder if the term will catch on?\n\nThe phone has a fingerprint scanner-home button combo on the front and OZO high-dynamic range audio recording.\n\nNotably for Nokia brand fans though, there's no Snake game to while away the time between bothies.\n\nThe Nokia 8 also has a 13-megapixel camera on the front which allows Dual-Sight video to be live-streamed natively and in real-time to social media.\n\nThe Dual Sight feature simultaneously harnesses front and rear cameras for both photos and videos.\n\n\"There are two sides to every story and the Dual-Sight feature of Nokia 8 is designed to help you create and share the full picture,\" says Nokia, which has created the slogan, \"Be less Selfie, be more Bothie.\"\n\nBuilt on a single block of aluminium, Nokia 8's body is 4.6mm thin at the edge and just 7.3mm slim on average.\n\nThe screen is slightly curved at the edges, but it's not one of those new ultra-wide screens that adorn most high-profile flagships these days.\n\n\"It's a phone for everyone, but focused on the next generations -- millennials and creators -- who are sharing every day their life great moments and experiences,\" said Pekka Rantala, HMD CEO.\n\nThe Nokia 8 runs on a Snapdragon 835 platform, Qualcomm's top-end chip, with a 1.90GHz CPU speed, 4GB of memory, and an Adreno 540 GPU.\n\nThe 5.3-inch, super-bright display has a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels and a pixel density of 559.\n\nNokia 8 uses OZO's Dolby surround audio technology and allows you to shoot 4K high-quality videos.\n\nMashable tested the audio performance on a preset video and it's impressively clear and crisp, with well-defined highs and nuances.\n\n\"We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media,\" said Juho Sarvikas, Chief Product Officer of HMD Global.\n\n\"People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own. It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance.\"\n\nThe handset will be available in four colours: Polished Blue, Tempered Blue, Steel, and a very daring Polished Copper which has attracted a lot of attention in the past few months.\n\nIt will be available at a global average retail

All controls can be individually controlled for each child account.\n\nSony is adding a new \"Custom Lists\" tab on the Friends screen in place of the existing \"Favorite Groups\" tab. This will enable PS4 owners to create and edit custom list of friends and arrange them into specific grounds based on the games they play or the people they like to play games with online.\n\nAs previously reported, PlayStation 4 system software update version 5.0 brings the ability to stream gameplay in 1080p at 60 frames-per-second via Twitch to PlayStation 4 Pro owners. Sony has finally added a new setting which enables users to disable pop-up notifications when they're watching a movie or TV show on their console.

This phone will be available in global markets this September and is expected to land in India by October.\n\nLaunched at an event in London, the Nokia 8 is an attempt by HMD Global to showcase that it has the ability to produce a flagship class device which is innovative. This is the company's halo device for the year and its hardware is proof of the pudding.\n\n\"Nokia 8 is flagship in design, imaging and performance,\" said Juho Sarvikas, HMD Global's chief product officer at a press briefing with the media.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB RAM and a gorgeous 5.3-inch LCD display with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 with a quad HD resolution and impressive brightness levels of up to 700 nits.\n\nHMD Global is focusing on real world usage here on this phone. It says that 4GB RAM is all what a flagship Android phone needs, something which has been proven on devices like the Google Pixel and the Samsung Galaxy S8. It also comes with an evolved antenna design adapted from the Nokia 5 and for heat management the phone has a copper pipe inside.\n\nThe phone has a series 6000 aluminium frame which was seen before on the Nokia 6. However, it is being offered in some unique colours -- polished blue, polished copper, tempered blue and steel; so there aren't any standard black and white colours here. It also has a certain degree of splash resistance.\n\nIt forgoes some new niceties that are becoming common on high end smartphone though. For instance, its display makes no pretensions about being edge-to-edge, it is nice but it is no Samsung Galaxy S8 which is fine.\n\nThe bigger deal is in its camera system. On the back HMD Global has rekindled an old partnership again. This phone has dual 13-megapixel sensors which have Carl Zeiss optics. Back in the day, Nokia phones were known to have Carl Zeiss lenses and boom we have that again. Even the dual camera system on the device is an interesting one as it doesn't use the widely adopted wide angle lens and telephoto lens combination. Instead, this phone, like the Huawei P10, has an RGB sensor and a monochrome sensor which allows for greater detailing in low light, better colour output and a truer looking image. The primary camera system also comes with stabilised lens which further improves low-light shooting especially when making videos. It also comes with a laser auto focus.\n\nEven on the selfie front, the phone packs a generous 13-megapixel shooter and all things considered when one uses the HMD Global camera app, shooting pictures from this device is a breeze. In fact, HMD Global has gone to great lengths with the front camera too as it uses the very same sensor as the RGB one on the rear and also has Carl Zeiss optics. This also means the front camera can also shoot in 4K.\n\nThe camera technology is really interesting as it packs in something HMD Global calls a dual sight mode which essentially allows the user to engage all the cameras at the same time offering a view from a standard and selfie perspective. Some HMD Global folks referred to this to as a 'Bothie.' This is an interesting feature and as Qualcomm's chipset doesn't support this out of the box, HMD Global had to work closely with Qualcomm to make this feature happen.\n\nOne of the big announcements as a part of this launch is that the Nokia Ozo audio technology is making its way to the device. HMD Global says that this has an inherent advantage over standard stereo and the phone packs multiple microphones to ensure great audio capture. In addition, Juho Sarvikas explained that when a traditional video is uploaded to social networks and platforms like YouTube the metadata for the encoding is lost. On the Nokia 8 that data is embedded and when videos from the phone are uploaded, their audio quality will be vastly superior.\n\n\"We have high dynamic range microphones and then encoded in Ozo audio algorithm\", said Sarvikas to PCMag India.\n\nLive streaming has been integrated on the stock camera app which borrows many cues from the erstwhile pro camera app Nokia used to make for its Lumia Windows Phones. This will allow users to stream videos directly to Facebook and YouTube. You can even live stream using all cameras offering the dual sight perspective. HMD Global hasn't integrated other services like Instagram but it says it is already working on improving the feature like adding support for multiple accounts.\n\nSome usual things are also part of the package like a front mounted fingerprint scanner, 4G LTE, USB Type-C, a 3,090mAh battery, and fast charging. It will be offered in a 64GB model and microSD card expansion besides a possible dual SIM model for open markets like India.\n\nThis phone runs on Android 7.1 Nougat completely bereft of any manufacturer led modifications and the latest Google security patch mimicking an experience one finds on the critically acclaimed Pixel smartphone that Google makes.\n\nHMD Global is confident that this would be one of the fastest ways to experience Android O. \"We are at a very advanced stage with the development of Android O,\" Sarvikas revealed highlighting that this phone will be one the first ones to get the update once Google officially releases the final build of the software.\n\nAt around around 599 euros this will be an expensive phone which will go on sale in India later next month for more than Rs 40,000.\n\nDisclaimer: HMD Global paid for the writers travel and stay to London to cover the event", "id": "9577969", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "HMD Global

There are two sides to every story and the Dual-Sight feature of Nokia 8 is designed to help you create and share the full picture.'\n\nPolice are using prams to catch people parking illegally\n\nNokia is now under licence to HMD Global, a Finnish start-up, which sparked the firm's revival earlier this year with the launch of three mid-range Android phones - the Nokia 3,5 and 6, as well as a revamped version of the 17-year-old 3310.\n\nThe new phone also has spatial audio technology previously only used in Nokia's high-end OZO 360 camera, which can play back sound in multiple directions, imitating how it was captured during recording.\n\nHMD Global confirmed the phone will go on sale in 'early September' and said the device was aimed at social media users and video creators.\n\nHMD chief product officer Juho Sarvikas said: 'We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media.\n\n'People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own.\n\n'It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance.'\n\nNokia and HMD Global's unveiling comes a week before Samsung is due to announce their next Note smartphone, the first since the Note 7 was discontinued last year over battery fires and safety fears.\n\nThe next iPhone, marking 10 years since the device first launched, is also expected to be announced in September.\n\nMORE: Malala Yousafzai is going to Oxford University after passing her A-Levels\n\nMORE: Man's extreme cramp looks like alien trying to burst through his leg", "id": "9661768",

Armed with top-notch hardware and optics, the high-end phone will sate your requirements for a regular-designed but powerful computing device.\n\nRocking a metal curved body, the Nokia features a 5.3-inch display and a resolution measuring 2560 x 1440. The advantage to having thick bezels is that the fingerprint reader is situated at the front, allowing easy access to unlock your phone. There is also a Type-C USB port present, and the Nokia 8 will be available in the following colors:\n\nThe PPI of the Nokia 8 stands at 550 pixels per inch and despite featuring an LCD panel, the company claims that the flagship will get noticeably bright, at 700 nits. The LCD display might be a cause of concern for several users, but HMD Global states that the smartphone will have its dedicated low-powered section to conserve battery life.\n\nComplementing the performance of the Snapdragon 835 is 4GB of RAM with 64GB of onboard storage. Later down the road, the Nokia 8 will also be offered with 128GB of storage, plus the microSD card slot makes storage flexibility all the sweeter. The phone will be running Android 7.1.1 Nougat, with a confirmed Android O update in the future.\n\nThe most exciting part has to be its dual-13MP camera sensors. The secondary lens present at the back is a monochrome shooter while the one at the front is a 13MP camera. All three of them use Zeiss optics, but that's not the only stand-out feature in stock. The camera app supports native live-streaming to Facebook or YouTube. Despite its 5.3-inch screen, the Nokia 8 features a non-removable 3,090mAh battery with support for Quick Charge 3.0.\n\nHMD Global has stated that the official launch of the smartphone is going to be a swift one.

Long rumored as the premium flagship of the revived brand, the Nokia 8 features cutting-edge technology and a new Dual-Sight mode for taking 'bothies': portraits using both the front and the rear camera. It launches this September for \u20ac599 (around $700).\n\nThe latest phone by the Finnish giant is the device that was promised since leaks starting making its way into the web earlier this year. The company said that they would release at least five phones in 2016, and the Nokia 8 marks the fifth if we count the revamped 3310.\n\nHMD's Nokia is against the likes of Samsung and Google itself in the premium tier market, and that's without including other top firms like LG or rising threats from the East like Xiaomi, Huawei, and OnePlus.\n\nAs is tradition by now with the brand handsets, the 8 was made from a single 6000 Series aluminum slab. The finished design gives the phone its rounded edges and attractive color coating, which comes in Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Steel, and Tempered Blue.\n\nOn the outside, HMD is keeping the home button, which in other flagships of its category is already disappearing in favor of other forms of technology. The button, however, doubles as a fingerprint sensor and is not located in any weird places like in Samsung's premium phones.\n\nInside, there is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC paired with 4 GB of RAM in the only configuration so far. The official site lists a fifth design alternative in Gloss Blue, which comes with 128 GB of storage instead of the standard 64 GB for all the others. Both are microSD card-compatible for expansion up to 256 GB.\n\nHMD Global themselves say that the rich features of the Nokia 8 are what sets it apart from the other Android flagships out there. Out of them all, the Dual-Sight mode is definitely the most appealing, even if some dismiss it as just a gimmick.\n\nThe new Nokia is riding on the rising trend of live content broadcasting and has added a two-camera shooting mode that works not only with photo and video but also streaming directly to Facebook and YouTube. People can record what's happening simultaneously from two perspectives and show it to the whole world.\n\nThis feature comes courtesy of Carl Zeiss and a new set of dual cameras on the back and a front camera with the same 13 MP of shooting quality. Both can record in 4K and take impressive 'bothie' pictures that you can also share instantly.\n\nOZO Audio pairs nicely with this feature, bringing rich sound as a welcomed feature on the Nokia 8. This \"Hollywood\" grade sound is making its debut in small form factors since previously it was reserved for pro studios used to make films.\n\nLast but not least, Nokia once again delivers the pure Android experience that was once promised in Motorola phones and other manufacturers, offering the closest thing there is to a stock version of the mobile OS made by Google. Plus, there is a deal in place to keep you updated on the latest security releases.\n\nHMD's Nokia 8 launches this September for \u20ac599, which translates roughly to $700. At that price point, the newcomer device looks quite enticing for some consumers who don't want to shell out almost $1,000 for a member of the Samsung Galaxy family or the latest in the Google Pixel lineup.\n\nRumors say that the Nokia 8 is not all HMD has to offer to its highest tier of customers. There is a chance that an even more exclusive device sees the light of day before the end of the year, but for the time being, you can get your hands on this flagship next month.", "id": "9665550", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "HMD reveals bothie-taking Nokia 8", "image": "http://theusbport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maxresdefault-3.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile operating system"}, "id": "308235", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}, "id": "312003", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}, {"label": {"eng": "Xiaomi Tech"}, "id": "314119", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi_Tech"}, {"label": {"eng": "Motorola"}, "id": "324217", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "01:26:00"}

In short, there are few huge features included in the update--which is out today for select beta testers--but lots of small improvements that should improve the system's functionality overall.\n\nSome of the enhancements center around streaming using the PS4's built-in broadcasting capabilities. PS4 Pro users will be able to stream in 1080p and 60 FPS, provided their connection is strong enough, and PSVR users will be able to see new messages and comments coming through while broadcasting. PSVR is also adding 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound support.\n\nNext up, the PS4's Friends List is being updated with greater management tools, such as the ability to set up separate lists of friends. You'll be able to create a list of all the people you play Destiny with and send them all an invite, for example. This feature replaces the old Favorite Groups tab.\n\nIn another move to help reduce the amount of time spent in menus, the Quick Menu is being updated to have more options. For example, you'll be able to check on download progress and see new party invites. You can also leave a party from within that menu and see your current Spotify playlist.\n\nNotifications are also being improved when watching films and TV, as you can now disable message and other notification pop-ups while watching media. You can also change how much of a message is displayed, as well as its color, when playing or watching any form of content.\n\nFinally, Parental Control features are being overhauled in favor of what Sony calls \"Family on PSN.\" This replaces the old Master/Sub account system; instead, one user is deemed the Family Manager, and they can set up other accounts and appoint them as a Parent/Guardian, Adult, or Child. Parents or Guardians can restrict Child accounts in their \"use of online features and communication with other players, set restrictions for games, restrict the use of the internet browser, and set spending limits for PlayStation Store.\" Note that Sony says the first time any North American user tries to set up an Adult account, they will be charged $0.50 \"to verify that you are an adult.\"\n\nYou can read all the details of the 5.0 update here. Beta testers who were selected to take part will be able to upgrade today, though bear in mind that your console may experience \"unexpected issues\" as a result of the beta. Sony does say, however, that you can downgrade to the current version of 4.73. The company has not revealed when the update will go live for all users, though beta invites do include two extra codes for testers to try it out with friends.\n\nFiled under: PlayStation 4 Gametech Upvote (19)Leave Blank View Comments (42)", "id": "9759548", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Big PS4 Update 5.0 Officially Revealed, Here's What It Does", "image": "https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_kubrick/1556/15568848/3274912-7606561114-29857.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television"}, "id": "302838", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop music"}, "id": "303105", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video game console"}, "id": "304421", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Web browser"}, "id": "306026", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spotify"}, "id": "307723", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "First-person shooter"}, "id": "314284", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter"}, {"label": {"eng": "7.1 surround sound"}, "id": "371798", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental Control"}, "id": "378103", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_Control"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Store"}, "id": "431033", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Store"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual surround"}, "id": "526394", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_surround"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation VR"}, "id": "1270845", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_VR"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 64, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 552, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 566, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Online"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1096, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms"}], "time": "14:20:00"}

There is a 13MP selfie camera as well on board with display flash, f/2.0 aperture and PDAF.\n\nLeaving the specifications apart, the Nokia 8 seems to have features such as Dual-Sight that uses both the front and rear cameras at the same time to click a snap, Nokia OZO Audio, Liquid Cooling that will keep the smartphone cool preventing overheating, and IP54 rating to make it splash proof.\n\nNokia 8 45,000(Expected Price) Specs Competitors Images +8", "id": "9833436", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Nokia 8 India release to happen during Diwali, to cost around Rs. 45,000", "image": "https://www.gizbot.com/img/2017/08/nokia8indiareleasetohappenduringdiwalitocostaroundrs45000-18-1503035439.jpg?18082017113721", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Steel"}, "id": "302732", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Indo-Asian News Service"}, "id": "305741", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Asian_News_Service"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}, "id": "306746", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}, "id": "312003", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}, {"label": {"eng": "LTE (telecommunication)"}, "id": "313094", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dual SIM"}, "id": "322106", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_SIM"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diwali"}, "id": "328626", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB Type-C"}, "id": "1270770", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_Type-C"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "06:18:00"}

Called simply the Nokia 8, the phone boasts some impressive specifications including a returning partnership with imaging experts Carl Zeiss.\n\nWith a sleek all-aluminium unibody design that's available both in matte and polished metal variations this is every bit the minimalist premium smartphone that you'd expect from Nokia.\n\nIt's also one of the phones to feature a new copper-style colour, something that we know has been leaked as a possible new colour for the iPhone 8.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is slim too, measuring just 7.3mm at its thickest point. Something to note that's really impressive about this device is there isn't a single sharp line or edge anywhere on the body. Instead everything sits flush within the curved body making it extremely comfortable to hold.\n\nWhile the design is impeccable, what Nokia is really pushing however is a particular feature within the camera which allows you to use both the front-facing and rear-facing cameras at the same time creating what the company calls a 'bothie' (instead of a selfie).\n\nIf taking a new type of selfie isn't up your street then you'll be pleased to learn that Nokia has rekindled its much-loved partnership with Carl Zeiss.\n\nBack before smartphones changed the world Nokia's partnership with Zeiss led to the creation of the superb N series, boasting 'smart' phone capabilities and a camera that could actually compete with stand-alone digital cameras available at that time.\n\nWell that partnership is back and in the Nokia 8 you're getting two 13MP Zeiss optics cameras. One shooting in colour and the other in monochrome.\n\nOn the front there's another 13MP camera for taking selfies or as Nokia insists on calling them 'bothies'.\n\nThe camera can shoot the same 'bokeh' effect shots you find on most smartphones now and can also record video in 4K.\n\nThe 8 also features the same 3D-audio recording technology from Nokia's $60,000 OZO virtual reality camera. What's even more impressive is that video sent to other people will still boast 3D audio, even if the recipient's phone doesn't feature the technology.\n\nFinally there's the screen. While some brands choose to stick with a standard HD display, the Nokia 8 has a reassuringly high-resolution 2K display. For comparison that's higher than the current iPhone but lower than the Samsung Galaxy S8.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will come running the latest version of Google's Android software and the company is promising that it will receive regular security updates as well as making sure you're on the latest version of Android.\n\nIt'll have 64GB of internal storage which can then be expanded using a microSD card.\n\nIt's available in four colours (Polished Blue, Tempered Blue, Steel, Polished Copper) and will be on sale in the UK early September for around \u20ac599 or $700.

At an event held in London today, HMD Global took the wraps off the Nokia 8, its new flagship Android smartphone. The smartphone features a gorgeous aluminum unibody build, said to be machined from a single block of 6000-series aluminum. It is then polished further to achieve a mirror-like finish that does look very charming. While not completely protected against the elements, the handset does come with an IP54 rating that makes it somewhat splash resistant.\n\nJust as the leaks had revealed, the Nokia 8 sports a 5.3-inch 1440 x 2560 Quad HD LCD display with a pixel density of 554 pixels per inch. HMD Global claims a peak brightness of 700 nits, which should translate into brilliant sunlight legibility. Like most other 2017 flagships, the Nokia 8 display is protected by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 5. Running under the hood is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 octa-core 64-bit SoC with an Adreno 540 GPU and 4GB of LPDDR4X RAM. The smartphone includes 64GB of UFS 2.1 internal memory, which can be expanded further with a microSD card by up to 256GB.\n\nThe Nokia 8 features dual 13MP resolution cameras at the rear, with the primary sensor equipped with optical image stabilization, Carl Zeiss optics, laser + PDAF autofocus, and 1.12-micron pixel size. The secondary 13MP sensor takes monochrome shots, similar to the dual-camera setups on Huawei flagships. For selfies, the Nokia 8 includes a 13MP snapper on the front with 1.12-micron pixels, an f/2.0 aperture lens, and phase detection autofocus. When shooting 4K video with the primary camera, the Nokia 8 can capture 360-degree spatial surround audio, thanks to OZO Audio technology.\n\nConnectivity features offered by the Nokia 8 include Wi-Fi 802.11ac dual-band, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS with GLONASS, USB Type-C 3.1, NFC, and 4G VoLTE. Keeping the lights on is a 3090mAh capacity battery with Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 support. In terms of software, the Nokia 8 will ship with the Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system out of the box and not Android O as rumored.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has been priced at 599 EUR (Rs.45,000 approx) and will begin shipping in Europe next month. Color options include Tempered Blue, Steel, Polished Blue, and Polished Copper. The official Nokia 8 product page also lists a \"Glossy Blue\" option with 6GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 128GB of UFS 2.1 storage.", "id": "9577987", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 goes official with a 5.3\" Quad HD display and 13MP dual rear cameras with ZEISS optics - Gear | MySmartPrice", "image": "https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Nokia-8.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Global Positioning System"}, "id": "306161", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}, "id": "306746", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}, "id": "307030", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Operating system"}, "id": "307345", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}, "id": "312003", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}, {"label": {"eng": "64-bit computing"}, "id": "315011", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel"}, "id": "315167", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "4G"}, "id": "315856", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel density"}, "id": "317242", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density"}, {"label": {"eng": "IEEE 802.11ac"}, "id": "322949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ac"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1255, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Optics", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Optics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1256, "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Optics", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Optics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1442, "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Optoelectronics and Fiber", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Optoelectronics_and_Fiber"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1560, "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Products and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Products_and_Services"}], "time": "19:33:00"}

HMD describes the feature as \"less Selfie, more Bothie\".\n\nIntroducing the new #Nokia8 with Dual-Sight mode, our most powerful Android smartphone. #Bothie #Nokiamobile https://t.co/8M7cS3ah9I pic.twitter.com/UoBKezXuYA -- Nokia Mobile (@nokiamobile)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nHMD had chosen to release cheaper models first because 50% of global demand was for phones costing between \u20ac100 and \u20ac250, Sarvikas said in an interview. \"We wanted to start there, where we know that we are highly relevant with our proposition. We're very eager to enter the flagship segment as well.\"\n\nNew optics\n\nThe new device has Zeiss cameras, after HMD said in July that it had signed a partnership with the group, part of the German optics company Carl Zeiss AG.\n\nThe launch comes as Apple prepares to launch a new iPhone and Samsung rolls out its new Galaxy Note 8. Sarvikas said by phone that HMD was \"less concerned about competition; we're here to design for the consumers.\"\n\nDemand for the redesigned 3310 feature phone, unveiled in February, had been \"very strong.\" Sarvikas was unable to share detailed sales figures but said HMD had sold \"millions\" of smartphones and \"tens of millions\" of feature phones - of which the 3310 is just one model.\n\nNokia Oyj sold the handset business to Microsoft in 2014. In 2016 Microsoft sold it to HMD and FIH Mobile, a subsidiary of Chinese phone maker Foxconn Technology. HMD's CEO Arto Nummela, a former Nokia executive, left the company last month.\n\nSUBSCRIBE FOR FREE UPDATE: Get Fin24's top morning business news and opinions in your inbox.", "id": "9645019", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia-Maker mixes with Apple, Samsung in new smartphone launch", "image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5018/2043dae80d314c1b8f52bc084255b6d2.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1227, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1242}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "69", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}], "location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "08:44:00"}

which is now the exclusive licensee of the Nokia brand name for smartphones and tablets - and has already been busy revamping the company's product line.\n\nIn March, a new version of its classic 3310 handset was revealed, as well as three new mid-range Android smartphones -

the feature technology from optics giant Carl Zeiss, who agreed a partnership with Nokia in July.\n\nThese early specs - if true - could place the Nokia 8 alongside the other flagship Android phones on the market from the likes of Samsung, HTC and Huawei, as well as the iPhone 7.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday night takes place just over a week before Samsung is due to reveal the Galaxy Note 8, the first new Note device since the Korean firm was forced to recall and discontinue the Note 7 last year over safety concerns and battery fires.\n\nApple is expected to follow in early September with the announcement of the next version of the iPhone -

This carries a bit of historical significance, but it also means that Nokia has entered a domain full of strong and worthwhile contenders. Whether the Nokia 8 remains afloat in this crowded field of smartphones partly depends on how much the Nokia name can carry the phone, but also whether the Nokia 8 is a good option on its own.\n\nOn the spec tables below, I've included the Moto Z2 Force, OnePlus 5, HTC U11, Samsung Galaxy S8/S8 Plus, and LG G6. Keep in mind there are other notable releases from this year and even from last year, a particularly strong point if you are someone willing to save some scratch to get something a bit older.\n\nStarting things off with processors, the Nokia 8 joins the growing list of phones that feature Qualcomm's latest 10nm Snapdragon 835 mobile platform. All the phones except the LG G6 feature the processor, with the LG G6 featuring last year's Snapdragon 821. It is still a speedy chipset, but the Snapdragon 835 will give you more future-proofing, extra performance, and more battery life in the long run.\n\nThe Nokia 8 also keeps pace with other flagships in terms of displays, with the phone featuring a Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440) resolution. Apart from the OnePlus 5, which sticks to a 1080p AMOLED display, all the other displays feature at least QHD resolution. Even putting the OnePlus 5 aside, however, discrepancies remain between display technology.\n\nFor one, the Nokia 8's and LG G6's panels are LCD, which means that they do not support Daydream VR. Meanwhile, the LG G6's and Galaxy S8/S8 Plus' panels support HDR, but even then, the specifics are a bit fuzzy. All of the displays are scratch-resistant to an extent, but the Moto Z2 Force's display technology prevents it from shattering when dropped, at the expense of a scratch-prone screen. Finally, whereas the LG G6 and Galaxy S8/S8 Plus feature taller, 18:9 displays, the Nokia 8, Moto Z2 Force, OnePlus 5, and HTC U11 feature more traditional 16:9 displays.\n\nIn other words, if you do not care about any of that, the Nokia 8's display will serve you just fine. If you sweat over the details, however, it might be best to do a bit of homework on all of the phones.\n\nThings get a bit simpler when it comes to memory. The Nokia 8 features 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB UFS flash across the board, though the Tempered Blue variant features 6 GB of RAM and double the storage. Regardless of the color choice, the fast UFS options are a boon and the microSD card slot is there if those storage amounts are not enough.\n\nMoving right along, Nokia puts its relationship with Carl Zeiss optics to good use with the Nokia 8's dual 13 MP cameras. Both sensors feature f/2.0 aperture, but the color sensor is the only one with optical image stabilization - the monochrome sensor does not feature OIS. The front-facing sensor also stands at 13 MP with f/2.0 aperture and auto-focus, which allows the Nokia 8 to include its \"bothie\" feature.\n\nThis feature allows pictures and videos to be taken with the front and rear cameras at the same time. The phone also utilizes Ozo Audio that uses its microphones to capture a high dynamic range and record binaural audio. It is nice to have these features available out of the box, but, at least with the \"bothie\" mode, it can be replicated with the right app.\n\nThis is where the other options come in. The Moto Z2 Force, OnePlus 5, and LG G6 also feature dual rear cameras, while the single rear sensors found on the HTC U11 and Galaxy S8/S8 Plus are still impressive. The LG G6's selfie sensor is really the only \"okay\" option available, but we are at a point where Android flagships finally feature capable cameras on the front and back.\n\nIn terms of battery, the Nokia 8 features a 3,090 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0. The standard allows for rapid charging, but the emphasis is on improved efficiency. If fast charging is all you want, then things do not get faster than the OnePlus 5's Dash Charge. You have to use the cable and power brick included in the box if you want to use Dash Charge, however, and the OnePlus 5 does not support any other fast charging standard.\n\nFinally, the Nokia 8 does not mess around too much with bonus features. The phone features IP58 certification, so while it is reasonably protected against dust, it is only splash-proof. The phone also retains the 3.5 mm headphone jack, NFC, and Android 7.1.1 Nougat. We know that last bit is a weird thing to include for bonus features, but that is for a good reason: timely updates, which Nokia promised for its Android phones and has so far delivered.\n\nThe HTC U11, Galaxy S8/S8 Plus, and LG G6 also feature IP ratings for water and dust resistance, but the Moto Z2 Force and OnePlus 5 do not. With more and more flagships featuring IP ratings, it is becoming less of an excuse for higher-tier phones to have water and dust resistance.\n\nFinally, we have to discuss virtual assistants because, for some reason, HTC and Samsung are dabbling with them with Amazon Alexa and Bixby, respectively. They, along with the Nokia 8 and the others, also use Google Assistant, with Nokia choosing to put efforts elsewhere.\n\nOverall, the Nokia 8 checks off all the boxes that a 2017 Android flagship needs to. The problem, and one you might have caught on, is whether the Nokia 8 does enough to differentiate itself from the competition. Sure, the Nokia name is still an evocative one, but I am not sure whether it will convince folks to buy the Nokia 8 over something like the Samsung Galaxy S8/S8 Plus.\n\nAnother concern is the Nokia 8's price, which currently sits at \u20ac599. My fears would be greatly diminished if it sold for $599, but if the phone sells for the conversion rate of around $705, that puts the Nokia 8 in a financial pickle. The OnePlus 5, which features similar specs across the board sans the display, sells for $200 less in the US. Funny enough, the only phone in this comparison that costs more than the Nokia 8, at least in USD, is the Moto Z2 Force.\n\nEven with all of that being said, the Nokia 8 looks to be a solid Android flagship, but what do you think?

It's powered by a Snapdragon 835 processor and comes equipped with 4GB or 6GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of built-in storage, and a microSD slot for adding more storage.\n\nOne of the highlight features of the Nokia 8 is its ZEISS-branded dual rear camera setup. There's one 13-megapixel color sensor and one 13-megapixel monochrome sensor, and the setup includes OIS, PDAF, an IR range finder, and dual tone flash. Meanwhile, the front-facing camera is a 13-megapixel shooter with PDAF.\n\nHMD Global, maker of the Nokia 8, is touting the phone's Dual-Sight mode that lets you use the front and back cameras at the same time for split-screen photos and video. Also included is built-in streaming to both Facebook Live and YouTube Live.\n\nAnother main focus of the Nokia 8 is the Nokia OZO spatial 360-degree audio. HMD Global touts that OZO enables you to \"accentuate the right sounds while reducing ambient sounds or background noise.\"\n\nRounding out the Nokia 8's feature set is a fingerprint reader, 3090mAh battery, USB Type-C port, and 3.5mm headphone jack. The whole body is IP54-rated to be splashproof.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will roll out globally through September at an average retail price of \u20ac599 ($705 USD).

In February HMD unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, priced at $163 and $222 respectively.\n\nJuho Sarvikas, HMD's chief product officer, said now was \"the perfect time\" to introduce the model, which he describes as a flagship product. The phone will feature a \"dual-sight\" photo and video function, in which images from the front and rear cameras will be displayed simultaneously on a split screen. HMD describes the feature as \"less Selfie, more Bothie\".\n\nHMD had chosen to release cheaper models first because 50 percent of global demand was for phones costing between $117 and $294, Sarvikas said in an interview.\n\n\"We wanted to start there, where we know that we are highly relevant with our proposition. We're very eager to enter the flagship segment as well.\"\n\nThe new device has Zeiss cameras, after HMD said in July that it had signed a partnership with the group, part of the German optics company Carl Zeiss AG.\n\nThe launch comes as Apple prepares to launch a new iPhone and Samsung rolls out its new Galaxy Note 8. Sarvikas said by phone that HMD was \"less concerned about competition; we're here to design for the consumers.\"\n\nDemand for the redesigned 3310 feature phone, unveiled in February, had been \"very strong.\" Sarvikas was unable to share detailed sales figures but said HMD had sold \"millions\" of smartphones and \"tens of millions\" of feature phones - of which the 3310 is just one model.\n\nNokia Oyj sold the handset business to Microsoft Corp. in 2014. In 2016 Microsoft sold it to HMD and FIH Mobile Ltd., a subsidiary of Chinese phone maker Foxconn Technology Group.

However, if you care about performance, you should probably look elsewhere.\n\nFor a budget-friendly phone, the Nokia 5 looks and feels rather premium. But for many, it's what's on the inside that counts, and that's where the phone's lower price starts to become evident. The question with any budget phone is what compromises had to be made in order to achieve the price - and whether those compromises are ones you can live with.\n\nFind out if this budget-friendly device is right for you in our full Nokia 5 review!\n\nThe Nokia 5 is sleek and doesn't feel 'cheap' at all in the hand.\n\nThe Nokia 5 is sleek and doesn't feel \"cheap\" at all in the hand. Like many more premium models, it's made entirely from metal (precision-milled aluminum) and has rounded corners for a very ergonomic feel. It's just the right amount of weighty too, giving the impression of quality as a result.\n\nThe look is also distinct, with nods to the design language of old Lumia devices. The metal chassis gives it a two-toned finish and a kind of 'jacket' that surrounds the front panel. My test unit has a matte chrome finish that looks very nice across the back. The device is also available in black, dark blue, and the in-vogue rose gold.\n\nAll in all, the Nokia 5's aesthetics are not going to win any pageants against the likes of the Galaxy S8, but it's definitely a looker.\n\nSpeakers are located on the bottom of the device and are pretty loud, though not without occasional distortion when cranked up. They're also located just where you don't want them for gaming. There's a fingerprint sensor on the home button (which is an indent rather than a button) and it's quite fast. Additionally, the phone is 'drip' resistant with IP52 certification, which means you won't be able to take it swimming.\n\nThe Nokia 5 sports a pretty basic 720p IPS display. If you love crisp white web pages and photos that pop on the screen before you upload them to the PC, you might be disappointed here. Watching media is acceptable but not the best experience for gaming or watching YouTube. If you use your smartphone as a primary media consumption device, then it might be worth looking for something with at least a small bump up in resolution.\n\nThis probably isn't the best phone for people that watch a ton of YouTube videos\n\nAt 5.2 inches, you theoretically get a lot of screen real estate but this is somewhat neutered by the lower resolution. For instance, when you use Android's multitasking feature (which does work fine in terms of performance), you won't be able to resize apps and will be forced to stick at a 50/50 screen share. Likewise, apps feel a little squashed and claustrophobic at anything less than 100%.\n\nThe Nokia 5's performance depends heavily on which task you're trying to accomplish\n\nPowering the Nokia 5 is an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor clocked at 1.4 GHz with an Adreno 505 GPU. We've seen the Snapdragon 430 perform well in other low-cost handsets, though the Nokia 5's performance depends heavily on which task you're trying to accomplish.\n\nFor instance, we rarely ran into any issues when multitasking, despite the device's low 2 GB of RAM. However, we did notice a ton of lag when browsing web pages and gaming, and dropped frames became somewhat normal.\n\nIt's all perfectly serviceable, it's just not the most pleasant experience. Whether this is acceptable to you will likely depend on whether browsing and consuming media on your phone is something you do often or particularly enjoy. If not, you may not need this to be the most polished experience.\n\nCall quality, signal strength, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi all work just fine and I experienced no dropped calls or other worrying issues. I will say that YouTube seemed to occasionally downgrade my resolution even on home Wi-Fi, though I'm not sure if this was just a glitch for me or not.\n\nWhat's more likely to be a problem for the average user is the tiny amount of internal storage. You get just 16 GB, which will fill up fast if you take a few photos and install a few apps; especially as only half of that will be available when you first boot up the device. Fortunately, there is expandable storage (microSD up to 128 GB) but personally I find that to be a poor substitute and would much rather have both. I'm sure other users would feel similarly.\n\nBattery life here is just fine. The device tends to last me all day, and I even consider myself to be a power user. In one day, I used Google Maps to navigate with the screen on during an hour-long journey, watched several YouTube programs, played Transformers: Forged to Fight, and had two long calls and it still made it well into the evening.\n\nThe device tends to last me all day, and I even consider myself to be a power user\n\nIt's no workhorse though, and when you consider the 720p display, one might expect better battery performance. It only has a 3,000 mAh battery, so any longevity here is likely coming from the innate software optimization found in Android. Quick Charge 3.0 is a nice addition for a budget phone, which will be able to get you around a 50% charge in an hour.\n\nAdditionally, the decision to go with a MicroUSB port over USB Type-C does feel pretty backwards, and means you can expect slower transfer speeds than other Android devices out there.\n\nAnother area where corners seem to have been cut is the camera.\n\nThere was a time when cameras were Nokia's 'thing', but you'll be disappointed if you were expecting anything exciting here\n\nThere was a time when cameras were Nokia's 'thing' (Lumia 1020 anyone?), but you'll be disappointed if you were expecting anything exciting here. The megapixel count is respectable at 13 MP, but the main problem here is lighting. Most photos come out too dark, even in good lighting conditions. There is a hefty flash on the back, though it mostly leaves things with brilliant white spots and long shadows.\n\nDaylight shots look fairly washed out most of the time, and other times they'll appear overexposed or blurred - especially when shooting moving subjects. HDR is present and the autofocus works well enough, so you can get some nice shots with a little work and patience. Just know that you'll want to take another camera with you on holiday and that your Facebook albums aren't going to be the most dynamic among your friends.\n\nCamera software is disappointingly basic too, with no fun or unique features to explore. For example, you won't find any fun filters to play with, nor will you have the option to change settings manually. It really does feel rather stripped back.\n\nNokia 5 camera samples\n\nThe 8 MP front-facing camera is capable of recording video in 1080p. This ironically means you can't play them back at full resolution until you get them home and onto the computer!\n\nThe Nokia 5's software experience is something that will make many of our readers happy though, and that's because it's basically running stock Android. With no bloatware or crazy customizations, things run as quickly as possible.\n\nIt's also running one of the latest versions of Android, 7.1.1 Nougat, which means you'll get access to the latest features from Google, such as Google Assistant. As long as the device is on or plugged in, you can summon Google at any time to offer you conversions in the kitchen, or to start navigation while driving. That's a pretty great feature in such an affordable device.\n\nWith no bloatware or crazy customizations, things run as quickly as possible.\n\nWhile a lot of people love the bare-bones Android experience, it's not going to be perfect for every user. For instance, to do something simple like displaying the battery percentage in your status bar, you need to navigate to the well-hidden System UI Tuner to do so. It'd also be nice to have a tethering shortcut in the quick settings panel. Things like this demonstrate that customizations aren't always a bad thing - and you may actually miss some of them when they're gone. Many people won't notice these things are missing though, and there are apps to handle most of it. As it is, stock Android can sometimes feel a little empty.\n\nI always find it tricky to review budget devices like this. When you spend this little - \u20ac189 to be exact - you know that you're not likely to get the very best design, specs, and camera. Instead you need to choose which of these things matters most to you and where you want the limited budget to go. The Nokia 5 is for those people to whom looks matter more than specs and performance. If you want a phone that will serve as a bit more of a fashion statement and look good when you use it, then this might be a solid choice.\n\nIf you want a phone that will serve as a bit more of a fashion statement and look good good when you use it, then this might be a solid choice.\n\nBut if you're someone who loves mobile gaming and consuming media, then something with a better screen and a little more oomph may be your preference. Either way, you'll want to invest in a microSD card and you'll probably still need to bring a camera with you when you travel.\n\nLike the Nokia 5's look but want a little more screen resolution and maybe some stereo speakers?

The firmware is currently in beta testing, and it brings a wide variety of changes, not the least of which is a redesigned master and sub-account system that makes it easier for families to manage their accounts. Changes are also coming for VR, managing friends, and more.\n\nSome of the features, such as the redesigned master/sub-account system, were tipped in the original leak. Sony has confirmed these features itself, though, at least as far as the beta software goes. Once update 5.0 rolls around, parents will be able to apply parental control settings to individual accounts, PlayStation Network will get a 'Family Manager' feature, and it'll be easier to create accounts for kids.\n\nUsers will also be given greater control over managing their friends list thanks to the addition of a 'Custom lists' tab where the 'Favorite Groups' tab currently exists. This is found on the 'Friends' screen. As the name suggests, PS4 owners will be able to create their own custom list of friends, which includes arranging them into groups, including putting some people into groups for specifics games you play with them.\n\nIf you use your console to broadcast, you'll be glad to know Sony is including some updates in 5.0 that'll suit your habits. Namely, broadcasters will soon be able to link their own communities when broadcasting, exposing them to viewers and making it easier for those viewers to visit the communities. As well, Sony says that it is adding a 'Display Message to Spectators and Spectators' Comments' settings for PS VR. With this, comments from spectators are visible in VR.\n\nLikewise concerning broadcasting is an update for PlayStation 4 Pro owners who will be able to stream to Twitch in 1080p resolution, something we've previously heard about.\n\nBroadcasting aside, the PlayStation 5.0 firmware update will also bring changes to messaging. If you use the console to listen to music, for example, the update will allow you to send a specific track to someone in a PS4 message. The recipient will have the option of listening to the track directly from the message.\n\nJoining too are tweaks to notifications, another previously tipped category of changes. If you don't like getting pop-up notifications, update 5.0 will give you the option to disable them...at least when you're watching television or movies, something that should have been added around the same time PlayStation Vue became a thing. Better late than never, though.\n\nUsers will also get the ability to change pop-up notifications to white or black, and to disable previews. Joining those changes are some updates to the Quick Menu, namely the addition of the notifications menu to this, making the notification alerts accessible while playing a game. The Quick Menu is also getting a 'Leave This Party' option.\n\nThat's not the full extent of the changes, though. The 5.0 update will also bring a new bracket viewer, PS VR virtual surround sound, and additional language support for Greek, Czech, Hungarian, Romanian, Vietnamese, Indonesian, and Thai.", "id": "9769066", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "PS4 update 5.0 features officially detailed: VR, friends, broadcasting and more", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Music"}, "id": "302636", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television"}, "id": "302838", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop music"}, "id": "303105", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video game console"}, "id": "304421", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}, "id": "340359", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Firmware"}, "id": "345389", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitch (website)"}, "id": "349819", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(website)"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 3 system software"}, "id": "395526", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_system_software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental controls"}, "id": "398807", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation VR"}, "id": "1270845", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_VR"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Vue"}, "id": "1272617", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Vue"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 64, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 402, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Tools and Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Tools_and_Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 413, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 821, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1030, "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Associations", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Associations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1096, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms"}], "time": "20:06:00"}

We take a look.\n\nNokia has unveiled its flagship for 2017 ,the Nokia 8, and it certainly looks to be a well-designed phone. But its European pricing puts it in the same league as Sammy's smartphone triumph, the Galaxy S8, which has some of the best hardware available. Has Nokia done enough to knock the S8 off the top spot? Here's all you need to know:\n\nNokia 8 vs Galaxy S8 - Design\n\nThe S8's curved-edge design and almost bezel-less display made it the nicest-looking phone of 2017. In fact, the S8 might just be the finest phone we've ever seen. The glass, screen and metal combine to make what feels like a solid and complete piece, while the lightweight design makes the phone feel seriously sleek. At 155g, it's lighter than the Nokia 8's 160g, and Sammy has managed to keep the handy MicroSD card slot despite the thin chassis.\n\nRelated: Best smartphone\n\nOverall, the curved edges, glass back, lack of a physical home button, and minimal bezel make the S8 look innovative as well as sleek. Nokia, or rather HMD Global which owns the rights to the Nokia brand, has chosen to keep a physical home button in place, which sits on a fairly beefy bezel on the bottom of the phone's face. There's also a hefty bezel at the top of the screen. The display itself does stretch to the sides of the phone, though, so the bezel is at least confined to the top and bottom of the handset.\n\nDespite the bezel, the Nokia 8 comes in a unibody design which has apparently been \"milled from a single block of 6000 series aluminium\". The 40-stage process of \"machining, anodizing and polishing\" has certainly resulted in what looks like a very classy smartphone, especially on the certain models that come with a high-gloss mirror finish, but Samsung's innovative design simply can't be beat for sheer looks.\n\nThe S8 is also IP68 water- and dust-resistant, so it will survive a dunk for 30 minutes in depths of up to 1.5 metres. Meanwhile the new Nokia 8 is only IP54 splash-proof, so don't go dropping it in the sink.\n\nCharging on both phones is handled by a USB Type-C port, but Sammy has also include Qi Wireless tech so you can juice up the S8 by simply placing it on a compatible charging mat. Another plus for Samsung, then. But at least the Nokia 8's fingerprint sensor remains on the front of the phone. Samsung was heavily criticised for moving its sensor to the rear of the phone and placing it right next to the camera lens.\n\nNokia 8 vs Galaxy S8 - Display\n\nIf you want the best screen available, then the Galaxy S8 wins on paper. Fancy curves aside, the phone comes with a new 18.5:9 aspect ratio, which means it's taller, giving you more space without having to enlarge the body of the device too much. While the previous Galaxy S7 had a 5.1-inch display, the S8 bumps that to 5.8, and it's a very capable panel at that.\n\nSamsung has provided an AMOLED panel with the odd quad-HD+ 2960 x 1440 resolution and Mobile HDR capabilities. In short, that makes for an incredibly sharp and dynamic on-screen image that few, if any, smartphones can match. We found in our review that the screen was so bright, we could keep it on 25% brightness and it's perfectly visible indoors. There's also a handy 'Video Enhancer' mode, which boosts the contrast and brightness in certain apps - Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube etc - to create a pseudo-HDR effect.\n\nNokia's offering might not be quite up to the same standard but it looks to be pretty close. The 5.3-inch display isn't AMOLED. Instead an IPS LCD panel has been used but it does boast an impressive QHD screen with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. The 700nit screen brightness isn't quite up to the S8's 1000+ nits but it's more than the LG G6's 650 nits, There's also a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 covering to protect the thing against drops, and the 2.5D Glass should produce a nice curve on the edges of the glass, even if it isn't quite as pronounced as on the S8.\n\nNokia 8 vs Galaxy S8 - Hardware\n\nThings are a little more even in the hardware department. Samsung uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor over in the states, and that's exactly what you'll find in the Nokia 8. Its' the top-end chip available right now, but the 836 isn't far away, so that's worth bearing in mind when considering any of these two devices. Outside of the states, Samsung uses its own Exynos 8895 chip, which is just as powerful as the Snapdragon 835.\n\nThe Nokia 8 and S8 also both sport 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, but you can expand that memory on both devices using a MicroSD card. All of which means you'll get a smooth and speedy user experience on both these devices. We can't say for sure whether there's much difference between the two as we are yet to try out the Nokia 8 for a prolonged period, but we'll update this piece once we have.\n\nOne element to note is that the Galaxy S8 comes with the Mali G71 CPU for the Exynos model and the Adreno 540 GPU for the Snapdragon version. That means games run incredibly well. We're still confirming what Nokia is working with in this regard.\n\nElsewhere, you'll find a non-removable 3000mAh battery on the S8, while the Nokia 8 comes with a 3090mAh cell. There likely won't be much difference between the two phones when it comes to power consumption, especially since they both use the same processors. But we'll have more once we've tried out the Nokia 8. As it stands, the S8 performed well, offering a day of use out the box, with the screen resolution bumped to quad-HD+ and the brightness at a very viewable 30%. That left us with about 10% battery life.\n\nOne area where the Nokia 8 will really have to deliver if it's to outdo the S8 is the camera. Samsung's offering is currently the best available, even though it doesn't come with a dual sensor like many of the more recent smartphones. Despite that, the single 12-megapixel sensor with wide f/1.7 lens and Dual Pixel tech makes for some stunning shots. The camera is also very quick, taking snaps as soon as you hit the shutter button, and the Auto HDR mode is a really useful addition.\n\nCan Nokia compete with that? Well, that remains to be seen, but on paper the 8's camera looks decent enough. Both the front and rear cameras have been co-developed with Zeiss optics, with the latter offering a dual setup which makes use of a 13-megapixel sensor with OIS and another 13-megapixel sensor that shoots in monochrome. That's the same setup as seen on phones from the likes of Huawei, and should make for some great shots with good depth of field. Other specs include an f/2.0 aperture, which isn't quite as wide as the S8's f/1.7, and a dual tone flash. Round the front, the 13-megapixel selfie shooter also boasts an f/2.0 aperture, which should be able to go toe-to-toe with the S8's 8-megapixel offering.\n\nHMD is making much of its Dual-Sight feature which uses the front and rear-facing cameras to live stream in split screen, or take pictures from both lenses at the same time. It's an interesting addition but whether users will find it useful remains unclear at this point.\n\nElsewhere, the Nokia 8 looks to have an interesting audio feature. HMD says the Nokia OZO Audiobrings spatial 360\u00b0 audio to your smartphone, offering what it claims is \"a fully immersive audio experience\" for your 4K video. We're yet to truly test it out, but it's an intriguing addition worth taking note of, especially since HMD says the binaural codecs enable high-fidelity playback even on devices without OZO Audio.\n\nNokia 8 vs Galaxy S8 - Software\n\nBoth Nokia and Samsung's phones run on the Android platform, which means you'll be getting Google's mobile OS no matter which smartphone you opt for. The latest version is Android Nougat 7.1.1, which comes on the Nokia 8, while the S8 comes with the first version, 7.0. However, Samsung will be releasing an update for the phone, so you'll be able to install Android Nougat 7.1.1 on the S8 very soon.\n\nOne big selling point for Nokia is its promise to offer a pure Android experience, with no unnecessary apps or add-ons. Un-skinned, untouched Android means you'll be mercifully spared the bloatware that comes with other companies' versions of the OS. So, it looks like we won't be getting any duplicate apps or dodgy skins on this device.\n\nSamsung, on the other hand, does skin its version of Android but that's not necessarily a bad thing in the case of the S8. Although previous Galaxy handsets have offered some pretty disappointing takes on the Android OS, we found the S8's software layer to be good-looking and functional, with more mature icons than the childish versions seen on older Samsung phones. The virtual home button even offers haptic feedback when pressed, and can be accessed even when the display is off.\n\nWhat's more, Samsung has added its own virtual assistant 'Bixby', so you'll be able to take advantage of the feature's AI capabilities.\n\nNokia 8 vs Galaxy S8 - Price and release\n\nThe Galaxy S8 has been out for a couple of months now, and can be picked up for \u00a3689 while the Plus model will run you \u00a3779. Check out our Best Galaxy S8 deals page for the latest offers on Sammy's handset.\n\nIf you'd rather hold out for the Nokia 8, HMD is releasing the phone in four colours - Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue, and Steel - throughout September. We're still awaiting a concrete release date for now, but stay tuned. The Nokia 8 will cost \u20ac599, which works out to about \u00a3544.\n\nNokia 8 vs Galaxy S8 - Summary\n\nPut simply, Samsung doesn't look like it needs to worry too much about the Nokia 8. There's no doubt HMD's handset offers some great hardware, but design-wise the S8 seems like it's at least a year ahead. It also offers just as good hardware and generally feels like a premium phone. The Nokia 8 certainly looks to be a great offering but it doesn't quite seem to edge the S8 out on paper. We'll have more once we've reviewed the Nokia 8 in full, so don't count it out yet.\n\nLet us know which phone you like the look of on social media.", "id": "9578003", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 vs Galaxy S8: Which is better? | Trusted Reviews", "image": "http://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/08/Nokia-8-vs-Galaxy-S8.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile operating system"}, "id": "308235", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}, "id": "308710", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED"}, {"label": {"eng": "Music video"}, "id": "309939", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adreno"}, "id": "351564", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adreno"}, {"label": {"eng": "Exynos (system on chip)"}, "id": "355361", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exynos_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}, "id": "393983", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy S7"}, "id": "1111713", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S7"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "17:33:00"}

"eng-3365057", "body": "Nokia has unveiled its first flagship Android smartphone - theNokia 8 - as the technology firm attempts to challenge the likes of Samsung and Apple for the first time.\n\nThe new device, which the firm said will cost \u00e2'\u00ac599, comes with split screen camera feature called Dual Sight which combines a photo or video from the front and rear-facing cameras at the same time.\n\nThe result is what Nokia is calling a \"Bothie\", which the company hopes will offer a new take on selfies.\n\nThe Nokia brand is now under license to Finnish start-up HMD Global, which sparked the firm's revival earlier this year with the launch of three mid-range Android phones - theNokia 3,5 and 6, as well as a revamped version of the 17-year-old 3310.\n\nThe flagship Nokia 8 features dual 13-megapixel rear cameras, as well as a 13-megapixel front-facing camera, while both the front and rear cameras feature optics technology from imaging giant Zeiss, who announced a new partnership with Nokia and HMD Global last month.\n\nZeiss technology is also being used to help improve the quality of photos taken on the 8,Nokia said, with \"image fusion algorithms\" in place to combine images captured by the two rear lenses into single photos.\n\nThe new phone also houses spatial audio technology previously only used in Nokia's high-end OZO 360 camera, which can play back sound in multiple directions, imitating how it was captured during recording.\n\nThe phone's specifications place it as a rival to the likes of Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S8 in the current smartphone market.\n\nHMD Global confirmed the phone will go on sale in \"early September\" and said the device was aimed at social media users and video creators.\n\n\"We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media,\" HMD chief product officer Juho Sarvikas said.\n\n\"People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own.\n\n\"It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance.\"\n\nLive video captured using the 8's Dual Sight mode can be shared directly to Facebook or YouTube from within the phone's Camera app.\n\nNokia and HMD Global's unveiling comes a week before Samsung is due to announce their next Note smartphone, the first since the Note 7 was discontinued last year over battery fires and safety fears.\n\nThe next iPhone, marking 10 years since the device first launched, is also expected to be announced in September.", "id": "9546622", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 to take on Iphone and

Only time will tell, but it's safe to say, from our initial impressions, the Nokia 8 is a very solid device and has all the trademarks of a 2017 high-end phone including a few little neat tricks up its sleeve.\n\nBut before we dive into the new device, let's start with a little history. The Nokia brand was relaunched by HMD Global at MWC this year, initially with a budget and mid-range offering, including the Nokia 3, 5, and 6. These phones run Android, and have nothing to do with the old Lumia range of Windows phones.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is the brand's new range-topping model, coming in at \u20ac599 (around \u00a3550) it's also the most expensive.\n\nFor that cash, you'll get specs which match the flagships from Samsung et al. Including the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset, 4GB RAM, 64GB expandable storage and a 5.3-inch QuadHD display.\n\nIt even features a full-length graphite shielded copper cooling pipe that dissipates the heat.\n\nFrom our initial play with the Nokia 8, it felt very quick, which is what you'd expect as it's essentially the same set up inside most other flagship phones. The LCD screen left us very impressed, it's sharp, and vibrant (so much so at first, we mistook it for an OLED panel). So far, so good.\n\nThe design is also very solid. At 7.9mm thick it's not the sleekest handset out there, but that makes it very comfortable to hold, with ergonomic tapered edges and soft corners.\n\nIt's well proportioned, but doesn't feature the bezel-less display found in the Samsung Galaxy S8, LG G6, and upcoming iPhone 8. Obviously, it's not the only phone to not include this new display tech (HTC U11), but it does make it look slightly more dated than the others.\n\nIt even comes in a striking Polished Copper, as well as other polished and matt finishes.\n\nIt's particularly smart of Nokia to let customers choose between matt and polished finishes - we like that a lot - because while the polished finish looks more striking, the matt finishes offer more grip. It's a tough choice, but good to let consumers make that decision.\n\nAnd now we arrive on the things that actually make the Nokia 8 a flagship phone. You see, it's now 2017, so to be considered a true flagship you need to be the best at something, or offer something others can't (Sony XZ Premium's super slow motion recording, Samsung's screen, Pixel's camera and software).\n\nFor Nokia these little bits of magic include OZO audio recording and a 'bothie' camera.\n\nLet's start with OZO Audio, shall we? The 8 combines three microphones to Nokia's acoustic algorithms to capture 360-degree spacial surround sound. This can be used in conjunction with 4K video recording, to create more immersive videos.\n\nIt's also smart enough to use binaural codecs, which enable high fidelity playback on devices without OZO Audio.\n\nIt's a cool idea in theory, and you'll have to wait for our full review to see if it works in practice.\n\nPersonally, I can't remember the last time I recorded a video on my phone, and when I did, it would have been something spectacularly dull, which wouldn't benefit from awesome 360-degree audio quality. What I'm saying is this feature is unlikely to sell phones, but it'll be a nice benefit for people who do decide to buy the Nokia 8 and film lots of video using their smartphone.\n\nThe next innovation is the 'bothie', an evolution of the selfie (I really had to force myself to type that). This uses the front and rear facing camera to create an image showing two sides of the story.\n\nIt's a cool idea and very well executed, but the 'bothie' branding does make us cringe a little.\n\nThe camera set up on the Nokia 8 is actually pretty cool. The rear facing dual camera features one colour stabilised sensor and one monochrome sensor, similar to the Huawei P10 set up.\n\nThese, combined with the front facing camera, are all co-developed with Zeiss optics. They all use a 13MP sensor, so image quality is the same in both directions.\n\nWe'll let you know what the image quality is like in our full review.\n\nWe liked the Nokia 8 a lot, it's an attractive flagship with a number of interesting features, made even more tempting by a competitive price (\u20ac599 / approx. \u00a3550).\n\nWe're looking forward to testing it further, to see whether it's software, camera and battery perform as well as we hope.", "id": "9615114", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Hands on Nokia 8 review: Is this the Nokia flagship we've been waiting for?", "image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R8XYsHwbMRxNDWnGUAotP-1200-80.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Video"}, "id": "302573", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sound recording and reproduction"}, "id": "302809", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Copper"}, "id": "306629", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphite"}, "id": "307290", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite"}, {"label": {"eng": "OLED"}, "id": "307342", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "LG Corp"}, "id": "307493", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microphone"}, "id": "307750", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Windows Phone"}, "id": "319197", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flagship"}, "id": "320976", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human factors and ergonomics"}, "id": "325739", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "High fidelity"}, "id": "374421", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fidelity"}, {"label": {"eng": "Heat pipe"}, "id": "414164", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pipe"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "16:51:00"}

Back in mid-July, we posted some rumors that the new Nokia 8 would come with a Snapdragon 835 SoC allowing it to be a higher end Nokia Android phone that feels like what everyone has been waiting for. Finally, HMD Global has provided some information about what the Nokia 8 will look like and what's running under the hood.\n\nHMD Global wasn't shy about telling the world that their newest flagship smartphone has three \"firsts\" in the Android world. One of the three \"firsts\" dubbed \"Bothie\" is a \"Dual-Sight\" video/photo option letting you use both the rear and front facing camera with a split screen visual offering real time recording if you plan on live streaming on Facebook or YouTube. You don't necessarily have to use it just for videos as photos will be an option too. You should be able to get a fine tuned photo thanks to Zeiss collaboration with the 13MP dual rear facing camera, one for color & OIS and the other for mono, with a 13MP front facing camera.\n\nThe second \"first\" deals with audio, which smartphones are slowly starting to get better at. The Nokia 8 comes with OZO Audio, \"Hollywood\" technology as HMD calls it, to provide you with a full 360-degree audio experience thanks to three microphones combined with Nokia's acoustic algorithms. When you share your videos with other, even if they don't have a Nokia 8, they will still be able to hear the 360-degree audio.\n\nAnd last but not least is the body and insides of the Nokia 8. It may not seem like a first for Android devices, but we'll give HMD the benefit of the doubt. The unibody is framed from a single block of 6000 series aluminum that goes through a 40 stage process for perfection. Inside of that single block of aluminum is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC leaving no shortage of performance. To keep the SoC cool, HMD included a full-length graphite shielded copper cooling pipe that keeps the handset cool when putting it through the ropes. The SoC wouldn't be complete without 4GB RAM to make multitasking much easier and IP54 rating allowing the phone to take some splash damage, but not totally destroy the phone. As for internal storage, you'll get 64GB by default which can be expanded up to 256GB with a MicroSD card, screen size is 5.3'' IPS LCD QHD 2560 x 1440 under a piece of Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 2.5D glass. USB Type-C is the charging port choice with Quick Charge 3.0 to go with the integrated 3,090mAh battery, and a fingerprint scanner. All of this is running on pure Android 7.1.1, which means no bloatware that we all dislike and monthly security updates to make sure the device is most current with Android updates.\n\nThere are four color options to choose from: Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue, and Steel. Price tag is \u20ac599 or about $705USD and available globally in September. No US release date yet, but that can change at any point in time. So tech heads, what do you think about the Nokia 8? Does anyone plan on purchasing one when it becomes available? Let us know by leaving comments down below, or on Google+, Twitter, or Facebook.\n\nSource: HMD Global +1 Tweet Share Share Stumble Pin Related Items:Android, featured, Mobile, Nokia, nokia 8, techRecommended for you [RUMOR] Huawei Mate 10 leaked images show up online Qualcomm announces depth-sensing camera tech for Android DOOGEE MIX review: An affordable nearly bezel-less phone", "id": "9596843", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "HMD Global finally gives us the Nokia 8 we've all been waiting for", "image": "http://techaeris.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Nokia-8-FI.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Copper"}, "id": "306629", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}, "id": "312003", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "IP Code"}, "id": "405233", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pre-installed software"}, "id": "424438", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-installed_software"}, {"label": {"eng": "S60 (software platform)"}, "id": "456644", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S60_(software_platform)"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB Type-C"}, "id": "1270770", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_Type-C"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "22:49:00"}

This is the first Flagship offering from the company, and it packs Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, 4GB LDDR4 RAM, and 5.3-inch Quad HD display. The major highlight of the phone is a dual 13MP rear camera set up.\n\nAfter being in the news and leaks for some time now, Nokia 8 is now official as expected and is the first smartphone to launch after the HMD Global and Carl Zeiss partnership for Nokia cameras. The device sports a 5.3 inches Quad HD LCD with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection and is powered by the 2.45GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset coupled with Adreno 540 and 4GB LDDR4 RAM.

Like the company's existing Nokia phones, the 8 will also run a clean, current version of Android with updates being made available as Google releases them.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect of the phone's design, however, is its cameras. Featuring exclusive ZEISS optics, the trio of 13MP shooters -- one for colour and one for monochrome at the rear, and a third front-facing -- enable a trick HMD hopes will speak to share-happy millenials.\n\nUsing a bit of software hocus pocus, the Nokia 8 can split the screen to display from the front and rear of the phone simultaneously, allowing pictures and videos that show the photographer's reaction alongside the image's subject. Nokia's software also allows this split feed to be easily streamed online.\n\nIn its marketing, HMD describes this \"Dual-Sight\" feature as \"less Selfie, more Bothie\".\n\n\"This is especially meant for millennial creators, people who want to share what's happening every day,\" HMD's chief marketing officer Pekka Rantala said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe phone can also record full 4K video and capture spatial 360-degree audio.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Technology Newsletter Technology Newsletter\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nLaunching in September at a global price Nokia expects will be around 599 euros ($888), the Nokia 8 joins the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 which are currently available at $250, $330 and $399 respectively. In other regions, the company also offers a modernised version of the classic Nokia 3310.\n\nHMD chose to release cheaper models first because 50 per cent of global demand was for phones costing between 100 euros and 250 euros (between $150 and $370), said Juho Sarvikas, HMD's chief product officer.\n\n\"We wanted to start there, where we know that we are highly relevant with our proposition. We're very eager to enter the flagship segment as well.\"\n\nThe launch comes as Apple prepares to launch a new iPhone and Samsung rolls out its new Galaxy Note 8. Sarvikas said that HMD was \"less concerned about competition; we're here to design for the consumers.\"\n\nWith agencies", "id": "9594246", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 flagship phone takes aim at stream-happy millennials", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/x/y/3/w/d/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gxy251.png/1502933717139.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "69", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Advertising"}, "id": "302578", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Email"}, "id": "302685", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marketing"}, "id": "303392", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Generation Y"}, "id": "304390", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics display resolution"}, "id": "312179", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fairfax Media"}, "id": "337961", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "01:39:00"}

The phone is a high-end model for sure, with a top-of-the-line processing package, iris scanner, metal body, and IP68 rating that handily takes the fight to Apple, Samsung, and the rest. The big question is whether this is enough to help the brand regain its former glory, or if smartphone owners are simply too spoilt for choice to bother with this legacy brand name anymore.\n\nDespite the high-end specifications, the most exciting part of the Nokia 8 announcement for me is the 13 megapixel dual camera. Yes we've seen plenty of dual camera smartphones released this year already, but it's the partnership with Zeiss for the camera optics that might give the company an edge over the excellent shooters already on the market. If the Nokia 8 is going to stand out from this year's flagships, rekindling the reputation the brand earned during the PureView and Zeiss days could really help.\n\nThere's no denying that the Nokia brand being shackled to the failed Windows Phone platform and subsequent absence from the huge world of Android has left the latest release with a distinct disadvantage. HMD Global not only has to rebuild the Nokia brand image if it wants to compete with big names like Apple and Samsung, but also has to compete against the low-cost competitive hardware of the Chinese manufacturers.\n\nWe've seen many a smartphone company dip in market share or even disappear from the industry after producing standard pieces of hardware, even of flagship calibre. Top-notch processors, tons of RAM, and a decent look are a dime a dozen in today's market, and you don't have to pay top dollar unless you opt for one of the premium brands.\n\nWe can't expect Nokia to be able to compete with Apple and Samsung on brand awareness and marketing out of the gate. The range needs a unique selling point.\n\nLooking at OnePlus for example, the company has had to raise its traditionally cutthroat prices with the OnePlus 5 to keep its specs competitive with the very best, and even then there are still a few hardware compromises. Other low cost brands, such as Xiaomi, are heavily reliant on selling extra services to boost profitability, something which HMD Global isn't in a position to do. It would also be unrealistic to expect Nokia to be able to compete with Apple and Samsung on brand awareness and marketing out of the gate, even if it's hardware specs are just as good. It's a tough situation to start from.\n\nOf course the Nokia brand is still worth a bit of weight in the minds of consumers, but ultimately price and hardware differentiation are what help companies stand out these days. Nokia's unique selling point in the past was its outstanding camera hardware, and the company would be wise to continue to focus on this front (especially with its Zeiss partnership) if it's looking for a way to stand out ahead of the crowd.\n\nThe Nokia 8's hardware looks very high-end, but generic flagship phones can be picked up cheap these days. The partnership with Zeiss gives Nokia a unique opportunity to stand out and it should capitalize on it.\n\nCameras are a very logical place to build a reputation and carve out not just a niche, but breach the general consumer barrier. The smartphone has replaced the portable point-and-click camera and is the primary shooter that most people carry around. Not to mention the explosion of selfie sharing and social media that has placed bigger demands on our compact shooters than ever before. As they say, the best camera is the one you have on you, and we're all hooked up to our phones most of the day.\n\nOther smartphone companies have built solid reputations based on camera performance recently. An obvious example is the Google Pixel and its excellent camera, but this trend isn't just reserved for the flagship tier of the market. Take Huawei's Honor range for example. It doesn't feature the most powerful hardware on the market, but it's well optimized for day-to-day tasks, looks like a premium piece of hardware aesthetically, takes excellent pictures, and boasts a price tag that won't break the bank. That's exactly what a huge number of consumers want in a phone.\n\nA huge portion of consumers want their phone to take good pictures, but even claiming the niche of mobile photography enthusiasts could help establish the new Nokia brand.\n\nNokia, in collaboration with Zeiss, has even done this before. Despite the questionable state of the Windows Phone ecosystem, the Lumia 1020 with its PureView technology tempted many a consumer who cared about camera quality. Even before modern smartphone operating systems, the Symbian-powered PureView 808 stood out based on little more than its camera prowess.\n\nPortable photography enthusiasts and smartphone veterans still look back on the 808 and 1020 days warmly. With the same partnership in place, HMD Global may be able to make lightning strike twice. Even if most consumers end up sticking with the established brands and their more than passable cameras, a niche of hardcore photography enthusiasts could be enough to sustain the brand in face of competition from other competent yet ultimately generic smartphone brands.\n\nAlthough a flagship release with all the bells and whistles is important for building up Nokia's profile as a serious brand and big player in the market, just as the Pixel range has been for Google, HMD's long-term success will almost undoubtedly depend on its broader range of phones. A good camera in the Nokia 8 is great for flagship customers, but there's a huge market for mid-tier and low-cost phones too. These consumers still want to be able to take good photos without breaking the bank.\n\nIf Nokia and Zeiss can bring top quality photography experiences down to the price range targeted by the likes of the Nokia 5, then we may really see the company nab some significant market share. Unfortunately it doesn't look like HMD Global has managed to accomplish this on its first attempt, but perhaps it will nail the formula next time around. We know that the two are planning a long term partnership after all!\n\nBut perhaps I'm wrong.

Here's how the Nokia 8 and OnePlus 5 stack up, so you can tell which one is worth your money.\n\nHMD Global has just launched its first Nokia-branded flagship phone, and the fourth smartphone using the name in 2017. While the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 were cut-price Android mobiles, the new Nokia 8 boasts premium hardware to take on other flagships - and so far, we're suitably impressed.\n\nOf course, the Nokia 8 has some incredibly strong competition right now, most notably from the OnePlus 5. The latest OnePlus device is a solid all-rounder, offering a great camera experience, cutting edge performance and plenty more besides, from just \u00a3449 here in the UK.\n\nSo how do the Nokia 8 and OnePlus 5 compare, and is this even a fair competition?\n\nNokia 8 vs OnePlus 5: Specs Phone Nokia 8 OnePlus 5 Screen size 5.3-inches 5.5-inches Screen resolution 2560x1440 1920x1080 Fingerprint sensor? Yes Yes Water resistant? Splash resistant only (IP54) No OS Android 7.1.1 Android 7.1.1 Processor Snapdragon 835 Snapdragon 835 Memory 4GB 6GB Storage 64GB 64GB microSD? Yes No Battery 3080mAh 3300mAh Rear camera 13MP dual-lens 20+16MP dual-lens Front camera 13MP 16MP Nokia 8 vs OnePlus 5: Design\n\nAlthough the OnePlus 5 offers the bigger screen here (5.5-inches compared with the 5.3-inch Nokia), both blowers are around the same dimensions and weight. The reason for that is the Nokia 8's slightly chunkier bezels surrounding the screen. As well as being about the same height and width, these Android flagships are pleasingly slender. Neither hits the 8mm mark, even though their camera modules stick out from the surface.\n\nA sturdy aluminium one-piece frame forms the body of each mobile, with aerial bands that blend in up top and down below. You get a choice of three matte colours with the OnePlus 5, while Nokia offers up four in all. As well as a standard matte silver or blue, you can pick up the Nokia 8 in a shiny 'polished' blue or copper finish. These glossy designs are total fingerprint magnets, of course.\n\nWant a spot of waterproofing? You're out of luck, then. Neither handset here offers full water resistance, so you best not go browsing in the bath. That said, Nokia's new blower is at least 'splash proof' (IP54) so you can get it moist without too much stress.\n\nNokia 8 vs OnePlus 5: Screen and media\n\nThe OnePlus 5's AMOLED panel produces vibrant visuals, which the Nokia 8 can more than compete with. In either case, you get punchy image reproduction, without any nasty over-saturation issues. Both displays are also powerfully bright, to counter glare.\n\nHowever, Nokia does beat the OnePlus when it comes to resolution. The OnePlus 5 serves up Full HD visuals, which means solid detail levels when watching video or checking out your photos. The Nokia 8 is a step beyond though, with its own Quad HD panel. You might struggle to notice the difference unless you stick these mobiles side-by-side, yet the Nokia phone produces seriously crisp images that are well and truly eye-pleasing.\n\nWhen it comes to storage, the OnePlus is again on the back foot. Although you get from 64GB of storage space, just as you do on the Nokia 8, HMD's handset is the only one to accept microSD memory cards for easy expansion.\n\nNokia 8 vs OnePlus 5: Features and OS\n\nBoth the Nokia 8 and the OnePlus 5 deliver the latest version of Android, although in quite different forms.\n\nOnePlus has tweaked and polished up Google's OS with its own OxygenOS overlay, adding in some bonus functionality. You get bonus gesture controls, some one-handed help, a gaming mode and a fair few other add-ons, many of which are actually quite helpful. Check out our OnePlus 5 tips and tricks guide for more info.\n\nOn the flip side you have the Nokia 8, which instead packs a very vanilla version of Android Nougat. While that means less bonus modes and gesture support than the OnePlus 5, you can also expect faster updating to Android O later in 2017 as a result.\n\nBoth handsets boast a responsive fingerprint sensor, for fast and effective security.\n\nNokia 8 vs OnePlus 5: Performance and battery\n\nWhen it comes to performance, you're in good hands no matter your mobile choice.\n\nThe OnePlus 5 and Nokia 8 offer up a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset, which is one of the most capable platforms available right now. You can expect smooth operations for ages to come, as well as general energy efficiency and strong connectivity (up to 1Gbps peak speeds).\n\nOf course, the OnePlus 5 with its 6GB of RAM trumps the Nokia 8, which has just 4GB. That's still solid, although the OnePlus 5 is more capable when it comes to multi-tasking and so on.\n\nWe're yet to fully test the Nokia 8's battery prowess, to see if this flagship can match the day and a half of life we get from the OnePlus. We're expecting a similar performance in this area however, even though the Nokia handset packs a slightly smaller cell. You get fast charge support (Quick Charge 3.0 on the Nokia, Dash Charge on the OnePlus) and Type-C USB connectivity in both cases.\n\nNokia 8 vs OnePlus 5: Cameras\n\nDual-lens camera tech is the order of the day here.\n\nThe Nokia 8's new 'Dual Sight' snapper seems to be a serious rival to the OnePlus 5's own double-lens shooter. Although the OnePlus wins on megapixel count, the Nokia 8 boasts Optical Image Stabilisation on the colour lens, to help prevent blurry results. In comparison, the OnePlus makes do with EIS - although a recent OxygenOS update has significantly improved the video stabilisation when shooting in 4K resolution.\n\nBoth phones here offer up to 4K video capture, as well as slow-mo and timelapse modes. You also have full manual controls, the ability to shoot panoramas and a depth-of-field setting to produce a neat bokeh effect. The Nokia 8 also serves up the new 'bothie' mode, which can be used to capture photos and videos with both front and rear cameras at once - with the option to live stream your life to YouTube or Facebook.\n\nYou can expect a fast shutter action from either phone, and so far in our hands-on tests the Nokia 8 seems to produce high-quality photos to rival the OnePlus 5. Of course, only our in-depth testing will reveal if we have a true competitor here - although we suspect the OnePlus will be better in low light, thanks to its f/1.7 aperture wide-angle lens.\n\nCheck out our Nokia 8 camera preview and in-depth OnePlus 5 camera review for all you need to know.", "id": "9578010", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 vs OnePlus 5: Which Android flagship is best for me?", "image": "https://cdn3.recombu.com/media/mobile/Devices/Nokia/Nokia 8/Nokia8vsOP5.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gesture recognition"}, "id": "318747", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesture_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Display resolution"}, "id": "355654", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Memory card"}, "id": "358978", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_card"}, {"label": {"eng": "IP Code"}, "id": "405233", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}, {"label": {"eng": "OxygenOS"}, "id": "1272001", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OxygenOS"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "17:33:00"}

I've already run some benchmark tests and its scores easily rival Samsung's Galaxy S8. In my experience so far, there's not much you can throw at this phone that it can't handle.\n\nThe 5.3-inch display is pin sharp, thanks to the ultra HD resolution (2,560x1,440 pixels) and it's bright enough to use under the midday sun.\n\nAround the back you'll find two cameras. One shoots in color, the other only in black and white -- good news if you love dramatic, moody portraits. They both have 13-megapixel resolutions and both shoot video in 4K. There's a 13-megapixel camera on the front, and thanks to some software trickery you can take photos with both the front and back camera to combine them into a single, split-screen image.\n\nI took the Nokia 8's camera for spin -- take a look through the gallery below to see how it performs.\n\n20 Taking the Nokia 8's dual camera for a test drive\n\nYou can also livestream that split-screen view directly to YouTube or Facebook. It's not a killer feature for me personally, but you'll enjoy this unique skill if you love sharing your whole life with the world.\n\nThat's all wrapped up in a really slick metal body with a highly polished finish. I think it looks extremely smart and elegant, although it is something of a fingerprint magnet.\n\nNokia says the phone is splash-proof, not waterproof, which is disappointing given that proper waterproofing is something we're now often seeing on top-end phones. On the upside, it has a fingerprint scanner on the front, a USB-C port and the latest version of Android Nougat on board.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will cost 599 euros when it goes on sale in September. The expected UK price is \u00a3599 and although there are currently no plans for it to reach the US or Australia yet, Nokia said that it's keen to sell the phone in both countries. For reference, 599 euros converts to around $700 or AU$900.\n\nNo, it's not a cheap phone, and that price puts it squarely in line with the Galaxy S8 (a phone with pretty much the same specs, on paper), which you can now pick up on Amazon for $575 in the US or \u00a3560 in the UK. In Australia you can find it for AU$899. Then there's the OnePlus 5, a superb Android phone that's also packed with top-notch tech and a brilliant dual camera system. It even won our coveted Editors' Choice award. The OnePlus costs even less at $479 in the US and \u00a3449 in the UK (AU$750, converted).\n\nWe'll have to wait to properly test the Nokia in our full review to decide on whether it's a wise purchase over the S8 or OnePlus 5. A price closer to or below $600, \u00a3500 or AU$750 would really help sweeten the deal. There's no question, however, that splashing that top-end cash will snag you a top-end phone that's absolutely worth considering, particularly if you have any sort of nostalgia for the Nokia name.", "id": "9577949", "details": {"liCnt": 137}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8", "image": "https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/MQkV-Gj67WD4aqrhBWshjh6iFYE=/2017/08/15/1a59f482-4ee6-4737-ab37-5f69fd844c8b/nokia-8-flagship-product-photos-hero-8.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Amazon.com"}, "id": "305588", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}, "id": "308589", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultra high definition television"}, "id": "311780", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_definition_television"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint recognition"}, "id": "314740", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel"}, "id": "315167", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}, "id": "320018", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video camera"}, "id": "320042", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}, "id": "329085", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "17:33:00"}

Despite being a Gorilla Glass-covered LCD display, Nokia has an always-on display that works through a low-power section at the top of the screen. At the moment, it only displays the date/time, battery status, and call/email/text notifications only.\n\nThe aluminum rear is polished, rather shiny, and continuous, with antenna lines located at the top and bottom. Colors include: Polished Blue, Tempered Blue, Steel, and Polished Copper.\n\nThere are curved edges, while the front retains capacitive buttons flanking the home and fingerprint sensor. This of course results in thicker top and bottom bezels, though the body is slim at 7.3mm thick.\n\nOn the camera front, this Nokia is using Zeiss optics for both the front and rear facing 13-megapixel cameras. The second camera on the rear captures a monochrome image. The audio story features a 3.5mm jack, as well as spatial audio recording thanks to Nokia's OZO technology used in their 360-degree camera rigs.\n\nOther specs include the Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage with microSD card slot. The Gloss Blue variant jumps to 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It runs stock Android 7.1.1 with minimal app customizations.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is priced at 599 euros ($705).

Like the company's existing Nokia phones, the 8 will also run a clean, current version of Android with updates being made available as Google releases them.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect of the phone's design, however, is its cameras. Featuring exclusive ZEISS optics, the trio of 13MP shooters -- one for colour and one for monochrome at the rear, and a third front-facing -- enable a trick HMD hopes will speak to share-happy millenials.\n\nUsing a bit of software hocus pocus, the Nokia 8 can split the screen to display from the front and rear of the phone simultaneously, allowing pictures and videos that show the photographer's reaction alongside the image's subject. Nokia's software also allows this split feed to be easily streamed online.\n\nIn its marketing, HMD describes this \"Dual-Sight\" feature as \"less Selfie, more Bothie\".\n\n\"This is especially meant for millennial creators, people who want to share what's happening every day,\" HMD's chief marketing officer Pekka Rantala said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunching in September at a global price Nokia expects will be around 599 euros ($888), the Nokia 8 joins the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 which are currently available at $250, $330 and $399 respectively.

We're very eager to enter the flagship segment as well.\"\n\nThe launch comes as Apple prepares to launch a new iPhone and Samsung rolls out its new Galaxy Note 8. Sarvikas said that HMD was \"less concerned about competition; we're here to design for the consumers.\"\n\nWith agencies", "id": "9593583", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 flagship phone takes aim at stream-happy millennials", "image": "http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/content/dam/images/g/x/y/3/w/d/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gxy251.png/1502932639918.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "69", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Advertising"}, "id": "302578", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Email"}, "id": "302685", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marketing"}, "id": "303392", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Generation Y"}, "id": "304390", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics display resolution"}, "id": "312179", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fairfax Media"}, "id": "337961", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "01:31:00"}

The Samsung flagship boasts a full-screen front, curved edges and a high-end metal and glass finish, and we described it as a \"thing of beauty\" in our full S8 review.\n\nThe Nokia 8 ain't going to be stealing the Galaxy S8's design crown, with HMD Global opting to shun the trend for full-screen smartphones in favour of a blocky, bezel-equipped handset that retains the physical home button. That's not to say it isn't a good looking phone, as the Nokia 8 comes in a unibody design which has apparently been \"milled from a single block of 6000 series aluminium\".\n\nIt isn't going to beat the S8 when it comes to functionality, either. Samsung's flagship is IP68 water and dust-resistant, so it will survive a dunk for 30 minutes in depths of up to 1.5 metres. The Nokia 8, on the other hand, is only IP54 splash-proof, so it unlikely will withstand a dunk in the toilet.\n\nDisplay\n\nGalaxy S7: 5.3in QHD (2560x1440, 554ppi) IPS LCD display\n\nGalaxy S8: 5.8in QHD+ (2960x1440, 570ppi), AMOLED HDR-certified Infinity display\n\nThe Galaxy S8 is also hard to beat when it comes to its display. The 5.8in QHD screen, besides its fancy curved edges, boasts an 18.5:9 aspect ratio, which means it's better suited to streaming video. It also opts for Super AMOLED, meaning it offers punchy, vibrant colours, and packs a pixel density of 570ppi, which means its slightly sharper than the Nokia 8's 554ppi LCD panel.\n\nHardware and storage\n\nNokia 8: Snapdragon 835 CPU, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, microSD up to 256GB\n\nGalaxy S8: Exynos 8995 CPU, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, microSD up to 256GB\n\nOn paper, the Nokia 8 and Galaxy S8 are fairly evenly matched when it comes to internal specs. Both phones pack flagship processors - the Nokia 8 opting for Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 and the Galaxy S8 for Samsung's homegrown Exynos 8995, and both pack an equal amount of RAM and built-in storage. Both also offer microSD slots, allowing for the onboard memory to be expanded up to 256GB.\n\nSoftware\n\nNokia 8: Android 7.1.1 Nougat\n\nGalaxy S8: Android 7.0 Nougat\n\nThe Nokia 8 and Galaxy S8 both run the Google's latest Nougat software but differ in their customisation. Samsung's skin, although scaled back compared to previous efforts, equips the device with a handful of custom features (aka bloatware), including Galaxy Apps, Samsung's own Gallery app and a tool for pairing your Samsung-branded wearable.\n\nThe Nokia 8, on the other hand, comes with no custom software besides its camera app, with HMD Global promising a largely-untouched Android experience, and quick software updates once they're released.\n\nCameras\n\nNokia 8: Dual 13MP with Zeiss optics, OIS; 13MP front-facing\n\nGalaxy S8: 12MP with OIS, (F1.7), autofocus; 8MP front-facing\n\nHMD Global has been keen to talk up the camera on the Nokia 8, which comes equipped with dual 13MP sensors (one RGB, one monochrome) and Zeiss optics for \"superior image quality\". There's also a new, ugh, \"bothie\" mode, that will activate both the front and rear cameras to capture phones and videos. Unlike the similar functionality found on Samsung smartphones, the Nokia 8 is also capable of broadcasting this video to Facebook or Youtube.\n\nThe Galaxy S8, on the other hand, sports a single-lens 12MP camera, with an f/1.7 aperture lens, optical image stabilisation and 8x digital zoom. While this doesn't sound as impressive on paper, we lauded it as one of, if not the best smartphone camera we've tested this year in our full review.\n\nBattery\n\nNokia 8: 3,090mAh, fast charging, USB-C\n\nGalaxy S8: 3,000mAh, fast charging, wireless charging, USB-C\n\nOn paper, the Nokia 8 wins this round too, with its meatier 3,090mAh battery which HMD claims will last for more than a full day. There's also support for Quick Charge 3.0, which is carried out via the handset's USB-C port.\n\nThe Galaxy S8 packs a 3,000mAh battery, but we found it easily breezed through a day and a half of usage. As well as fast charging support via USB-C, the handset also offers wireless charging capabilities.\n\nPrice\n\nPricing for the Galaxy S8 starts at \u00a3689 SIM-free. HMD has yet to announce exact UK availability details for the Nokia 8 but has said it'll fetch \u20ac599, which works out to about \u00a3544.\n\nVerdict\n\nAlthough the Nokia 8 is HMD's highest-spec Android smartphone to date, we don't think Samsung has much to worry about. The Nokia 8's design, with its chunky bezels and boxy design, feels somewhat dated compared to the likes of Samsung's latest flagship, and it's LCD display will struggle to rival the S8's curved AMOLED offering.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the Nokia 8 likely will be more than \u00a3100 cheaper when it goes on sale in the UK, so it might manage to woo those looking for a more affordable Android flagship. \u00b5", "id": "9665441", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 vs Galaxy S8 specs comparison | TheINQUIRER ", "image":

Here's a look at everything you need to know about Nokia 8.\n\nMust Read Nokia 8 first impressions: Sleek design, new camera features and the 'bothie' (Source: Photo by Shruti Dhapola)", "id": "9625484", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "First images of Nokia 8 from London", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/nokia-8-410.jpg?w=410", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}, "id": "308708", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "06:37:00"}

We've gone hands-on with the Nokia 8's Dual Sight snapper and here's our in-depth camera preview.\n\nNokia flagship devices from yesteryear always put a strong emphasis on photography chops. The likes of the Lumia 1020 were pretty much cameras with bolted-on phone bits, while a long-standing relationship with Carl Zeiss certainly paid dividends.\n\nWhich is why the new Nokia 8, created under new owners HMD Global, is such a relief. This all-new flagship Android phone boasts a dual-lens 'Dual Sight' camera on the back, once again produced with some help from Zeiss. Specs-wise it's serious business and we had a chance to play around with this mobile shooter ahead of the official launch, to see if this handset is strong competition for the Galaxy S8, OnePlus 5 and other top-end camera tech.\n\nCheck out our pick of the best mobile cameras in 2017 for our favourite smartphone snappers and be sure to delve into our Nokia 8 hands-on review.\n\nNokia 8 camera preview: Hardware\n\nNokia's 'Dual Sight' double-lens camera offers a monochrome as well as a colour lens, which work together to produce sharp and satisfying results. Both can shoot 13-megapixel images and then combine them, for finer detailing.\n\nYou can of course capture some bokeh-style effects as well. Like the OnePlus 5, Huawei P10 and other dual-lens shooters, the double lens setup means you get some nice depth-of-field effects, which help your subject to stand out against a blurred background. That colour lens also offers built-in Optical Image Stabilisation, to help eliminate judder and shake.\n\nAround the front of the Nokia 8 you'll find yet another 13-megapixel lens. Like the rear efforts, you can shoot up to 4K Ultra HD resolution video using that selfie snapper, which is quite rare to find; most handsets max out at Full HD.\n\nNokia 8 camera preview: UI and features\n\nThe Nokia 8 camera app offers a solid balance between features and ease of use. The main interface is simple enough not to overwhelm, while also giving quick access to plenty of handy tools and bonus modes.\n\nOn the right hand side you'll find the fast-acting shutter button, as well as the toggle to switch to video mode. There's also a subtle button for opening the camera tools menu. For photos, you can bring up manual controls (giving direct access to white balance and scene modes), as well as the panorama function and an obligatory beautify mode. For video, you can swap between standard, time lapse and slow motion footage.\n\nMeanwhile along the left edge of the camera app you'll find the usual flash toggle and a means of switching between the front and rear cameras (or using both at once; more on this in a second). You can also swap to live stream mode at any point.\n\nIf you're into vlogging your life, the Nokia 8 will definitely be a desirable tool. You can stream your life directly to Facebook or YouTube using the rear cameras and the 13-megapixel selfie camera; either separately or using both at once, with a split-screen effect. You can also simply capture photos and videos using both sets of cameras simultaneously, which HMD is calling...the 'bothie'. Just when you thought groufies had the game all wrapped up.\n\nOf course, that's a feature we've seen before from the likes of Samsung, although it never seemed to catch on at the time. It'll be interesting to see if Nokia can enjoy more success.\n\nLastly, the dual-lens setup allows you to shoot 'live bokeh' images. This adds a pleasing blurriness to a photo's background, to help your subject to stand out. This is something found on other dual-lens snappers also, including the OnePlus 5 and Huawei P10, and it's definitely an effective way to capture someone's portrait.\n\nNokia 8 camera preview: Photo capture\n\nIn our hands-on session with the Nokia 8, we got the chance to test out the Dual Sight camera and take some sample shots. So far, we're certainly impressed. The handset's Phase Detection Autofocus is fast enough to lock onto your subject almost instantly, and allow successive snaps to be taken without delay when pounding the shutter button.\n\nTest photos came out well-balanced, even in the harsh midday sun. However, we're yet to test out low light functionality. Both lenses sport an f/2.0 aperture, so chances are you'll get more grain than from the OnePlus 5, Galaxy S8 and other camera phones boasting a higher aperture.\n\nNokia 8 camera preview: Video capture\n\nYou can shoot up to 4K footage with both the front and rear cameras, making the Nokia 8 one of few phones that can record Ultra HD video using the selfie snapper. There's also an option for slow-mo and timelapse video capture, pretty standard features for modern mobiles.\n\nWhen shooting video, HMD's Ozo Audio solution offers 360-degree sound capture. That's accomplished via multiple microphones (three in all) built into the frame, so you can capture noise from any direction (which also helps provide some noise cancellation for phone calls). This was unfortunately difficult to test out in the limited time we had, so stay tuned for our in-depth Nokia 8 camera review to find out more.\n\nImage stabilisation so far seems good, although again we'll be testing this in the real world to see if the Nokia 8 can rival Samsung's Galaxy S8, the OnePlus 5 and the iPhone 7 phones for shooting your home movies.", "id": "9578021", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 Camera Preview: Hands-on with Nokia's Dual Sight snapper", "image": "https://cdn1.recombu.com/media/mobile/Devices/Nokia/Nokia 8/Nokia8_CameraThumb.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Photography"}, "id": "302979", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultra high definition television"}, "id": "311780", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_definition_television"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Digital camera"}, "id": "317506", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}, "id": "329085", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Depth of field"}, "id": "355372", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bokeh"}, "id": "404967", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia Lumia 1020"}, "id": "525752", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_1020"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 670, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1380, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques and Styles", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques_and_Styles"}], "time": "17:33:00"}

In February, HMD unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, priced at \u20ac139 and \u20ac189 respectively.\n\nJuho Sarvikas, HMD's chief product officer, said now was \"the perfect time\" to introduce the model, which he describes as a flagship product. The phone will feature a \"dual-sight\" photo and video function, in which images from the front and rear cameras will be displayed simultaneously on a split screen. HMD describes the feature as \"less Selfie, more Bothie\".\n\nHMD had chosen to release cheaper models first because 50% of global demand was for phones costing between \u20ac100 and \u20ac250, Sarvikas said in an interview. \"We wanted to start there, where we know that we are highly relevant with our proposition. We're very eager to enter the flagship segment as well.\"\n\nThe new device has Zeiss cameras, after HMD said in July that it had signed a partnership with the group, part of the German optics company Carl Zeiss.\n\nThe launch comes as Apple prepares to launch a new iPhone and Samsung rolls out its new Galaxy Note8. Sarvikas said by phone that HMD was \"less concerned about competition; we're here to design for the consumers\".\n\nDemand for the redesigned 3310 feature phone, unveiled in February, had been \"very strong\". Sarvikas was unable to share detailed sales figures but said HMD had sold \"millions\" of smartphones and \"tens of millions\" of feature phones -- of which the 3310 is just one model.\n\nNokia sold the handset business to Microsoft in 2014. In 2016, Microsoft sold it to HMD and FIH Mobile, a subsidiary of Chinese phone maker Foxconn Technology Group. HMD's CEO, Arto Nummela, a former Nokia executive, left the company last month. -- Reported by Kaye Wiggins, (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP", "id": "9619924", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8: HMD unveils new Android flagship - TechCentral", "image": "https://techcentral.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nokia-8-2156-1120.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "id": "304420", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}, "id": "308699", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "05:54:00"}

HMD Global's latest offering, the Nokia 8 is a genuine high-end device with state of the art specifications. Expected to be priced at Rs. 45,000 INR, the handset is set to launch in India around October 2017. Here, we have tried to compare the Nokia 8 with other Snapdragon 835-powered flagship phones available in the country.\n\nPresently, in India, only three smartphones feature the Qualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon 835 SoC. Those are the OnePlus 5, HTC U11 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium. Unfortunately, Samsung only sells the Exynos 8895 variants of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ in the country.\n\nHere we will separately compare the Nokia 8 with each of the Snapdragon 835 toting trio.\n\nNokia 8 vs OnePlus 5\n\nThe Nokia 8 is quite similar to the OnePlus 5 in various aspects like software and camera. Both the devices come with a near stock user interface of the latest Android version along with a dual rear camera setup. HMD Global and OnePlus are equally eager to offer consistent software upgrades for an extended period of time.\n\nWhile the design languages of the Nokia 8 and OnePlus 5 are quite different from one another, both of them sport a full metal body with Gorilla Glass 5 covered screens. Now, let's talk about their differences.\n\nThe Nokia 8 and OnePlus 5 sports identical processing powers, but the latter excels in the memory department with up to 8 GB of RAM, whereas the former maxes out at just 4 GB. However, the Nokia 8 does offer a micro SD card slot which is absent in the OnePlus 5.\n\nAlthough both the handsets feature dual rear cameras, they are not exactly the same. While OnePlus has combined a telephoto lens with a normal camera, Nokia has opted for a monochromatic secondary sensor. Additionally, the latter has also included the OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) and IR (Infra-Ray) range finder, which the OnePlus 5 completely lacks.\n\nMoving on to the display, the Nokia 8 sports a 5.3-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) IPS LCD panel, whereas, the OnePlus 5 comes with a 5.5-inch Optic AMOLED Full HD (1080 x 1920) screen. This comes to your personal preference.\n\nA smaller 3090mAh battery juices up the Nokia 8 while the OnePlus 5 rocks a 3300mAh cell. However, the former does come with splash proof construction, which the latter lacks. Lastly, both the devices are pretty similar in terms of connectivity.\n\nComing to the pricing, the Nokia 8 would certainly cost around Rs. 10,000 to 12,000 more than the OnePlus 5.\n\nNokia 8 vs HTC U11\n\nHTC U11 is another Snapdragon 835-powered smartphone which is officially available in India. Exterior-wise, the Nokia 8 is considerably different from the U11. The former comes with a full metal build while the latter rocks a beautiful glass construction. Additionally, HTC's handset is IP67 certified in comparison to the splash proof Nokia 8. This clearly indicates that the former is significantly better resistant to water and dust intrusions than the latter.\n\nSpeaking of the display, HTC has gone for a 5.5-inch Quad HD (2560 x 1440) Super LCD 5, while the Nokia 8 has a smaller 5.3-inch screen of the same resolution. Both are covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 3.\n\nUnder the hood, the Nokia 8 and the HTC U11 has the same processing power. However, the latter excels in the memory department by offering up to 6GB of RAM.\n\nComing to the camera, HTC has opted for a single 12 MP rear shooter, while the Nokia 8 boasts a dual 13 MP + 13 MP primary snapper. While both the smartphones have OIS, the latter scores higher with its additional IR range finder.\n\nOther things like connectivity and battery capacity are basically identical among the Nokia 8 and the HTC U11. However, where pricing is concerned, the former would certainly cost around Rs. 5,000 lesser than the latter.\n\nNokia 8 vs Sony Xperia XZ Premium\n\nSony Xperia XZ Premium is another Snapdragon 835 toting phone to be available in India. Design-wise, the handset is quite different to the Nokia 8. The Xperia XZ Premium has a significantly sharper appearance. Moreover, it is IP68 certified, which means that XZ Premium is a true water and dust resistant device while the Nokia is simply a splash proof handset.\n\nComing to the display, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium rocks a 5.46-inch IPS LCD panel with a whopping 4K (3840 x 2160) resolution. This is not only larger than the 5.3-inch screen of the Nokia 8 but also a lot sharper. Gorilla Glass 5 is there in both the competing devices.\n\nMoving on to the innards, there is practically no difference between the Xperia XZ Premium and the Nokia 8 as they both sport the same processor along with equal RAM and storage. Each of the smartphones run on Android 7.1 Nougat operating system.\n\nTalking of the camera specifications, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium houses a 19 MP Exmor RS sensor at the back, whereas, the Nokia 8 sports a Zeiss optics-made dual 13 MP + 13 MP primary shooter.\n\nBoth the contending smartphones are quite similar when it comes to connectivity and battery backup. Coming to pricing, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium costs around Rs. 60,000 while the Nokia 8 is expected to launch for around Rs. 45,000.\n\nNokia 8 release date, news and features", "id": "9665394", "details": {"liCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 vs Snapdragon 835 phones in India", "image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CYvoE5PrBdkddDtw8vf3nm-1200-80.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 284, "date": "2017-10-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 296}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}, "id": "308710", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}, "id": "312003", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony Xperia"}, "id": "324361", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Xperia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Exynos (system on chip)"}, "id": "355361", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exynos_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}, "id": "368054", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 468, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "06:25:00"}

But it goes beyond enabling PS4 Plus owners to stream on Twitch in 1080p at 60 frames per second. While only pre-selected users get to enjoy the new additions as the update rolls out in beta today, Sony released a list of features for the console's greater playerbase to look forward to.\n\nMost of the tweaks are solidly quality-of-life improvements, though some are better late than never: You'll finally be able to switch off notifications when watching a movie or TV show, for example. And there's good news for everyone who hates navigating through the menu to see notifications (which is, well, everyone): They're now visible in the Quick Menu.\n\nSony's post confirms what Eurogamer originally leaked: A more robust family management system allowing for multiple adult users and different permissions for child accounts (letting teens play more mature games than younger kids, for example). The friend list is getting updated, too, ditching the Favorite Groups tab to let users create completely custom sets of friends.\n\nYes, PS4 Pro owners will get too livestream in 1080p60 on Twitch, but Sony has added other streaming functionality. You can bind broadcasts to communities you own, giving spectators a button that links right to your group. Users now get messages while they're broadcasting in VR mode, too.\n\nSpeaking of VR, those watching Blu-Rays or DVDs in cinematic mode get 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound when listening on headphones. If you like listening to music on your PS4, you can now share straight to your friends; If they're also on Sony's console, they can pop open the song you sent them in the Quick Menu and listen from there. If they open the message on the PlayStation mobile app, clicking on your message opens the track in Spotify.\n\nFinally, the update brings new languages, and the consoles now support Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Romanian, Thai and Vietnamese.", "id": "9736031", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "PS4's next update finally lets you squelch notifications during movies", "image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=1600%2C1027%2C0%2C0&quality=85&format=jpg&resize=1600%2C1027&image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F9750d914c6bd7f7c99ca0a962fd0336a%2F204374529%2Fanniversary-29-ed.jpg&client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&signature=db8ec3c0742dce86bae6d713ef2bb14ecd469dfb", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Music"}, "id": "302636", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop music"}, "id": "303105", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television program"}, "id": "303532", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video game console"}, "id": "304421", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"}, {"label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}, "id": "305704", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}, "id": "307034", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headphones"}, "id": "314741", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones"}, {"label": {"eng": "DVD"}, "id": "318168", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eurogamer"}, "id": "335423", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogamer"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}, "id": "340359", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitch (website)"}, "id": "349819", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(website)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Livestream"}, "id": "363344", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestream"}, {"label": {"eng": "7.1 surround sound"}, "id": "371798", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "VR mode"}, "id": "409262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VR_mode"}, {"label": {"eng": "Entertainment Software Rating Board"}, "id": "490972", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual surround"}, "id": "526394", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_surround"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 64, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 201, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1096, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms"}], "time": "16:45:00"}

Priced at \u20ac599 (approximately Rs 45,000), it is HMD Global's fourth Nokia-branded smartphone after the more affordable Nokia 3, Nokia 5, and Nokia 6 smartphones. What sets the Nokia 8 apart from its contemporaries is that it features a dual camera module that supports a dual sight mode, which makes real-time video streaming from both the cameras possible. Here's how the dual-camera on the Nokia 8 works.\n\nWhat is the dual-camera deal?\n\nA dual-camera module on a smartphone intends to deliver DSLR-like effects to images, making them richer in color, or achieve Bokeh. While the concept is not new, the trend peaked with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus thanks to its Portrait Mode. The trend has continued through the OnePlus 5 and more recently, the Honor 8 Pro. RELATED: Nokia 8 vs OnePlus 5 vs Honor 8 Pro: Price, specifications and features compared\n\nComing to the Nokia 8; it features a dual-camera module at the back which comprises of a pair of 13-megapixel Carl ZEISS sensors. One of the sensors is a primary RGB color sensor, while the other is a monochrome sensor. Similar to the Huawei P9, these two sensors work together to capture the same subject in color and monochrome, and then stitch it together to achieve a richer final image. The color sensor comes with optical image stabilization, PDAF and aperture f/2.0.\n\n#Bothie\n\nThe unusual moniker refers to the ability with which you can leverage the front and back camera on the Nokia 8 for live streaming. On the front of the smartphone is a 13-megapixel camera for selfies and video-calling. For Bothie, the Dual Sight mode comes into play. It essentially allows you to stream from both the front and rear cameras at the same time. So for example, if you are doing a Facebook or YouTube live from an event, the feature will split the screen into two so that you can interact with your audience, while also allowing them to witness your surroundings simultaneously. ALSO READ: Nokia 8 hands-on and first impressions roundup: Here's what previews say of the device\n\nTo stream a Bothie, you don't need to use any additional app as the feature is built-in the main camera app itself. You simply need to tap on the Dual Sight mode next to the hamburger menu on the top. There is an option to stream to Facebook or YouTube right from the native app. So, you can switch to the mode and start streaming instantly. However, as early reviewers point out, you won't be able to use the Dual Sight mode if you shoot the live video from the main Facebook or YouTube app.\n\nHello #Bothie!

The is Espoo's most powerful Android phone but it didn't stop at that. Nokia had to usher in a new era of . For that, it created the . It's isn't a . Neither is it a youie. It's both. All the three camera on the phone work in tandem to create a photo showing both you, and what's around you. Hence, a bothie. Wow.\n\nNokia is banking on its ' bothie-bilities ' to set itself apart from the rest of the flagships and it could so happen that bothie will be the next big thing among the cool kids. A lot of you scoffed when selfies first started going viral. Bothie might go the same distance. And if the phone is a success, it could soon be picked up by Oxford Dictionary and Merriam Webster.\n\nThere is only one bothie phone right now. The Nokia 8. It is 's best offering under the Nokia brand and comes with 13-megapixel on the back and a similar 13-megapixel on the front. A bothie happens when all the three cameras fire simultaneously to take an all-round shot, from the front and the back. It is, many would argue, the natural evolution of selfie.\n\nBut a bothie is not just a photo. Bothie can be a video too. And it can be broadcast directly to Facebook and YouTube.\n\nThe bothie-ness is powered by Carl Zeiss optics which has been an old ally of Nokia phones for long and uses computational photography to fuse the feed from all the cameras together in a split screen. To be fair, the feature was first seen in the LG V20 and the LG G6, but LG didn't bother giving it a name. By giving a weird, funny name, Nokia just claimed the rights for it .\n\nThe next generation social obsession also needed the right audio. So Nokia went ahead and implemented its technology to the Nokia 8. The Nokia 8 comes with high dynamic range microphones that can record 360-degree spatial audio. It's borrowed from the company's 360-degree OZO camera. The speakers are also tuned to the OZO algorithm and can play back sound in multiple directions, just like how it was recorded.\n\nFor the window to your bothies, the Nokia 8 sports a 5.3-inch quadHD LCD display with good brightness and wide viewing angles. It's lined with thick bezels too and protected by Gorilla Glass 5. Classic old school Nokia.\n\nNow, the dual sight technology that fires all the three cameras together is not supported by Qualcomm's flagship chip by default. HMD Global worked with Qualcomm to bake in the feature in the chipset. Moreover, to keep the phone from frying, there is also a graphite shielded copper pipe inside the phone that absorbs the heat generated and scatters it throughout the device. Trust Nokia to ensure safety along with new features. Samsung should take notes as the successor to the ill-fated Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is just around the corner.\n\nNow the question remains, what's in store for the future? If bothies are going to replace selfies, will bothies too one-day be replaced by 360-degree Everythingies?", "id": "9735860", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Meet bothie, the next big social obsession after selfies", "image": "http://www.gizmodo.in/photo/60102186/news/meet-bothie-the-next-big-social-obsession-after-selfies.jpg?46498", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Espoo"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "20300", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espoo", "label": {"eng": "Espoo"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Evolution"}, "id": "305138", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "LG Corp"}, "id": "307493", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}, "id": "313138", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "High-dynamic-range imaging"}, "id": "404926", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-dynamic-range_imaging"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bothy"}, "id": "541460", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Computational photography"}, "id": "645757", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_photography"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "08:15:00"}

A steal at that price, the OnePlus 5 has unsurprisingly landed to positive critical reception and is one of the most widely recommended Android phones for 2017.\n\nThen there's the Nokia 8, the first flagship phone we've seen come out of Finnish phone maker HMD - the company that's paying to use the Nokia brand license. It's certainly got the looks and the branding heft, but can it keep pace with the OnePlus 5? We take an early look and see how the phones rack up.\n\nBear in mind, however, that we can only compare the phones so much without having completed our full Nokia 8 review, so we can't say for sure which phone will have better performance yet.\n\nIf you want a brief comparison of the two phones, scroll down to the bottom of this page. Otherwise, read on for a full run-down of both handsets.\n\nRelated: Samsung Galaxy Note 8\n\nNokia 8 vs OnePlus 5 - Design\n\nThe OnePlus 5 design is familiar enough, with a smooth flat body that curves at the edges. It's typical of modern smartphone design, and has been generally well-received by phone reviewers.\n\nIt's a fairly sizeable bit of kit - and bigger than the Nokia 8 - courtesy of it's large 5.5-inch display, but it's still fairly slim at 7.3mm and lightweight at 153 grams. You can buy it in the following colour options: Midnight Black, Slate Grey, and the new Soft Gold.\n\nThe Nokia 8, meanwhile, has a similar design, although the phone is marginally thicker at 7.9mm, and has a rear casing that tapers much more significantly than the OnePlus 5. It's also a heavier phone at 160 grams.\n\nCredit: OnePlus\n\nStill, it's very attractive, and we're particularly fond of the coppery colour, which we're expecting to become an increasingly common paintjob for phones - it's even mooted to appear as 'Blush Gold' on the next Apple iPhone, the iPhone 8.\n\nHere are all of the Nokia 8 colours, for reference: Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue, and Steel.\n\nNokia 8 vs OnePlus 5 - Hardware and Software\n\nScreen: The key advantage that the OnePlus 5 has is its hefty screen size; 5.5-inches is still a respectable amount of screen, even by 2017's gargantuan display standards. The downside is that the display resolution is a mere 1920 x 1080 pixels, which works out at a middling 401-pixels-per-inch (ppi) pixel density.\n\nBy comparison, the Nokia 8 has an admittedly smaller 5.3-inch screen, but it trumps the OnePlus 5 thanks to the QHD resolution of its screen - that's 2560 x 1440 pixels, in layman's terms. That works out at a very dense 554ppi, and should result in seriously sharp visuals - though how it'll look in practice remains to be seen.\n\nPerformance: Both phones run on Qualcomm's latest system-on-a-chip, the Snapdragon 835, so we're expecting both to offer similar processing output. This is the same chip that we've also seen power flagship rivals like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and HTC U11.\n\nIt's arguably the most powerful mobile processor on the market right now, which means you should have no trouble getting anything done on either phone.\n\nThe OnePlus 5 may have a slight advantage, however, in that it trumps the Nokia 8 on memory. The OnePlus 5 comes with 6GB of RAM as standard, with an option to upgrade to a very generous 8GB. But the Nokia 8 defaults at 4GB, which isn't particularly special by today's standards.\n\nWe should also mention that although both phones offer 64GB of base storage, the OnePlus 5 is also available in a 128GB variant - something the Nokia 8 appears to be lacking.\n\nCamera: The OnePlus 5 camera was one of the phone's headline features; it was the first OnePlus phone to feature a dual-camera arrangement, after all.\n\nThe rear-facing shooter on the OnePlus 5 is comprised of two different cameras, which work in sync to provide better performance in low light conditions, improved depth of field, and generally higher-quality snapping. One camera offers 16-megapixel capture with an f/1.7 aperture, while the other can take 20-megapixel shots with an f/2.6 aperture.\n\nThe OnePlus 5 also sports a respectable 16-megapixel f/2.0 camera on the front, for good measure.\n\nExcitingly, the Nokia 8 has also followed this year's dual-camera trend, and has opted for a double-shooter of its own.\n\nUnlike the OnePlus 5 dual-camera module, the Nokia 8 provides more lowly 13-megapixel capture - this doesn't necessarily impact quality mind; just the size of the photos. Both cameras feature an f/2.0 aperture, with one shooting in colour (with optical image stabilisation) and the other in monochrome. These two images are then combined to offer a better quality image with (hopefully) improved depth of field.\n\nThe Nokia 8's selfie shooter is also worse on paper, described as a 13-megapixel f/2.0 front-facing camera. But then we won't know which phone's camera setups work better in the real world until we complete our full Nokia 8 review - stay tuned.\n\nCredit: Nokia\n\nRelated: iPhone 7S\n\nBattery Life and Other Hardware: We can't speak to the Nokia 8's battery life just yet, but we already know that the OnePlus 5 easily makes it through a whole day of usage thanks to its 3,300mAh battery cell.\n\nThe Nokia 8, by comparison, features a 3,090mAh cell, which is marginally smaller. Does that mean battery life will be worse? Not necessarily. The fact that the Nokia 8 uses a smaller screen will help, although the higher-resolution panel will create a bigger drain on the battery. Various software and hardware optimisations also have to be taken into account, so we won't know anything for certain for a good while yet.\n\nThe two phones are fairly well-equipped by other measures however, with the OnePlus 5 and Nokia 8 both making use of USB Type-C charging, NFC connectivity (for contactless mobile payments), and a fingerprint scanner for user authentication.\n\nSoftware: There's not much to say on the software front; both the OnePlus 5 and Nokia 8 ship with Google's latest Android 7.0 Nougat software.\n\nIt's a capable mobile operating system that's been refined over many years, and is certainly on par with Apple's iOS. OnePlus does make some minor tweaks to the software using its own Oxygen OS overlay, but there aren't any significant changes that will massively affect user experience.\n\nFor more information on the software, check out our Android Nougat guide.\n\nNokia 8 vs OnePlus 5 - Price\n\nWe don't actually have Nokia 8 pricing for the UK yet, but we do have European pricing.\n\nIn Europe, the Nokia 8 costs \u20ac599 to buy outright, which is a fair amount more than the OnePlus 5's European pricing of \u20ac499/\u20ac559 (pricing depending on the model you choose).\n\nGiven that in the UK, the OnePlus 5 costs either \u00a3449 or \u00a3499, it seems likely that the Nokia 8 will almost certainly cost more than \u00a3499.\n\nIf that's the case, it will be a hard sell for Nokia to convince customers that its flagship smartphone is worth the extra charge over the OnePlus 5, a handset that has been roundly praised for its powerful specs and great-value price tag.\n\nNokia 8 vs OnePlus 5 - Summary\n\nNokia 8 vs OnePlus 5 Design: The OnePlus 5 and Nokia 8 are both very attractive phones, but the former is both lighter and thinner. The latter, meanwhile, has a greater range of colour options. You'll be happy with either in terms of looks though, we'd wager.\n\nNokia 8 vs OnePlus 5 Specs: The OnePlus 5 appears to have the edge over the Nokia 8 in terms of specs, but we'll need to fully review Nokia's latest before coming to a firm decision based on real-world usage.\n\nNokia 8 vs OnePlus 5 Price: In the absence of UK pricing for the Nokia 8, we can only say so much. However, with European pricing suggesting that the Nokia 8 will be the more expensive of the two phones, we're inclined to say that the OnePlus 5 offers greater value for money - at this early stage, anyway.\n\nRelated: Best Android phones\n\nLet us know which phone you prefer via Facebook or Twitter.", "id": "9577983", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "OnePlus 5 vs Nokia 8: Which is the better Android flagship? | Trusted Reviews", "image": "http://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/08/02-3.jpeg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3275, "date": "-05-05", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3280}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "69", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile operating system"}, "id": "308235", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "IOS"}, "id": "308487", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}, "id": "312003", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel density"}, "id": "317242", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}, "id": "368054", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}, {"label": {"eng": "OxygenOS"}, "id": "1272001", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OxygenOS"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "17:33:00"}

This will make it easier for the members of the community page to check out the broadcast in just one click.\n\nThe upcoming update also reportedly comes with several messages improvements, including the ones that will be shared on social networking sites likes Facebook and Twitter through PlayStation Music. \"If your friends are on PS4, they can listen to the track right inside the message by booting up Quick Menu, and if they're on their mobile device, they can jump directly to the Spotify app from the PS Messages app to check out the song,\" Sony stated.\n\nHowever, Sony has yet to announce the official release date of the PlayStation 4 update 5.0 for those who are not included in the beta program.", "id": "9899412", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "PlayStation 4 5.0 System Update Features: Customized Family System, Better Messaging Feature Revealed", "image": "http://d.christianpost.com/full/116582/playstation-4-5-0-system-update.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social networking service"}, "id": "302877", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blog"}, "id": "305393", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spotify"}, "id": "307723", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}, "id": "308708", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental controls"}, "id": "398807", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony Interactive Entertainment"}, "id": "1283778", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Music"}, "id": "1437736", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Music"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 116, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations and Age Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations_and_Age_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1096, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms"}], "time": "08:53:00"}

The result is a split-screen view that ideally looks something like this, according to HMD:\n\nApparently there is a monkey on the loose. HMD Global\n\nHMD is trying to call images taken with this camera mode \"bothies.\" As in, a selfie, but with images from both sides. I think we can all agree that the less said about this, the better.\n\nYou'll notice there's a \"Live\" icon in the top corner there: That's because, according to HMD, the Dual-Sight mode lets you stream your \"bothies\" -- split-screen videos using the phone's front and rear cameras, in this case -- to Facebook and YouTube directly from the Nokia 8's camera app. It's a firm show of support for live video, which has overtaken social media in recent years.\n\nIt's worth noting that HMD isn't the first phone maker to do this: Both Samsung and LG have used similar double-camera modes on flagship phones from years ago. It's the livestreaming component that's the real big change here in the Nokia 8. To be clear, while this is neat tech, it does feel a lot like a gimmick. It seems safe to say that people haven't been clamoring too hard for a better class of selfie. But for the niche of YouTube \"reaction videos,\" particularly those during sports events or concerts, it could make capturing a little easier. A little more functionality probably can't hurt too much.\n\nWhether that makes the Nokia 8 worth buying, though, is another question.

There's a decent-sized battery included on the Nokia 8, coming in at 3,090 mAh in capacity with support for Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0. When it comes to cameras, you'll find 13MP sensors on both the front and back of the Nokia 8 with Zeiss optics.\n\nSpeaking of the cameras, HMD has included what it calls a \"bothie\" mode which activates both the front and rear cameras for pictures and videos.

In short, there are few huge features included in the update-which is out today for select beta testers-but lots of small improvements that should improve the system's functionality overall.\n\nSome of the enhancements center around streaming using the PS4's built-in broadcasting capabilities. PS4 Pro users will be able to stream in 1080p and 60 FPS, provided their connection is strong enough, and PSVR users will be able to see new messages and comments coming through while broadcasting. PSVR is also adding 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound support.\n\nNext up, the PS4's Friends List is being updated with greater management tools, such as the ability to set up separate lists of friends. You'll be able to create a list of all the people you play Destiny with and send them all an invite, for example. This feature replaces the old Favorite Groups tab.\n\nIn another move to help reduce the amount of time spent in menus, the Quick Menu is being updated to have more options. For example, you'll be able to check on download progress and see new party invites. You can also leave a party from within that menu and see your current Spotify playlist.\n\nNotifications are also being improved when watching films and TV, as you can now disable message and other notification pop-ups while watching media. You can also change how much of a message is displayed, as well as its color, when playing or watching any form of content.\n\nFinally, Parental Control features are being overhauled in favor of what Sony calls \"Family on PSN.\" This replaces the old Master/Sub account system; instead, one user is deemed the Family Manager, and they can set up other accounts and appoint them as a Parent/Guardian, Adult, or Child. Parents or Guardians can restrict Child accounts in their \"use of online features and communication with other players, set restrictions for games, restrict the use of the internet browser, and set spending limits for PlayStation Store.\" Note that Sony says the first time any North American user tries to set up an Adult account, they will be charged $0.50 \"to verify that you are an adult.\"\n\nYou can read all the details of the 5.0 update here. Beta testers who were selected to take part will be able to upgrade today, though bear in mind that your console may experience \"unexpected issues\" as a result of the beta. Sony does say, however, that you can downgrade to the current version of 4.73. The company has not revealed when the update will go live for all users, though beta invites do include two extra codes for testers to try it out with friends.", "id": "9709800", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Big PS4 Update 5.0 Officially Revealed, Here's What It Does", "image": "https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1556/15568848/3274928-36178028280_6e723a2995_b.jpg?w=240", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 552, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 566, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Online"}], "time": "14:31:00"}

HMD described the feature, which gives users the ability to shoot photos and videos from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, as \"less Selfie, more Bothie.\" Images from both cameras can be viewed at the same time on a split screen and be shared on Facebook (FB) or Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) YouTube.\n\n\"We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media,\" said Sarvikas in the statement. \"People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own.\"\n\nThe Nokia 8 camera features technology developed by German optics company Carl Zeiss. The new android device also features a high-resolution 5.3-inch screen and polished aluminum body and will be powered by Qualcomm Inc.'s (QCOM) Snapdragon 835 chipset.

The result is a split-screen view that ideally looks something like this, according to HMD:\n\nHMD is trying to call images taken with this camera mode \"bothies.\" As in, a selfie, but with images from both sides. I think we can all agree that the less said about this, the better.\n\nYou'll notice there's a \"Live\" icon in the top corner there: That's because, according to HMD, the Dual-Sight mode lets you stream your \"bothies\" -- split-screen videos using the phone's front and rear cameras, in this case -- to social feeds like Facebook and YouTube directly from the Nokia 8's camera app. It's a firm show of support for live video, which has overtaken social media in recent years.\n\nIt's worth noting that HMD isn't the first phone maker to do this: Both Samsung and LG have used similar double-camera modes on flagship phones from years ago. It's the livestreaming component that's the real big change here in the Nokia 8. To be clear, while this is neat tech, it does feel a lot like a gimmick. It seems safe to say that people haven't been clamouring too hard for a better class of selfie. But for the niche of YouTube \"reaction videos,\" particularly those during sports events or concerts, it could make capturing a little easier. A little more functionality probably can't hurt too much.\n\nWhether that makes the Nokia 8 worth buying, though, is another question.

Sentimental nostalgia for the phones of the 1990s and early 2000s aside, is the new handset actually any good?\n\nTo help answer that question we've put it up against two of the best phones of 2017 so far, the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the LG G6, to see which one will come out on top. For more on the Nokia 8 phone, check out our hands-on review to see what our first impressions were.\n\nDesign and feel\n\nSmartphone beauty (or lack of it) really is a matter of taste, and we'd say these are three very well designed phones. The Nokia 8 does eschew the bezel-free, 18:9 aspect ratio screens favoured by the Samsung and LG phones though, which does make it look a touch more old-fashioned from the front.\n\nThe Nokia 8 (above) measures 151.5 mm x 73.7 mm x 7.9 mm and boasts a 5.3-inch LCD screen with a 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution, weighing in at 160 grams. Thanks to those bezels, it's got the smallest screen but it's the bulkiest phone overall, by a few millimetres - based on the time we've spent with it though, it still feels great in the hand.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 (above) measures 148.9 mm x 68.1 mm x 8 mm, with a 5.8-inch OLED screen, 2960 x 1440 pixel resolution, and a weight of 155 grams. Don't forget the Samsung party trick either, those slightly curved screen edges that add a touch of class to the design and which have been helping to earn the handset some rave reviews.\n\nFinally the dimensions of the LG G6 (above) are 148.9 mm x 71.9 mm x 7.9 mm, it has a 5.7-inch LCD screen with a 2880 x 1440 pixel resolution, and it weighs 163 grams. It's the heaviest of our three phones, but not by any kind of margin that you'll notice. In fact these three phones are almost identical in terms of physical dimensions, though the Samsung model squeezes in more screen space and more pixels.\n\nInternal specs\n\nOn to the specs, and obviously there's a lot of ground to cover, so we'll stick to the most important components. The bottom line is that you're not really going to notice a whole lot of difference in the performance of these three handsets - remember though that smoothness of operation isn't just down to internal specs, and we've yet to get the chance to put the Nokia 8 through its paces properly at the time of writing.\n\nThe Nokia 8 packs a Snapdragon 835 processor, an Adreno 540 GPU, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage which you can expand via microSD card should you so wish. Those are pretty much the top-end specs for flagships in 2017, though they may be bettered by the end of the year by the time the iPhone 8 and the Google Pixel XL 2 have appeared.\n\nAs for the Samsung Galaxy S8, it too has a Snapdragon 835 CPU, or the similar Exynos 8895 Samsung chip if you're outside the USA and China. Everything else matches the Nokia 8: the Adreno 540, the 4GB of RAM, and the 64GB of storage space. Again, you can expand the storage with a microSD card if you need to.\n\nThe LG G6 has the slightly inferior Snapdragon 821 processor on board, though you're unlikely to notice the difference most of the time in most of your applications. That's combined with an Adreno 530 GPU, 4GB of RAM, and either 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB of storage space, as well as room for a microSD card. If you want to max out on storage at least, the LG G6 is the phone for you.\n\nCamera specs\n\nWhere would we be without our phone cameras? We shudder to think, and so rarely think about it. The Nokia and LG phones here take a dual-lens approach to the rear-facing camera, though by all accounts the Samsung Galaxy S8 takes some very good pictures as well, so don't necessarily think two lenses are better than one. In fact it's hard to compare cameras on specs alone, so we'll have to reserve judgement on the Nokia 8 until we can really test it out.\n\nThe new Nokia flagship has two 13 MP snappers around the back and one at the front, capable of 4K video recording and \"bothie\" live streaming - that's a newly made up word that means you can record with both front and rear cameras simultaneously and record or broadcast them in a split-screen view... well, the kids might like it.\n\nThe Galaxy S8 has a single 12 MP lens around the back and an 8MP one on the front, and again 4K video recording is possible. As per our review, the S8 is capable of some very impressive snaps, even in low light, despite the fact that the camera was only a very slightly tweaked version of the snapper on board the Galaxy S7 from the year before (something about if it ain't broke...).\n\nAs for the LG G6, the phone comes with a dual-lens camera on the back, with both lenses offering 13 MP of photo goodness, and 4K video recording within the handset's capabilities. Around the front there's a 5 MP camera, meanwhile. In our review, we said the phone could churn out some decent-looking images, but it's in the video tweaking where the handset really shines.\n\nPrice and verdict\n\nPricing is of course a big factor in any buying decision, and so far we just have one price from Nokia for the Nokia 8's European launch: \u20ac599, which works out at \u00a3545 or $705 with a rough currency conversion. That's not the most you'll ever pay for an unlocked flagship smartphone, but it's not far off.\n\nSticking to the euros, the Galaxy S8 originally retailed at \u20ac799 unlocked, while the LG G6 was a touch below at \u20ac750. Those phones also have official UK and US prices, and have of course had several discounts applied since launch, but we're sticking to one figure to be fair to the Nokia 8 for comparison purposes.\n\nThat's maybe one reason to go for the Nokia 8 - it's significantly cheaper, at least in euros. Another might be that its version of Android is very close to stock, and Nokia (or rather HMD Global) is promising fast and secure updates, something which you're not necessarily guaranteed if you go with Samsung or LG.\n\nIn most other departments, the rivals to the Nokia 8 still have the edge, particularly in those gorgeous, 18:9 aspect ratio, bezel-busting displays. It remains to be seen whether the Nokia 8's camera can help it to stand out from the crowd, but right now it seems to be a handset that's competitive, rather than one that blows the competition away.\n\nNot convinced?

The update is not bringing PSN ID changes or anything like that, it's bringing an overhaul to parent accounts, an expanded friend management system, 1080p support for Twitch on PS4 Pro and more.\n\nThe current master/sub-account system has been overhauled and introduces the new \"Family on PlayStation Network.\" This new system will offer a more flexible experience for families on PS4 by making it easier to setup PSN accounts for children and customize parental control settings. Below are the new features that will be introduced with family on PSN:\n\nYou've already been able to share your favorite music to Twitter and Facebook via PlayStation Music, but now you'll also be able to share via messages using your PS4. If your friends are on PS4, they can listen to the track right inside the message by booting up Quick Menu, and if they're on their mobile device, they can jump directly to the Spotify app from the PS Messages app to check out the song.\n\nIn addition, if you're part of multiple message groups, you can now easily leave several groups at once. Just open up Options in the message list, select Leave, and choose the message groups you want to leave.\n\nNotifications Updates\n\nA new setting that allows you to disable pop-up notifications while you're watching a movie or TV show on your PS4 has been added. This setting is off by default, so go to Settings > Notifications to disable notifications and go uninterrupted during your videos.\n\nFurthermore, you now have the option to turn off message previews on your pop-up notifications. If you turn this setting off, the pop-up notification will hide the message senders' online ID and will display a generic user icon and message instead.\n\nLastly, you'll have the option to change the color of your pop-up notifications to either white (default) or black.\n\nQuick Menu Updates\n\nIf you want to keep an eye out on what's happening under Notifications, like the progress of your game downloads/installations or new party invites, you can now access this directly from the Quick Menu so you don't have to step away from your game every time you want to check your notifications.\n\nA 'Leave Party' option has been added to the Quick Menu, so you can easily exit a party and go right back to playing your game.\n\nIn addition, now you'll see the system clock in the upper-right corner of the screen when you pop open the Quick Menu.", "id": "9763314", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "PlayStation 4 System Software Update 5.0 rolls out today; Details here", "image": "http://download.gamezone.com/uploads/image/data/1219950/plasy.JPG", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Music"}, "id": "302636", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop music"}, "id": "303105", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television program"}, "id": "303532", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spotify"}, "id": "307723", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}, "id": "308708", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}, "id": "340359", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitch (website)"}, "id": "349819", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(website)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Software Update"}, "id": "361205", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Software_Update"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental controls"}, "id": "398807", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop-up notification"}, "id": "650501", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_notification"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Music"}, "id": "1437736", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Music"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Games"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 64, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 306, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 566, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Online"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 712, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1096, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms"}], "time": "13:06:00"}

We see how it compares to the current king of the Android market, the Galaxy S8.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is a decent phone built for content creators. It stands out for its Carl Zeiss dual rear cameras and 13Mp selfie camera that can be combined in a new 'Bothie' mode to capture the full picture, and for its Dual-Sight streaming capabilities and Ozo spatial audio recording.\n\nIt matches the Galaxy S8 on core specifications, and Nokia promises timely updates to its vanilla Android operating system. But in other respects the Nokia 8 does little to stand out in the crowded market.\n\nSamsung, meanwhile, is the master of bells and whistles. Though its flagship might not feature a dual-camera (that is tipped for the upcoming Note 8), it does have one of the best phone cameras on the market.\n\nThe Galaxy S8 has fancy extras such as wireless charging, an always-on display, an iris scanner and a heart-rate scanner, and though it's not plain Android the firm's Touchwiz UI is no longer the resource hog it once was, now focusing purely on useful extras - including the Bixby AI assistant, though we've yet to experience its full potential in the UK.\n\nAnd Samsung has perfected the S-series design with a combination of waterproofing (the Nokia 8 is merely splashproof), tough glass, dual-curved edges, and a virtually full-screen Infinity Display that is a sign of things to come in the smartphone market.\n\nThe screen technology itself has the edge, with Samsung specifying AMOLED in place of Nokia's IPS, offering (in our opinion) more satisfying and vibrant saturated colours and richer contrast. It's also brighter, though the Nokia 8 is very impressive at 700 nits.\n\nThe minimal bezels also give it a sleek appearance that the still-pretty 6000-series aluminium Nokia has no chance of matching, thanks to its decision to retain the home button (though this does mean the fingerprint scanner is in a more user-friendly position). In design the Galaxy S8 is the clear winner in this pairing.\n\nThough the Galaxy S8 was by far the more expensive of the two when it went on sale in April, the price has now fallen such that it may even be a few pounds cheaper than the Nokia 8 when it goes on sale in September.\n\nYou can today buy the Galaxy S8 SIM-free from Amazon for \u00a3551.99, while the Nokia 8 has an RRP of 599\u20ac that we expect to convert to around \u00a3550 in the UK.\n\nWe've compared the key specifications of each of these phones in the table below to help you form a purchasing decision.", "id": "9873730", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Nokia 8 vs Galaxy S8: Can the new Nokia compete with the King of Android?", "image": "https://cdn.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/reviews/3662884/nokia_8_vs_galaxy_s8_comparison_thumb800.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Price"}, "id": "303074", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glass"}, "id": "303772", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google Play Store"}, "id": "306750", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play"}, {"label": {"eng": "Operating system"}, "id": "307345", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}, "id": "308710", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED"}, {"label": {"eng": "User interface"}, "id": "311082", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint recognition"}, "id": "314740", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inductive charging"}, "id": "345265", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging"}, {"label": {"eng": "TouchWiz"}, "id": "388560", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TouchWiz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "10:40:00"}

Notably, the Nokia 2 was spotted recently on the FCC website revealing the design and few specs. Nonetheless, the smartphone for sure will be arriving today.\n\n6/7/17: HMD Global has announced that Nokia has rekindled its decades-old relationship with Zeiss, hinting that the upcoming Nokia 8 could be the firm's first Android phone to pack Carl Zeiss optics. The information was leaked on social media channel Twitter by Evan Blass, a credible source in the technology community. Confirming the phone as flagship devices, the listing also points to 4GB RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset. The smartphone will run on Android 7.1.1 Nougat out-of-the-box. The smartphone has been making rounds on the web in the form of leaks and rumours. The handset, based on leaks and rumours, will be sporting a vertical dual rear camera setup powered by Carl Zeiss lenses. The recent leaks suggested that the Nokia 8 will compete with the likes of iPhone 8, Samsung Galaxy Note 8. It is also lower than the earlier tipped price of Euro 749 (roughly Rs. 55,300), while the India price was tipped to be at Rs. 44,999.\n\nRelated News: 16 August 2017 Friends of stuntwoman killed on

It offers expandable memory using microSD cards of up to 256 GB via the microSD card slot. The smartphone runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box.\n\nThere's a 4G-enabled nano-SIM slot along with a hybrid nano-SIM slot that can be used as a micro-SD card slot to expand storage up to 256 GB. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, Wi-Fi hotspot, Bluetooth v5 A2DP and LE, GPS with A-GPS, GLONASS, BDS, NFC, FM Radio, a 3.5 mm headphone jack and a reversible Type-C USB 3.1 port in terms of connectivity. HMD Global has also added an IP54 rating to ensure that dust and minor water splashes don't damage the smartphone.\n\nImage Credit: HMD Global, Nokia\n\nAs for the battery, there's a 3,090 mAh non-removable Lithium-Ion battery that supports Quick Charge 3.0. The device will be available in four color options, Tempered Blue, Polished Blue, Steel and Polished Copper. The smartphone will be available in Europe for EUR 599. The company has not announced the pricing and availability of the flagship for the Indian market at the time of writing.\n\nWith the launch of the much-awaited flagship from Nokia, it is sure to generate interest amongst potential smartphone buyers. The reason for this interest is both because of the nostalgia associated with the Nokia brand in addition to the sturdy build quality that we expect from the company. With this in mind, we've pitted the Nokia 8 against the 2017 flagships currently available in the Indian market.\n\nImage Credit: HMD Global, Nokia\n\nWe have chosen the Nokia 8, the OnePlus 5, the Samsung Galaxy S8+ and the HTC U11 for the comparison. Even though, the Nokia 8 is not available in the Indian market, we can expect the device to arrive here in the coming months. Availability in the Indian market is the reason we have not included flagships from Lenovo-owned Motorola and Xiaomi.

One thing to note here is that it does not bring anything new in terms of design or specifications. The only new feature that Nokia brings to the table are in terms of software with the 'Bothie' feature that uses both the front and back camera modules at the same time to capture a photo or video. The company has also added 'Dual-Sight' video where users can livestream using both the front and back camera at the same time. The smartphone also captures 360-degree spatial audio with the help of OZO Audio feature.\n\nThere are a few things that may work for the company as it packs Carl Zeiss lenses on both the camera modules at the back. Another neat addition is stock Android Nougat 7.1.1 out of the box along with a clean UI. Last but not the least, the nostalgia factor would work for Nokia once the smartphone launches in the market. The unique features like 'Dual-Sight' and 'Bothie' may attract some users and content creators.\n\nImage Credit: HMD Global, Nokia\n\nHowever, the problem here is not the new software features but the fact that Nokia has not launched anything revolutionary in terms of the hardware. The company was known to take risks and bring different hardware innovations to the market. The Nokia 8 can't compete with OnePlus 5 in terms of the value for money proposition either. The design is also not as bold as that of the Galaxy S8, but the appreciation of this is a subjective choice. It looks similar to the HTC U11 in terms of looks without adding anything new, like the U11's squeezable frame gimmick.\n\nSo far, Nokia's flagship seems like a very safe design. It offers a pure Android experience, plain design and a brand name. We're not sure if that'e enough to get everyone to take notice of the fact that Nokia is back. For now, judging by the specs on paper, Nokia appears to be pinning its hopes on the camera. Let's just hope that it's a good one.\n\n#Htc #Nokia #Nokia 8 #Nokia 8 comparison #Nokia 8 vs htc u11 #Nokia 8 vs oneplus 5 #Nokia 8 vs samsung s8+ #Nokia mobile #Oneplus #Samsung\n\nPublished Date:

First, the bad news: you still can't change your PSN account name, even if it seemed really cool back in middle school. But there's some good stuff too. If you aren't in the beta and can't try them yourself, here are some tweaks to look forward to when the final version arrives in the weeks ahead.\n\nDisable notifications while you're watching Netflix\n\nNothing drains the tension out of a great TV moment like your PS4 suddenly chirping up and filling the corner of your screen with inessential tidbits like 'your friend logged on'. In PS4 update 5.0, you'll finally be able to silence those annoying pop-ups while you're watching TV or movies. Note that you could already turn notifications off entirely, but this way you can still get them while you're playing games (i.e. when information about your friends coming online might actually be useful).\n\nCustom friend lists for easy invites\n\nHave a few different groups of friends you play games with? The new 'Custom Lists' tab in the Friends menu will let you create and edit, what else, custom friend lists. Then you can use that list to easily message and invite your Helldivers squad (hey, Helldivers is still really good) without disturbing your Destiny raid buddies. Custom Lists will take the place of 'Favorite Groups'.\n\nBetter family controls\n\nPS4 family controls are finally getting a modern kick in the pants in update 5.0. Multiple parent/guardians can be part of the same family, all with parental controls over child accounts. You can also set different controls for individual child accounts, if little X is growing up fast and ready to play Helldivers (no, seriously, it's good) but little Y should stick to games that don't let you drop orbital pods on strangers.\n\nA more useful Quick Menu (again)\n\nThe Quick Menu fights ever harder to justify that long press of the PlayStation Button. This update gives it three handy new features: Notifications (so you can check your downloads and invites), Leave Party (so you can get the hell out of a party with a quickness), and the System Clock (so you can see how long it's been since you last said \"just one more round\").\n\nYou can read through the rest of the changes coming in PS4 update 5.0 on the PlayStation Blog.

Even better, the Finnish marque has opted to not reinvent the wheel and is sticking to vanilla Android for its software. Until now, Nokia focused its Android efforts on entry-level and mid-range devices. The Nokia 8 takes a different tack and shows that the company looks to compete in the high-end arena too.\n\nThe 8 is built around the same \"10-nm\" Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 as Sony's Xperia XZ Premium, HTC's U11, and some versions of Samsung's Galaxy S8. The four CPU cores run at 2.5 GHz and the chip has a full-length copper heatpipe atop it, so it could potentially offer better sustained performance than some of its platform-mates. The SoC is augmented by 4 GB of LPDDR4X memory. Buyers will be able to install plenty of apps and games on the 64 GB of internal storage (128 GB on the navy blue model). If that isn't enough room, the microSD slot can accept cards as large as 256 GB.\n\nThe storage will come in handy for holding the images generated by the Nokia 8's fancy camera setup. The world-facing camera and the self-facing snapper are both 13-MP f/2.0 units. The main camera has dual monochrome and color sensors and is topped off by an IR range finder and a dual-tone flash. The two picture-snappers can be used together to create what Nokia is calling a \"bothie.\" The cameras can record 4K video and Nokia OZO spatial 360\u00b0 audio, something that could make for somewhat less-awful recordings of coffee shop acoustic sets. Users can get those images and any other data on or off the phone using a USB Type-C port.\n\nNokia says that manufacturing 8's aluminum unibody requires 40 steps of machining, anodizing, and polishing. Unlike some other recent range-topping handsets, Nokia's latest has a healthy bezel around the screen. This approach doesn't look as cool as an edge-to-edge screen, but offers some usability benefits. As for the screen itself, it's a 5.3\" IPS display with a Corning Gorilla Glass cover and a 2560x1440 resolution that works out to 554 PPI.\n\nThe phone packs Google's latest Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system and always-on Google Assistant AI helper. Nokia says it \"packed the full spread of Google's most popular apps and no unnecessary extras\" in the software. Furthermore, the company vows to provide regular updates to keep users on top of features and security.\n\nThe Nokia 8 measures 5.9\" tall, 2.9\" wide and 0.31\" thick (15 cm x 7.4 cm x 0.8 cm) and is available with black, navy blue, copper, and silver finishes. The handset goes on sale in Europe early next month for \u20ac599 (about $580 without taxes).", "id": "9720128", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 zeroes in on the Galaxy S8 and

The incremental fixes have been nice, but there hasn't been enough of an iteration to fold in the key features of the PlayStation 4 Pro.\n\nThe next major update for the PS4, system software version 5.00, is heading into beta Thursday and there are a number of features that we can get excited about, including better broadcasting capability for the PS4 Pro and improved family accounts and sub-accounts for kids.\n\nThis is a time to rejoice -- finally, we can see the PS4 taking advantage of the PS4 Pro's improved graphical capabilities for more than just playing games. Twitch streamers will be able to stream PS4 games on their PS4 Pros at 1080p definition and at 60 frames per second.\n\nAnd, if you're looking to stream directly from your PlayStation VR headset, you'll be able to see messages from spectators in VR, as well as cinematic mode.\n\nAs a parent with three children that have fairly active PlayStation Network sub-accounts, this is a heartening change, especially after discovering the horrors of the PSN porn bots. Setting up a master account with sub-accounts isn't difficult in the current system, but it's easy to make a mistake and not lock it down tightly enough.\n\nInstead of it falling on one parent to be in charge of all of the kids' accounts, you can split it off to another adult in the family. According to the PlayStation blog post, \"The family manager can promote another adult inside the family to a parent/guardian, who can then customize parental control levels of children's accounts.\"\n\nThis doesn't take into account that there might be two or more adults either in the household or in the family that need to have access to these family accounts -- but, baby steps.\n\nIt's a particularly embarrassing moment when you have to shuffle your feet and ask your partner to unlock the PlayStation because the parental controls prevent you from streaming. With these new parental controls, you can tune parental controls for each child, instead of having every account on the PlayStation be affected by the same level of controls.\n\nUsability is paramount when you're building a solid user interface. If people can't use the software, the hardware is going to end up as a brick underneath a TV somewhere, unused and unloved.\n\nPlayStation continues to improve the usability with this new system update, specifically in the quick menu. The quick menu was a new addition for the 4.00 update from September, and 5.00 improves on it by providing some better options for party management. No one likes to leave a game screen to leave a party or adjust party settings in the party page.\n\nMessages have been improved, too. As it is right now, messaging is a cumbersome effort that requires way too much time to wrangle. There's no way to or bulk-leave conversations. You have to do it one at a time. The 5.00 update fixes that.\n\nFinally, some much-needed improvements to friend lists. Currently, there is a \"favorite groups\" tab, but the new 5.00 update will remove that in lieu of \"custom lists\", which will allow you to curate your list of fave people. Or, if you're a streamer with regular viewers or regular co-players, that's a good place to wrangle them, too.\n\nThink of the new \"custom lists\" as a list on Twitter -- they're not always useful but there are definitely times that you're glad you have them set up, just in case.\n\nThere's no word on when the beta update will be rolled out to all users, but the beta goes live Thursday for those that received emails from Sony previously.", "id": "9763341", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "The PS4 5.00 Update Beta includes new family options, better streaming features and more", "image": "https://thumbs.mic.com/N2EwM2QxNWIzOCMvQWJHem4xdG5jVDVvUWtxR1RuTi1GT3EtVlFZPS8weDA6MTA3NXg2MDQvMTIwMHg2MzAvZmlsdGVyczpxdWFsaXR5KDcwKS9odHRwczovL3MzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20vcG9saWN5bWljLWltYWdlcy94aWNpdnYybG1ndDJyZTAydnljYXVuNW9vcTQ5aDhoenppa2hxdXdxYjJ0MWJxYmJoOWJtanM1NGZjd2Q3dHZjLmpwZw.undefined", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 92, "date": "2017-09-13", "amb": false, "textEnd": 100}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Television"}, "id": "302838", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"}, {"label": {"eng": "Family (biology)"}, "id": "303765", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blog"}, "id": "305393", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphical user interface"}, "id": "306748", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}, "id": "307034", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation (console)"}, "id": "308310", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)"}, {"label": {"eng": "User interface"}, "id": "311082", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "Usability"}, "id": "314749", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability"}, {"label": {"eng": "Curate"}, "id": "314902", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}, "id": "340359", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitch (website)"}, "id": "349819", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(website)"}, {"label": {"eng": "System software"}, "id": "396377", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental controls"}, "id": "398807", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation VR"}, "id": "1270845", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_VR"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 413, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 701, "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Firms", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Firms"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1030, "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Associations", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Associations"}], "time": "16:06:00"}

That's a fair bit more affordable than Samsung's brilliant Galaxy S8 handset, which currently costs just under \u00a3700 here in the UK.\n\nOn paper, the Nokia mobile actually sounds more enticing in many ways than Samsung's S8. For instance, that Dual Sight snapper, created in collaboration with optics expert Carl Zeiss, appears to be a serious rival to the Galaxy's single-lens camera. You also get the super-powered Snapdragon 835 chipset packed inside, along with a pleasingly pure version of Google's Android OS.\n\nSo is the Nokia 8 really a smarter choice than the Galaxy S8? Here's our full comparison, to help you decide which flagship to lay your money on.\n\nNokia 8 vs Galaxy S8: Specs Phone Nokia 8 Samsung Galaxy S8 Screen size 5.3-inches 5.8-inches Screen resolution 2560x1440 2560x1440 Fingerprint sensor? Yes Yes Water resistant? Splash resistant only (IP54) Yes OS Android 7.1.1 Android 7.1.1 + TouchWiz Processor Snapdragon 835 Snapdragon 835/Exynos 8995 Memory 4GB 4GB Storage 64GB 64GB microSD? Yes Yes Battery 3080mAh 3000mAh Rear camera 13MP dual-lens 12MP Front camera 13MP 8MP Nokia 8 vs Galaxy S8: Design\n\nWhen it comes to looks, we have to side with Samsung's phone.\n\nThat edge-to-edge design is still stunning, even months after the launch. You'd never guess that the Galaxy S8 comes packing a 5.8-inch display either, as the handset is so comfortable to clutch, slipping into pockets and bags with ease.\n\nIn comparison, the Nokia 8 sports quite chunky bezels, especially above and below the display. That means you get very similar dimensions, even though the display is just 5.3-inches in size.\n\nIf you want a phone to take in the bath or snap some shower selfies, then Samsung is your best choice. The S8 is fully water resistant, so can survive a tumble into liquid, while the Nokia 8 is merely splash-proof. Still, while the Galaxy handset only comes with a glossy rear, the Nokia flagship can be snaffled in a choice of matte or 'polished' aluminium finishes. Both blowers offer a small selection of colours, to suit your personal tastes.\n\nYou also get a fingerprint sensor no matter your choice, although we prefer Nokia's front-facing scanner. Samsung has housed the sensor around the back of the phone in a rather awkward position, which means you'll occasionally have to fumble to find it.\n\nNokia 8 vs Galaxy S8: Screen and media\n\nIf you want super-crisp visuals, then you'll be happy with either phone in this comparison. Both of these devices serve up 2K displays, although the exact resolution is slightly different thanks to the Galaxy S8's stretched aspect ratio. Colours are punchy, brightness levels are strong and viewing angles are nice and wide, as you'd expect from flagship handsets.\n\nOf course, the Galaxy S8 is well and truly future-proof, offering full support for HDR video streaming. That's something you sadly won't find on the Nokia 8. Although we're yet to see much HDR content for mobile devices, the likes of Netflix will soon offer plenty of shows and movies to watch with these seriously impressive visuals.\n\nBoth blowers pack in plenty of storage space, to carry around a massive media collection. You'll find 64GB of room no matter your choice, with full support for microSD memory cards.\n\nNokia 8 vs Galaxy S8: Features and OS\n\nAlthough Android is the OS on both of these flagships, the design of each phone's UI is quite different. That's because while Samsung has tweaked the interface and added a bunch of new features, Nokia has stuck with a vanilla version of Google's mobile operating system.\n\nThe Galaxy S8 offers up quite a lot of bonus functionality, on top of Android's typical features. For instance, you can arrange a row of shortcuts to your favourite apps and contacts along the curved edge of the display, for fast access. Samsung's own S Health app is on hand to keep tabs on your lifestyle and track your movements, complete with a built-in heart rate monitor. And a handy one-handed mode makes the phone easier to use on the go.\n\nWander over to our Galaxy S8 tips, tricks and best hidden features guide for all you need to know about these bonus bits.\n\nBy comparison, the Nokia 8 delivers a raw version of Android Nougat. Although you don't get so many built-in features, this also means you don't get any annoying duplication like you do on the Galaxy S8 (which packs two web browsers, as just one example). Nokia owners are likely to get a full upgrade to Android O ahead of S8 users as well.\n\nNokia 8 vs Galaxy S8: Performance and battery life\n\nSamsung's Galaxy S8 is one of the most powerful handsets around, boasting a Snapdragon 835 platform in the USA and China and Samsung's own Exynos 8995 chipset in the rest of the world. Either way, you're getting a smooth everyday experience and the ability to play the latest games with a perfect frame rate. You certainly won't see any signs of ageing for quite some time either.\n\nLikewise, the Nokia 8 also boasts Qualcomm's super-powered Snapdragon 835 chipset. Android runs like a dream and we'd be surprised to see any kind of stutter or lag. Of course, you'll have to check back for our in-depth Nokia 8 review to see if the new flagship really is a solid performer.\n\nWe're yet to fully test the Nokia phone's battery life, although the 3080mAh cell is ever so slightly more capacious than the Galaxy S8's 3000mAh battery. We're expecting the Nokia phone to offer a little longer than Samsung's 24 hours of life, especially as it has a smaller screen to power. Still, both phones offer fast charge support, so you can expect close to a full recharge from just an hour at the plug.\n\nNokia 8 vs Galaxy S8: Cameras\n\nWhen it comes to optics, these two phones offer pretty different tech.\n\nSamsung's Galaxy S8 sports a single-lens 12-megapixel camera on the rear, with an f/1.7 aperture lens and Dual Pixel autofocus. The result is near instant photo capture, with excellent results in almost any conditions - even low light.\n\nMeanwhile the Nokia 8 packs a dual-lens camera, with two 13-megapixel f/2.0 aperture lenses working together to capture crisp shots. The Phase Detection Autofocus seems to be just as fast as the S8's, and so far we're impressed by the image quality on offer. Of course, while we're yet to test the low light performance, we're expecting Samsung's blower to be the superior handset for tricky conditions.\n\nWhat the Nokia 8 offers instead is some neat bokeh-style effects, thanks to the dual-lens setup. That said, the S8 does a fine job of replicating this effect with its depth-of-field photo feature, which simply takes a number of shots and merges them together.\n\nBoth phones can shoot up to 4K resolution video, as well as timelapse and slow-motion footage. You can also live stream your activities straight to Facebook or YouTube via the Nokia 8's camera app, something not offered by the Galaxy S8 - despite Samsung previously supporting this with its Live Broadcast tool.\n\nPro photographers have a number of manual controls in either case, to get just the shot they desire. However, Samsung also has serious appeal for younger users with its selection of bizarre stickers and AR face masks, which range from the silly to the downright creepy. The Nokia 8 instead wants us to capture shots using the front and rear cameras at the same time, which HMD is calling a 'bothie'.\n\nCheck out our Nokia 8 camera preview and in-depth Galaxy S8 camera review for more detailed information on these mobile snappers.", "id": "9577986", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 vs Galaxy S8: Can Nokia's flagship Android trump Samsung's...", "image": "https://cdn1.recombu.com/media/mobile/Devices/Nokia/Nokia 8/Nokia8vsS8.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Heart rate"}, "id": "302683", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Netflix"}, "id": "302687", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ceremonial ship launching"}, "id": "302960", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_ship_launching"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}, "id": "307034", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile operating system"}, "id": "308235", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}, "id": "308589", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}, "id": "308708", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device"}, {"label": {"eng": "Music video"}, "id": "309939", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Exynos (system on chip)"}, "id": "355361", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exynos_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Memory card"}, "id": "358978", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_card"}, {"label": {"eng": "TouchWiz"}, "id": "388560", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TouchWiz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "IP Code"}, "id": "405233", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "17:33:00"}

Not least because of the curved back, which gleams especially in the two glossy versions available.\n\nNokia has always had a strong eye for colour and scored big successes with handsets that dared not to be black. Here, there are four shades: matte silver, polished blue, matte blue and polished copper.\n\nThe copper is the real standout, though that glossy polished blue is fierce. Both the polished surfaces attract some fingerprints, though not to the level I've found on some other glossy phones. Anyway, part of the pleasure of a shiny phone is polishing it to its most gleaming, I find.\n\n11 useful WhatsApp features you didn't know existed + show all 11 useful WhatsApp features you didn't know existed 1/11 Dodge the blue ticks\n\nWhatsApp's blue ticks show when sent messages have been read, but you can disable them buy going to Settings > Account > Privacy > Read Receipts. However, bear in mind that, by doing so, you'll lose the ability to see when your own sent messages have been read. Another, more fiddly way of reading your messages without triggering the blue ticks, is enabling Aeroplane Mode before opening your messages - just remember to close the app before switching Aeroplane Mode off again.\n\n2/11 Hide your 'last seen' time\n\nPrevent your friends from finding out when you were last online by hiding your last seen time. Go to Settings > Account > Privacy > Last Seen. As is the case with disabling read receipts, hiding your 'last seen' time will also stop you from seeing anybody else's.\n\n3/11 Limit data usage\n\nYou can control how much data you munch through on WhatsApp by limiting the types of media you automatically download on a mobile connection. Go to Settings > Data Usage and choose the best option for you.\n\n4/11 Customise notifications\n\nIf you're expecting an important WhatsApp message from someone, set a custom notification for them by opening the chat, tapping their name at the top and hitting Custom Notifications.\n\n5/11 Format your messages\n\nTo jazz up any of your messages, simply highlight it by tapping and holding it, hit the More Options key on the pop-up menu and tap the formatting option you want - bold, italic, strikethrough or monospace.\n\n6/11 Type hands-free\n\nYou can get Siri or Google Assistant to type your WhatsApp messages out for you by saying either \"Hey Siri\" or \"Okay Google\", followed by the name of the person you want to message and the actual contents of the message.\n\n7/11 Mark chats as unread\n\nWhen you've read a message but can't reply to it straight away, you can set a visual reminder by marking it as unread. On Android, long-press the conversation, and on iOS, swipe from left to right on a chat.\n\n8/11 Email entire conversations\n\nYou almost certainly won't do this on a regular basis, but it's a handy option to have. You can export entire conversations - complete with emoji and media attachments - by hitting More inside a chat a selecting Email Chat.\n\n9/11 Mass-message contacts\n\nYou can send the same message to lots of your contacts without lumping them all into one group, much like the BCC option on email, by hitting the New Broadcast option on the app's main menu.\n\n10/11 Pin conversations\n\nYou pin up to three contacts and groups to the top of your WhatsApp conversation list by tapping and holding a chat, then hitting the pin icon.\n\n11/11 Make things easier to find\n\nYou can easily mark key messages with a star, allowing you to find them easily when you need to. Just tap and hold a message and hit the star icon to save it, and return to it later by selecting Starred Messages in WhatsApp's main menu.\n\nDisplay\n\nThe display's 2,560 x 1,440 resolution, which translates to 554 pixels per inch, is much sharper than Nokia's previous screens. It looks great: rich, detailed and brightly coloured - even though it's an LCD screen, not the OLED display favoured by Samsung's flagship Galaxy S8 and rumoured to be in the next iPhone.\n\nThe display, though, is fine. But some may have problems with the bezels at top and bottom of the phone, which are noticeably bigger than on recent premium handsets such as the Samsung and the LG G6.\n\nStill, Nokia has strong arguments for designing it this way. First, the company says it wanted to keep the Android Back and Recent Apps buttons on the front of the phone, either side of the fingerprint sensor. So that sensor requires some real estate below the display edge.\n\nThe company also says that including a 13-megapixel front-facing camera was a priority, and there's a limit, it says, to how narrow you can make a bezel at the top and still have the room the camera sensor needs.\n\nPersonally, I think it looks fine, for now at least. But as more phones arrive with tiny bezels and near-fullscreen fronts, it may come to look dated.\n\nCamera\n\nThe camera is such a big selling point on every smartphone now, it's no surprise that Nokia is putting such emphasis on it here, especially with the Zeiss collaboration.\n\nWe'll have to see just how good the images are, but Nokia's cameraphones in its previous existence were consistently strong and innovative, and certainly Zeiss was at pains to tell me that its input is more than just the lens - the software, for instance, has a big Zeiss input.\n\nThe rear dual cameras are both 13-megapixel sensors, one colour and one monochrome. Huawei has a similar approach on its latest phones, saying that the monochrome sensor can get a sharper result as it grabs light quickly, and the colour one gives you the colour fidelity.\n\nRead more How has Apple's iPhone changed in the decade since its debut?\n\nThe system is certainly flexible: you can opt to shoot using both sensors - which is the choice it will automatically go for - or with one or the other. So you can go for a black-and-white image, which is strong on contrast and less muddy than many colour sensors could manage. Quite why you'd just use the colour sensor isn't clear, but, hey, it's nice to have the option.\n\nJudgement will have to wait until I can test it properly but first impressions are very strong: sharp, effective images resulted from even lowish light situations, with an imperceptible level of shutter lag.\n\nOh, one more thing about the camera, the front- and rear-facing lenses can be put to use simultaneously to deliver a combination image showing, as it were, selfies in two directions, which it calls - wait for it - the bothie.\n\nNokia isn't the first to have both cameras active at the same time, it's true, but this is easily the most intuitive and simple implementation of this effect. Will it catch on? Who knows, but it's an imaginative feature that sets Nokia apart.\n\nAudio\n\nNokia also stressed the importance of audio on the phone, with expertise it has learnt from its Virtual Reality sensors. There are three microphones that work together in a system it calls OZO, which records audio binaurally so that it provides, Nokia claims, high-quality audio automatically, with no special playback system required.\n\nAndroid\n\nNokia stresses that it uses the latest version of Android generally available, version 7.1.1, and that because it has a pure form of Android on board, this phone will be one of the very first to receive Android O, when it goes live shortly.\n\nA pure version of Android should indeed mean quicker updates to the latest version, though we'll have to see how this pans out in practice. Meantime, most of the phone uses pure, vanilla Android, with only the camera behaving in a strikingly different way from rivals.\n\nThe Nokia 8 goes on sale in early September with networks announced nearer to the time and an initial SIM-free price point of \u20ac599 (\u00a3545) - noticeably lower than most top-of-the-range from rival manufacturers.\n\nMore about: Nokia Android smartphones Reuse content", "id": "9646834", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "This is the phone that's trying to reinvent the selfie", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/16/16/nokia-8-polished-blue-and-polished-copper.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Email"}, "id": "302685", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}, "id": "306307", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp"}, {"label": {"eng": "OLED"}, "id": "307342", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "IOS"}, "id": "308487", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS"}, {"label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}, "id": "308706", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cellular network"}, "id": "308803", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emoji"}, "id": "309729", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel density"}, "id": "317242", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tower Bridge"}, "id": "339071", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Bridge"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "08:21:00"}

Here is what Nokia 8 users can be expected from its cameras.\n\nIt includes a 13-megapixel Sony IMX258 RGB sensor. It is a f/2.0 aperture sensor with 1.12-micron pixels and carries support for optical image stabilization (OIS). The dual camera system also includes a f/2.0 aperture Sony IMX258 monochrome sensor that lacks OIS.\n\nThe inclusion of a monochrome sensor helps in adding more light while shooting photos and videos in low-light conditions. According to Nokia, the dual rear cameras of the Nokia 8 are equipped with advanced image fusion algorithm that makes it possible to shoot impressive images in all conditions.\n\nThe dual rear cameras of the Nokia 8 can be used for capturing shots with bokeh effect. Nokia's Live Bokeh effect feature allows users to increase or decrease the artificial blur for the background so that can users can shoot perfect photos with bokeh effect.\n\nOne of the major camera features of the Nokia 8 is called Bothie. The Dual-Sight mode allows users to make use of the dual rear cameras as well as the frontal camera simultaneously to shoot split-screen videos or pictures called Bothies as shown in the image above. Bothies can be livestreamed on social platforms like Facebook or YouTube by using the Live icon in the camera app.\n\nRead More: Nokia 8 Goes Official With SD835 & Carl Zeiss Dual Cameras: Get Ready For \"Bothies\"\n\nThe frontside also includes a 13-megapixel selfie snapper that seems that it also features a f/2.0 aperture Sony IMX258 sensor.

That time has finally come - the Nokia 8 is here, and it's every bit the high-end handset we've been pinning our hopes on.\n\nBringing back long-time collaborator Zeiss optics, and learning lessons from the Nokia 3, 5 and Nokia 6, put it in a great place to make a splash - even with big guns like OnePlus, Honor and Motorola already having made their mark.\n\nI got to try one out ahead of launch, and based on early impressions, there's a lot to like. Especially if you're a fan of copper.\n\nIf the Nokia 6 was a chunky slab of metal, the 8 is a slim, svelte slice. It's 7.3mm in the middle, but tapers down to less than 5mm at the edges, with smooth curves that fit perfectly in your hand.\n\nIt feels slick to hold, whether you go for the grippy, matt colours with their coarser texture, or the shiny, polished variants that are a bit more of a fingerprint magnet, but look that little bit more premium. It's a similar look to HTC's U11, only here it's metal and not glass doing the shining.\n\nAnnoyingly, I wasn't allowed to take photos of the copper version, which is easily the best-looking phone in the line-up. The stealthy antenna lines at the top and bottom leave the entire back of the phone free from unwanted distractions, letting you get a good look at the shiny surface.\n\nUp front, you still get the familiar screen bezels we've been seeing for the best part of ten years - Nokia hasn't made the move to skinny screens just yet, leaving Samsung and LG (and possibly Apple later in the year) in a category to themselves. It still looks good, just not as future-friendly as some of the more expensive competition.\n\nWith Zeiss making a long-awaited return to Nokia phones here, you'd expect the 8 to make a big splash, and on paper, it's got every chance of doing it. There are three 13MP sensors on board - two on the back and one on the front.\n\nOne of those rear snappers is pure monochrome, with the other shooting in RGB colour. They work together with Nokia's own algorithms to give your pics a detail boost, or you can use them individually for some moody black and white shots. Phase-detect AF, an IR range-finder and f/2.0 apertures should help it take high-quality photos.\n\nOnly the colour sensor has optical image stabilisation, though, so might be better suited to those low-light shots. I only got to take a few snaps in perfect sunlight, so it's tough to tell how it will perform, but early impressions are positive.\n\nThe one thing I'm not so sold on? The idea that we'll soon be using both front and back cameras to capture Bothies - it's the kind of #millennial nonsense I'm clearly too over-the-hill to appreciate, but maybe the kids will be down with it once the phone arrives.\n\nWhen I first picked it up, I wondered if Nokia had used an OLED panel for the 5.3in display: everything looks impressively rich and colourful, with excellent contrast. There's even an always-on display option, which pops the time, date and any notifications on the standby screen. Turns out it's actually an LCD screen, which is pretty damn impressive.\n\nThe 2K resolution is par for the course in a top-spec blower like this, but everything still looks sharp and precise. Viewing angles seem pretty good, and it gets seriously bright, too - Nokia reckons it'll hit 700nits, and it certainly stayed perfectly legible when I stepped outside with it.\n\nSound is more of a mixed bag. There's only a single speaker, and I didn't get the chance to properly try it out, but Nokia is promising big things when it comes to recording. Ozo audio is essentially a 3D recording algorithm that uses multiple mics to create surround sound. Again, it's one to test before we pass judgment. There's also a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you don't have to worry about living the dongle life just yet.\n\nIf the new Nokia's first three phones didn't quite hit the mark when it came to power, this more than makes up for it. Here you get a Snapdragon 835 CPU and 4GB of RAM, which puts it on par with the most expensive smartphones around right now.\n\nIt certainly felt rapid when swiping between home screens and opening apps - although that could partly be down to Nokia's barebones approach to Android customisation. It feels almost exactly like a Google Pixel, with no ugly UI or preinstalled bloat slowing things down. That also means it'll be first in line to get Android updates, including the big push to Android O later in the year.\n\nThat Qualcomm chip also has one of the best mobile GPUs around for gaming, so we don't doubt it'll absolutely fly when you load up Asphalt 8.\n\nThe one worry is the 3000mAh battery, which isn't exactly massive. Nokia reckons it has done a lot of work to optimise the CPU, which should translate to a day and a half between charges, but we'll have to wait until a full review to see how that works out in real life.\n\nAt least you get USB-C charging here, and QuickCharge 3.0 support for quick top-ups.\n\nSure, it might have a similar look, but the 8 feels a world apart from Nokia's three other smartphones. The leap in build quality, hardware and general design is huge, and the dual camera tech shows plenty of promise.\n\nWith European pricing set to start at \u20ac599 (there's no US or Australian pricing yet, but it should make it here eventually), it puts the 8 at the pricier end of the smartphone spectrum. Not quite as high as the Samsungs and Apples of the world, but more expensive than a OnePlus 5. It'll be down to those cameras to make up the difference, then.\n\nI'm not convinced that doubling up the front and back cameras is going to make enough of a splash, but maybe there's still a lot of love for the Nokia name out there - and a flagship phone is what will bring the fans back.\n\nWe'll find out in a few weeks, when the phone goes on sale and we give it a full review.", "id": "9598656", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Hands-on Preview: Nokia 8 smartphone", "image": "http://i.nextmedia.com.au/Features/nokia_8_handson_stuff_19.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}, "id": "307030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "OLED"}, "id": "307342", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Motorola"}, "id": "324217", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}, "id": "329085", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}, "id": "360548", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model"}, {"label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}, "id": "368054", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "02:27:00"}

People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own,\" Juho Sarvikas, Chief Product Officer of HMD Global said in a brand statement.\n\n\"It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance.\"\n\nThe phone itself is pretty sexy. It has a body that's 4.6mm thin at the edge and 7.3mm on average and is precision milled from a single block of 6000 series aluminium. It also features 'Nokia OZO Audio', a fancy audio feature which combines three microphones to capture sound from all around.\n\nEver notice your handset get really hot when using Snapchat or asking it to do a lot of stuff at once? The developers have addressed that, too. The result is a full-length, graphite shielded copper cooling pipe that 'dissipates the heat generated by the high performing system across the full length and breadth of the handset'. The result is a cooler running phone even when you're using it flat out.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will retail for $899.00 is available to pre-order from JB Hi Fi Friday 18 August.

Sarvikas reinforced the position that avoiding customisation and bloat would result in being able to use all the power for the things you want, as well as being able to deliver the latest updates faster.\n\nThat's good news for Android users getting the latest security update, which Nokia has delivered on with its existing handsets - the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 - but Sarvikas also outlined a strong desire to have the Nokia 8 running Android O as quickly as possible.\n\nWith no date yet given by Google for the launch of Android 8, Sarvikas didn't confirm a date for the update to Android O, but stated that the Nokia 8 would be aiming to be one of the first devices to push out the update to Android O, and that the company was already working with development versions of the software.\n\nThat's good news for those interested in this new flagship phone: the likes of the HTC U11 or Samsung Galaxy S8 may be waiting for many months.

It wasn't exactly a flagship though, since it was powered by a Snapdragon 430 chipset, and the Nokia 3 and 5 were even lower end.\n\nBut today, HMD Global finally announced a flagship phone in the Nokia 8. Unsurprisingly, it uses the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, which means that it supports gigabit 4G LTE, and more.\n\nBoth of the two rear camera lenses and the front camera is made by ZEISS, as was shown previously in leaks. The Dual-Sight feature allows users to live-stream split-screen video from both the front and rear sensors, which HMD Global says is a first in a smartphone. The company shamelessly said that it's not a selfie...it's a Bothie.\n\nOne feature that seems interesting is that the 13-megapixel front camera includes phase detect autofocus. Most front cameras are fixed-focus, and even the ones with autofocus don't have phase detect, which should allow for it to focus quickly.\n\nThe handset isn't only trying to innovate with video capture though, as the phone utilizes OZO Audio by combining three microphones \"with exclusive Nokia acoustic algorithms to capture audio with immersive 360\u00b0 spatial surround sound.\" The firm says that high fidelity playback will even work on devices that don't have OZO.\n\nHere are the full specs:\n\nCPU Snapdragon 835 GPU Adreno 540 Display 5.3 inches, 1440p, LCD Body 151.5 x 73.7 x 7.9mm (0.4mm camera bump), 160g Camera Dual 13MP (one color with OIS and one monochrome), Front - 13MP Camera features Dual-Sight, OIS, PDAF RAM 4GB Storage 64GB Network\n\nGSM: 850/900/1800/1900\n\nWCDMA: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8\n\nTDS-CDMA: 34, 39\n\nLTE:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 20, 28, 38, 39, 40, 41\n\nBattery 3,090mAh\n\nWhile the Nokia 8 comes in at 7.9mm, it's 4.6mm at its thinnest. The phone is \"precision milled from a single block of 6000 series aluminium and its pure design has been refined through a 40-stage process of machining, anodizing and polishing.\"\n\nThe phone will be available globally in September at an average price of \u20ac599, but you'll want to check the LTE bands above before purchasing it in your region. It will come in four colors, including Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue, and Steel.\n\nSource: HMD Global | Qualcomm | Nokia", "id": "9561080", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "HMD Global finally announces a flagship phone with the Nokia 8", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/neowin/news/images/uploaded/2017/08/1502912144_nokia_8_story.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}, "id": "307030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microphone"}, "id": "307750", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera lens"}, "id": "310411", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_lens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "International CES"}, "id": "312203", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_CES"}, {"label": {"eng": "LTE (telecommunication)"}, "id": "313094", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Machining"}, "id": "321107", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machining"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}, "id": "322107", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm"}, {"label": {"eng": "GSM"}, "id": "333961", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chipset"}, "id": "345802", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adreno"}, "id": "351564", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adreno"}, {"label": {"eng": "Code division multiple access"}, "id": "367616", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_division_multiple_access"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "20:40:00"}

PS4 Pro users will be able to stream in 1080p and 60 FPS, provided their connection is strong enough, and PSVR users will be able to see new messages and comments coming through while broadcasting. PSVR is also adding 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound support. Next up, the PS4's Friends List is being updated with greater management tools, such as the ability to set up separate lists of friends. You'll be able to create a list of all the people you play Destiny with and send them all an invite, for example. This feature replaces the old Favorite Groups tab. In another move to help reduce the amount of time spent in menus, the Quick Menu is being updated to have more options. For example, you'll be able to check on download progress and see new party invites. You can also leave a party from within that menu and see your current Spotify playlist. Notifications are also being improved when watching films and TV, as you can now disable message and other notification pop-ups while watching media. You can also change how much of a message is displayed, as well as its color, when playing or watching any form of content.\n\nFinally, Parental Control features are being overhauled in favor of what Sony calls \"Family on PSN.\" This replaces the old Master/Sub account system; instead, one user is deemed the Family Manager, and they can set up other accounts and appoint them as a Parent/Guardian, Adult, or Child. Parents or Guardians can restrict Child accounts in their \"use of online features and communication with other players, set restrictions for games, restrict the use of the internet browser, and set spending limits for PlayStation Store.\" Note that Sony says the first time any North American user tries to set up an Adult account, they will be charged $0.50 \"to verify that you are an adult.\"", "id": "9802621", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "PlayStation 4 Update 5.0 Officially Revealed", "image": "https://a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/os_64.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television"}, "id": "302838", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop music"}, "id": "303105", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Web browser"}, "id": "306026", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Playlist"}, "id": "307666", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playlist"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spotify"}, "id": "307723", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "First-person shooter"}, "id": "314284", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter"}, {"label": {"eng": "GameSpot"}, "id": "369518", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot"}, {"label": {"eng": "7.1 surround sound"}, "id": "371798", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental Control"}, "id": "378103", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_Control"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual surround"}, "id": "526394", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_surround"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation VR"}, "id": "1270845", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_VR"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 552, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 553, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Jewelry", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Jewelry"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 566, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Online"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1030, "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Associations", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Associations"}], "time": "00:45:00"}

I've already run some benchmark tests and its scores easily rival Samsung's Galaxy S8. In my experience so far, there's not much you can throw at this phone that it can't handle.\n\nThe 5.3-inch display is pin sharp, thanks to the ultra HD resolution (2,560x1,440 pixels) and it's bright enough to use under the midday sun.\n\nAround the back you'll find two cameras. One shoots in color, the other only in black and white -- good news if you love dramatic, moody portraits. They both have 13-megapixel resolutions and both shoot video in 4K. There's a 13-megapixel camera on the front, and thanks to some software trickery you can take photos with both the front and back camera to combine them into a single, split-screen image.\n\nI took the Nokia 8's camera for spin -- take a look through at the gallery to see how it performs.\n\nYou can also livestream that split-screen view directly to YouTube or Facebook. It's not a killer feature for me personally, but you'll enjoy this unique skill if you love sharing your whole life with the world.\n\nThat's all wrapped up in a really slick metal body with a highly polished finish. I think it looks extremely smart and elegant, although it is something of a fingerprint magnet.\n\nNokia says the phone is splash-proof, not waterproof, which is disappointing given that proper waterproofing is something we're now often seeing on top-end phones. On the upside, it has a fingerprint scanner on the front, a USB-C port and the latest version of Android Nougat on board.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will cost 599 euros when it goes on sale in September. The expected UK price is \u00a3599 and although there are currently no plans for it to reach the US or Australia yet, Nokia said that it's keen to sell the phone in both countries. For reference, 599 euros converts to around $700 or AU$900.\n\nNo, it's not a cheap phone, and that price puts it squarely in line with the Galaxy S8 (a phone with pretty much the same specs, on paper), which you can now pick up on Amazon for $575 in the US or \u00a3560 in the UK. In Australia you can find it for AU$899. Then there's the OnePlus 5, a superb Android phone that's also packed with top-notch tech and a brilliant dual camera system. It even won our coveted Editors' Choice award. The OnePlus costs even less at $479 in the US and \u00a3449 in the UK (AU$750, converted).\n\nWe'll have to wait to properly test the Nokia in our full review to decide on whether it's a wise purchase over the S8 or OnePlus 5. A price closer to or below $600, \u00a3500 or AU$750 would really help sweeten the deal. There's no question, however, that splashing that top-end cash will snag you a top-end phone that's absolutely worth considering, particularly if you have any sort of nostalgia for the Nokia name.", "id": "9595022", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia finally has a flagship Android phone and it's beautiful", "image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/08/17/a36191df-7991-485c-85f9-2d9cd6d04914/nokia-8-flagship-phone-01-cnet.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Amazon.com"}, "id": "305588", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}, "id": "308589", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultra high definition television"}, "id": "311780", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_definition_television"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint recognition"}, "id": "314740", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel"}, "id": "315167", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}, "id": "320018", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video camera"}, "id": "320042", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}, "id": "329085", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}], "time": "01:47:00"}

An HMD Global representative told Gadgets 360 that the smartphone is set to come to India in early October, and the price of the device for this region will be unveiled closer to launch date. The big highlight of the smartphone is its 'bothies' feature that allows you to use and even live stream from the front and rear cameras simultaneously.\n\nThe Nokia 8, positioned as a flagship device, is set to compete with a lot of Android smartphones out there. We've chosen popular ones powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 or a comparable chipset. That brought include the OnePlus 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphones that are doing quite well for their respective OEMs. We pit the Nokia 8 with the other two flagships to see if the HMD Global offering has an edge over the other two reigning champions or not.\n\nWith respect to price, the OnePlus 5 wins hands down with a price tag starting at Rs. 32,999. The Nokia 8 smartphone has been priced at EUR 599 (roughly Rs. 45,000), while the Samsung Galaxy S8 is priced at Rs. 57,900. Even the 128GB variant of the OnePlus 5 is cheaper than the other two at Rs. 37,999.\n\nTo recall, in the US, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is priced at $720 (roughly Rs. 46,700). OnePlus 5 prices in the US and select European regions for the variant with 6GB RAM, 64GB storage, and Slate Gray colour are $479 (roughly Rs. 31,000) and EUR 499 (roughly Rs. 35,900), respectively. The 8GB RAM + 128GB storage variant in Midnight Black paint job costs $539 (approximately Rs. 35,000), and EUR 559 (about Rs. 40,000) in the US and the select European markets, respectively. It is important to note that the Nokia 8's India price has not been revealed yet, so a fair comparison is not possible, and just a generic assumption can be made.\n\nWhile the OnePlus 5 and the Nokia 8 both sport a dual camera setup, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has a single camera setup at the back (loaded with features though). Samsung keeps its fingerprint scanner at the back, while the other two prefer to keep it in the front, underneath the home button. The biggest takeaway for Samsung is its stunning Infinity Display that makes the smartphone almost bezel-less and a real looker. The other two have sufficient bezels on the top and bottom chin. Lastly, when it comes to slimness, the OnePlus 5 wins at 7.25mm, while the Galaxy S8 is the thickest at 8mm.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has the smallest display at 5.3-inch, but OnePlus loses the battle in the resolution game. All the three smartphones are powered by the latest Snapdragon processor, though Samsung uses the Exynos 8895 variant in some regions like India. While Nokia and Samsung both offer 4GB of RAM, OnePlus takes it further to 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. Apart from the 64GB internal storage option that is available on all the three phones, the OnePlus 5 also has a 128GB variant up for grabs. Samsung and Nokia offer expandable memory slots though, while OnePlus prefers the Apple route in this case.\n\nPossibly the biggest buying decision is going to be the dual camera setup. While on paper, the OnePlus 5 looks strong with a telephoto lens in the mix, while the Nokia 8 uses one monochrome and one RGB sensor for improved contrast and colour accuracy. As we mentioned, the Nokia 8 also has a unique feature called 'bothies' i.e., the ability to capture images and videos from front and rear cameras at the same time. However, dual cameras or not, we cannot ascertain camera quality of any smartphone just by pure specifications comparison, and you'll have to await our review.\n\nThe OnePlus 5 has the biggest battery at 3300mAh, with the Nokia 8 bearing a 3090mAh battery, and the Samsung Galaxy S8 bearing a 3000mAh battery.\n\nOn the software front, all the three phones are neck to neck, currently running Android 7.1.1 Nougat. However, OnePlus has shown itself to be quite fickle with its own promises, and we'll have to wait and see just how many version updates beyond Android O will the OnePlus 5 receive. Nokia - or rather, Finnish startup HMD Global with the licence to the Nokia brand - is new in this space, and while it has been quick in providing security updates, we wonder just how frequent will version updates be for the four Nokia Android smartphones, and how long each device will be supported. Samsung on the other hand, while slow with updates, is steady, and provides version updates for flagships for roughly two years.\n\nNokia claims to offer pure, stock Android, while OnePlus has minor customisations built into OxygenOS, and Samsung has reduced bloatware in the past but still retains a level of customisation above and beyond stock Android.\n\nAs you can see, all the three phones compete neck to neck on paper, with camera and display being the only big differences between the two. Coming to price, the OnePlus 5 wins hands down for now, but we will have to wait and see the price tag attached to the Nokia 8 when it arrives in India. That, in our opinion, will be the biggest decision making factor for all consumers.", "id": "9676867", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 vs OnePlus 5 vs Samsung Galaxy S8: Price, Specifications Compared", "image": "https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/nokia8vsoneplusvsgalaxy_1502960957432.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "69", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint recognition"}, "id": "314740", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy Ace 3"}, "id": "325064", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Exynos (system on chip)"}, "id": "355361", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exynos_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bothy"}, "id": "541460", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothy"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 468, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "09:15:00"}

With version 5.0, owners can now configure those rules on a per child basis. And the update makes it possible for multiple adults to be part of a single family unit: a \"Family Manager\" can promote adults to a \"Parent/Guardian\" role, where they can then tweak the access levels of children's accounts.\n\nIf you've longed for a way to sort large friends lists by, say, just the ones in your Overwatch or Call of Duty clan, the update swaps \"Favorite Groups\" for a new \"Custom Lists\" view under \"Friends.\" You can still access groups here, but the new features allow you to create ad hoc lists drawing from your general friends list instead of by \"message groups.\"\n\nOn the video broadcast side, the good news is that the update adds support for Twitch video streaming at 1080p and 60 frames per second. (The current version only supports up to 720p at 60 frames per second.) The bad news? You'll need a PlayStation 4 Pro, the boutique $399 version of the PlayStation 4 Sony rolled out last November, to make it work -- regular PlayStation 4 users are stuck at the lower quality rate.\n\nOther features include tweaks to messaging, notifications and what you can see on your \"Quick Menu,\" the overlay summonable by holding the PlayStation button in the center of a gamepad. If you're rocking a PlayStation VR headset, the update also adds headphones support for both 5.1 and 7.1 channel virtual surround sound when watching Blu-ray or DVDs in \"Cinematic Mode.\"\n\nSony hasn't said when the 5.00 update will release to general owners, but notes that anyone who signed up for the beta and was chosen will receive an email explaining how to download the update and dive in.", "id": "9748980", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Here's Everything in Sony's Huge New PlayStation 4 Update", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/gettyimages-188091773.jpg?w=720", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Video"}, "id": "302573", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video game console"}, "id": "304421", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"}, {"label": {"eng": "Oda Nobunaga"}, "id": "304924", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oda_Nobunaga"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}, "id": "307034", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headphones"}, "id": "314741", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones"}, {"label": {"eng": "720p"}, "id": "322948", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Surround sound"}, "id": "333958", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}, "id": "340359", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitch (website)"}, "id": "349819", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(website)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gamepad"}, "id": "353140", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamepad"}, {"label": {"eng": "Portable media player"}, "id": "451293", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_media_player"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation VR"}, "id": "1270845", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_VR"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 116, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations and Age Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations_and_Age_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1096, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms"}], "time": "18:00:00"}

And/or pull consumers away from Huawei's flagships handsets -- or indeed the swathe of Chinese OEMs surging up the smartphone market share ranks.\n\nWith the Nokia 8, HMD is putting its flagship focus on content creators wanting to livestream video for their social feeds.\n\nCompetition in the Android OEM space has been fierce for years and there's no signs of any slack appearing so HDM faces a steep challenge to make any kind of dent here. But at least it now has an iron in the fire. As analyst CCS Insight notes, the handset will be \"hugely important in getting Nokia-branded smartphones back on the mobile phone map\".\n\nSpecs wise, the Nokia 8 runs the latest version of Android (Nougat 7.1.1) -- which HMD is touting as a \"pure Android experience\", akin to Google's Pixel handsets. (There's a not-so-gentle irony there, given Nokia's history in smartphones. But clearly HMD is going full in on Android.)\n\nOn the hardware front, there's a top end Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, plus 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal memory (expandable thanks to a MicroSD card slot). While the 5.3 inch ultra HD resolution display puts it on the verge of phablet territory -- and squarely within the current smartphone screen size sweet spot.\n\nAlso on board: dual rear cameras, both 13MP (one color, one B&W), and a 13MP front facing lens -- all with f/2.0; using Zeiss optics; and with support for 4K video.\n\nThe flagship camera feature -- and really phone feature too -- is the ability to livestream video from both front and back cameras simultaneously.\n\nHMD is trying to coin a hashtaggable word to describe this: \"bothie\" (as opposed to a selfie)...\n\nThis split screen camera feature can also be used for photos -- so they've basically reinvented Frontback. Well done.\n\n\"Content creators can natively broadcast their unique #Bothie stories to social media through the Dual-Sight functionality located within the camera app. Fans can also enjoy unlimited photo [<16MB in size] and video uploads to Google Photos,\" HMD writes.\n\nThis could prove a sticky feature for social media lovers -- perhaps especially the dual video option, which lets people share twin perspective video direct to Facebook and YouTube via the camera app.\n\nOr it could prove a passing fad, like Frontback. Time will tell. CCS Insight describes it as an \"interesting approach\" but also cautions on whether consumers will take to it.\n\nCommenting on the feature in a statement, HMD's Juho Sarvikas, chief product officer, said: \"We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media. People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own. It's these people who have inspired us.\"\n\nElsewhere on the device, there's a spatial surround sound recording tech that uses three microphones and is apparently drawing on Nokia's Ozo 360 camera division, plus USB type C charging port; a 3.5mm headphone jack; and a non-removable 3090 mAh battery.\n\nThe handset, which is clad in an aluminium unibody casing and has a fingerprint reader on the front for device unlocking and authentication, is described as splashproof rather than waterproof.\n\nGlobal RRP for the Nokia 8 is \u20ac599, with a rollout due to start in September.\n\nThere's a choice of four colors: Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue and Steel.", "id": "9679073", "details": {"liCnt": 6}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Android newbie HMD's Nokia 8 flagship lets

The smartphone will hit several markets in early September, though fans in India will have to wait till October to get their hands on the device. For those unaware, the Nokia 8 puts the camera front and centre, and the biggest camera innovation is the 'bothies' feature that allows users to capture videos and photos from both the front and rear cameras simultaneously. While the feature is certainly unique, the wait till October seems a little too long, and you are in the market for a high-end smartphone right now, you have other options to consider.\n\nNokia 8 Phone Targets Surging Demand for Live Video Streaming\n\nTo help you with your buying decision, we've chosen popular ones powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 or a comparable chipset, zeroing down to the OnePlus 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S8, which are doing quite well. We pit the Nokia 8 with the other two flagships to see if the HMD Global offering has an edge over the other two reigning champions or not.\n\nWith respect to price, the OnePlus 5 wins hands down with a price tag starting at Rs. 32,999. The Nokia 8 smartphone has been priced at EUR 599 (roughly Rs. 45,000), while the Samsung Galaxy S8 is priced at Rs. 57,900. Even the 128GB variant of the OnePlus 5 is cheaper than the other two at Rs. 37,999.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8 review\n\nTo recall, in the US, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is priced at $720 (roughly Rs. 46,700). OnePlus 5 prices in the US and select European regions for the variant with 6GB RAM, 64GB storage, and Slate Gray colour are $479 (roughly Rs. 31,000) and EUR 499 (roughly Rs. 35,900), respectively. The 8GB RAM + 128GB storage variant in Midnight Black paint job costs $539 (approximately Rs. 35,000), and EUR 559 (about Rs. 40,000) in the US and the select European markets, respectively. It is important to note that the Nokia 8's India price has not been revealed yet, so a fair comparison is not possible, and just a generic assumption can be made.\n\nWhile the OnePlus 5 and the Nokia 8 both sport a dual camera setup, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has a single camera setup at the back (loaded with features though). Samsung keeps its fingerprint scanner at the back, while the other two prefer to keep it in the front, underneath the home button. The biggest takeaway for Samsung is its stunning Infinity Display that makes the smartphone almost bezel-less and a real looker. The other two have sufficient bezels on the top and bottom chin. Lastly, when it comes to slimness, the OnePlus 5 wins at 7.25mm, while the Galaxy S8 is the thickest at 8mm.\n\nOnePlus 5 review\n\nThe Nokia 8 has the smallest display at 5.3-inch, but OnePlus loses the battle in the resolution game. All the three smartphones are powered by the latest Snapdragon processor, though Samsung uses the Exynos 8895 variant in some regions like India. While Nokia and Samsung both offer 4GB of RAM, OnePlus takes it further to 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. Apart from the 64GB internal storage option that is available on all the three phones, the OnePlus 5 also has a 128GB variant up for grabs. Samsung and Nokia offer expandable memory slots though, while OnePlus prefers the Apple route in this case.\n\nPossibly the biggest buying decision is going to be the dual camera setup. While on paper, the OnePlus 5 looks strong with a telephoto lens in the mix, while the Nokia 8 uses one monochrome and one RGB sensor for improved contrast and colour accuracy. As we mentioned, the Nokia 8 also has a unique feature called 'bothies' i.e., the ability to capture images and videos from front and rear cameras at the same time. However, dual cameras or not, we cannot ascertain camera quality of any smartphone just by pure specifications comparison, and you'll have to await our review.\n\nThe OnePlus 5 has the biggest battery at 3300mAh, with the Nokia 8 bearing a 3090mAh battery, and the Samsung Galaxy S8 bearing a 3000mAh battery.\n\nOn the software front, all the three phones are neck to neck, currently running Android 7.1.1 Nougat. However, OnePlus has shown itself to be quite fickle with its own promises, and we'll have to wait and see just how many version updates beyond Android O will the OnePlus 5 receive. Nokia - or rather, Finnish startup HMD Global with the licence to the Nokia brand - is new in this space, and while it has been quick in providing security updates, we wonder just how frequent will version updates be for the four Nokia Android smartphones, and how long each device will be supported. Samsung on the other hand, while slow with updates, is steady, and provides version updates for flagships for roughly two years.\n\nNokia claims to offer pure, stock Android, while OnePlus has minor customisations built into OxygenOS, and Samsung has reduced bloatware in the past but still retains a level of customisation above and beyond stock Android.\n\nAs you can see, all the three phones compete neck to neck on paper, with camera and display being the only big differences between the two.

Now, Sony Interactive Entertainment has officially unveiled what's set to be included in the patch, as select beta testers have today been given access to all of the forthcoming changes in the update that will incorporate a few big features, as well as some small refinements intending to improve the system's overall performance and functionality.\n\nSome of the enhancements on the way in the PS4's Update 5.0 focus on streaming while using the console's built-in broadcasting capabilities, as PS4 Pro users will be able to stream in 1080p and 60 FPS, provided their connection is strong enough, while PlayStation VR users will be able to see new messages and comments coming through while broadcasting. Additionally, PSVR will also be adding 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound support.\n\nAnother refinement being brought about in the PS4's Update is Sony's decision to give the Friends List greater management tools, such as the ability to set up separate lists of friends. Once the patch is in place, users will be able to create a list of all the people they wish to jump into their favorite multiplayer titles with like Overwatch or Destiny and send them all an invite, for example, with the feature replacing the old Favorite Groups tab.\n\nFurthermore, the Quick Menu is set to be updated to have more options after the PS4's Update 5.0 is implemented. For example, users will be able to check on download progress and see new party invites without having to leave a currently opened application to do so. Plus, one can also leave a party from within that menu and see their current Spotify playlist.\n\nThe PS4's Update 5.0 also intends to improve notifications when watching films and TV, as the patch enables the ability to disable message and other notification pop-ups while watching media. Not to mention, the refinements will also allowing one to change how much of a message is displayed - in addition to its color - when playing, experiencing, or watching any form of content on the console.\n\nFinally, and perhaps the most sizable change, is Sony's overhaul of the Parental Control features for PS4. Update 5.0 replaces the old Master/Sub account system by making one user the Family Manager, which gives them the ability to set up other accounts and categorize them as a Parent/Guardian, Adult, or Child. Parents or Guardians can restrict Child accounts in their \"use of online features and communication with other players,\" and put restrictions to games in place, inhibit the use of the Internet browser, and instill PlayStation Store spending limits. Perhaps most interestingly, though, is Sony's insistence on charging 50\u00a2 for the first time any North American user tries to set up an Adult account in order \"to verify that you are an adult.\"\n\nWhile it will be interesting to hear the feedback from Update 5.0's beta testers, it's important to note that PS4 consoles undergoing the firmware trial may experience \"unexpected issues,\" but Sony has assured fans that they can always downgrade the to current version of 4.73. With any luck, this latest patch will be able to lay the groundwork for some much-requested features and improvements for the system.\n\nThe PS4 is available now in a standard edition, as the PS4 Slim, and as the PS4 Pro.", "id": "9757716", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "PS4 Update 5.0 Contents Officially Confirmed", "image": "https://cdn.gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/ps4-update-50-contents.jpg.optimal.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television"}, "id": "302838", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video game console"}, "id": "304421", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"}, {"label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}, "id": "305704", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Web browser"}, "id": "306026", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spotify"}, "id": "307723", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify"}, {"label": {"eng": "Multiplayer video game"}, "id": "313088", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_video_game"}, {"label": {"eng": "First-person shooter"}, "id": "314284", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Firmware"}, "id": "345389", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware"}, {"label": {"eng": "7.1 surround sound"}, "id": "371798", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental Control"}, "id": "378103", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_Control"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Store"}, "id": "431033", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Store"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual surround"}, "id": "526394", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_surround"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation VR"}, "id": "1270845", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_VR"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony Interactive Entertainment"}, "id": "1283778", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 64, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 201, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems"}], "time": "18:58:00"}

For the most part, it's usually for the better. This time around, they've actually made it downright convenient. Though this update is currently only available for beta testers, the notes have been revealed. Here's our first look.\n\nOf the noteworthy changes, Sony included a new feature called \"Family\" on PSN. In sum, it allows for multiple adult/parent accounts that can manage sub-accounts. As the name indicates, it is ideally suited for parents looking to limit the accessibility of accounts belonging to children and/or other family members. Alternatively, the master account can give the parental status to someone else, and the individual can thus manage other sub-accounts.\n\nAnother feature being added to your PS4 is the ability to broadcast games. I assume this is different from SharePlay in that it allows multiple people to view your game playthroughs. Meanwhile, on the PS4 Pro, users can stream their content via Twitch at 1080p 60FPS.\n\nNotifications have become customizable. The firmware update will let you decide how pop-ups reach your screen: messages, updates, requests, etc. There's also the option to eliminate pop-ups altogether while playing video.\n\nAnd speaking of notifications, update 5.0 has made this feature quicker and easier to access. Notifications and downloads will now appear on the Quick Menu; this way you don't have to leave your game or application. Simply press and hold the PS button to view everything relevant.\n\nMore notes for PS4 Software Update 5.0 are available at the PlayStation Blog. An exact release date hasn't been revealed, but it may come soon.

It's the first Android phone to have the Nokia branding, which is exciting stuff - but the phone itself is really just par for what you'd expect from a modern flagship.\n\nAligning with the leaks, the Nokia 8 has a 5.3-inch display (2560 x 1440), and is powered by the same chip that's in the Samsung Galaxy S8 (at least, the ones that don't have Samsung's own Exynos processor), Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. It'll also sport 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. It'll come with a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 screen, along with a pretty decent-sized 3,090mAh battery and support for Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0.\n\nUnlike its competitors though, the screen appears to have a large bezel, skipping on the edge-to-edge, bezel-free stuff we see in phones from LG and Samsung. The whole thing seems a little...uninspired, without features like waterproofing, or wireless charging.\n\nIts big gimmick seems to be in its camera, which sports a dual 13MP dual-camera setup. One camera will do colour, while the other snaps in monochrome, allowing for some amazing post-snap editing. It'll also have a \"bothie\" mode, which besides its stupid naming could actually be useful. It engages both front and rear cameras so you'll be able to share \"both sides of the story.\" For vloggers, this'll be great to show what's happening while keeping their all-important narcissistic faces in shot too.\n\n\"Nokia 8 features a 13 MP dual image-fusion rear camera with both colour and monochrome sensors, plus a wide-angle 13 MP phase detection auto-focus front camera. Both front and rear cameras are equipped with ZEISS optics, meaning every snapshot moment becomes a story worth sharing.\"\n\nThe phone will also feature Nokia OZO spatial 360\u00b0 audio, which should make it a decent phone for recording audio. It'll also let you record video in 4K, and allows for microSD storage so you can actually save all of that footage. That same slot can be used as a second sim slot.\n\nJuho Sarvikas, Chief Product Officer of HMD Global, said: \"We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media. People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own. It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance.\"\n\nOur friends at Gearburn have confirmed that the device will be available in South Africa in September.

The smartphone comes with a price tag of EUR 599 ( Rs 45,000) and the brand will start selling the smartphone globally in September this year.\n\nAs for the Indian pricing and availability is concerned, the flagship will arrive before Diwali in October and it might bear a price tag of Rs 45,000. With this, HMD Global is all set to bank on the brand value that Nokia once carried. However, things are different now and it will be a difficult task for the brand to compete with other players that are offering some amazing specs around the same or less price tag. We have Honor 8 Pro and OnePlus 5, which comes loaded with some interesting specs and will surely make it difficult for Nokia to make a grand comeback. So, does the Nokia 8 has all the arsenal to beat the two interesting smartphones and become people's new favourite? Let's find out.\n\nAt a time, when most of the smartphone's design resemble each other, Nokia 8 stands out of the crowd quite easily. The smartphone does give a premium look and it comes in a 6000 series aluminium body, which surely adds some strength. Comparatively, OnePlus 5 takes a back seat as the device looks eerily similar to Apple iPhone 7 Plus. However, Honor still manages to give a distinct look and looks more elegant as compared to the OnePlus 5.\n\nBut which one is sleek? The answer is quite simple. Honor 8 Pro takes a lead in this department as the phone is 6.97mm thick as compared to OnePlus 5's (7.25mm thick) and Nokia 8 (7.9mm thick). If we get to choose between the three of them, then surely it would be Nokia 8 as the smartphone looks different and it comes with more colour options,(Polished Copper, Polished Blue, Tempered Blue and Steel) as compared to Honor 8 Pro (Navy Blue, Platinum Gold and Midnight Black) and OnePlus 5 (Slate Grey and Midnight Black).\n\nMoving on the display department, the Nokia 8 sports a 5.3-inch IPS QHD display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels which is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5. The Honor 8 Pro features a 5.7-inch QHD LTPS LCD display with a screen resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels and a pixel density of 515ppi. The OnePlus 5 uses the same display found in the OnePlus 3T including a 5.5-inch Full HD Optic AMOLED display with a screen resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels and a pixel density of 401ppi.\n\nThe real fight is in between the Nokia 8 and Honor 8 Pro as both the devices come with a Quad HD display. However, it is too early to comment on the display of the Nokia 8, but on papers, the smartphone seems to be a more interesting option when compared to the Honor 8 Pro. But that doesn't mean that Honor 8 Pro display is not up to the mark. It offers some bright and vivid colours and we faced no issues during our review.\n\nOn the hardware front, all three of them packs some top-of-the-lines specs. The Nokia 8 and OnePlus 5 are powered by the same octa-core (Four 2.5GHz Kryo + Four 1.8GHz Kryo) Snapdragon 835 processor. The Nokia 8 is backed by a 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, which can be further expanded up to 256GB via microSD card. The OnePlus 5, on the other hand, comes in two RAM and storage configurations: 6GB RAM+64GB and 8GB+128GB but doesn't have an expandable memory slot.\n\nThe Honor 8 Pro is powered by company's in-house Kirin 960 octa-core processor clocked at 2.4GHz and is backed by a 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, which can be further expanded up to 128GB via microSD card slot.\n\nThis is where it gets real close. Though the OnePlus 5 and Honor 8 Pro comes loaded with similar RAM (keeping the 6GB RAM variant in mind), Nokia 8 takes a back seat here. However, it is too earlier to comment on the computing power of Nokia 8, but coupled with pure Android experience, it surely give a tough fight to both the smartphones.\n\nOn the software front, all three of them run on the latest Android Nougat. Interestingly, the Nokia 8 runs on pure stock Android 7.1.1 Android Nougat OS and the company promises to offer the latest updates to its users without any delay. The brand has also tied up with Google to offer free unlimited high-quality storage in Google Photos. Honor 8 Pro has EMUI 5.1 running on top of it, while OnePlus 5 runs on Oxygen OS. All three of them have a different user interface to offer. Those who are in love pure stock Android experience will go for the Nokia 8, while those who love little tweaks can opt for OnePlus 5. But those who are willing to use a completely different flavour of Android can go for the Honor 8 Pro.\n\nThis is where the competition gets really intense. All three devices sport a dual-camera setup. The Nokia 8 features dual 13-megapixel setup at the back powered by ZEISS optics. The primary dual-lens camera includes 13-megapixels (Colour + OIS) along with 13-megapixels (Mono) sensors with dual-tone Flash with an aperture of f/2.0, 76.9\u02da, PDAF and IR range finder. The Honor 8 Pro has a combination of two 12-megapixel sensors out of which one is used to capture RGB, while the other is used to capture monochrome images. The smartphone also supports 4K recording at 30 frames per second. On the other hand, the OnePlus 5 has a 16-megapixel sensor with f/1.7 aperture, Sony IMX398 sensor and a 20-megapixel telephoto lens with aperture f/2.6.\n\nSo, the question here is, who sports a better camera? On paper, OnePlus 5 camera specs look more tempting as compared to the one used in Honor 8 Pro and Nokia 8, but, the camera performance of the OnePlus 5 has been already criticised in most of the reviews. On the other hand, Honor has a pretty clean record when it comes to the camera performance. Whether it be Honor 8 or Honor 8 Lite, both the smartphones were praised for the camera and implementation of the dual camera setup was pretty interesting. Same can be expected for Honor 8 Pro.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has Zeiss branding, which itself makes it pretty intense competition. This coupled with some interesting camera tricks, makes it even more tempting. The Nokia 8 allows users to shoot with both front and rear cameras in Facebook Live and YouTube Live videos. Also, there is a Boothie mode which enables both front and back cameras simultaneously for split-screen photos and video. OnePlus is already accused of not giving a proper 2x optical zoom, despite boasting heavily about and performance is not up to the mark, according to different reviews. So, we leave this round for you to decide.\n\nOn the battery front, the Honor 8 Pro sports a 4000mAh battery, while the OnePlus 5 is juiced up by a 3300mAh battery and the Nokia 8 gets its power from a 3090mAh battery. The OnePlus 5 has its Dash Charge technology, which can quickly charge up the device for a full day of use, while the Honor 8 Pro sports a Smart Power 5.0 prolong the battery life by 2-3 hours as compared to 4.0 version. However, there is no mention about any quick charging support for the Nokia 8. Interestingly, Honor 8 Pro wins this round as it boasts a better battery backup as compared to the OnePlus 5 and Nokia 8.\n\nTo wrap up, all three smartphones come loaded with some top-of-the-lines specs and gives a neck and neck competition to each other. Nokia 8 has an upper hand when it comes to design and camera department, while on the other hand, Honor 8 Pro packs some interesting internals and smooth performance. The OnPlus 5 also offers decent performance but has been embroiled in controversies. It becomes a momentum task to choose the best out of three and it would be interesting to see th Indian pricing of the Nokia 8 and how well it performs against the two popular smartphones.", "id": "9648255", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia 8 vs Honor 8 Pro vs OnePlus 5: Which one will be people's new favourite?", "image": "https://www.themobileindian.com/resizer.php?src=/public/uploads/news/2017/08/18806/nokia-honor-oneplus.jpg&w=735&h=425", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graphics display resolution"}, "id": "312179", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel density"}, "id": "317242", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook features"}, "id": "332330", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_features"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google Photos"}, "id": "468906", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasa"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}, {"label": {"eng": "OxygenOS"}, "id": "1272001", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OxygenOS"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 468, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 690, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1024, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics"}], "time": "09:04:00"}

In February HMD unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, priced at 139 euros ($163) and 189 euros respectively.\n\nJuho Sarvikas, HMD's chief product officer, said now was \"the perfect time\" to introduce the model, which he describes as a flagship product. The phone will feature a \"dual-sight\" photo and video function, in which images from the front and rear cameras will be displayed simultaneously on a split screen. HMD describes the feature as \"less Selfie, more Bothie\".\n\nHMD had chosen to release cheaper models first because 50 percent of global demand was for phones costing between 100 euros and 250 euros, Sarvikas said in an interview. \"We wanted to start there, where we know that we are highly relevant with our proposition. We're very eager to enter the flagship segment as well.\"\n\nThe new device has Zeiss cameras, after HMD said in July that it had signed a partnership with the group, part of the German optics company Carl Zeiss AG.\n\nThe launch comes as Apple prepares to launch a new iPhone and Samsung rolls out its new Galaxy Note 8. Sarvikas said by phone that HMD was \"less concerned about competition; we're here to design for the consumers.\"\n\nDemand for the redesigned 3310 feature phone, unveiled in February, had been \"very strong.\" Sarvikas was unable to share detailed sales figures but said HMD had sold \"millions\" of smartphones and \"tens of millions\" of feature phones - of which the 3310 is just one model.", "id": "9577954", "details": {"liCnt": 29}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "With a New Smartphone, Nokia-Maker Takes on Apple and Samsung", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iyWcNW0LMV5E/v0/1200x800.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head-mounted display"}, "id": "308313", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-mounted_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aktiengesellschaft"}, "id": "311013", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiengesellschaft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy Note (original)"}, "id": "321823", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Note_(original)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Core product"}, "id": "349805", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_product"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss"}, "id": "565067", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data"}], "time": "18:33:00"}

There's a heavy emphasis on how players manage their friends and families while using their PS4. A new 'Family' system rejigs the old master/sub-account hierarchy and allows for tailored parental controls for individual users, and a 'Custom Lists' option replaces the old Favourite Groups to allow players to design their own lists based on individual preferences.\n\nThere's also plenty of love for those who like to broadcast their gaming, with the previously-rumoured Twitch update confirmed. 1080p 60fps streaming is now supported on Twitch for those who own a PS4 Pro. In addition, broadcasts can now be directly linked to communities, and spectator comments can now be made visible in VR mode, allowing broadcasters to connect more easily with their viewers. VR players also get the added bonus of new support for 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound when watching DVDs or Blu-rays in cinematic mode.\n\nThere are also some general ease of use improvements - music can now be directly shared in a message, allowing recipients to open the song on their PS4 or mobile device, and Notifications becoming more easily accessible through the Quick Menu. There's now also an option to turn off pop-up notifications while watching TV or other video content, as well as disabling message previews.\n\nMatt Davidson is a freelance writer for IGN who hasn't got an invitation but that's fine he didn't want one anyway.

Will it catch on?\n\nAlmost everyone is partial to an occasional selfie but getting the perfect shot can take a vast amount of care and precision. Yet, in all the postulating and pondering around the selfie's composition, have you ever wondered what it would be like to take a photo with your phone's front and rear camera at the same time? No. Me neither.\n\nHowever, someone at HMD Global, the Finnish firm behind the rejuvenated Nokia brand, thought it would be a good idea. In doing so, the company coined the dual image as a \"bothie\" and incorporated the feature into its new flagship phone.\n\nThe Nokia 8 was unveiled last night at an event in London and is the highest-end Nokia handset that HMD has produced to date. Earlier this year it revealed the Nokia 6 and the incredibly hyped revamp of the 3310. The Nokia 8 is its attempt to take on Apple and Samsung. There's a 5.3-inch screen, 4GB of RAM, 64GB storage, a Snapdragon 835 processor and a 3090 mAh battery. More significant than all of that, perhaps, is HMD's decision to use a completely un-skinned version of the Android operating system.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will be available from late September and cost around \u20ac599 (\u00a3549).\n\nWhat HMD hopes will set the phone apart from other similar devices is the \"bothie\". As such it's targeting the device at 'creators' - the YouTubers and Instagramers of the world. Despite the unfortunate moniker, there's some sense to being able to use the 13MP front and rear cameras at the same time. As well as taking selfies, it's also possible to livestream both views at once.\n\nHMD isn't the first to have had this idea though. There are a number of apps, both for iPhone and Android that do the same thing. What HMD has done is introduced the feature natively, which could be copied by other manufacturers fairly simply.\n\nOr, the bothie could just be another gimmick that's trying to set a phone apart from an endlessly monochrome competition. Earlier this year, HTC introduced its U11 that could open apps with a squeeze; its EVO 4G, back in 2012, included a built-in kickstand that didn't catch on.\n\nSamsung's Galaxy Beam phone incorporated a projector into the top of the device - something that was a challenge for both users and battery life. Yotaphone's two screen display (LCD one on the front and an e-ink display on the rear) also failed to kickstart a mobile revolution. And, who can forget the Moto X's wrist shake to unlock and take selfies?", "id": "9657359", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia's 'bothie' is yet another attempt to redefine the phone", "image": "https://wi-images.condecdn.net/image/g8wQbeLXmEr/crop/1323/landscape", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "69", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Core product"}, "id": "349805", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_product"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC Evo 4G"}, "id": "894428", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Evo_4G"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc. v.

As expected, the stock Android handset is indeed called the Nokia 8 and it's setting itself up as a worthy rival to the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8's of the world.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is a bit more affordable as compared to those two, but it still comes in at a hefty EUR 599 (roughly $706 or Rs 45320). Its metal unibody has been constructed out of 6000 series aluminum and features a unique heat management system that uses a copper pipe with a graphite shield to make sure heat is dissipated evenly.\n\nHMD Global is placing a heavy emphasis on a photography tool called Dual-Sight. The mode lets users shoot from both the front and back cameras simultaneously for split-screen photos and videos AKA Bothies. It's not a bad idea, though there is the question of the disparity in quality since rear cameras are usually better equipped than the front.\n\nIn the case of the Nokia 8, the back plays host to two 13MP Carl Zeiss lenses consisting of a color + monochrome setup that's enhanced by 1.12\u00b5m pixels, 4K video recording, an aperture of f/2.0, OIS, PDAF, and dual-LED flash. There's a 13MP snapper on the flip side as well, boasting of the same 1.12\u00b5m pixels, f/2.0 aperture, and PDAF.\n\nAlso See: Nokia 5 set to go up for sale on August 15\n\nA lot of phones have dual cameras these days, which means the Nokia 8 needs something unique to set it apart from the others. The company's betting on its own OZO spatial 360-degree audio technology to do so. The tool utilizes 3 microphones to capture surround sound, making the audio more immersive than most smartphone recordings.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will begin its global journey in September. It's set to hit India in early October.

It features a physical home button with inbuilt fingerprint scanner just below the display, a USB-C charging and connection port and incredibly tactile physical volume and on/off buttons on right hand side which click loudly when you apply pressure to them.\n\nThe two rear-facing cameras are positioned vertically in the top-centre of the back, and are almost flush with the body (take note Apple, HTC, Samsung et al).\n\nThe screen is bright and sharp, and, crucially, is displaying stock pure Android 7.0, which (in my opinion) is without a doubt the best version of Android. It's swift, uncluttered and functional, just like Google's own Pixel before it.\n\nNOKIA 8 SPECS\n\n5.3-inch 2560 x 1440 display\n\nOne front-facing, two rear-facing 13MP camera\n\n64GB storage, up to 256GB with microSD card\n\n4GB RAM\n\nRuns Google's Android Nougat software\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor\n\nInbuilt cooling system thanks to an internal copper pipe and graphite shield\n\nFour finishes: polished blue, tempered blue, steel and polished copper\n\nThe Nokia 8's most outstanding feature is its excellent 13MP single front-facing and two rear-facing cameras, produced in partnership with optics company Zeiss. The rear lenses sport optical image stabilisation, to reduce motion blur, and is designed to combat poor performance in low light conditions. The cameras are powerful, producing incredibly detailed images which are true-to-life without falling into the over-saturation trap many of its rivals fall victim to.\n\nThe best part is its dual-sight feature, which enables you to record or capture images using both front and rear cameras simultaneously. Selecting the dual mode from within the camera app provides you with a split-screen visualisation of your own face and what's immediately in front of you: a feature that Samsung, LG and other have had a go at but never really cracked.\n\nI tested it on myself and a landscape view of the river Thames, and a combination of a selfie and a friend - something Nokia is pushing as a 'bothie'. Cringe-worthy name aside, it's easy to use and should be a big hit among the influencer and creative crowd Nokia is squarely targeting here.\n\nEarly verdict\n\nNokia has set itself an enormous challenge in looking to take on the major players at their own game, particularly when the Pixel, Galaxy and Sony's Xperia ranges have all gone to great lengths to position themselves as the go-to handsets for exceptional cameras. However, the beauty of the Nokia 8 lies in its simplicity. It's a slick, stylish device which looks fantastic, and appears to run like a dream. However, its future success could very much hinge on how the company chooses to translate that \u20ac599 into pounds when it goes on sale in early September - a straight \u00a3599 conversion pits it directly against the iPhone 7, which may prove a bridge too far for the discerning phone buyer. But on first impressions, the Nokia 8 is a breath of fresh air in an increasingly stale Android line up.", "id": "9596783", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Hands on with the Nokia 8: how it feels and what it looks like", "image": "https://1k95i3bqziq3bboq03r87f8x-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_5058.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Steel"}, "id": "302732", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Copper"}, "id": "306629", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "LG Corp"}, "id": "307493", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint recognition"}, "id": "314740", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}, "id": "320018", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony Xperia"}, "id": "324361", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Xperia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nougat"}, "id": "329104", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nougat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chocolate bar"}, "id": "344043", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_bar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 255, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 521, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1059, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Biometrics", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Biometrics"}], "time": "23:02:00"}

I've already run some benchmark tests and its scores easily rival Samsung's Galaxy S8. In my experience so far, there's not much you can throw at this phone that it can't handle.\n\nThe 5.3-inch display is pin sharp, thanks to the ultra HD resolution (2,560\u00d71,440 pixels) and it's bright enough to use under the midday sun.\n\nAround the back you'll find two cameras. One shoots in color, the other only in black and white -- good news if you love dramatic, moody portraits. They both have 13-megapixel resolutions and both shoot video in 4K. There's a 13-megapixel camera on the front, and thanks to some software trickery you can take photos with both the front and back camera to combine them into a single, split-screen image.\n\nI took the Nokia 8's camera for spin -- take a look through at the gallery to see how it performs.\n\nYou can also livestream that split-screen view directly to YouTube or Facebook. It's not a killer feature for me personally, but you'll enjoy this unique skill if you love sharing your whole life with the world.\n\nThat's all wrapped up in a really slick metal body with a highly polished finish. I think it looks extremely smart and elegant, although it is something of a fingerprint magnet.\n\nNokia says the phone is splash-proof, not waterproof, which is disappointing given that proper waterproofing is something we're now often seeing on top-end phones. On the upside, it has a fingerprint scanner on the front, a USB-C port and the latest version of Android Nougat on board.\n\nThe Nokia 8 will cost 599 euros when it goes on sale in September. The expected UK price is \u00a3599 and although there are currently no plans for it to reach the US or Australia yet, Nokia said that it's keen to sell the phone in both countries. For reference, 599 euros converts to around $700 or AU$900.\n\nThe phone is not the cheap one, and its price puts it squarely in line with the Galaxy S8 (a phone with pretty much the same specs, on paper), which you can now pick up on Amazon for $575 in the US or \u00a3560 in the UK. In Australia you can find it for AU$899. Then there's the OnePlus 5, a superb Android phone that's also packed with top-notch tech and a brilliant dual camera system.", "id": "9697529", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nokia finally has a flagship Android phone and it's beautiful", "image": "http://aaj.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/no.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}, "id": "308589", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}, "id": "308709", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultra high definition television"}, "id": "311780", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_definition_television"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint recognition"}, "id": "314740", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel"}, "id": "315167", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}, "id": "320018", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video camera"}, "id": "320042", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}, "id": "329085", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Livestream"}, "id": "363344", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestream"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB Type-C"}, "id": "1270770", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_Type-C"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "13:28:00"}

The software update brings PS4's system to version 5.0 and it includes a bunch of new features which enhance the console's user experience. Nonetheless, the update is being rolled out OTA (over the air) right now and PS4 owners are encouraged to download it as soon as possible.\n\nNew Features\n\nFirst off, the most important feature that's included in the PS4 5.0 system software update is the new family management system. The new feature has been especially designed to make it easier for adults and guardians to set up PlayStation Network accounts for their kids. This is quite important since it gives adults the ability to customize the parental control settings and choose the type of content that's available for their kids.\n\nCustom Friends Lists\n\nAnother great feature that comes alongside the 5.0 system software update gives players the ability to create custom friends lists. This means that PS4 players will be able to create a list that's specific for their Destiny 2 teammates as an example. According to Sony, this feature was created with one purpose in mind and that's to make it easier for PS4 players to send out raid invites without being forced to scroll through their friends list.\n\nPS4 Pro 1080 60FPS Broadcasting\n\nLive streaming is one of the most popular entertainment platforms right now and Sony knows that too well. This is why Sony wants to capitalize on PS4 Pro's capabilities and will allow players to broadcast live in full HD 1080 resolution at 60 frames per second. Moreover, streamers will also be able to pin their community to the broadcast with one simple tap. Things get even better for streamers since a new setting makes it possible for them to read spectators comments while they are in VR mode.", "id": "9899409", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "PS4 Receives Major System 5.0 Beta Version Update Which Contains Many Awesome Features", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/gigjets.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/PS4-Receives-Major-System-5.0-Beta-Version-Update-Which-Contains-Many-Awesome-Features.jpg?fit=300%2C169", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video game console"}, "id": "304421", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"}, {"label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}, "id": "305704", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}, "id": "307034", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "System software"}, "id": "396377", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental controls"}, "id": "398807", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 64, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 349, "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Technology", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Technology"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 402, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Tools and Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Tools_and_Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 413, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 510, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 821, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific"}], "time": "05:53:00"}

That's what HMD told us and we think is a perfect description for this dual-eyed Finn. Any story that stars Carl Zeiss is one we'll listen to, but let's start at the beginning.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has a 5.3\" IPS LCD display on the front with QHD resolution and a blinding 700nits of max brightness. 2.5D Gorilla Glass 5 curves into the phone's metal shell, which is milled out of 6000 series aluminum. The phone measures 7.9mm at the thickest point and has basic resistance to the elements with an IP54 rating.\n\nThe optical engineers at Zeiss helped make the lens for both the rear and the front cameras. The main camera features two 13MP sensors (color + monochrome) with 1.12\u00b5m pixels and an f/2.0 aperture. The color camera has optical image stabilization (OIS) and there is Laser autofocus and a dual LED flash to help in the dark.\n\nThe selfie camera is one-eyed, but otherwise similar - 13MP sensor (1.12\u00b5m pixels) with an f/2.0 aperture and phase detection autofocus. The phone can livestream split-screen footage from the front and back cameras to YouTube and Facebook, something HMD calls Dual-Sight.\n\nNokia 8: Polished Blue * Steel\n\nOZO - Nokia's camera division - co-developed the 360\u00b0 spatial surround audio recording, which will capture sound with a quality to match the sharp 4K video imagery. A rare feature, binaural audio, will give your viewers and even more immersive experience. The powerful Snapdragon 835 chipset handles all the necessary processing.\n\nHMD partnered with Google to make Google Photos the default gallery app on the phone. You'll get unlimited photo and video storage in the cloud, to bolster the 64GB built-in memory (there's a microSD slot if you prefer to keep things offline).\n\nNokia 8: Tempered Blue * Polished Copper\n\nThe Nokia 8 will start selling globally in September at a price of \u0080600, which is steep but par for the course on a flagship smartphone. Pure Android (7.1 at launch) will allow HMD to breeze through major software updates, though the time frame for Android O is still under wraps.", "id": "9564621", "details": {"gpCnt": 13}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 announced: its dual camera boasts Zeiss lens and OZO audio", "image": "http://cdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/17/08/nokia-8-announcement/-728x314/gsmarena_001.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sound recording and reproduction"}, "id": "302809", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}, "id": "308589", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}, "id": "311787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel"}, "id": "315167", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}, "id": "315860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aperture (mollusc)"}, "id": "317238", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture_(mollusc)"}, {"label": {"eng": "MicroSD"}, "id": "329065", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital#microSD"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gastropod shell"}, "id": "340580", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastropod_shell"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lens (optics)"}, "id": "343602", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Finnish language"}, "id": "353407", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}, "id": "368054", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "IP Code"}, "id": "405233", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code"}, {"label": {"eng": "2.5D"}, "id": "422764", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.5D"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google Photos"}, "id": "468906", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasa"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1380, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques and Styles", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques_and_Styles"}], "time": "21:06:00"}

Arguably none of its new elements are as big of a deal as the ones in the most recent major update, v4.50, which added features like support for USB external storage.\n\nChief among the new items in the v5.0 update is an overhaul of the way that Sony handles parental controls. Under the current system, a parent can use their own \"master account\" to create \"sub accounts\" for up to six family members under 18. However, any parental controls -- such as preventing access to games based on their ESRB rating -- apply to all users on the same console, including adults.\n\nSony is looking to replace that system in PS4 v5.0 with \"Family on PlayStation Network.\" With the new setup, the PSN will allow multiple adults to be part of the same \"family.\" The original account holder, the \"family manager,\" will be able to promote another adult in the family to the position of \"parent/guardian,\" and then both individuals will be able to adjust parental controls. In addition, the new system will let adults customize parental controls for each child account in the family.\n\nAnother major area of focus in the upcoming firmware update is friends management and notifications. Sony is adding a long-awaited setting: the ability to disable notification pop-ups during video playback -- an option that has been available on Xbox 360 for ages, and was added to Xbox One less than a year after the console's launch. Users will also be able to customize the color of the pop-up windows, and enable a privacy mode for PSN message pop-ups that hides their sender and content. In addition, notifications will be accessible from the Quick Menu, allowing players to easily check in on download progress and party invites.\n\nOn the friends side, PS4 v5.0 replaces the friends page's existing Favorite Groups tab with a feature that allows users to group their PSN friends into customized lists. Looking to quickly find out if your Destiny 2 buddies are online? Set up a list with them on it!\n\nFor PlayStation 4 Pro owners, the v5.0 update will enable broadcasting games via Twitch at 60 frames per second in 1080p resolution. Assuming that Sony releases the new firmware to everybody soon, that will be a fast turnaround: Twitch only added support for 1080p60 streaming at the end of March. Check out the full PlayStation Blog post for further details on the v5.0 update, which is codenamed \"Nobunaga.\"\n\nAccess to beta testing for the v5.0 firmware is invite-only; Sony began taking sign-ups about a month ago, when it said it planned to begin the beta in \"early August.\"", "id": "9808937", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Here are the new features in the PS4's v5.0 firmware beta", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MBRPjmyloZFcXn6hk2GnxnHBl9I=/0x250:2400x1600/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56246381/playstation_logo_buttons_photo_2400.0.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Video"}, "id": "302573", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop music"}, "id": "303105", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Powerstar Golf"}, "id": "304419", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video game console"}, "id": "304421", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}, "id": "307034", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Xbox 360"}, "id": "312031", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "Privacy mode"}, "id": "313604", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_mode"}, {"label": {"eng": "Firmware"}, "id": "345389", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitch (website)"}, "id": "349819", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(website)"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 3 system software"}, "id": "395526", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_system_software"}, {"label": {"eng": "System software"}, "id": "396377", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental controls"}, "id": "398807", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls"}, {"label": {"eng": "Entertainment Software Rating Board"}, "id": "490972", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 64, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 137, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1096, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms"}], "time": "22:24:00"}

Which is like, so hot right now.\n\nIt even has three 13MP cameras which can all be used at the same time to capture a \"bothie\" or images from both sides of the camera, if you're opposed to cringey marketing speak.\n\nThere's even OZO audio capture, which uses three mics to record immersive sounding 360-degree audio. Perfect when you're at a gig or party.\n\nIt's no secret these features are designed to appeal to a young, millennial audience, and hey, there's nothing wrong with that! It's about time smartphones became a bit more 'trendy' and 'hip'.\n\nThe good news is, this seems like a solid phone and you don't have to be a millennial to get the best out of it! Best of all, the Nokia 8 only cost \u20ac699 (around \u00a3550).\n\nImage 1 of 4\n\nImage 2 of 4\n\nImage 3 of 4\n\nImage 4 of 4\n\nAnd seriously, read more in our hands on Nokia 8 review.", "id": "9596837", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "The Nokia 8 is the flagship smartphone for trendy young people", "image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HSZukbtdiQdgzdBBZFTf4T-1200-80.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brand"}, "id": "302722", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flagship"}, "id": "320976", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Corporate jargon"}, "id": "387445", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_jargon"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 65, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 116, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations and Age Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations_and_Age_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 407, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Consulting", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Consulting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "18:37:00"}

It ships with 64GB of internal storage which can be expanded with microSD memory cards.\n\nAccording to HMD, the phone is meant for \"content producers\" - not meaning people who write blogs for living, but people who use social media actively and post lot of a/v content to net. This means that HMD has made an extra effort to make sure all the audio and video features of the phone are on par with the top models in the market.\n\nBoth, front and rear camera can record video and capture still images at the same time without video recording suffering from this. Both cameras can be operated at the same time and can be viewed on screen simultaneously. To enhance the \"multi-dimensional\" video recording, Nokia 8 also supports Nokia OZO surround audio recording.\n\nRear camera is a dual 13Mpix camera - the other one capturing black and white spectre and other one capturing colors, a similar solution to the one Huawei has used in its recent flagship models. Furthermore, the front camera has a 13Mpix sensor.\n\nEstimated global pricing is set at around \u20ac559 / $658. Availability should be \"soon\", but HMD didn't reveal exact dates.

Code-named Nobunaga, this patch introduces a host of tweaks and new features, including smart improvements to the Quick Menu and the system's media viewing capabilities.\n\nThe update will allow users to disable pop-up notifications while the console is playing a movie or a television show, eliminating and potential distractions at a crucial moment. There is also a new option to turn off message previews in favor of a generic new message notification, as well as a choice between light and dark color schemes for the actual notification pop-up.\n\nThe Quick Menu has been outfitted with a couple of helpful additions, like a small system clock readout and the option to leave the current party. The notifications section of the menu now gives an at-a-glance readout of download progress and party invites, too.\n\nThe Friends List is also being adjusted, with the Favorite Groups tab being replaced by Custom Lists, allowing players to give themselves easy access to players they often call upon to play specific games. Update 5.0 also provides a quick way of exiting several different messaging groups at once and introduces the option to share music via the system's messaging app.\n\nThe PlayStation 4's broadcasting capabilities has received some attention too as 1080p, 60fps Twitch streaming is now supported on the Pro model. Additionally, communities can now be bound to a broadcast, adding a link to the community page from the spectator screen and there is a new option to view spectator comments while broadcasting while wearing a virtual reality helmet.\n\nSony is also making some big changes to the way master and sub-accounts work, streamlining this functionality under PSN Family. Multiple adult users can be part of the same family and now there is more granular control over what kind of parental controls are set for each member of the family, which is handy if children are at different ages and need to be able to access different content.\n\nFinally, there is a new tournament bracket viewer and Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Romanian, Thai, and Vietnamese have all been added as system language options.\n\nAnyone who was accepted into the Update 5.0 beta should receive an email with instructions on how to download it.", "id": "9763328", "details": {"pinCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "PlayStation 4 beta update lets users disable pop-ups in media apps", "image": "https://icdn5.digitaltrends.com/image/sony-playstation-4-pro-0010-510x0.jpg?ver=1", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Music"}, "id": "302636", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sony"}, "id": "302846", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television program"}, "id": "303532", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4 system software"}, "id": "304364", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video game console"}, "id": "304421", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "1080p"}, "id": "307033", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}, "id": "307034", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}, "id": "312033", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitch (website)"}, "id": "349819", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(website)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parental controls"}, "id": "398807", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 26, "label": "dmoz/Computers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 116, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations and Age Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations_and_Age_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 201, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1096, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms"}], "time": "15:06:00"}

Twitch streamers rejoice. By Matt Davidson\n\nAfter opening registrations last month, Sony has announced in a blog post that invitations are being sent out for successful applicants to the latest system update beta test, detailing key features in the process.\n\nPS4 System Software Update 5.00 (codenamed Nobunaga) makes a variety of changes across the board. There's a heavy emphasis on how players manage their friends and families while using their PS4. A new 'Family' system rejigs the old master/sub-account hierarchy and allows for tailored parental controls for individual users, and a 'Custom Lists' option replaces the old Favourite Groups to allow players to design their own lists based on individual preferences.\n\nThe new Family System.\n\nThere's also plenty of love for those who like to broadcast their gaming, with the previously-rumoured Twitch update confirmed. 1080p 60fps streaming is now supported on Twitch for those who own a PS4 Pro. In addition, broadcasts can now be directly linked to communities, and spectator comments can now be made visible in VR mode, allowing broadcasters to connect more easily with their viewers. VR players also get the added bonus of new support for 5.1ch and 7.1ch virtual surround sound when watching DVDs or Blu-rays in cinematic mode.\n\nThere are also some general ease of use improvements - music can now be directly shared in a message, allowing recipients to open the song on their PS4 or mobile device, and Notifications becoming more easily accessible through the Quick Menu.

It's a composite shot from both cameras on your phone, showing both you and whatever else is out there. It's a bothie.\n\nCrazy idea? Maybe. And yet, if history is any indication, you'll scoff at the bothie now and then while you're not looking they will take over the world.\n\nNow, allow me to introduce you to The Bothie Phone. Technically, it's called the Nokia 8. Either way it's the first flagship phone from HMD Global, the Finnish company that now owns the Nokia smartphone name. The Nokia 8, in addition to its Bothie-ness, offers most of the trappings of a good phone: 4 gigs of RAM, 64 gigs of storage, brand-spankin'-new processor, crisp 5.3-inch screen, pure Android. It's not waterproof and it doesn't have a tiny bezel, but it does have some of the standard Nokia design flair. It's a clean, slim, softly rounded device that comes in a bunch of cool colors, like blue and orange. It does all the things a good phone should.\n\nBut its bothie-bilities set the 8 apart. At least, HMD Global hopes so. The company made the camera rig with the help of longtime Nokia partner Carl Zeiss, and made the phone for the YouTubers and Instagrammers of the world. The phone has three cameras: two 13-megapixel sensors on the back, one color and one monochrome, and another 13-megapixel shooter on the front. Even the audio has been tuned for 360-degree sound. You can fire up the camera, switch to dual-sight mode, and either capture or livestream both views from your device. Viewers will see a split-screen live feed on YouTube or Facebook, so make sure you don't absent-mindedly pick your nose or anything.\n\nSuch camera-melding techniques are hardly new. The app Frontback offered a similar effect, albeit a more manual one. Samsung, for a while, let you snap a selfie and then drop it into the frame of a photo. You could also make the case that 360 photos are bothies and then some. (Everythingies?) In theory, the feature offers a way to be part of a scene without interrupting it. And since it's right next to the most important buttons in your camera app, HMD hopes you'll make it part of your social routine.\n\nThe Nokia 8 won't be available in the US, which will surely disappoint at least a few creators. It'll be available in Europe and elsewhere for about 599 euros, which puts the 8 into nearly the top tier of smartphones everywhere. That's a lot of pressure to put on the 8's camera, its only truly unique feature. HMD's smart to emphasize the camera, which has become more and more important to all smartphone users in the Snapchat and Instagram era. But if people do like the feature, other manufacturers and developers can likely copy it quickly. Still, HMD had to make phones for someone, and it picked people who love selfies. That might be the biggest market of them all.", "id": "9544922", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia's New Phone Ushers In the Unfortunate Era of the 'Bothie'", "image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/59938d9be6274631de40ae87/2:1/w_2500,c_limit/Nokia-FA.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bothy"}, "id": "541460", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia Lumia 920"}, "id": "707786", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_920"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "18:49:00"}

Well looks like Nokia 8 has the solution for that which they call as 'bothies'.\n\nFinnish phone manufacturer HMD Global announced its latest smartphone Nokia 8 on Wednesday that contains one unusual feature named as 'Dual-Sight'. The feature permits the user to shoot pictures using the front and the rear-facing cameras simultaneously. The result is a split-screen view. The company calls the resulted images as 'bothies' - a selfie but with both sides.\n\n\"There are two sides to every story and the Dual-Sight feature of Nokia 8 is designed to help you create and share the full picture,\" says Nokia, which created the slogan, \"Be less Selfie, be more Bothie.\"\n\nApart from the unique new feature, the phone contains similar properties like other phones such as a strong chipset, sharp display, dual cameras and other similar features, reported Business Insider.\n\nThere is also a 'Live' option at the top corner of the screen that allows the Dual-Sight mode to stream both the 'bothies' to Facebook or YouTube directly from the phone's camera application. Though Samsung and LG have already practiced a similar feature of double-cameras, it's the live streaming mode that distinguishes Nokia 8 from other phones.\n\nOther specs of the phone include a fingerprint scanner-home button combo, OZO high-dynamic range audio recording allowing the user to shoot 4K high-quality videos, 13MP front camera and slightly curved edges. Having a 5.3-inch screen, the phone runs on Snapdragon 835 processor with 4GB memory, super-bright display and a pixel density of 559.\n\nThe phone will be available in four unique colors: Polished Blue, Tempered Blue, Steel and Polished Copper making it more attractive. It is expected that the phone will roll out by September.\n\nAccording to Mashable, HMD CEO Pekka Rantala expressed, \"It's a phone for everyone, but focused on the next generations -- millennials and creators -- who are sharing every day their life great moments and experiences.\"", "id": "9662704", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "\"Be less Selfie, be more Bothie\" - Nokia | Business Recorder", "image": "http://www.brecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nokia-8.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "69", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sound recording and reproduction"}, "id": "302809", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dynamic range"}, "id": "311779", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}, "id": "312171", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}, "id": "314192", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint recognition"}, "id": "314740", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pixel density"}, "id": "317242", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mashable"}, "id": "328873", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashable"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bothy"}, "id": "541460", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothy"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Nokia products"}, "id": "795436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "10:25:00"}

If you pronounced that in your head as 'bah-these,' you're not the only one, but that's not what Nokia is going for. Pronounced 'both-eez,' the name refers to recording/shooting with both of a phone's cameras at the same time, combining the content into a single photo or videos.\n\nThe gimmick isn't new, and it isn't popular, though one could argue that the lack of popularity is due to the lack of an easy way to use both cameras at once. The Nokia 8 will fix that, offering two-way camera shooting as a standard feature. Point the camera at yourself, the other camera at a friend, and take a picture of you both together...but not exactly together, just close enough.\n\n'Bothies' involve the use of Nokia's Dual Sight technology, and it supports livestreaming from both cameras at once, as well as taking content to be saved and then shared. The livestreamed videos can be used with both YouTube and Facebook. The photos or videos are presented side-by-side, serving something akin to a picture-in-picture arrangement but in a way that is more suitable for viewing on a small phone screen.\n\nThe idea here seems to be that at the moment, you can take a 'selfie' by having someone smoosh in next to you, but not all situations are primed for that. Maybe you're out at a restaurant and you want to livestream both yourself and the people on the side of the table. 'Bothies' make that a possibility. Whether consumers are actually interested in recording, shooting, or livestreaming these situations is yet to be seen.\n\nOf course, you don't have to wait for the Nokia 8 to take your own 'bothies' using your existing handset, assuming it has both a front and a rear camera. Some existing apps available in the app stores bring this functionality to any phone, such as Frontback (iOS | Android), which is exactly what it sounds like.

The Nokia 8's most novel feature is its simultaneous front-and-back video capture ability. All images from Nokia\n\nMANILA, Philippines - HMD Global unveiled its first Nokia flagship, the Nokia 8, on Thursday, August 17, Manila time.\n\nThe 8 has the numbers fitting for a 2017 flagship:\n\nIt's priced at 599 euros (P36,208.35) and will start to come out in September, but specific details on Philippine availability as well as pricing have yet to be announced.\n\nWhile the specs are on par with what consumers expect out of a 2017 flagship, one feature allows it to stand out: its \"Dual-Sight\" mode, which allows a user to capture videos using the front and back cameras simultaneously.\n\nThe mode produces a split-screen video, where a user will be able to show two scenes at the same time: what's happening out front, and the user's face on the other. By concept, the feature removes the need for a user to switch between the front and back cameras when trying to capture their surroundings, say, at a concert, at a vacation, or whatnot.\n\nFRONT VIEW. The Nokia 8 has a 5.3-inch quad HD display and combination of capacitive buttons and a home button in the middle.\n\nDual-sight also works with Facebook's streaming feature, Facebook Live, in which users regularly switch between the front and rear cameras to tell their stories. With dual-sight, users now have the option to forgo switching between cameras.\n\nRegarding the phone's strong focus on live content, HMD chief product officer Juho Sarvikas, in a press statement, said: \"We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media. People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own.\"\n\n\"It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance,\" he finished.\n\nAdditionally, Facebook Live and YouTube Live are integrated with the phone's camera app. Instead of using the Facebook and YouTube apps, users can tap either the Facebook or YouTube icon in the camera's menu to live stream.\n\nThe Nokia 8 has a 13MP dual-camera system with two sensors, color and monochrome, on the rear. Up front, it has a wide-angle, auto-focusing 13MP shooter. Both front and rear cameras use Zeiss lenses, a continuation of Nokia's long-standing partnership with the respected German optics maker.\n\nThe 8 also has 4K video recording, and features an \"Audio Focus\" mode powered by a spatial 360-degree audio technology called OZO. The mode lets users focus on a specific audio range, and tune out ambient and background sounds when recording. - Rappler.com", "id": "9702202", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "New Nokia 8 touts simultaneous front and back video capture", "image": "https://assets.rappler.com/48D9BA10968F4856872586B2A8E5B9A1/img/36DC0C112E0544F1AE619DB83722DA0A/nokia-8-phone-081717.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 300, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 309}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "City of Manila"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "62003", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "label": {"eng": "City of Manila"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video"}, "id": "302573", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flagship"}, "id": "320976", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook features"}, "id": "332330", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_features"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube Live"}, "id": "573455", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Live"}, {"label": {"eng": "WQHD"}, "id": "1333231", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution#QHD_(2560%C3%971440)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 762, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 869, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital Video", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital_Video"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "03:20:00"}

It seems to have achieved that with a Snapdragon 835, 5.3-inch QHD screen, 64 GB storage with micro SD slot and twin 13 MP Zeiss cameras. The industrial design seems fine, although there's less of an emphasis on minimizing the bezel than seen on some other flagship smartphones.\n\nThe best attempt at differentiation seems to be a camera feature HMD is calling the 'bothie', which enables split screen images and video to be captured using the front and rear cameras simultaneously. This would presumably be especially handy for YouTubers looking to film their reactions to thins like computer games.\n\n\"We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media,\" said Juho Sarvikas, Chief Product Officer of HMD. \"People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own. It's these people who have inspired us to craft a flagship smartphone which perfectly balances premium design, an outstanding experience and powerful performance.\"\n\nThe Nokia 8 will roll out globally during September, costing around $700. Online response has been muted, with reviews concluding the device is adequate rather than exceptional and that it's likely to struggle against similarly specced phones like the OnePlus 5 that are considerably cheaper. We will get a good sense of the residual value in the Nokia smartphone brand by the end of the year.", "id": "9678663", "details": {"liCnt": 6}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "HMD launches Nokia 8 flagship smartphone with 'bothie' camera gimmick", "image": "http://telecoms.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/08/Nokia_8_Range-300x210.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video"}, "id": "302573", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "PC game"}, "id": "317606", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flagship"}, "id": "320976", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Industrial design"}, "id": "331516", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_design"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia Lumia 920"}, "id": "707786", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_920"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 196, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 762, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "11:50:00"}

I've already run some benchmark tests and its scores easily rival Samsung's Galaxy S8. In my experience so far, there's not much you can throw at this phone that it can't handle.\n\nThe 5.3-inch display is pin sharp, thanks to the ultra HD resolution (2,560\u00d71,440 pixels) and it's bright enough to use under the midday sun.\n\nAround the back you'll find two cameras. One shoots in color, the other only in black and white -- good news if you love dramatic, moody portraits. They both have 13-megapixel resolutions and both shoot video in 4K. There's a 13-megapixel camera on the front, and thanks to some software trickery you can take photos with both the front and back camera to combine them into a single, split-screen image.\n\nI took the Nokia 8's camera for spin -- take a look through at the gallery to see how it performs.\n\nYou can also livestream that split-screen view directly to YouTube or Facebook. It's not a killer feature for me personally, but you'll enjoy this unique skill if you love sharing your whole life with the world.\n\nThat's all wrapped up in a really slick metal body with a highly polished finish. I think it looks extremely smart and elegant, although it is something of a fingerprint magnet.\n\nNokia says the phone is splash-proof, not waterproof, which is disappointing given that proper waterproofing is something we're now often seeing on top-end phones.

How do you combine the photos from two 13MP cameras and end up with 8MP?\n\nPlus, since you have to take both shots simultaneously, framing is tricky. It would have been easier if it had the option to take the photo in two steps (as other camera apps have done in the past).\n\nWhat do you mean they're called #bothies?\n\nThe Nokia 8 can produce black & white photos too.

about five years ago, but you'd do well to find anyone nowadays who doesn't know what a 'selfie' is.\n\nJust ask Aidan O'Shea.\n\nThere's little doubt that the selfie has revolutionised the way people take photos, but Nokia (remember them?) are hoping to change the landscape all over again with the launch of their new smartphone, the Nokia 8.\n\nKey to Nokia's sales pitch for their new product is a dual sight-mode feature, which will enable the use of front and back cameras simultaneously for split-screen photos and video (video can be uploaded directly to YouTube and Facebook Live).\n\nWhat it means, in essence, is that owners of the phone will be able to include themselves in a photo they're taking, whether it's of a friend or while stood in front of a monument like the Spire on Dublin's O'Connell Street.\n\nIt will also, alas, bring an end to the cheeky (but hilarious) practise of pretending to take a photo of someone/a group of people while secretly turning the camera on yourself.\n\nOf course, such a concept is no good without a catchy name to describe it and after what we presume must not have been much debate, Nokia have decided upon the term 'bothie', which they hope will become as familiar a part of the lexicon as 'selfie' in the near future.\n\n\"Be less Selfie, be more #Bothie,\" reads the tagline on the website of the Finnish company, who are hoping to re-emerge as a giant in the communications world and who re-released the iconic Nokia 3310 earlier this year.\n\nIt remains to be seen if 'Bothie' will achieve next to or near the popularity of the selfie, but if you want to find out more about it and about the Nokia 8 itself, you can do so here.", "id": "9665430", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "A new type of photo called a

Today's discerning Instagrammers require a new way to document their every waking moment. Enter the Nokia 8 and its \"bothie.\" Nokia's attempt to compete with Samsung and Apple in the high-end smartphone market hits stores in Europe in September. Wired reports the Nokia 8 is standard stuff for a high-end smartphone; it's got 64 gigs of storage, 4 gigs of RAM, a 5.3-inch screen, and so on. And the Verge came away fairly unimpressed by the phone, calling it \"average,\" especially compared to what Apple apparently has planned for its new phone. The one thing the Nokia 8 does have, and what it could live or die on, is the bothie.\n\nThe bothie uses Dual Sight technology to let users take photos or videos using both the front and rear cameras at the same time, the Guardian explains. The resulting video or image shows whatever is in front of the user alongside the user's reaction to it. Those photos and videos can then be shared directly to Facebook or YouTube. Wired calls the bothie the Nokia 8's \"only truly unique feature,\" meaning the phone was made \"for the YouTubers and Instagrammers of the world.\" And they'll have to embrace the bothie if Nokia has any chance of competing with Apple and Samsung.

One of the standout features of the Nokia 8 is the 'Dual-Sight' camera mode that allows users to use both the front and rear cameras in a split screen. The Nokia 8 also comes with native support for livestreaming videos to social media apps like Facebook and YouTube. Nokia is touting this feature as 'Bothie', a spin on the popular culture of selfies.\n\nNokia's 'Bothie' feature seems pretty interesting and unique, but to use it you'll have to wait for the Nokia 8 to launch in India. If you have been really blown away by the Bothie feature, you may want to try out these free apps that can mimic the experience.\n\nFrontback\n\nAvailable for both Android and iOS, the Frontback app allows you to combine photos from rear and front cameras. While you can sign up with the app via email, Facebook, Twitter or Google, you can browse the app and take 'Frontback' photos without creating an account. The app has its own social stream, however, to use this feature you'll need to create an account.\n\nThe app has a very simple interface and easy to get familiar with. It also allows you to do minor editing within the app. The Frontback had gone viral in 2013.\n\nFront & Back Camera - Dual Selfie Camera Effect\n\nAvailable for Android, this app also allows users to take photos from the front and back cameras at the same time. You can combine the two photos into one single photo with just a tap. Like the Frontback app, it also allows minor editing such as vintage and retro filters, zoom, move or rotate the photos. It also allows you to directly share the photos with your friends via WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, among others.\n\nphoTWO\n\nAvailable for iOS, the phoTWO app is quite similar to PIP camera app. The phoTWO allows users to combine rear and front photos into one. The app creates a picture-in-picture like effect rather a split-screen effect. Just like other apps in this list, you can move, rotate and crop the photos. The phoTWO does a pretty fine job at blending the two photos together.", "id": "9643488", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Liked Nokia 8's 'Bothie' feature?

Nevertheless, a number of mobile phone makers seem to be employing this tactic in recent times as they seek to garner \"valuable feedback\" from their users.\n\nThe latest culprit is HMD Global, the business vehicle established specifically to create and market Nokia-branded mobile devices. The Finnish company has unveiled a number of mobile phones over the past nine months or so, from cheap feature phones and mid-range smartphones all the way up to yesterday's Nokia 8 flagship. Arguably -- and, perhaps, sadly -- HMD Global's most notable achievement to date (until yesterday's Nokia 8) was the excitement it generated by bringing back the classic Nokia 3310, slightly reimagined for the modern era with Bluetooth and a sleeker design.\n\nShortly after the Nokia 3310 is turned on, and before a SIM card is inserted, the phone serves up a little message -- a survey. It reads:\n\nYour opinion is very valuable to HMD Global, so please tell us what you think of your new phone. If you would like to take part in this...[hit] 'OK' or 'Later.'\n\nClicking \"OK\" brought up the first question, which asked how likely I was to recommend this phone to a friend or colleague.\n\nThe survey doesn't offer an obvious way to dismiss it permanently, merely presenting the user with two options -- agree or postpone. But the fact that the survey was baked into the very fabric of the phone at all was something of a surprise.\n\nChinese smartphone giant OnePlus, creator of some fantastic phones, including the recent OnePlus 5, was caught engaging in similar antics recently too, when some OnePlus 5 owners reported receiving push notifications requesting that they take part in a survey... to win a OnePlus 5. This followed a number of other \"promotions\" that were dispatched by push notifications to earlier OnePlus models to promote the upcoming OnePlus 5 launch.\n\nIn its explanation about sending out surveys via push notification, OnePlus said:\n\nFeedback from our community has always been at the heart of our product decision making and as part of this feedback loop, OnePlus 5 users have been sent a notification to share their personal experiences about the OnePlus 5 with an option to opt-out. This is to help with the continuous improvement of our products and to better understand our community of users.\n\nOther companies have been caught sending ads to users' devices over the years, including HTC, which pushed a Fantastic Four promotion back in 2015, and Samsung, which has sought to promote its new flagships through this mechanism.\n\nIn the case of HMD Global's survey, those of a calm disposition will no doubt argue that it's just a harmless feedback form and is hardly the end of the world. This is true, it is very much a \"first-world problem.\" But someone who has paid for a product shouldn't have surveys forced upon them in this way.\n\nA spokesperson told VentureBeat:\n\nHMD is committed to understanding the customer experience and this optional survey provides valuable feedback from consumers. The survey can be dismissed by pressing the back button.\n\nAt the time of writing, HMD Global hasn't confirmed whether similar surveys would be included on its latest flagship Nokia 8 device. But VentureBeat has seen reports elsewhere of surveys being included on other HMD Global Android phones, including the Nokia 6, so it would not be all that surprising if this was standard practice across the company's devices.", "id": "9724640", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "HMD Global is preinstalling surveys on Nokia phones", "image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/photo_20170704_082325.jpg?fit=1694%2C1039&strip=all&w=640", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "69", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}, "id": "306746", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth"}, {"label": {"eng": "HTC"}, "id": "307344", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Instant messaging"}, "id": "307453", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}, "id": "308708", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}, "id": "317431", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decision_making"}, {"label": {"eng": "Subscriber identity module"}, "id": "323117", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscriber_identity_module"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feature phone"}, "id": "324046", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "VentureBeat"}, "id": "381005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VentureBeat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Push technology"}, "id": "387807", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia 3310"}, "id": "679641", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"}, {"label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}, "id": "1270530", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 259, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Marketing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Marketing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 260, "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geomatics", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geomatics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 261, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Web Design and Development", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Web_Design_and_Development"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}], "time": "15:44:00"}

Good devices to be sure but not quite trailblazers. There's no doubt about the fact that enthusiasts and loyalists have been waiting for a new top end device from Nokia. With the launch of the 8, the company is aiming to deliver just that. So without further ado, here's a closer look at the all new Nokia 8.\n\nA single glance at the device and you can see that it is unmistakably a Nokia smartphone. Designed in Finland; there's symmetry, minimalism and a stylistic chic that is right in line with the rest of the line up yet different enough from the competition to standout.\n\nUp front is a 5.3 inch Quad HD IPS LCD panel. Below it lies the fingerprint sensor and two capacitive keys flanking it. Unlike the Galaxy S8 or the LG G6, the screen is certainly not bezel less and further trimmed down edges would've been appreciated.\n\nOver on the right is the volume rocker and power button both of which are sufficiently clicky and offer good feedback. The phone charges over USB Type C and has a 3.5mm audio jack at the top.\n\nFlip the phone over and you'll notice series 6000 aluminium back polished to a sheen in some of the variants. Beyond that though, there's the long camera island which has two 13MP cameras, one of them being a monochrome sensor. Below the Zeiss branding lies the dual LED flash and laser autofocus module.\n\nIn terms of specifications, the phone is powered by a Snapdragon 835 chipset paired with 4GB of RAM. There's 64GB of storage on board that can be expanded via the microSD card slot. The phone will have a Dual SIM version in some markets in which case the microSD slot will double up as a 2nd SIM slot. The battery capacity is 3090 mAh and the phone supports Quick Charge 3.0.\n\nThe phone runs a clean build of Android 7.1.1 with no extraneous additions and the August security patch installed. The company claims that the 8 will be amongst the first few devices to get the Android O update. Predictably, the phone flies and performance is fantastic, the clean software build certainly aids the flagship hardware in this respect. The company claims that significant work has gone into ensuring proper heat dissipation though we did observe one of the pre production devices heating up a bit with extended camera use.\n\nTalking about the camera, this is one of the key USPs of the device. The company claims that the 8 has been designed ground up for media creators and to this effect, it has added in some interesting tweaks to the camera app. Additionally, the phone includes Nokia's OZO algorithms for binaural audio encoding.\n\nThe front and rear cameras have identical camera sensors with differing implementations. The main rear camera includes OIS while the secondary camera has a monochrome sensor. You can switch between either but the preferred choice is to let the camera automatically merge data from multiple shots to create the final image.\n\nAs we mentioned, media creation, HMD has tied up with Facebook and Youtube to enable live streaming directly from the camera app. You can also interact with your Facebook Live comments straight from the camera app. To this effect, a badly named \"Bothie\" or dual sight streaming mode has been developed by the company that lets you stream or record from both the rear and front cameras simultaneously. The resulting video has both the clips fused together half n half. This could prove to be interesting for creators who would like to do a reactions style video while also capturing the setting. At the moment, there is no way to switch camera modes while recording.\n\nIn it's own right, the phone focuses on and based on our initial impressions, delivers on the essentials. We like the minimalistic design that fits really well in the hand and the variety of color options certainly make the phone stand out. Will the company's bet on millennial media creators pay off remains to be seen but as a flagship device, the company has certainly managed to create a well-rounded and polished hardware that can be a great option for someone looking for flagship hardware without Samsung's bloat. The Nokia 8 by HMD Global is priced at 599 Euros and starts shipping in early September globally. India availability is expected around early October.", "id": "9549397", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nokia 8 Hands On Impressions", "image": "http://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Nokia-8-8.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "69", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Finland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ceremonial ship launching"}, "id": "302960", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_ship_launching"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sensor"}, "id": "303316", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}, "id": "305643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secure Digital"}, "id": "306743", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"}, {"label": {"eng": "USB"}, "id": "306889", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}, "id": "307343", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "LG Corp"}, "id": "307493", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}, "id": "309949", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Laser"}, "id": "310579", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Computer hardware"}, "id": "312008", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Capacitor"}, "id": "318005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}, "id": "320018", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flash memory"}, "id": "320973", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flagship"}, "id": "320976", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dual SIM"}, "id": "322106", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_SIM"}, {"label": {"eng": "MicroSD"}, "id": "329065", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital#microSD"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 467, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "19:20:00"}

Called, the Nokia 8, the premium category smartphone is priced at \u20ac599 (approximately Rs 45,000) and takes on the likes of Samsung Galaxy S8, HTC U11 and the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. The smartphone not only boasts top-tier features but carries a price tag which is likely to help the brand regain popularity amongst the masses. Here's how it fares against its contemporaries on all parameters.\n\nPricing and availability\n\nNokia 8 carries a price tag of \u20ac599 and will be available in four color choices of Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue, and Steel. It has been currently launched in the (__) market. It is expected to be introduced gradually in other markets throughout September.\n\nIn comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is priced at Rs Rs 57,900 and available in color choices of Orchid Gray, Mighnight Black, and Maple Gold. HTC U11 is priced at 51,990 and available in Sapphire Blue, Amazing Silver, and Solar Red colors. Sony Xperia XZ Premium, on the other hand, is priced the highest at Rs 59,990 and available in color choices of Luminous Chrome and Deep Sea Black.\n\nIf the Nokia 8 is launched around the same price at par with its international pricing in India then it stands a good chance of success as the competing smartphones here are placed in the Rs 50,000 and above range.\n\nDisplay\n\nNokia 8 boasts a 5.3-inch IPS LCD display with quad HD resolution (2560 x 1440). The display is layered with 2.5D glass with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S8 features a 5.8-inch quad HD display, the HTC U11 packs a 5.5-inch quad HD display. The Sony Xperia XZ Premium features a 5.5-inch 4K HDR display with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. An HDR display is essentially meant for HDR content consumption.\n\nBased purely on the display, the Nokia 8 pales in comparison both in terms of size and resolution. However, given the price of the smartphone, it might be overlooked by potential customers. ALSO READ: Samsung Galaxy S8 review: A combination of beauty, beast and near-perfection!\n\nChipset, RAM, storage\n\nOne of the elements making the Nokia 8 a flagship smartphone is its use of Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC - the same chipset that powers the HTC U11 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium. While the Samsung Galaxy S8 is also available in the Snapdragon 835 variant, in India, it runs the Exynos 8895 SoC. As for the memory and storage, the Nokia 6, Galaxy S8, and Xperia XZ Premium include 4GB of RAM with 64GB of expandable internal storage. The HTC U11, on the other hand, packs 6GB of RAM with 128GB of internal storage. While the Nokia 8 is yet to be tested for performance, given the same configuration as its contemporaries, we can expect it to score well on this front.\n\nCameras\n\nIn what is likely to give the Nokia-brand a much-needed boost after the re-entry in the mobile market is the decision to opt for a dual-camera module on the Nokia 8. Catching up on the industry trend, the Nokia 8 features a pair of 13-megapixel primary sensor with Optical Image Stabilization and a 13-megapixel monochrome sensor with PDAF support, dual tone flash, and IR range finder. Up front, there is a 13-megapixel sensor with f/2.0, 78.4-degree lens and display flash.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8 features a single 12-megapixel rear camera with OIS, EIS, and PDAF. Up front, there is an 8-megapixel camera. The HTC U11 also packs a 12-megapixel rear camera with UltraPixel technology, 5-axis OIS, EIS, f/1.7 aperture and 4K video recording support with 360-degree sound recording. Up front, there is a 16-megapixel camera with 150-degree wide-angle lens. ALSO READ: Sony Xperia XZ Review\n\nKnown for camera prowess, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium is equipped with a 19-megapixel rear camera with features like predictive capture, triple image sensing technology, predictive hybrid autofocus. Up front, there is a 13-megapixel camera. The smartphone further comes with Motion Eye technology making it capable of shooting super slow motion videos.\n\nThe presence of a dual-camera module on the Nokia 8 makes it stand out from its competition here; none of which boast the newer trend in smartphone camera technology.\n\nBattery, OS, Connectivity\n\nNokia 8 is powered by 3,090mAh battery with Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 support. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and HTC U11 are both fueled by a 3,000mAh battery. The Xperia XZ Premium boasts the maximum capacity in the list with a 3,230mAh battery.\n\nOn the software front, all the smartphones run the newer Android Nougat out-of-the-box; Nokia 8 is powered by Android 7.1.1 Nougat, Galaxy S8 runs Android 7.0 Nougat with TouchWiz UI, HTC U11 runs Android 7.1 Nougat with HTC sense while the Xperia XZ Premium is powered by Android 7.1 Nougat. ALSO READ: HTC U11 review: Utopia in the making\n\nIn terms of connectivity, all the smartphones are Type-C based, and support 4G VoLTE support, fingerprint sensor, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, and dual SIM. Except the HTC U11, all the other smartphones support Bluetooth 5.0.\n\nVerdict\n\nGoing purely by the set of specifications, the Nokia 8 is set to give existing flagship smartphones a run for their money by bringing the top-tier features such as dual-camera setup, Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, and a decent battery capacity at an aggressive pricing. While the smartphone boasts the camera as one of its USPs, the HTC U11 offers a squeezable feature while the Galaxy S8 has an Infinity Display for an edgeless-experience. Similarly, the Xperia XZ Premium boasts what is called as the world's first super slow-motion camera. While each of the contemporaries has one key feature to boast, the Nokia 8 aims to seal it all with its pricing strategy.\n\nNokia 8 vs Samsung Galaxy S8 vs HTC U11 vs Sony Xperia XZ Premium:

Ben Travis gets double vision\n\nIn the beginning, there were smartphone cameras. And then, inevitably, came selfies. Human beings were always going to find a way to self-publicise.\n\nBut as technology advances, the selfie starts to look almost antiquated. Mercifully, new advances permit us new ways to express ourselves: brace yourself for the \"bothie\". Nokia's latest handset, the Nokia 8, announced to hype at a briefing yesterday morning, has a unique camera mode that could change the way we capture and share memorable moments.\n\nTechnically, the \"bothie\" is known as Dual-Sight technology (though where's the fun in that?). It's a photo and video mode which uses both front- and back-facing cameras simultaneously, and presents this view in one split-screen image. In other words, the camera can show your face, and also the world that you are reacting to.\n\nIt's sightly more sociable, and slightly less self-involved than a traditional selfie -- and it also invites plenty more experimentation with the form.\n\nIt feels purpose-made for social media: indeed, the Nokia 8's camera app incorporates a button to fluently broadcast live \"bothie\" video footage over YouTube and Facebook, without leaving the app.\n\nThe feature could be a gamechanger in how we share our lives online. \"People love to share and tell stories,\" says Juho Sarvikas, chief product officer at Nokia owner HMD Global. \"Nokia 8 is designed for anyone who wants to simultaneously capture and share high-quality footage.\n\n\"Social media has made the route from experience to sharing instantaneous. Live sharing is a major part of this trend and we wanted to make it as easy as possible for people to create immersive experiences for those who love to create and share special moments.\n\n\"With every smartphone user being a potential content creator we wanted to help people share their experiences and reactions with their followers, friends and family, in real-time.\"\n\nCare has gone into the hardware. It's rare for the front-facing camera on a smartphone to match up to the specs of the one on the back but the Nokia 8 features Zeiss-branded 13 megapixel cameras on both sides to ensure equal picture quality on each half of the \"bothie\".\n\nNokia isn't the only smartphone company upping its selfie game. Samsung brought auto-focus, rather than the usual fixed-focus, to the front-facing camera on this year's Galaxy S8 handset, and enhanced its only slightly sterile, sci-fi beauty mode, which offers airbrushing tweaks such as face-slimming, eye-enlarging and anti-skin blemish filters. The face of the future is a perfect one.\n\nChinese phone company Protruly has taken things even further with its Darling handset. The phone itself looks rather bizarre and cumbersome but it packs a full dome-shaped 360-degree camera in its unusual design. As a result, it can shoot immersive videos that are compatible with virtual reality headsets, as well as the ultimate selfie -- fully panoramic 360-degree photos that capture yourself and the surrounding environment.\n\nApple's aspirations for the selfie remain opaque -- though the company might well have something planned for the much-vaunted iPhone 8. Certainly, the back-facing snapper on last year's iPhone 7 Plus proved its most significant camera upgrade yet, incorporating a nifty 2x optical zoom dual-lens, and allowing for the phone to use \"Portrait\" mode, which captures SLR-style shallow depth of field images with sharp foregrounds and blurred-out backgrounds.\n\nHuawei's P10 handset has a similar feature, with the added bonus of lenses branded by the cool German optics company Leica. As dual-lens smartphone cameras become increasingly prevalent (and easier to run as processor power improves), it's currently a race to see who will be the first to bring it to the front-facing camera.\n\nMoreover, the next generation of selfie isn't all about hardware. Snapchat continues to liven up social media with its shareable augmented reality filters -- this week's addition invited users to map Pok\u00e9mon mascot Pikachu onto their faces. And Apple's ARKit for developers could bring further AR leaps that literally change how we see ourselves in selfie mode.\n\nWhat Snapchat filters really show is that social media is the true litmus test of selfie innovations -- and that's where the legacy of Nokia 8's \"bothie\" will be decided.\n\nIn the beginning, there were smartphone cameras. And then, inevitably, came selfies. Human beings were always going to find a way to self-publicise.\n\nBut as technology advances, the selfie starts to look almost antiquated.

In other words, the camera can show your face, and also the world that you are reacting to.\n\nIt's sightly more sociable, and slightly less self-involved than a traditional selfie -- and it also invites plenty more experimentation with the form.\n\nIt feels purpose-made for social media: indeed, the Nokia 8's camera app incorporates a button to fluently broadcast live \"bothie\" video footage over YouTube and Facebook, without leaving the app.\n\nThe feature could be a gamechanger in how we share our lives online. \"People love to share and tell stories,\" says Juho Sarvikas, chief product officer at Nokia owner HMD Global. \"Nokia 8 is designed for anyone who wants to simultaneously capture and share high-quality footage.\n\n\"Social media has made the route from experience to sharing instantaneous. Live sharing is a major part of this trend and we wanted to make it as easy as possible for people to create immersive experiences for those who love to create and share special moments.\n\n\"With every smartphone user being a potential content creator we wanted to help people share their experiences and reactions with their followers, friends and family, in real-time.\"\n\nCare has gone into the hardware. It's rare for the front-facing camera on a smartphone to match up to the specs of the one on the back but the Nokia 8 features Zeiss-branded 13 megapixel cameras on both sides to ensure equal picture quality on each half of the \"bothie\".\n\nNokia isn't the only smartphone company upping its selfie game. Samsung brought auto-focus, rather than the usual fixed-focus, to the front-facing camera on this year's Galaxy S8 handset, and enhanced its only slightly sterile, sci-fi beauty mode, which offers airbrushing tweaks such as face-slimming, eye-enlarging and anti-skin blemish filters. The face of the future is a perfect one.\n\nChinese phone company Protruly has taken things even further with its Darling handset. The phone itself looks rather bizarre and cumbersome but it packs a full dome-shaped 360-degree camera in its unusual design. As a result, it can shoot immersive videos that are compatible with virtual reality headsets, as well as the ultimate selfie -- fully panoramic 360-degree photos that capture yourself and the surrounding environment.\n\nApple's aspirations for the selfie remain opaque -- though the company might well have something planned for the much-vaunted iPhone 8. Certainly, the back-facing snapper on last year's iPhone 7 Plus proved its most significant camera upgrade yet, incorporating a nifty 2x optical zoom dual-lens, and allowing for the phone to use \"Portrait\" mode, which captures SLR-style shallow depth of field images with sharp foregrounds and blurred-out backgrounds.\n\nHuawei's P10 handset has a similar feature, with the added bonus of lenses branded by the cool German optics company Leica. As dual-lens smartphone cameras become increasingly prevalent (and easier to run as processor power improves), it's currently a race to see who will be the first to bring it to the front-facing camera.\n\nMoreover, the next generation of selfie isn't all about hardware. Snapchat continues to liven up social media with its shareable augmented reality filters -- this week's addition invited users to map Pok\u00e9mon mascot Pikachu onto their faces. And Apple's ARKit for developers could bring further AR leaps that literally change how we see ourselves in selfie mode.\n\nWhat Snapchat filters really show is that social media is the true litmus test of selfie innovations -- and that's where the legacy of Nokia 8's \"bothie\" will be decided.", "id": "9647675", "details": {"liCnt": 117}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Forget selfies, the new Nokia 8 lets you take a 'bothie'", "image": "https://www.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/17/09/an128294484nokia-8-bothie.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Selfie"}, "id": "303142", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Evan Spiegel"}, "id": "303286", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "id": "305286", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}, "id": "306314", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samsung"}, "id": "307347", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pikachu"}, "id": "308488", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikachu"}, {"label": {"eng": "Zoom lens"}, "id": "310412", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_lens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Megapixel"}, "id": "315855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Megapixel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Autofocus"}, "id": "317237", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Self-portrait"}, "id": "317239", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-portrait"}, {"label": {"eng": "Optics"}, "id": "331860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Single-lens reflex camera"}, "id": "338118", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Depth of field"}, "id": "355372", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field"}, {"label": {"eng": "Leica Camera"}, "id": "358059", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}, "id": "404963", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"}, {"label": {"eng": "Front-facing camera"}, "id": "1288799", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-facing_camera"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 255, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}], "time": "08:37:00"}

Gold grills glitter on her bottom teeth and a Yankees fitted is perched atop her dainty curls. Her demeanour is arrogant, her throaty rhymes are declarative statements: \"I changed rap forever, man / It's me who had the biggest plan / Ain't no average bitch, I've been the man / I've been the G.O.A.T., eatin' off the land.\" The comment section for this Youtube video has been disabled and it feels somewhat symbolic: Princess Nokia has declared herself the Greatest of All Time -- and there's no room for debate.\n\n\"Everybody wants to act like I ain't a big deal when I am. I'm one of the most successful, relevant and influential rappers of my generation,\" the New York native tells Exclaim! \"I don't have songs on the radio, I never had no celebrity co-sign. I've written all of my songs, I directed all my videos. Every part of what I've done for music, from the visuals to the business, I did it. And I'm really proud of that.\"\n\nNokia, born Destiny Frasqueri, has much to celebrate. Emboldened by the success of her 2016 album, 1992, an international summer tour and a recent distribution deal with Rough Trade Records, she is gearing up to release 1992 Deluxe in September. A revamp of last year's effort, it will feature eight new tracks, more grit and more braggadocio than the original.\n\n\"The flavour is different. In the original 1992, I tried to stay away from [talking about my] success. But I was like 'Let me talk my shit in 1992 Deluxe!\" says Nokia. \"It's me glorifying the places I've been, the things that I've seen, the experiences I've had. I travelled and toured, made a life for myself. So that subject matter is in Deluxe.\"\n\nNokia's idea of success ventures beyond touring the world and selling out shows. The true triumph for her is being a woman in hip-hop, building her career and shaping her image on her own terms. She talks about embracing all of her layers: her Puerto Rican and Afro-Indigenous roots, her womanhood, her New York influences, her spirituality, and how earlier in her career, she felt pressure to forsake parts of herself in order to become the next female rapper du jour. Hip-hop chisels narrow, suffocating spaces for women, but Nokia refuses to contort herself to fit an assigned aesthetic.\n\n\"When I started out rapping, I became very frightened by the idea that people were trying to pigeonhole me. That's usually what happens to most female rappers. They fit in a box and there's a prototype or person they're compared to,\" Nokia says. \"The people that wanted to be involved in my career early on wanted me to be one way. And that made me uncomfortable. I was always so many different things, all at once: a little hood, a little punk, a little grunge, a little glam, a little gay. I have a whole bunch of flavours. Early on, people had qualms with how I identified and what I wanted to be. Now, I have solidified myself in my career and no one is confused anymore. I have tried really hard to maintain the beauty in my multifaceted identity. And most people get it and I'm really glad.\"\n\nEmbracing uniqueness is the core message in Nokia's art. 1992 Deluxe, she says, will continue painting the picture of what it's like to be an outcast and a misfit, but in a celebratory way that highlights the beauty of being different. And although she tried not to boast on the original, this time around, she's collecting all her props.\n\n\"When you see a young girl, you want to be the first person to introduce her to the world. You want to be 'the one,' the reason why she's successful. [But] I don't want to give anyone the opportunity to say they were responsible for my career or that they made me,\" says Nokia. \"I worked hard for this shit. I made something out of it. So excuse me if I want to brag.\"\n\nPrincess Nokia plays the Velvet Underground in Toronto on August 20 and Club Soda in Montreal on August 28.

We are ensuring that whatever medium you get the file, even WhatsApp, you will get the surround experience of the audio when you listen to it,\" said Sarvikas.", "id": "9614154", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "When is Nokia 8 coming to India?", "image": "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAqcWWv.img?h=100&amp;w=100&amp;m=6&amp;q=60&amp;o=f&amp;l=f", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Video"}, "id": "302573", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sound recording and reproduction"}, "id": "302809", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Software"}, "id": "304150", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software"}, {"label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "id": "305834", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Microphone"}, "id": "307750", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Music video"}, "id": "309939", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camera"}, "id": "310415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nokia"}, "id": "311122", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dynamic range"}, "id": "311779", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range"}, {"label": {"eng": "Surround sound"}, "id": "333958", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Livestream"}, "id": "363344", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestream"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bokeh"}, "id": "404967", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stereo camera"}, "id": "581034", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereo_camera"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 762, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 869, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital Video", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital_Video"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1015, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1016, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1017, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1188, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Electronics"}], "time": "05:10:00"}

A rare feature, binaural audio, will give your viewers and even more immersive experience. The powerful Snapdragon 835 chipset handles all the necessary processing.\n\nHMD partnered with Google to make Google Photos the default gallery app on the phone.

But does it have the mettle?\n\nFinnish brand Nokia is continuing its attempt to clamber up the ranks in the smartphone market with the Nokia 8, a flagship smartphone with a few interesting features.\n\nPerhaps most interesting is the Nokia 8's 'Dual-Sight'. You can snap photos and record videos using both front and rear cameras at the same time - and you can see how these look on the phone's display via its split-screen feature.\n\nYou can record 4K video on the Nokia 8, too. Plus the phone records 360\u00b0 audio, which means it should capture sound from all directions for more immersive playback.\n\nYou should be able to buy the Nokia 8 at some point in September, and it will cost around \u00a3550 to buy outright. This price tag places it among the more expensive smartphones we've seen, but is it worth considering over well-known models such as the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6?\n\nIt's made from aluminium for an expensive look, has a generous 64GB on-board storage and dual cameras on its rear. We can't wait until we get full results from our test lab, to bring you our definitive verdict.\n\nIn the meantime, we cover some of the phone's key specs, and whether it's shaping up to be one of the best smartphones of 2017, below.\n\nMobile phone reviews - get the best smartphone for your budget\n\nMore and more mobile phone manufacturers are sticking two camera lenses on the back of handsets, to try to improve photo and video quality.\n\nNokia has jumped on the bandwagon with the 8, with 13Mp colour and monochrome lenses. The theory behind this is that you'll get better detail even in low-light shots, and you'll be able to focus more quickly on your subject. It also has a 13Mp front-facing camera for selfie fans.\n\nWe test all phones for camera quality in a range of light conditions. We can't wait to see whether the Nokia 8 delivers on its grand claims.\n\nUnder the hood, the Nokia 8 has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. This is the latest Snapdragon chip in the series, and means that the new Nokia should speed through everyday tasks.\n\nIt should also be able to handle the latest, graphic-intensive games, and flitting between several different apps. This means the Nokia 8 could be a good choice both for people who use their phones mainly for texts and light web browsing, as well as people who use their phones for several hours a day.\n\nThe Nokia 8 runs on Google's Android operating system. Many manufacturers do the same, but modify how it looks for a more bespoke experience.\n\nHowever, Nokia is offering Android in its pure form with its new smartphone. Nokia says that this means there will be no unnecessary apps that you can't delete - instead, you have more storage space to fill with exactly what you want.\n\nThe Finnish brand also promises monthly security updates to the Nokia 8, which may give you peace of mind.\n\nAs you'd expect from a phone this expensive, it has a fingerprint scanner for so you can quickly unlock your device.\n\nMany expensive smartphones are designed with decent water-resistance. For example, you can submerge the Samsung Galaxy S8 for half an hour in 1.5 metres of water, and it should still work normally. It's somewhat disappointing that the Nokia 8 can only withstand 'splashes' of water, and that an accidental drop in the toilet could render it completely useless.", "id": "9886868", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Nokia 8 announced: a mobile phone designed for live streaming - Which?

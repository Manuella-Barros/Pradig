He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was able to have his record expunged after less than a year of probation.\n\nNelly was also arrested in October 2017 in Auburn, Washington, south of Seattle, after a woman alleged he had sexually assaulted her on his tour bus. Rosenblum said then that the allegations were fabricated. The woman sued Nelly, who countersued, and they settled their legal claims in September 2018.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(Greg Doherty/Getty Images)\n\nRapper Nelly was arrested early Wednesday at a St. Louis-area casino, and the Missouri Highway Patrol said an officer found four illegal ecstasy pills on him. The rapper's attorney said an \"overzealous\" officer targeted him and conducted an improper search.\n\nThe arrest occurred about 4:45 a.m., and Nelly, 49, was held and then released by police in Maryland Heights, Missouri, the patrol said in a brief online report. The St. Louis suburb is home to the Hollywood Casino and Hotel, and Nelly's attorney, Scott Rosenblum said in a statement Wednesday evening that the rapper, who grew up in the area, visits it frequently.\n\nOnline Missouri court records show that Nelly, whose birth name is Cornell Haynes II, was cited in June 2018 in Maryland Heights with operating a vehicle without proper proof of insurance. A judge issued a warrant in December 2023, and it remained outstanding.\n\nRosenblum said Nelly had won several casino jackpots and when he sought to collect them, the officer who would have supervised the transaction \"needlessly\" ran a search for warrants. Once the officer found the outstanding warrant, he cuffed Nelly's hands behind his back and \"felt compelled\" to \"parade him through the casino in front of other customers,\" Rosenblum said.\n\nNelly's attorney called what the officer found \"alleged 'ecstasy'\" and said the officer did not have probable cause to justify searching him. Nelly wasn't notified of the warrant and did not know about it, Rosenblum said.\n\n\"I am 100 percent confident this case will go nowhere,\" Rosenblum said. \"And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\"\n\nThe Highway Patrol's report provided no details about the arrest, and Maryland Heights police did not respond to a call Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nRosenblum said that in similar circumstances, \"any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.\"\n\nNelly, a three-time Grammy Award winner, is known for hits like \"Hot in Herre\" and \"Just A Dream.\" He's had four No. 1 hits and received nine Billboard Music Awards. He recently wrapped up a series of performances with Janet Jackson as a special guest on her tour.\n\nHe won Grammy Awards in 2002 for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Best Male Solo Rap Performance, and his \"Nellyville\" was nominated that year for both Best Rap Album and Album of the Year. He also won a Grammy the following year for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group the following year for \"Shake Ya Tailfeather.\"\n\nBeyond his recording career, Nelly has appeared in a number of films and television series, including the sports film \"The Longest Yard\" and a BET reality series featuring his family. The artist announced in April he was engaged to singer and actor Ashanti and the pair is expecting a baby.\n\nIn April 2015, Nelly was arrested and faced felony drug charges in Tennessee after a bus he was traveling in was pulled over east of Nashville by the Tennessee Highway Patrol. He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was able to have his record expunged after less than a year of probation.\n\nNelly was also arrested in October 2017 in Auburn, Washington, south of Seattle, after a woman alleged he had sexually assaulted her on his tour bus. Rosenblum said then that the allegations were fabricated. The woman sued Nelly, who countersued, and they settled their legal claims in September 2018.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was released later on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement released to DailyMail.com, Rosenblum said that Nelly 'was not charged with drug possession' but rather 'arrested for \"No Proof of Insurance\" from 2018 on a warrant issued [in] December 2023 that he received no notice' about.\n\nNelly had been 'targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer,' the lawyer said, after a successful evening at the Hollywood Casino and Hotel in which he won 'several jackpots.'\n\nNelly's lawyer Scott Rosenblum is pushing back on the 49-year-old rapper's Wednesday arrest in connection with suspected drug possession, saying he was 100 percent 'confident this case will go nowhere'; pictured in his mug shot from the Maryland Heights Police Department\n\nThe three-time Grammy-winning rapper was pictured at the Grammys in LA last year\n\nRosenblum said that the police officer, 'instead of just supervising the transfer of [Nelly's] winnings ... felt compelled to needlessly run a check for warrants.'\n\nThe police officer told Nelly that 'a background check was mandated when a player won over a certain amount,' Rosenblum said.\n\nRead More EXCLUSIVE: Why Nelly REALLY 'malfunctioned' on stage: Event organiser weighs in after troubling footage of the rapper twitching at Juicy Fest went viral\n\nThe rapper knew that claim was false after having won 'several jackpots for similar or greater amounts, including one just a week prior without incident or a background check,' Rosenblum said.\n\nRosenblum said that after Nelly was told of an outstanding warrant for the insurance-related infraction, the 'officer felt compelled to handcuff [Nelly] behind his back and parade him through the casino in front of other patrons.'\n\nNelly's lawyer said that the officer then 'conducted a search without probable cause where he claimed to have found alleged \"ecstasy\" in [Nelly's] personal property.'\n\nRosenblum implied that the officer treated Nelly differently due to his fame, as 'under similar circumstances, assuming there was an old warrant without any notice to the individual for no proof of insurance, any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.'\n\nNelly's lawyer said that the rap artist 'is regularly asked to supply proof of no warrants' in accordance with 'the requirements to travel internationally,' and has also been vetted by the FBI.\n\nRosenblum wrapped up in saying he was fully 'confident this case will go nowhere' and that his firm 'will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.'\n\nThe rapper Nelly was arrested early Wednesday morning for alleged drug possession, according to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's arrest report, via FOX 2 News\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol also arrested Nelly for allegedly not having insurance; pictured in November 2023 in Miami, Florida\n\nAfter the Missouri State Highway Patrol arrested Nelly, he was then transferred to the custody of the Maryland Heights Police Department, where he was arrested on a failure to appear warrant.\n\nThat warrant was reportedly related to a traffic charge he had previously received in Maryland Heights, the department said in a statement to NBC News.\n\nEarlier this summer, Nelly was reported to have married fellow musical artist Ashanti secretly wed nearly six months earlier.\n\nCiting public records, TMZ reported that the couple wed on December 27, 2023.\n\nIt's unknown where exactly they tied the knot, but the union became official in St. Louis County.

TMZ later reported that the couple had actually been married since December 2023.\n\nIn the early morning hours of Wednesday, Aug. 7, Nelly was arrested by the Missouri State Highway Patrol at the Hollywood Casino in Maryland Heights, Missouri.\n\nPer hip-hop magazine XXL, the St. Louis native was investigated by the Missouri Gaming Commission after winning a jackpot at the gambling venue, at which point authorities found a failure-to-appear warrant for a No Proof of Insurance infraction dating back to 2018. When the \"Hot in Herre\" rapper's car was searched, Missouri State Highway officers found ecstasy pills and reportedly charged Nelly with drug possession. He was taken to the Maryland Heights Police Department and later released.\n\nAccording to a statement by the musician's lawyer, however, Nelly was not charged with drug possession.

In the statement, Rosenblum questioned the choice by the Missouri Gaming Commission to run a background check on Nelly after he won \"several jackpots,\" which he claims was not common practice at the casino, frequently visited by the rapper. The lawyer further claims the car was searched \"without probable cause.\"\n\nNelly and his team will be asking for an inquiry into the officer who led the arrest, described by Rosenblum as \"overzealous\" and \"out of line.\"", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "francisca_tinoco@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Francisca Tinoco", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Heights,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music recording certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashanti (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhythm and blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Gaming_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri Gaming Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proof (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_State_Highway_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri State Highway Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXL_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "XXL (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_in_Herre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hot in Herre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Fictional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Nelly.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 158, "textEnd": 164, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Arrest Explained", "body": "Rapper Nelly's recent arrest has captured significant media attention and left fans curious about the details. Reports indicate that he was detained on charges related to drug possession and an insurance violation. Now, fans want to know what exactly happened.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the details of Nelly's arrest and provide a clear explanation of what happened.\n\nDid rapper Nelly get arrested in St. Louis?\n\nYes, rapper Nelly was arrested on August 7, 2024, at the Hollywood Casino in the St. Louis area, Missouri.\n\nBillboard reports that Nelly was seen in handcuffs at the casino after authorities found a long-standing warrant related to an old insurance issue. Following his arrest, he was taken to the Maryland Heights Police Department but has since been released.\n\nWhat is rapper Nelly accused of?\n\nAccording to AP News, he was arrested for drug possession and an insurance violation. Nelly has been accused of illegal drug possession.\n\nMissouri State Highway Patrol flagged an outstanding warrant for Nelly, stemming from a previous traffic stop due to lack of insurance. This led to a background check and a search, during which officers reportedly found him in possession of four ecstasy pills.\n\nFollowing his arrest, Nelly's mugshot quickly went viral. Although he has yet to face the charges, it will ultimately be up to the prosecutor's discretion. Nelly's attorneys have denied the drug possession charges. In a statement to Billboard, attorney Scott Rosenblum claimed that an overzealous officer targeted Nelly. He stated, \"Mr. Haynes was not charged with drug possession. He was arrested for 'No Proof of Insurance' from 2018 on a warrant issued December 2023 that he received no notice. Mr. Haynes was targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer.\"\n\nRosenblum explained that after winning several jackpots at the casino, the officer unnecessarily ran a background check. He said, \"Instead of just supervising the transfer of Mr. Haynes' winnings, this officer felt compelled to needlessly run a check for warrants. The officer informed Mr. Haynes a background check was mandated when a player won over a certain amount; Mr. Haynes knew this to be untrue as he had won several jackpots for similar or greater amounts.\"\n\nRosenblum also claimed that the search of Nelly was conducted without probable cause, leading to the alleged discovery of ecstasy. The lawyer claimed, \"It is also important to note that Mr. Haynes, as part of the requirements to travel internationally, is regularly asked to supply proof of no warrants, including FBI checks. There were none. I am 100 percent confident this case will go nowhere. And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\"", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "disheeta_maheshwari@comingsoon.net", "name": "Disheeta Maheshwari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_State_Highway_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri State Highway Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mug_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mug shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Heights,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proof (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Nelly.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

He was held and then released by police.\n\nThis isn't the first time Nelly has run into trouble with the law. He's previously faced multiple sexual assault allegations, including in October 2017 when he was arrested after a woman named Monique Greene claimed the rapper assaulted her on his tour bus in Washington.\n\nAt the time, a rep for Nelly denied the allegations to PEOPLE via a statement from his lawyer, claiming that the woman's accusation was \"a completely fabricated allegation\" and they were confident he wouldn't be charged.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nRelated: Nelly Arrested on Felony Drug Charge While Traveling in Tennessee\n\nProsecutors dropped the case by September 2019 after Greene refused to testify in court. She did not file any charges, and Nelly maintained they had consensual sex.\n\nIn April 2015, Nelly was also arrested on several drug charges, including felony possession by Tennessee state troopers, PEOPLE confirmed. However, his attorney denied that he was \"associated\" with the illegal substances that led to his arrest.\n\n\"Nelly was one of several individuals that was on a tour bus that was stopped and searched while traveling through Tennessee,\" his lawyer Rosenblum said in a statement at the time. \"In fact, there had been 15-20 people that had access to the bus prior to the stop. Allegedly, a small quantity of contraband (MDMA aka molly or ecstasy) was discovered during the routine search.\"\n\nNelly pleaded guilty to misdemeanor marijuana and drug paraphernalia possession charges, but they were eventually dismissed from his record after completing a diversion program.\n\n\"This new year of my life is such a blessing full of love, hope and anticipation,\" Ashanti told the publication. \"Motherhood is something that I have looked forward to, and sharing this with my family, fianc\u00e9 and loyal fans, who have been so supportive of my career, is an amazing

The rapper's attorney said an \"overzealous\" officer targeted him and conducted an improper search.\n\nThe arrest occurred about 4:45 a.m., and Nelly, 49, was held and then released by police in Maryland Heights, Missouri, the patrol said in a brief online report. The St. Louis suburb is home to the Hollywood Casino and Hotel, and Nelly's attorney, Scott Rosenblum said in a statement Wednesday evening that the rapper, who grew up in the area, visits it frequently.\n\nOnline Missouri court records show that Nelly, whose birth name is Cornell Haynes II, was cited in June 2018 in Maryland Heights with operating a vehicle without proper proof of insurance. A judge issued a warrant in December 2023, and it remained outstanding.\n\nRosenblum said Nelly had won several casino jackpots and when he sought to collect them, the officer who would have supervised the transaction \"needlessly\" ran a search for warrants. Once the officer found the outstanding warrant, he cuffed Nelly's hands behind his back and \"felt compelled\" to \"parade him through the casino in front of other customers,\" Rosenblum said.\n\nNelly's attorney called what the officer found \"alleged 'ecstasy'\" and said the officer did not have probable cause to justify searching him. Nelly wasn't notified of the warrant and did not know about it, Rosenblum said.\n\n\"I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere,\" Rosenblum said. \"And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\"\n\nThe Highway Patrol's report provided no details about the arrest, and Maryland Heights police did not respond to a call Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nRosenblum said that in similar circumstances, \"any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.\"\n\nNelly, a three-time Grammy Award winner, is known for hits like \"Hot in Herre\" and \"Just A Dream.\" He's had four No. 1 hits and received nine Billboard Music Awards. He recently wrapped up a series of performances with Janet Jackson as a special guest on her tour.\n\nHe won Grammy Awards in 2002 for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Best Male Solo Rap Performance, and his \"Nellyville\" was nominated that year for both Best Rap Album and Album of the Year. He also won a Grammy the following year for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group the following year for \"Shake Ya Tailfeather.\"\n\nBeyond his recording career, Nelly has appeared in a number of films and television series, including the sports film \"The Longest Yard\" and a BET reality series featuring his family. The artist announced in April he was engaged to singer and actor Ashanti and the pair is expecting a baby.\n\nIn April 2015, Nelly was arrested and faced felony drug charges in Tennessee after a bus he was traveling in was pulled over east of Nashville by the Tennessee Highway Patrol. He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was able to have his record expunged after less than a year of probation.\n\nNelly was also arrested in October 2017 in Auburn, Washington, south of Seattle, after a woman alleged he had sexually assaulted her on his tour bus. Rosenblum said then that the allegations were fabricated. The woman sued Nelly, who countersued, and they settled their legal claims in September 2018.\n\nBallentine reported from Columbia, Missouri, and Hanna reported from Topeka, Kansas.

He was held and then released by police.\n\nThis isn't the first time Nelly has run into trouble with the law. He's previously faced multiple sexual assault allegations, including in October 2017 when he was arrested after a woman named Monique Greene claimed the rapper assaulted her on his tour bus in Washington.\n\nAt the time, a rep for Nelly denied the allegations to PEOPLE via a statement from his lawyer, claiming that the woman's accusation was \"a completely fabricated allegation\" and they were confident he wouldn't be charged.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nProsecutors dropped the case by September 2019 after Greene refused to testify in court. She did not file any charges, and Nelly maintained they had consensual sex.\n\nIn April 2015, Nelly was also arrested on several drug charges, including felony possession by Tennessee state troopers, PEOPLE confirmed. However, his attorney denied that he was \"associated\" with the illegal substances that led to his arrest.\n\n\"Nelly was one of several individuals that was on a tour bus that was stopped and searched while traveling through Tennessee,\" his lawyer Rosenblum said in a statement at the time. \"In fact, there had been 15-20 people that had access to the bus prior to the stop. Allegedly, a small quantity of contraband (MDMA aka molly or ecstasy) was discovered during the routine search.\"\n\nNelly pleaded guilty to misdemeanor marijuana and drug paraphernalia possession charges, but they were eventually dismissed from his record after completing a diversion program.\n\n\"This new year of my life is such a blessing full of love, hope and anticipation,\" Ashanti told the publication. \"Motherhood is something that I have looked forward to, and sharing this with my family, fianc\u00e9 and loyal fans, who have been so supportive of my career, is an amazing experience.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Haynes Jr., 49, was arrested for a 2018 infraction, which turned into a warrant issued in December 2023, according to his attorney.\n\nScott Rosenblum, Nelly's attorney, released a statement later Wednesday evening. Rosenblum says his client was at the casino, where he \"frequently visits and entertains at its amphitheater\" and won several jackpots.\n\nAn officer, who usually supervises the money transfer, also ran a check for warrants, saying that \"a background check was mandated when a player won over a certain amount,\" according to Rosenblum.\n\nThe attorney denies that it is mandated, noting that Nelly had won larger amounts of money a week ago with no background checks. A release from the Missouri State Highway Patrol states that the initial patrol contact with Nelly was during an \"identification verification in accordance with the Missouri Gaming Commission regulations.\"\n\nElection results: August 6, Missouri primary\n\nRosenblum says the officer discovered a warrant for a no proof of insurance infraction, handcuffed Nelly, and conducted a search, which led to the discovery of four pills. A preliminary investigation from MSHP found the pills to be \"tentatively identified\" as ecstasy.\n\nThe end of Rosenblum's statement reads:\n\n\"Under similar circumstances, assuming there was an old warrant without any notice to the individual for no proof of insurance, any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.\n\n\"It is also important to note that Mr. Haynes, as part of the requirements to travel internationally, is regularly asked to supply proof of no warrants. Including FBI checks. There were none.\n\n\"I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere. And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\"\n\nNelly was transported to the Maryland Heights Police Department and was released a short time after his arrest. According to the Missouri State Highway Patrol, formal charges for possession of a controlled substance were submitted to the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office.\n\nSeveral community members and St. Louis natives told FOX 2 Wednesday that despite the legal issue, they will stand by Nelly to focus on his legacy and hope for a positive resolution.\n\n\"Maybe we should look past it, because we all do stupid things sometimes,\" St. Louisan Jomia Johnson said.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

The St. Louis suburb is home to the Hollywood Casino and Hotel, and Nelly's attorney, Scott Rosenblum said in a statement Wednesday evening that the rapper, who grew up in the area, visits it frequently.\n\nRelated Story: Kelsea Ballerini Announces New Album, 'Patterns.'

A judge issued a warrant in December 2023, and it remained outstanding.\n\nRosenblum said Nelly had won several casino jackpots and when he sought to collect them, the officer who would have supervised the transaction \"needlessly\" ran a search for warrants.

He recently wrapped up a series of performances with Janet Jackson as a special guest on her tour.\n\nHe won Grammy Awards in 2002 for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Best Male Solo Rap Performance, and his \"Nellyville\" was nominated that year for both Best Rap Album and Album of the Year. He also won a Grammy the following year for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group the following year for \"Shake Ya Tailfeather.\"\n\nBeyond his recording career, Nelly has appeared in a number of films and television series, including the sports film \"The Longest Yard\" and a BET reality series featuring his family. The artist announced in April he was engaged to singer and actor Ashanti and the pair is expecting a baby.\n\nIn April 2015, Nelly was arrested and faced felony drug charges in Tennessee after a bus he was traveling in was pulled over east of Nashville by the Tennessee Highway Patrol. He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was able to have his record expunged after less than a year of probation.\n\nNelly was also arrested in October 2017 in Auburn, Washington, south of Seattle, after a woman alleged he had sexually assaulted her on his tour bus. Rosenblum said then that the allegations were fabricated. The woman sued Nelly, who countersued, and they settled their legal claims in September 2018.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri":

His lawyer says the case will die", "body": "Rapper Nelly was arrested early Wednesday at a St. Louis-area casino, and the Missouri Highway Patrol said an officer found four illegal ecstasy pills on him. The rapper's attorney said an \"overzealous\" officer targeted him and conducted an improper search.\n\nThe arrest occurred about 4:45 a.m., and Nelly, 49, was held and then released by police in Maryland Heights, Missouri, the patrol said in a brief online report. The St. Louis suburb is home to the Hollywood Casino and Hotel, and Nelly's attorney, Scott Rosenblum said in a statement Wednesday evening that the rapper, who grew up in the area, visits it frequently.\n\nOnline Missouri court records show that Nelly, whose birth name is Cornell Haynes II, was cited in June 2018 in Maryland Heights with operating a vehicle without proper proof of insurance. A judge issued a warrant in December 2023, and it remained outstanding.\n\nRosenblum said Nelly had won several casino jackpots and when he sought to collect them, the officer who would have supervised the transaction \"needlessly\" ran a search for warrants. Once the officer found the outstanding warrant, he cuffed Nelly's hands behind his back and \"felt compelled\" to \"parade him through the casino in front of other customers,\" Rosenblum said.\n\nNelly's attorney called what the officer found \"alleged 'ecstasy'\" and said the officer did not have probable cause to justify searching him. Nelly wasn't notified of the warrant and did not know about it, Rosenblum said.\n\n\"I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere,\" Rosenblum said. \"And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\"\n\nThe Highway Patrol's report provided no details about the arrest, and Maryland Heights police did not respond to a call Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nRosenblum said that in similar circumstances, \"any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.\"\n\nNelly, a three-time Grammy Award winner, is known for hits like \"Hot in Herre\" and \"Just A Dream.\" He's had four No. 1 hits and received nine Billboard Music Awards. He recently wrapped up a series of performances with Janet Jackson as a special guest on her tour.\n\nHe won Grammy Awards in 2002 for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Best Male Solo Rap Performance, and his \"Nellyville\" was nominated that year for both Best Rap Album and Album of the Year. He also won a Grammy the following year for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group the following year for \"Shake Ya Tailfeather.\"\n\nBeyond his recording career, Nelly has appeared in a number of films and television series, including the sports film \"The Longest Yard\" and a BET reality series featuring his family. The artist announced in April he was engaged to singer and actor Ashanti and the pair is expecting a baby.\n\nIn April 2015, Nelly was arrested and faced felony drug charges in Tennessee after a bus he was traveling in was pulled over east of Nashville by the Tennessee Highway Patrol. He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was able to have his record expunged after less than a year of probation.\n\nNelly was also arrested in October 2017 in Auburn, Washington, south of Seattle, after a woman alleged he had sexually assaulted her on his tour bus. Rosenblum said then that the allegations were fabricated. The woman sued Nelly, who countersued, and they settled their legal claims in September 2018.\n\nBallentine reported from Columbia, Missouri, and Hanna reported from Topeka, Kansas.

An officer found a warrant for a no proof of insurance infraction, resulting in Nelly being handcuffed and searched, which led to the discovery of four pills. A preliminary investigation by the Missouri State Highway Patrol tentatively identified the pills as ecstasy.\n\nNelly's attorney, Scott Rosenblum, has since released a statement to clarify the situation. He told the Daily Mail that Nelly \"was not charged with drug possession,\" and that the rapper's arrest stemmed from a warrant issued in December 2023 for a 2018 no proof of insurance violation, which Nelly had not been notified about.\n\nRELATED:Nelly Arrested in St. Louis for Possession of Ecstasy and Driving Without Insurance\n\nRELATED:Say What!?

Police arrested the 49-year-old musician at a St. Louis-area casino where he was allegedly carrying four ecstasy pills.\n\nNelly (real name Cornell Iral Haynes Jr.) was held and released by police in Maryland Heights, a city northwest of St. Louis. The Highway Patrol database also lists a citation for operating a vehicle without proper proof of insurance, though Nelly initially received this citation in June 2018 in Maryland Heights. A judge issued a warrant in December 2023, and it remained outstanding.\n\nScott Rosenblum, a legal representative for Nelly, said the Grammy winner had won several casino jackpots and when he sought to collect them, the officer who would have supervised the transaction \"needlessly\" ran a search for warrants. Once the officer found the outstanding warrant, he cuffed Nelly's hands behind his back and \"felt compelled\" to \"parade him through the casino in front of other customers,\" Rosenblum said.\n\nRosenblum also alleged that the police official had no probable cause to justify searching Nelly. The rapper, who is expecting a child with singer Ashanti, wasn't notified of the warrant and did not know about it, Rosenblum said.\n\n\"I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere,\" Rosenblum said. \"And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\"\n\nRosenblum did not immediately respond to The Times' request for comment.\n\nNelly's arrest comes months after legal documents from the St. Louis County Recorder database revealed that he and Ashanti (full name Ashanti Shequoiya Douglas) married on Dec. 27, 2023.\n\nIn April, the \"Baby\" singer, 43, confirmed speculation that she is starting a family with Nelly.\n\n\"This new year of my life is such a blessing full of love, hope, and anticipation,\" Ashanti told Essence in April. \"Motherhood is something that I have looked forward to, and sharing this with my family, fianc\u00e9, and loyal fans, who have been so supportive of my career, is an amazing experience.\"\n\nThe two musicians gave love another shot last year after dating on and off for about 11 years before breaking up in 2013. The baby will be Ashanti's first and Nelly's fifth. He shares daughter Chanelle, 30, and son Cornell, 25, with his ex-girlfriend Channetta Valentine. He also adopted the two children of his late sister Jackie Donahue after she died of leukemia in 2005.\n\nNelly has had previous run-ins with law enforcement. In April 2015, he was arrested and faced felony drug charges in Tennessee. He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was able to have his record expunged after less than a year of probation.\n\nTwo years later he was arrested in Auburn, Wash., after a woman alleged he had sexually assaulted her on his tour bus. The woman sued Nelly, who sued back. The case was settled in September 2018.\n\nEarlier this year, Nelly took the stage with Janet Jackson as part of her Together Again tour which included six shows across California.", "source": {"uri":

His lawyer says the case will die", "body": "By SUMMER BALLENTINE and JOHN HANNA - Assolciated Press\n\nRapper Nelly was arrested early Wednesday at a St. Louis-area casino, and the Missouri Highway Patrol said an officer found four illegal ecstasy pills on him. The rapper's attorney said an \"overzealous\" officer targeted him and conducted an improper search.\n\nThe arrest occurred about 4:45 a.m., and Nelly, 49, was held and then released by police in Maryland Heights, Missouri, the patrol said in a brief online report. The St. Louis suburb is home to the Hollywood Casino and Hotel, and Nelly's attorney, Scott Rosenblum said in a statement Wednesday evening that the rapper, who grew up in the area, visits it frequently.\n\nOnline Missouri court records show that Nelly, whose birth name is Cornell Haynes II, was cited in June 2018 in Maryland Heights with operating a vehicle without proper proof of insurance. A judge issued a warrant in December 2023, and it remained outstanding.\n\nInterim superintendent of St. Louis Public Schools left previous job under fire Letter: If Biden's age was so concerning, why isn't Trump's age?

Once the officer found the outstanding warrant, he cuffed Nelly's hands behind his back and \"felt compelled\" to \"parade him through the casino in front of other customers,\" Rosenblum said.\n\nNelly's attorney called what the officer found \"alleged 'ecstasy'\" and said the officer did not have probable cause to justify searching him. Nelly wasn't notified of the warrant and did not know about it, Rosenblum said.\n\n\"I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere,\" Rosenblum said. \"And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\"\n\nThe Highway Patrol's report provided no details about the arrest, and Maryland Heights police did not respond to a call Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nRosenblum said that in similar circumstances, \"any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.\"\n\nNelly, a three-time Grammy Award winner, is known for hits like \"Hot in Herre\" and \"Just A Dream.\" He's had four No. 1 hits and received nine Billboard Music Awards. He recently wrapped up a series of performances with Janet Jackson as a special guest on her tour.\n\nHe won Grammy Awards in 2002 for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Best Male Solo Rap Performance, and his \"Nellyville\" was nominated that year for both Best Rap Album and Album of the Year. He also won a Grammy the following year for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group the following year for \"Shake Ya Tailfeather.\"\n\nBeyond his recording career, Nelly has appeared in a number of films and television series, including the sports film \"The Longest Yard\" and a BET reality series featuring his family. The artist announced in April he was engaged to singer and actor Ashanti and the pair is expecting a baby.\n\nIn April 2015, Nelly was arrested and faced felony drug charges in Tennessee after a bus he was traveling in was pulled over east of Nashville by the Tennessee Highway Patrol. He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was able to have his record expunged after less than a year of probation.\n\nNelly was also arrested in October 2017 in Auburn, Washington, south of Seattle, after a woman alleged he had sexually assaulted her on his tour bus. Rosenblum said then that the allegations were fabricated. The woman sued Nelly, who countersued, and they settled their legal claims in September 2018.\n\nBallentine reported from Columbia, Missouri, and Hanna reported from Topeka, Kansas.

He had an outstanding warrant stemming from a 2018 traffic charge, when he was found driving without insurance, dating back to December 2023. He had allegedly failed to appear in court for the charge.\n\nNelly's attorney, Scott Rosenblum, said that after the 49-year-old multiple-Grammy-winner won several casino jackpots and attempted to collect his earnings, an \"overjealous\" officer supervising the transaction decided to run an identity verification, including a search for warrants. When he found the outstanding one, Nelly was cuffed and they proceeded to \"parade him through the casino in front of other customers,\" Rosenblum said.\n\nThe arrest report shows Nelly was arrested at 4:45 AM and subsequently released. Prosecutors have yet to charge him with a crime.\n\nRosenblum labeled the four pills \"alleged 'ecstasy'\" -- in scare quotes. The attorney also claimed the officer lacked probable cause to search him, and that Nelly was not made aware of the warrant in the first place.\n\n\"Any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way,\" Rosenblum said.\n\nThough widely beloved, having created some of the most well-known singles of the 2000s and pushing boundaries in his genre, Nelly has long been an underrated songwriter.\n\nThis isn't the first time Nelly has run into trouble with the law, however. Back in 2015, he faced felony drug charges in Tennessee after authorities searched the rapper's tour bus and found methamphetamines and marijuana. At the time, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. Within a year of probation, he was able to have his record expunged, according to the Associated Press.\n\nTwo years later, in 2017, he was arrested again in Washington when a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her on his tour bus. Rosenblum also stated those claims were fabricated, and the dispute was settled in 2018 -- after, Nelly countersued.\n\nThis recent arrest comes just months after Nelly and his wife, the also-iconic R&B singer Ashanti, announced they're expecting a baby.\n\n\"I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere,\" Rosenblum said. \"And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\"", "source": {"uri": "vice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VICE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sammi_caramela@vice.com", "name": "Sammi Caramela", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_State_Highway_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri State Highway Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashanti (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Methamphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhythm and blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.vice.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Nelly-VEVO-GO-Show.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\n\nNelly, whose birth name is Cornell Haynes II, was arrested at 4:45am Wednesday in St. Louis by the Missouri State Highway Patrol, according to online records.\n\nThe arrest took place at the Hollywood Casino, Maryland Heights Police Department PIO Terry McComas told CNN. McComas said the previous charge was \"failure to appear on an old traffic charge of no proof of insurance in Maryland Heights, MO.\"\n\nAccording to court records, Nelly's previous traffic charge, for lack of insurance, took place in 2018.\n\nPolice said that during the arrest, they found four pills, which \"a preliminary investigation tentatively identified\" as ecstasy.\n\nIn their release, Highway Patrol said Nelly \"was transported and released to the Maryland Heights Police Department. Formal charges for felony possession of a controlled substance will be submitted to the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office.\"\n\nAs of Thursday afternoon, the prosecutor's office told CNN that it has not yet received an application or record for any charges.\n\nEarlier this year, the \"Hot in Herre\" artist made headlines when he simultaneously announced his engagement to singer Ashanti, and that the rekindled pair were expecting a baby.\n\nAshanti and Nelly confirmed in September 2023 that they were reunited as a couple, 20 years after they were first linked together in a relationship that ended after a decade.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

He was released later on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement released to DailyMail.com, Rosenblum said that Nelly 'was not charged with drug possession' but rather 'arrested for \"No Proof of Insurance\" from 2018 on a warrant issued [in] December 2023 that he received no notice' about.\n\nNelly had been 'targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer,' the lawyer said, after a successful evening at the Hollywood Casino and Hotel in which he won 'several jackpots.'\n\nRosenblum said that the police officer, 'instead of just supervising the transfer of [Nelly's] winnings ... felt compelled to needlessly run a check for warrants.'\n\nThe police officer told Nelly that 'a background check was mandated when a player won over a certain amount,' Rosenblum said.\n\nThe rapper knew that claim was false after having won 'several jackpots for similar or greater amounts, including one just a week prior without incident or a background check,' Rosenblum said.\n\nAshanti, who is heavily pregnant with her first child with Nelly, failed to mention her spouse's arrest, instead sharing a gallery of snaps from her mother's birthday party last month\n\nThe mother-to-be showed off her growing bump in the selection of snaps, which were taken on July 14, as she partied with her family\n\nShe captioned her post: 'Recap Mom's bday!!!! @theoriginalmomanger \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f This was such a special night Happy Birthday again mom'\n\nRosenblum said that after Nelly was told of an outstanding warrant for the insurance-related infraction, the 'officer felt compelled to handcuff [Nelly] behind his back and parade him through the casino in front of other patrons.'\n\nNelly's lawyer said that the officer then 'conducted a search without probable cause where he claimed to have found alleged \"ecstasy\" in [Nelly's] personal property.'\n\nRosenblum implied that the officer treated Nelly differently due to his fame, as 'under similar circumstances, assuming there was an old warrant without any notice to the individual for no proof of insurance, any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.'\n\nNelly's lawyer said that the rap artist 'is regularly asked to supply proof of no warrants' in accordance with 'the requirements to travel internationally,' and has also been vetted by the FBI.\n\nRosenblum wrapped up in saying he was fully 'confident this case will go nowhere' and that his firm 'will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.'\n\nAfter the Missouri State Highway Patrol arrested Nelly, he was then transferred to the custody of the Maryland Heights Police Department, where he was arrested on a failure to appear warrant.\n\nThat warrant was reportedly related to a traffic charge he had previously received in Maryland Heights, the department said in a statement to NBC News.\n\nEarlier this summer, Nelly was reported to have married fellow musical artist Ashanti secretly wed nearly six months earlier.\n\nCiting public records, TMZ reported that the couple wed on December 27, 2023.\n\nThe couple are expecting their first child together. In April, Ashanti confirmed her pregnancy and revealed their engagement\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol also arrested Nelly for allegedly not having insurance; pictured in November 2023 in Miami, Florida\n\nIt's unknown where exactly they tied the knot, but the union became official in St. Louis County.

'We were not dressy.'\n\nThe singer said they were watching television in bed, dressed in pajamas, which added to why she was 'completely' shocked.\n\n'I cried. I gave him the biggest hug and kiss ever,' Ashanti recalled. 'I FaceTimed everyone I know... I was overjoyed and shocked and surprised and happy kind of like all in one.'\n\nWhen it comes to their impending nuptials, the Foolish artist confirmed she will give birth before walking down the aisle.\n\n'Never in a million years did I think we would be here,' she gushed. 'Ten years ago -- maybe yes -- but after our breakup, you know, I didn't even think we'd ever have a conversation again.'\n\nThe couple dated from 2003 to 2013 before going their separate ways.\n\nIn 2021, Nelly and Ashanti ran into each other at Fat Joe and Ja Rule's Verzuz battle.\n\nNelly asked for Ashanti's number from DJ City, sparking the pair to rekindle their romance.\n\n'I guess when you go through a breakup, for me personally, I kind of just shut that person out...'

Before I felt like both of us were doing what we were doing before career-wise, and when you got so many people in the middle of it, it can be tough.\"\n\nA source exclusively told Us at the time that Nelly and Ashanti were taking their relationship slow. \"A few years ago, Ashanti never would've imagined reconciling with Nelly, but they're enjoying spending time together,\" the insider shared. \"They don't want to rush anything.\"\n\nMonths later, Us broke the news that Nelly and Ashanti are expecting their first baby together, his fifth. (Nelly is a dad to daughter Chanelle, 30, and son Cornell Haynes III, 25, whom he shares with ex Channetta Valentine. He also previously adopted Shawn and Sydney, the children of his late sister Jackie Donahue, after her 2005 death.)\n\nAshanti confirmed the news during an interview with Essence in April, saying, \"This new year of my life is such a blessing full of love, hope and anticipation.

Although an online arrest record and several outlets have reported that he was allegedly in possession of four ecstasy pills, his lawyer has refuted the claims.\n\n\"Mr. Haynes was not charged with drug possession,\" said Attorney Scott Rosenblum in a statement. \"He was arrested for 'No Proof of Insurance' from 2018 on a warrant issued December 2023 that he received no notice.\"\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nRosenblum said that Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Haynes Jr., had won several jackpots at an unnamed venue he frequently visits and that instead of \"supervising the transfer of Mr. Haynes' winnings,\" an officer \"felt compelled to needlessly run a check for warrants.\"\n\nOnce Nelly was made aware of the warrant for lack of insurance, per his lawyer, the officer handcuffed the rapper and proceeded to \"parade him through the casino in front of other patrons.\" Rosenblum said that the officer also conducted a search of Nelly without probable cause and claimed to have found him in possession of \"ecstasy.\"\n\nRosenblum said the rapper had been \"targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer,\" and stated that \"any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.\"\n\nHis attorney added that he is \"100% confident this case will go nowhere,\" and that he \"will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\"\n\nThe three-time Grammy winner, known for chart hits such as \"Hot in Herre\" and \"Dilemma,\" was previously arrested in April 2015 and faced felony drug charges in Tennessee after a search of his tour bus uncovered methamphetamines and marijuana.\n\n\"I feel the need to take responsibility for my choices in needing to be more aware of all the people I associate with and allow onto my property while committing to making better choices moving forward,\" Nelly said in a statement following the 2015 arrest. \"While my instinct, of course, is to be accessible to my friends, fans and acquaintances, the last thing I would want to do is compromise the respect and admiration of friends, family and fans.\" Nelly later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge.\n\nThe artist was also arrested in October 2017 after a woman alleged he had sexually assaulted her on his tour bus in Washington. A lawyer for Nelly at the time called the allegation \"fabricated\" and \"devoid of credibility.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charisma_madarang@yahoo.com", "name": "Charisma Madarang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proof (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dilemma (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_in_Herre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hot in Herre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Methamphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Office_Products/Furniture", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Office Products/Furniture", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Office_Products", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Office Products", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bwWhkBJK4Zh50FiOrB3pWQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/rollingstone.com/24b28a8de1c448954c62acb8511094c9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-04-", "textStart": 1517, "textEnd": 1527}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-10-", "textStart": 2182, "textEnd": 2194}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

However, there have been a few notable incidents, with the most recent being on Wednesday, August 7.\n\nAccording to an arrest report, Nelly was busted for possession of ecstasy pills and not having insurance.\n\nThe \"Hot in Herre\" rapper was taken into custody after being pulled over in Maryland Heights, a suburb outside St. Louis, Nelly's hometown, according to TMZ.\n\nNelly was taken into custody at 4:45 a.m. Wednesday and booked at the Maryland Heights Police Department, but he has since been released.\n\nMaryland Heights Police confirmed the rapper had an outstanding traffic summons on August 7.\n\nThis is not the first time Nelly has been busted for drug possession. In 2001, the rapper was arrested in St. Louis on drug-related charges after he was reportedly found with a small amount of marijuana and was briefly detained before being released.\n\nIn 2009, Nelly faced legal issues once again after police discovered drugs and weapons on his tour bus. During a traffic stop in Sierra Blanca, Texas, authorities found marijuana, methamphetamine, and a loaded firearm. Nelly was not charged with drug possession himself but was cited for having the contraband on his bus.\n\nFor the next ten years, Nelly mostly stayed out of the headlines for drug-related issues--until his recent arrest for possession of ecstasy pills.\n\nIn October 2017, Nelly found himself in the midst of a legal storm when he was arrested and charged with second-degree rape. The allegations came from Monique Greene, a then-22-year-old college student, who accused the rapper of assaulting her on his tour bus just before a highly anticipated performance with Florida Georgia Line.\n\nIn December of the same year, Greene took legal action against Nelly, suing the \"Hot in Herre\" rapper for sexual assault and defamation after he publicly denied her accusations. The lawsuit not only included Greene's claims but also introduced allegations from two anonymous women in England.\n\n\"I do NOT plan on walking away quietly,\" Nelly had said in a statement at the time. \"I have to speak up for my family and for the real victims strong enough to come forward and face people that have actually assaulted them. I want to thank [my girlfriend] Shantel, my family, friends, and fans that have stood next to me through all of this, and know my real character.\"\n\nThe two other women alleged that Nelly groped them and masturbated in front of them after they had been invited to join him and his entourage in 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn response, Nelly filed a countersuit in January 2018, denying the allegations and labeling them as \"completely fabricated\" in a bid to follow-up Greene's claims. By September, it was reported that Nelly and Greene had reached a mutual settlement, bringing the contentious legal battle to a close.\n\nFollowing the dismissal, Nelly released a statement obtained by People Magazine. \"I am very thankful to the U.K. police for thoroughly investigating the false allegations against me and I am satisfied with the results of this case and the previous one in the U.S., both driven by the same attorney, both being dropped,\" Nelly said.\n\n\"I stand with women and real survivors and can't wait to just focus on what I love, family, music and reconnecting with the fans that have stood by me through these turbulent times,\" the rapper added.\n\nDespite the legal issues, Nelly was awarded the I Am Hip Hop Award at the 2021 BET Hip Hop Awards \"for his massive contributions to music and the culture at large,\" according to Daily Beast.\n\n\"I am honored to receive this award and humbled to be in such great company of past artists who\u202fhave\u202freceived this award,\" Nelly said in a statement after winning the award. \"I have been blessed to work with some incredible people in my career, making\u202f22 years go by in the blink of an eye. This award isn't just about Nelly; it\u202fis about my fans, BET, and the people that continue to support\u202fme and allow me to do what I love to do.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelly_coffey_behrens@theblast.com", "name": "Kelly Coffey-Behrens", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Heights,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_in_Herre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hot in Herre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraband", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contraband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Georgia_Line", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Georgia Line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methamphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Blanca,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Blanca, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Blanca, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BET"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/1894x874/2024/08/07155714/nelly-1-scaled-e1723060653968.jpg?", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 302, "textEnd": 310, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-10-", "textStart": 1538, "textEnd": 1550}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-01-", "textStart": 2737, "textEnd": 2749}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The decision to press charges will be in the hands of the prosecutors.\n\nThe rapper, famous for early-2000s hits like \"Hot in Herre,\" \"Ride Wit Me,\" \"Pimp Juice\" and \"Country Grammar,\" seemed to smirk in his mugshot while dressed in a black hoodie over a white shirt and a diamond chain.\n\nNelly's attorney, Scott Rosenblum, informed The Post that Nelly was \"targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer.\"\n\nIn the statement, the lawyer explained, \"after winning several jackpots, at a venue where Mr. Haynes frequently visits and entertains at its amphitheater; instead of just supervising the transfer of Mr. Haynes' winnings, this officer felt compelled to needlessly run a check for warrants.\"\n\n\"The officer informed Mr. Haynes a background check was mandated when a player won over a certain amount; Mr. Haynes knew this to be untrue as he had won several jackpots for similar or greater amounts including one just a week prior without incident or a background check,\" Rosenblum added.\n\nHe alleged that the officer \"felt compelled to handcuff Mr. Haynes behind his back and parade him through the casino in front of other patrons\" and then \"conducted a search without probable cause where he claimed to have found alleged 'ecstasy' in Mr. Haynes' personal property.\"\n\nNelly's attorney defended him by stating, \"It is also important to note, that Mr. Haynes, as part of the requirements to travel internationally, is regularly asked to supply proof of no warrants. Including FBI checks. There were none.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere.

The rapper's attorney said an \"overzealous\" officer targeted him and conducted an improper search.\n\nThe arrest occurred about 4.45am, and Nelly, 49, was held and then released by police in Maryland Heights, Missouri, the patrol said in a brief online report. The St Louis suburb is home to the Hollywood casino and hotel, and Nelly's attorney, Scott Rosenblum, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the rapper, who grew up in the area, visits it frequently.\n\nOnline Missouri court records show that Nelly, whose birth name is Cornell Haynes II, was cited in June 2018 in Maryland Heights with operating a vehicle without proper proof of insurance. A judge issued a warrant in December 2023, and it remained outstanding.\n\nRosenblum said Nelly had won several casino jackpots and when he sought to collect them, the officer who would have supervised the transaction \"needlessly\" ran a search for warrants. Once the officer found the outstanding warrant, he cuffed Nelly's hands behind his back and \"felt compelled\" to \"parade him through the casino in front of other customers\", Rosenblum said.\n\nNelly's attorney called what the officer found \"alleged 'ecstasy'\" and said the officer did not have probable cause to justify searching him. Nelly wasn't notified of the warrant and did not know about it, Rosenblum said.\n\n\"I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere,\" Rosenblum said. \"And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\"\n\nThe highway patrol's report provided no details about the arrest, and Maryland Heights police did not respond to a call Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nRosenblum said that in similar circumstances, \"any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way\".\n\nNelly, a three-time Grammy award winner, is known for hits like Hot in Herre and Just A Dream.

He was arrested \"in possession of four ecstasy pills and for not having insurance,\" local news outlet KRCG reported.\n\nNelly, whose real name is Cornell Haynes II, was taken into custody at 4:45 a.m. and booked at the Maryland Heights Police Department.

He wore a black hoodie over a white shirt with a chain around his neck and had a neutral expression on his face.\n\nNelly is currently performing various shows around the country.

However, the felony drug charge was later dropped after the \"E.I.\" rapper pleaded guilty to the marijuana and drug paraphernalia charges.\n\n\"We were confident from the onset of the charges that Nelly would be cleared and we are pleased with the outcome of dismissed charges,\" his attorney said in a statement, per E! News. \"It was stated in open court that there was never any methamphetamines on his bus and absolutely no evidence present to pursue felony charges against rap superstar Nelly. As for the misdemeanor consumption charge, Nelly took a diversion which means his record will be cleared of any misdemeanor charges.\"\n\nNelly added, \"I would like to thank my attorney, Scott Rosenblum, and the people of Tennessee for a very fair outcome.\"\n\nA bus carrying Nelly and other passengers was also stopped in 2012 at a border patrol checkpoint in Sierra Blanca, Texas, after police suspected it was carrying 36 Ziploc bags of heroin, as well as marijuana and a loaded .45 caliber pistol.

According to NBC News, the 49-year-old rapper, born Cornell Haynes II, was arrested around 4 a.m. on Wednesday.\n\nThe Hot In Herre rapper was said to be in possession of four ecstasy pills when he was arrested at the Hollywood Casino in Maryland Heights. Good Morning America also reported that the Missouri State Highway Patrol in a statement said Nelly was \"initially contacted by the Patrol during an identification verification in accordance with Missouri Gaming Commission regulations.\"\n\n\"During the verification process, Haynes was found to have an active warrant for his arrest from the Maryland Heights Police Department and was arrested without incident,\" the statement added. \"During a search of his person incident to the arrest, Haynes was found to be in possession of four pills. A preliminary investigation tentatively identified the pills as Ecstasy.\"\n\nNelly was later released after he was detained at the Maryland Heights Police Department, per records from the Missouri State Highway Patrol. Responding to his arrest in a statement, the award-winning rapper's lawyer, Scott Rosenblum, claimed Nelly \"was targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer\" and highlighted he was \"not charged with drug possession.\"\n\n\"He was arrested for 'No Proof of Insurance' from 2018 on a warrant issued December 2023 that he received no notice,\" Rosenblum explained. \"After winning several jackpots at a venue where Mr. Haynes frequently visits and entertains at its amphitheater, instead of just supervising the transfer of Mr. Haynes' winnings, this officer felt compelled to needlessly run a check for warrants,\" the statement added.\n\nThe statement continued: \"The officer informed Mr. Haynes a background check was mandated when a player won over a certain amount; Mr. Haynes knew this to be untrue as he had won several jackpots for similar or greater amounts including one just a week prior without incident or a background check.\"\n\n\"Once Mr. Haynes was informed of the warrant for a No Proof of insurance infraction, this officer felt compelled to handcuff Mr. Haynes behind his back and parade him through the casino in front of other patrons,\" the statement further said.\n\n\"This officer then conducted a search without probable cause where he claimed to have found alleged 'ecstasy' in Mr. Haynes' personal property. Under similar circumstances, assuming there was an old warrant without any notice to the individual for no proof of insurance, any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.\"\n\nRosenblum also said he's \"100% confident this case will go nowhere\", adding that they will be \"asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\"", "source": {"uri": "face2faceafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Face2Face Africa"}, "authors": [{"uri": "francis_akhalbey@face2faceafrica.com", "name": "Francis Akhalbey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Heights,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_State_Highway_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missouri State Highway Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Gaming_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri Gaming Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_in_Herre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hot in Herre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://face2faceafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Image-10.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Nelly, the renowned rapper who brought us hits like \"Hot in Herre\" and \"Dilemma,\" has found himself in hot water yet again. According to reports from KRCG, the St. Louis rapper was arrested in the early hours of the morning for ecstasy possession. That's right, folks, at 4:45 a.m., Nelly was caught red-handed with four ecstasy pills. To add insult to injury, he was also driving without insurance.\n\nThe arrest took place in the St. Louis area, where Nelly was pulled over by police. It appears the rapper, whose real name is Cornell Haynes Jr., had an outstanding traffic summons, which led to his apprehension. After being taken to the Maryland Heights Police Department, Nelly was later released. This incident has left many fans and onlookers scratching their heads and wondering why a man of his stature and age would be caught up in such a scandal.\n\nNelly, who is now in his late 40s, is far too old to be dabbling in illegal substances like ecstasy. This isn't just a matter of age; it's a matter of responsibility and image. Nelly is no longer the young, reckless rapper of the early 2000s. He's a grown man with a family and a career that demands maturity and stability. This arrest comes at a particularly bad time, as Nelly is about to become a father again. His new wife, Ashanti, must be reeling from the news.\n\nEcstasy, also known as MDMA, is a potent and dangerous drug. It can cause severe dehydration, hyperthermia, and long-term damage to the brain. For someone like Nelly, who has a public image to maintain and a family to support, getting involved with such substances is not only irresponsible but potentially life-ruining. The effects of ecstasy can impair judgment, increase risky behaviors, and lead to severe health complications. It's a drug that has no place in the life of a successful, mature adult.\n\nThis arrest is particularly troubling given Nelly's impending fatherhood. Becoming a parent is a huge responsibility, one that requires a level-headed and responsible mindset. How can Nelly be a role model to his new child if he's getting arrested for drug possession? This incident could have long-lasting repercussions on his family life and his relationship with Ashanti.\n\nAshanti, Nelly's new wife, must be feeling a whirlwind of emotions. On one hand, she's preparing to welcome a new life into the world. On the other hand, her husband is making headlines for all the wrong reasons. This isn't just a blow to Nelly's reputation; it's a blow to their relationship. Ashanti deserves a partner who is fully present and committed, not someone who is getting arrested in the middle of the night with illegal substances.\n\nOne of the most puzzling aspects of this incident is the timing. What was Nelly doing out at 4:45 a.m.? Driving around at such an hour, especially without insurance and with drugs in the car, raises a lot of questions. Was he coming back from a late-night studio session, or was he involved in something more dubious? Regardless of the reason, it's not a good look for someone of his age and status.\n\nFans have taken to social media to express their shock and disappointment. Many are questioning Nelly's judgment and expressing concern for his well-being and the well-being of his family. Here are some of the reactions:\n\n\"Wtf are you doing you just had a baby and a wife ?????\"\n\n\"I know this man is not playing in our face before our girl has the baby! What?!????\"\n\n\"Chile he a artist he problem stressed and he got a baby coming free my uncle Nelly\"\n\n\"And where can someone find ecstasy in 2024? Asking for a friend definitely not me.\"\n\nThis arrest isn't just a blip on the radar; it's a significant event that could impact Nelly's legacy. He's been in the music industry for decades, building a career that many look up to. However, incidents like this tarnish that legacy and make it harder for fans to continue supporting him unconditionally. Nelly needs to take a hard look at his choices and consider the long-term effects of his actions on his career and his family.\n\nThe big question now is, what's next for Nelly? How does he move past this scandal and regain the trust of his fans and loved ones? It's going to take more than just a public apology. Nelly needs to demonstrate a commitment to making better choices and taking responsibility for his actions. This might mean seeking professional help, focusing on his family, and staying out of trouble.\n\nNelly's arrest for ecstasy possession is a wake-up call, not just for him but for everyone watching. It's a reminder that no matter how successful or famous you are, poor choices can have serious consequences. For Nelly, this is an opportunity to turn things around and show that he's capable of being the responsible adult and father his family needs.\n\nLet's keep our eyes peeled and hope that Nelly learns from this incident and makes the necessary changes. This isn't just about his reputation; it's about his future and the future of his family. Here's hoping for better days ahead for Nelly, Ashanti, and their soon-to-be bundle of joy.", "source": {"uri": "thyblackman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThyBlackMan"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamar_jackson@thyblackman.com", "name": "Jamar Jackson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ashanti (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_song", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hit song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dilemma (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratching", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scratching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_in_Herre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hot in Herre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popcorn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popcorn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Heights,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Role model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyperthermia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://thyblackman.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Nelly-Arrested-For-Ecstasy-Possesion-During-Arrest.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Read on!\n\nNelly's legal team is speaking out after the rapper's recent arrest in the St. Louis area, challenging the charges and the conduct of the arresting officer. On Wednesday, Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Haynes Jr., was taken into custody on a warrant for an old traffic violation and for alleged possession of a controlled substance. However, his attorney, Scott Rosenblum, is vigorously disputing the drug charge.\n\nRosenblum clarified that Nelly was not charged with drug possession, despite what was reported in the online arrest record, according to a statement given to People. \"He was arrested for 'No Proof of Insurance' from 2018 on a warrant issued December 2023 that he received no notice,\" the attorney stated.\n\nRosenblum further claimed that Nelly was \"targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer\" after winning several jackpots at a local St. Louis casino, where the rapper is a frequent visitor.\n\nAlso read: Olympics Closing Ceremony: Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg, Red Hot Chili Peppers set to perform\n\nAccording to Rosenblum, instead of simply overseeing the transfer of Nelly's winnings, the officer insisted on conducting a background check, citing a supposed rule requiring such checks after large casino wins. The attorney stated that Nelly knew this claim was false, as he had previously won larger amounts without incident or background check.\n\nUpon discovering the warrant for the insurance violation, Rosenblum alleged that the officer \"unnecessarily handcuffed Nelly and paraded him through the casino in front of other patrons\". During the subsequent search, which Rosenblum argues lacked probable cause, the officer claimed to have found ecstasy pills among Nelly's personal belongings.\n\nThe lawyer contended that under similar circumstances, any other individual would have been released with instructions to address the insurance issue.\n\nAlso read: What's in Katy Perry's bag?

address the warrant and sent on his way ... instead of being arrested, as was the case here.\n\nAs we reported ... the Missouri Highway Patrol, which has troopers from its gaming division at the casino, told us Nelly was booked for felony drug possession and on a warrant for no vehicle insurance.\n\nNelly's attorney, however, says he has not been charged with drug possession ... and Rosenblum's confident the case will go nowhere and his law firm will be asking for an inquiry into the arresting officer's conduct.", "source": {"uri": "tmz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TMZ"},

During his 4:45 a.m. arrest, officers searched him and found what they believed were four pills of ecstasy.\n\nHaynes was taken to the Maryland Heights Police Department. He was released later on Wednesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nThe patrol said formal charges for felony possession of a controlled substance will be submitted to the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office.\n\nHe is being represented by Scott Rosenblum, who told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch he would send out a statement later Wednesday. He declined to comment otherwise.\n\nThe St. Louis rapper released hits like \"Hot in Herre\" and \"Ride Wit Me.\" He grew up in the St. Louis area and got involved with the music scene there in the 1990s.\n\nThe rapper has had a few run-ins with the law before this incident in Maryland Heights. Haynes was arrested in 2015 after authorities found marijuana on his tour bus in Tennessee. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor marijuana and drug paraphernalia possession, but that was later cleared from his criminal record after he completed a diversion program.\n\nThe following year, TMZ reported he owed more than $2 million to the IRS.\n\nPhotos: Nelly performs at a sold out show at the River Spirit Hotel and Casino's Paradise Cove", "source": {"uri": "magicvalley.com", "dataType":

Interesting. What do ya'll think he plays if anything? Roulette? Blackjack or maybe Texas Hold'em ... We gotta get the drop on that. Maybe he was just grabbing a bite to eat.\n\nGet this, he was initially stopped by the Missouri Gaming Commission for an ID verification. A ha. So one of the most recognizable people in the entire state of Missouri was stopped to verify his ID? Huh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the stop, authorities miraculously discovered that Nelly had an outstanding warrant for failure to obtain car insurance, leading to his arrest. Wow. Seriously?\n\nHere's where it took a turn. Missouri State Highway officers conducted a search of Nelly's vehicle and found ecstasy pills. If accurate, yikes.\n\nSo what's the result? Nelly was also charged with drug possession. Then the \"Country Grammar\" rapper was taken to the Maryland Heights Police Department but was later released.\n\nTalk about bad timing, ICYMI, Nelly is expecting a child with Ashanti.

He was later released from police custody as authorities continued to investigate the claim.\n\nA rep for Nelly denied the allegations and told PEOPLE via a statement from his lawyer that the woman's claims are \"a completely fabricated allegation\" and they were confident he wouldn't be charged.\n\nBy September 2019, prosecutors dropped the case after Greene refused to testify and did not file any charges. Nelly maintained they had consensual sex.\n\nAfter facing accusations of an alleged sexual assault that happened in December 2017 following one of his concerts in England, Essex police stopped their investigation into the hip-hop star in April 2019.\n\nThe anonymous woman claimed that Nelly masturbated in front of her multiple times after his show at Cliffs Pavilion in Southend. He had denied the allegations.\n\nPer the BBC, the woman refused to testify, prompting U.K. prosecutors to drop the case.\n\nIn April 2015, Nelly was also arrested on several drug charges, including felony possession by Tennessee state troopers, PEOPLE confirmed. However, his attorney denied that he was \"associated\" with the contraband that led to his arrest.\n\nWhile traveling with five other people, Nelly had been stopped for failure to display a U.S. Department of Transportation and International Fuel Tax Association sticker, authorities said in a press release at the time.\n\nPer the release, Troopers said they smelled the odor of marijuana in the vehicle.\n\nIn a subsequent probable cause search and investigation, troopers found a plastic bag with five colored, crystal-type rocks that tested positive for methamphetamine; a \"small amount\" of marijuana; approximately 100 small Ziploc bags and \"numerous\" handguns, including a gold-plated 50-caliber Desert Eagle pistol.\n\n\"Nelly was one of several individuals that was on a tour bus that was stopped and searched while traveling through Tennessee,\" attorney Scott Rosenblum said in a statement at the time. \"In fact, there had been 15-20 people that had access to the bus prior to the stop. Allegedly, a small quantity of contraband (MDMA aka molly or ecstasy) was discovered during the routine search.\"\n\nNelly was charged with felony possession of drugs, simple possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor marijuana and drug paraphernalia possession, but the charges were eventually cleared from his record after completing a diversion program.\n\nNever miss a story --

The rapper suffered an embarrassing arrest for possessing illicit drugs while in Missouri. Nelly's reputation of late has been mostly positive due to his reconciled romance with the Foolish songstress.\n\nThe bust happened on Wednesday morning around 4:45 in Maryland Heights, a suburb close to Nelly's hometown. Per TMZ, the artist showed up at the Hollywood Casino in St. Charles, where officers of the Missouri State Highway Patrol were stationed. As part of the Missouri Gaming Commission regulations, the cops asked Nelly for his ID and ran it through the system for verification purposes. Unfortunately, they discovered he had a warrant from a previous traffic stop for having no vehicle insurance.\n\nAuthorities proceeded to search Nelly and found four Ecstasy pills on him. The singer, whose real name is Cornell Iral Haynes Jr., was booked for felony drug possession and the warrant for no vehicle insurance. A mugshot from the arrest showed the Hot In Herre artist in a black hoodie with bloodshot eyes. He was mostly expressionless. He was later released with no bail payment.\n\nFollowing the arrest, Nelly's attorney spoke up, claiming his client was \"targeted by an overzealous, out-of-line officer.\" Lawyer Scott Rosenblum alleged the 49-year-old was singled out because he won a jackpot at the casino. The cops reportedly lied to the rapper and said that they had to run a background check before handing him his win. However, Rosenblum argues that background checks aren't standard procedures because Nelly has had bigger wins in the past.\n\nAfter conducting a background check, Nelly's lawyer said the cops put him in handcuffs and paraded him in front of other gamblers. The arresting officer then searched him without probable cause, claiming to have seen the stimulant drug. As for the outstanding warrant, Rosenblum explained to TMZ that his client was not given notice of the warrant that was issued back in 2018. The Texas native is yet to be charged with drug possession. Luckily, his lawyer believes the case will be knocked out of the park.

According to the Missouri State Highway Patrol, the arrest stemmed from an outstanding warrant for a previous traffic violation related to lack of insurance. During a search, officers allegedly discovered four ecstasy pills in his possession.\n\nNelly's attorney, Scott Rosenblum, vehemently denies the drug charges, asserting that the search was conducted without probable cause. He further claims that Nelly was targeted due to his celebrity status and the fact that he had won several jackpots at the casino. Rosenblum questions why the warrant check was necessary after Nelly's winnings and emphasizes that Nelly regularly undergoes security checks, including FBI checks, for international travel without any previous issues.\n\nThis incident comes on the heels of recent positive news for Nelly, including his engagement and subsequent marriage to singer Ashanti, with whom he is expecting his first child. Despite the legal trouble, Rosenblum expresses confidence that the case will be dismissed and calls for an investigation into the officer's conduct.

The attorney also claims that Nelly has won significant jackpots before, as recently as last week, and did not have to go through background checks.\n\nRosenblum also released a statement explaining that Nelly, legal name Cornell I. Haynes Jr., has to regularly go through security, including FBI checks, to tour, writing, \"Under similar circumstances, assuming there was an old warrant without any notice to the individual for no proof of insurance, any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.

He was later released from police custody as authorities continued to investigate the claim.\n\nA rep for Nelly denied the allegations and told PEOPLE via a statement from his lawyer that the woman's claims are \"a completely fabricated allegation\" and they were confident he wouldn't be charged.\n\nBy September 2019, prosecutors dropped the case after Greene refused to testify and did not file any charges. Nelly maintained they had consensual sex.\n\nAfter facing accusations of an alleged sexual assault that happened in December 2017 following one of his concerts in England, Essex police stopped their investigation into the hip-hop star in April 2019.\n\nThe anonymous woman claimed that Nelly masturbated in front of her multiple times after his show at Cliffs Pavilion in Southend. He had denied the allegations.\n\nPer the BBC, the woman refused to testify, prompting U.K. prosecutors to drop the case.\n\nIn April 2015, Nelly was also arrested on several drug charges, including felony possession by Tennessee state troopers, PEOPLE confirmed. However, his attorney denied that he was \"associated\" with the contraband that led to his arrest.\n\nWhile traveling with five other people, Nelly had been stopped for failure to display a U.S. Department of Transportation and International Fuel Tax Association sticker, authorities said in a press release at the time.\n\nPer the release, Troopers said they smelled the odor of marijuana in the vehicle.\n\nIn a subsequent probable cause search and investigation, troopers found a plastic bag with five colored, crystal-type rocks that tested positive for methamphetamine; a \"small amount\" of marijuana; approximately 100 small Ziploc bags and \"numerous\" handguns, including a gold-plated 50-caliber Desert Eagle pistol.\n\n\"Nelly was one of several individuals that was on a tour bus that was stopped and searched while traveling through Tennessee,\" attorney Scott Rosenblum said in a statement at the time. \"In fact, there had been 15-20 people that had access to the bus prior to the stop. Allegedly, a small quantity of contraband (MDMA aka molly or ecstasy) was discovered during the routine search.\"\n\nNelly was charged with felony possession of drugs, simple possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor marijuana and drug paraphernalia possession, but the charges were eventually cleared from his record after completing a diversion program.\n\nNever miss a story --

first child with Ashanti, whom he secretly married in December 2023.\n\nIn April 2024 the \"Happy\" musician, 43, revealed the pair were expecting their first baby together and discussed the life change in an interview with Essence.\n\n\"This new year of my life is such a blessing full of love, hope, and anticipation,\" Ashanti told the publication. \"Motherhood is something that I have looked forward to.\"\n\nThe \"Foolish\" singer also subtly confirmed the couple's engagement when she referred to Nelly as her \"fianc\u00e9.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Iral Haynes Jr., was taken into police custody and appeared in a mugshot wearing a white t-shirt, a black hoodie and a silver chain.

Surprisingly, he could have escaped cops if he never won the $50,000 jackpot.\n\nNelly's lawyer recently shed more light on his run-in with cops, revealing their plans to investigate the arresting officer for allegedly abusing his power.\n\nAccording to the \"Hot in Herre\" hitmaker's attorney, Scott Rosenblum, Nelly collected his $50,000 jackpot before getting arrested. He won the massive sum on the slot machine at the Hollywood Casino in St. Charles.\n\nRosenblum noted his client's arrest was triggered by his earnings, with the arresting officer claiming they needed to run a background check before giving him the money. However, Nelly found this move odd.\n\nHe noted that he had won larger amounts at the same casino without getting a background check but agreed to the investigation. Unfortunately, the background check revealed he had an active warrant for a traffic stop issue.\n\nThis red flag, per TMZ, prompted the arresting officer to search Nelly's bags, and they allegedly found Ecstasy. However, Rosenblum noted that prosecutors haven't charged him with drug possession.\n\nAlthough the active warrant on Nelly's head triggered his arrest, he seemed to blame the arresting officer for running a background check. His lawyer noted they wanted the law enforcer investigated because he searched the rapper without probable cause.\n\nSources familiar with the situation claimed Nelly initially believed the arrest was a joke or a prank. He was in the middle of collecting his winnings when the background check revealed the open warrant.\n\nNelly, per insiders, was handcuffed to a chair with one hand free to collect the remaining money. Once he had the $50,000 Winnings, cops cuffed both his wrists and escorted him out of the casino.\n\nA year before his casino arrest, The Blast reported that Nelly had finalized a deal with HarbourView Equity Partners to sell part of his famous music catalog. The agreement covered 50% of the rapper's recorded music.\n\nThe catalog, reportedly worth $50 million, included some of Nelly's most popular songs like \"Ride Wit Me\" and chart-topping tracks \"Dilemma\" featuring Kelly Rowland and \"Hot in Herre.\" Nelly addressed the sale in a statement, declaring:\n\n\"As artists, we put our heart and soul into each track, and there comes a time when you consider preservation of that artistry.\"\n\n\"My music is my legacy, which I want to last beyond me, continuing to make my existing fans happy while reaching new generations and new audiences,\" Nelly continued, noting his excitement to partner with Harbourview.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2013, Nelly had an on-and-off-again romance with fellow singer Ashanti. However, The Blast shared that they rekindled their famous love in April 2023 when they were spotted cuddling and holding hands at a Vegas boxing match.\n\nHowever, they did not confirm their reunion until September when Nelly proudly declared, \"Yeah, we cool again,\" on the \"Boss Moves with Rasheeda.\" He confirmed their relationship wasn't planned, echoing sentiments similar to Ashanti's.\n\nAn insider from Ashanti's team alleged that she never imagined reconciling with Nelly, adding: \"They're enjoying spending time together. They don't want to rush anything.\" Despite the claims of taking things slow, the pair soon had a bun in the oven.\n\nIn December 2023, Nelly and Ashanti triggered pregnancy rumors at his Black and White Ball in St. Louis. They took the stage and placed their hands on the singer's stomach, seemingly implying there was a baby in there.\n\nA video of their adorable moment went viral on social media, capturing them laughing as they repeatedly touched Ashanti's stomach. Following the event, a source confirmed the pair were expecting their first child together.\n\nThe announcement sparked positive reactions from fans, with many celebrating the couple's blessings. One sweet commenter penned: \"I love Ashanti and Nelly together. I don't care what anyone says! Congratulations, and I'll bring the meatballs to the baby shower!\"\n\nNelly and Ashanti quietly tied the knot in December 2023 amid the pregnancy news. While it is her first child, the rapper has two children from a previous relationship.", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "afouda_bamidele@theblast.com", "name": "Afouda Bamidele", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slot machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Charles,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Charles, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Charles, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traffic stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_in_Herre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hot in Herre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dilemma (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ride_wit_Me", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ride wit Me"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black and white"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashanti (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congratulations_(Post_Malone_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congratulations (Post Malone song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasheeda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rasheeda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/2056x947/2024/08/09063529/Nelly-3-scaled-e1723199815135.jpg?", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The Grammy-winning music star was booked overnight by the Missouri Highway Patrol, in his hometown. Officers arrested Nelly on a failure to appear on a warrant, but when they took him into custody they allegedly found him to be in possession of multiple pills of Ecstasy.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Tonight, Nelly -- whose real name is Cornell Haynes II -- was arrested after winning a jackpot at Hollywood Casino, following a background check by police, who claimed that it was necessary to do background checks on players who won large amounts of money. In addition to the aforementioned charges, Nelly was also charged with not having insurance.\n\nIn response to the arrest. Nelly's lawyer, Scott Rosenblum, has issued a statement. \"Mr. Haynes was not charged with drug possession. He was arrested for 'No Proof of Insurance' from 2018 on a warrant issued December 2023 that he received no notice,\" the attorney stated. \"Mr. Haynes was targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer.\"\n\nRegarding the events that led to Nelly's arrest, Rosenblum explained, \"After winning several jackpots, at a venue where Mr. Haynes frequently visits and entertains at its amphitheater; instead of just supervising the transfer of Mr. Haynes' winnings, this officer felt compelled to needlessly run a check for warrants.\"\n\n\"The officer informed Mr. Haynes a background check was mandated when a player won over a certain amount; Mr. Haynes knew this to be untrue as he had won several jackpots for similar or greater amounts including one just a week prior without incident or a background check,\" Rosenblum continued. \"Once Mr. Haynes was informed of the warrant for a No Proof of Insurance infraction, this officer felt compelled to handcuff Mr. Haynes behind his back and parade him through the casino in front of other patrons.\"\n\n\"This officer then conducted a search without probable cause where he claimed to have found alleged 'ecstasy' in Mr. Haynes' personal property,\" Rosenblum went on to state. \"Under similar circumstances, assuming there was an old warrant without any notice to the individual for no proof of insurance, any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way.\"\n\nRosenblum's statement concluded, \"It is also important to note, that Mr. Haynes, as part of the requirements to travel internationally, is regularly asked to supply proof of no warrants. Including FBI checks. There were none. I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere. And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\"", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_State_Highway_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri State Highway Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_in_Herre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hot in Herre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proof (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2023/05/01/31e0ebf7-b29a-4e8d-b9f9-0ef9d2f39bfd/nelly.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

During his 4:45 a.m. arrest, officers searched him and found what they believed were four pills of ecstasy.\n\nHaynes was taken to the Maryland Heights Police Department.

He declined to comment otherwise.\n\nThe St. Louis rapper released hits like \"Hot in Herre\" and \"Ride Wit Me.\" He grew up in the St. Louis area and got involved with the music scene there in the 1990s.\n\nThe rapper has had a few run-ins with the law before this incident in Maryland Heights. Haynes was arrested in 2015 after authorities found marijuana on his tour bus in Tennessee. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor marijuana and drug paraphernalia possession, but that was later cleared from his criminal record after he completed a diversion program.\n\nThe following year, TMZ reported he owed more than $2 million to the IRS.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Heights,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Missouri", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Missouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_State_Highway_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri State Highway Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversion_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diversion program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ride_wit_Me", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ride wit Me"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_in_Herre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hot in Herre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_paraphernalia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug paraphernalia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Cannabis", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Cannabis", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs/Cannabis", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs/Cannabis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/301/30119/3011976.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The arrest occurred about 4:45 a.m., and Nelly, 49, was held and then released by police in Maryland Heights, Mo., the patrol said in an online report. Nelly's attorney, Scott Rosenblum, said Wednesday in a statement the rapper, who grew up in the area, visits Hollywood Casino and Hotel frequently. Court records show that Nelly, whose birth name is Cornell Haynes II, was cited in June 2018 in Maryland Heights with operating a vehicle without proper proof of insurance. A judge issued a warrant in December 2023 and it remained outstanding. Rosenblum said Haynes had won several casino jackpots Wednesday and when he sought to collect them, the officer who would have supervised the transaction \"needlessly\" ran a search for warrants. Once the officer found the outstanding warrant, he cuffed Haynes' hands behind his back and \"felt compelled\" to \"parade him through the casino in front of other customers,\" Rosenblum said. The three-time Grammy Award-winner's attorney called what the officer found \"alleged 'ecstasy'\" and said the officer did not have probable cause to justify searching him. Nelly wasn't notified of the warrant and did not know about it, Rosenblum said. \"I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere,\" Rosenblum said. \"And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\" The Highway Patrol's report provided no details about the arrest and Maryland Heights police did not respond to a call Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nSteve Martin will not play Vice President Kamala Harris' new running mate, Minnesota Gov.

You need someone who can really nail the guy.' I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.\" Although Martin initially leaned into the fun, writing on social platform Threads that he \"just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short,\" he also noted the impression comes with a long-term commitment of performing on the show. \"It's ongoing,\" Martin, 78, told the Times. \"It's not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again.

Online records from the Missouri State Highway Patrol show that he was arrested around 4:45 a.m. local time on Wednesday and held by the Maryland Heights Police Department. While listed charges include possession of a controlled substance from MSHP and a prior lack of proof of insurance-related charge from Maryland Heights, Nelly's attorney, Scott Rosenblum, has disputed the former.\n\nAccording to a statement shared with Page Six and others, Rosenblum believes Nelly was \"targeted\" in the incident by an \"overzealous\" officer who \"felt compelled to needlessly run a check for warrants,\" resulting in the insurance-related issue circa late last year. At one point in their interaction, Rosenblum added, the officer told Nelly that a full-fledged background check was required for him to collect his winnings, which makes another facet of the arrest that the lawyer has called into question.\n\nAs for a subsequent search, Rosenblum says this was done \"without probable cause.\" Furthermore, the officer's claims of having found what Rosenblum described as \"alleged ecstasy\" are approached with speculation in the attorney's statement, which wraps with an expression of confidence regarding this headlines-making case's future.\n\n\"I am 100 percent confident this case will go nowhere,\" he said.\n\nAs of this writing, Nelly wasn't speaking publicly on the arrest, whether on social media or elsewhere. Last month, he and Ashanti celebrated the impending arrival of their first child together with back-to-back baby showers.\n\nIn February, the couple appeared together on the track \"This Lil' Game We Play\" with Juicy J and Jermaine Dupri.", "source": {"uri": "complex.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Complex"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bytrace_william_cowen@complex.com", "name": "ByTrace William Cowen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Heights,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_State_Highway_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri State Highway Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashanti (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermaine_Dupri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jermaine Dupri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juicy_J", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juicy J"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/v1723122295/nelly.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

He was subsequently arrested for a previous warrant he had under his name for failure to obtain car insurance.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs' Son Accused of Sexually Assaulting and Drugging Woman in New Lawsuit\n\nRapper Rod Wave Arrested on Weapons Charges\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs' Properties Raided by Homeland Security as Part of Sex Trafficking Investigation\n\nUpon searching Nelly's car, Missouri State Highway officers also discovered ecstasy pills, leading them to charge the entertainer for drug possession. Nelly was then transported to the Maryland Heights Police Department and was ultimately released.\n\nRepresentatives for Nelly did not immediately respond to Variety's request for comment.\n\nNelly just recently completed a trek across the United States as the supporting act for Janet Jackson's ninth concert tour. The summer leg was an extension of Jackson's 2023 \"Together Again\" run -- the highest selling jaunt of Jackson's career. The last date Nelly played was on July 30 at the Footprint Center in Phoenix.\n\nHe has put somewhat of a pause on his solo music career, with his last solo full-length and original effort being 2021's \"Heartland,\" which saw him collaborating with country acts such as Florida Georgia Line. Most recently, Nelly signed with WME for global representation after touring with T.I., Ja Rule and Ashanti, in addition to a short trek with Nashville singer Chase McDaniel, and following a string of music festival appearances.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in August 2024\n\nWhat's Coming to Netflix in August 2024\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

We'll explain.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Country Grammar rapper was taken into custody at the Hollywood Casino in St. Louis on charges of allegedly possessing ecstasy pills and not having vehicle insurance, according to Missouri State Highway Patrol per TMZ. After winning the jackpot at the casino, the rapper was informed by working officer that he would need to conduct a background check before releasing the money to him. Per his lawyer Scott Rosenblum, Nelly (legally Cornell Haynes II) reportedly knew that procedure was false due to him having previously won larger amounts at the same venue and being able to take his winnings home with no issue.\n\nAccording to TMZ, this time however, he wasn't so lucky as the background check ended up showing he had a warrant from 2018 for having no insurance that the \"Hot in Here\" artist was allegedly unaware of. This, in turn, led the officer to put handcuffs on the rapper, arrest him and \"parade him through the casino in front of other patrons.\"\n\nIn a statement to TMZ, Rosenblum blasted the \"overzealous, out of line officer\" for his conduct, clarified that the arrest had more to do the no insurance warrant -- not alleged possession of the drug, and said that an inquiry into the officer would be put in motion.\n\n\"Under similar circumstances, assuming there was an old warrant without any notice to the individual for no proof of insurance, any other citizen would have been told to address it and allowed to go on their way,\" the statement read in part. \"It is also important to note that Mr. Haynes, as part as the requirements to travel internationally is regularly asked to supply proof of no warrants. Including FBI checks. There were none. I am 100% confident this case will go nowhere. And we will be askiing for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\"", "source": {"uri": "theroot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Root"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Grammar_(Hot_Shit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country Grammar (Hot Shit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_State_Highway_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri State Highway Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dilemma (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/88f31a279ca5d2742b2e1050810e0818.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Rosenblum claims that as the officer prepared to take him into custody, they searched him \"without probable cause\" which led to them finding the ecstasy pills.\n\n\"I am 100 percent confident this case will go nowhere,\" Scott Rosenblum said. \"And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct.\" He boosted his claim by revealing that Nelly often travels internationally and is required to prove that he has no active warrants, including times when he has been checked by the FBI. Thus, he had no prior knowledge of the active warrant.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol arrested the RIAA Diamond-certified artist Wednesday morning (Aug. 7). They claimed that the verification check following a major gambling victory was standard across all casinos in the state under their gaming commission regulations.\n\nThis is a less than opportune time for legal troubles as Nelly has been in the honeymoon phase with his old flame Ashanti. The recently rekindled couple got married last year and is expecting their first child.", "source": {"uri": "vibe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vibe"}, "authors": [{"uri": "armon_sadler@vibe.com", "name": "Armon Sadler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashanti (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recording Industry Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_State_Highway_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missouri State Highway Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1416619685-e1723123144446.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1724, "textEnd": 1730}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

He is already a father to two adult children and has also adopted two children of his sister who passed away from leukemia in 2005.\n\nThis article was written in collaboration with Generative AI news company Alchemiq\n\nSources: USA Today, Yahoo Entertainment, ISTO\u00c9, Daily Caller, The Express Tribune, Der Bund, The Music, Pinkvilla, MTV Uutiset, Devdiscourse, HotNewHipHop, ORF, Inquirer, The Nerd Stash, Notiulti, 1News.", "source": {"uri": "ynetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ynetnews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_song", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hit song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Music_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Music Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_a_Dream_(Nelly_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Just a Dream (Nelly song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_in_Herre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hot in Herre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkvilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinkvilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HotNewHipHop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HotNewHipHop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashanti (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leukemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Janet Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORF_(broadcaster)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ORF (broadcaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/08/08/SyNyP7MqC/SyNyP7MqC_0_248_970_547_0_large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Attorney Scott Rosenblum told Page Six on Wednesday that Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Haynes, Jr., was singled out after winning several jackpots at the Hollywood Casino in St. Louis.\n\n\"After winning several jackpots at a venue where Mr. Haynes frequently visits and entertains at its amphitheater; instead of just supervising the transfer of Mr. Haynes' winnings, this officer felt compelled to needlessly run a check for warrants,\" Rosenblum stated.\n\nThe incident unfolded early Wednesday morning when the 49-year-old artist was taken into custody by the Missouri State Highway Patrol's Gaming Division at around 5 a.m. The arrest was initially attributed to a failure-to-appear warrant dating back to 2018 out of Maryland Heights. However, Rosenblum argues that the arresting officer went beyond his duties.\n\nAccording to Rosenblum, the officer justified the background check by claiming it was mandatory for players winning over a certain amount. \"Mr. Haynes knew this to be untrue as he had won several jackpots for similar or greater amounts, including one just a week prior, without incident or a background check,\" Rosenblum explained.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the officer allegedly conducted a search without probable cause and claimed to have found four ecstasy pills in Nelly's personal property. Rosenblum refuted this claim, emphasizing that Nelly often travels internationally and is regularly required to provide proof of no warrants, including FBI checks.\n\n\"I am 100 percent confident this case will go nowhere. And we will be asking for an inquiry into this officer's conduct,\" Rosenblum concluded.", "source": {"uri": "balleralert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baller Alert"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphitheatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amphitheatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Heights,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://balleralert.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1403056110-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

The 45-year-old was gambling at Hollywood Casino in Maryland Heights, Missouri, when he hit a jackpot.\n\nHowever, in accordance with Missouri Gaming Commission regulations, authorities asked for proper identification before he could get his payout, which is when the issue began. Upon verifying who he was, a quick search revealed that he had a warrant out for his arrest for failure to show proof of car insurance. Cops then proceeded to search him and allegedly found four ecstasy pills on him.\n\nThat led to his arrest, and after being searched, he was charged with drug possession when he was taken into custody around 4:45 a.m. The initial warrant is from 2018 when he failed to appear in court due to a lack of insurance.\n\nHowever, Nelly's lawyer, Scott Rosenblum, is fighting the charges, claiming that running his background check wasn't done after prior wins, and they made a spectacle of his client.\n\n\"The officer informed Mr. Haynes a background check was mandated when a player won over a certain amount; Mr. Haynes knew this to be untrue as he had won several jackpots for similar or greater amounts, including one just a week prior without incident or a background check,\" Rosenblum's statement to ET read. \"Once Mr. Haynes was informed of the warrant for a No Proof of Insurance infraction, this officer felt compelled to handcuff Mr. Haynes behind his back and parade him through the casino in front of other patrons.\"\n\nRosenblum goes on to explain that if Nelly wasn't a public figure, he would have been let go and instructed to contact authorities and settle the issue rather than being cuffed. Plus, as an entertainer, he regularly travels out of the country, and if he had any valid warrants, it wouldn't have been possible.\n\nHis lawyer is confident that the charges will ultimately amount to nothing but see how social media is reacting to the news below.", "source": {"uri": "cassiuslife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cassius | born unapologetic | News, Style, Culture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bruce_goodwin_ii@cassiuslife.com", "name": "Bruce Goodwin Ii", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Gaming_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri Gaming Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Heights,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland Heights, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proof (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://cassiuslife.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/47/2024/08/17231349246534.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=560&crop=0,0,100,320px", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799247", "eventUri": "eng-9799247", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

On Wednesday morning (Aug. 7), the artist was booked for possession of four ecstasy pills and not having insurance, per KRCG.\n\nAccording to police records, Nelly, born Cornell Iral Haynes Jr., was arrested at 4:45 am and taken to the Maryland Heights Police Department. The department also confirmed the 49-year-old entertainer had an outstanding traffic summons on Aug. 7.\n\nHe has since been released and no further details of the arrest have been reported.\n\nOn a more positive note, Nelly has had an exciting year in his personal life and career with many things to look forward to. This summer, he has been busy out on the road as the supporting act on Janet Jackson's Together Again Tour.\n\nAdditionally, after rekindling his romance with Ashanti in 2023, the two went all in. They got privately married in December of that year and announced their pregnancy a few months afterward. Since the announcement, the \"Hot In Herre\" rapper has showered his lady with multiple celebrations, including throwing her a surprise baby shower at the Dolce & Gabbana children's boutique in NYC.\n\nOf her baby, the singer told Entertainment Tonight that she's \"excited about seeing this little human version of myself and the person that I love so much be here... I'm really looking forward to having an extension of both of us, be with us, and watching that spirit grow. It's an amazing thing.\"\n\nNelly and Ashanti have been regarded as one of the best spin-the-block success stories in recent years, as their romance began over a decade ago. The two dated the during the 2010s and split in 2013, and the \"Foolish\" singer admitted she closed that chapter of her life. However, after the pair crossed paths in 2021 at Fat Joe and Ja Rule's VERZUZ, where Nelly got her number from DJ City and fast forward to now, they have a baby on the way together.\n\nSpeaking with Entertainment Tonight, Ashanti detailed how the relationship is much different now after they both had a chance to grow during their years apart. \"The growth has been like superb, you know, like on both ends,\" she explained. \"We are both at a place where like before, sometimes we would argue and walk out, slam the door, and not talk for a few days. Now, it's kinda like, 'All right, you good?' It's not like holding on and bickering and we find out what the resolution is...

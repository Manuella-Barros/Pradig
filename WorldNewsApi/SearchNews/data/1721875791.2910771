Just days before his first debate against President Joe Biden in the rematch of the 2020 election, Trump addressed tens of thousands at Temple University\u2019s Liacouras Center. Until Saturday, no Republican presidential candidate had campaigned in a predominantly black Philadelphia neighborhood in years. \u201cWe are going to win this Commonwealth,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPennsylvania [will] tell Crooked Joe Biden, \u2018You\u2019re fired.'\u201d Trump chose Philadelphia to \u2018break the ice\u2019 with minority voters Team Trump black media director Janiyah Thomas shed light on why the 45th president chose to go into Philadelphia, a city whose residents voted for Biden at a greater than 5-to-1 clip in 2020, in a zip code that is 80.9% black. \u201cIf you ask the average voter in these cities, they will say that Joe Biden and the Democrats have abandoned their communities and they are desperate for change,\u201d Thomas told the Washington Examiner. \u201cTeam Trump\u2019s outreach to minority communities is a stark contrast to Joe Biden\u2019s failing campaign, whose only tactic is to gaslight Black voters.\u201d While not the majority demographic, there appeared to be more minorities, and black voters in particular, attending the rally. Several of them shared their thoughts with the Washington Examiner. One 28-year-old black voter named Kevin, who asked only to be identified by his first name and works in an HVAC warehouse, said black voters are \u201cwaking up \u2026 even at the barber shop\u201d and among his coworkers. He thinks Trump\u2019s visit to this part of Philadelphia will help \u201cwake up\u201d more black voters. James Freeman, 40, who works for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, praised Trump for coming to \u201cthe hood\u201d to \u201cmake a statement\u201d with black voters. Freeman said he knows many other black voters who \u201care still in the closet\u201d about their support for the former president. D\u2019Anna Morgan said this November will mark the third time she is voting for Trump. She slammed Biden for his comments suggesting \u201cyou ain\u2019t black\u201d if you vote for Trump, as well as his eulogy for Klansman Robert C. Byrd and the 1994 crime bill, which disproportionately affected the black community. Chris Vinsmoke, a 21-year-old black student from Philadelphia, said he was not interested in politics until Trump helped his cousin, rapper Kodak Black, get out of prison. \u201cI\u2019m just so grateful for Trump,\u201d he said. Ed Moye, the Republican candidate for the 70th Pennsylvania House of Representatives District, said Republicans \u201cshould have done something like this a long time ago\u201d but noted that Trump is the right man to \u201cbreak the ice\u201d in this neighborhood. Saturday\u2019s event is not the first time Trump has courted black voters this election cycle. On Wednesday, his campaign put out a statement commemorating Juneteenth and reflecting \u201con how far we have come as a nation\u201d since the days of slavery and vowed to \u201cadvance the American dream for all people\u201d under his leadership. Last Saturday, Trump launched a group designed to appeal to black voters and spoke at a roundtable at a predominantly black church in Detroit to discuss the new coalition. The former president has also mentioned his legal troubles in attempts to relate to the historical persecution of black people through a two-tiered justice system. Alison Dagnes, chairwoman of Shippensburg University\u2019s Department of Political Science, told the Washington Examiner that Trump\u2019s increased efforts with the black community have a lot to do with the fact that younger black male voters \u201care moving to support Trump, and he is responding accordingly.\u201d In other words, the former president sees it as an opportunity to pounce on. Trump\u2019s efforts have paid off in the polls, as he has cut into Biden\u2019s Pennsylvania lead with black voters since 2020. Last election, Biden took 92% of the black vote. According to a Marist poll from this month, Biden has 68% of support from black voters in the commonwealth, compared to 23% from Trump. Trump supporters say \u2018Let Biden speak\u2019 at Thursday\u2019s debate With the first 2024 presidential debate between Trump and Biden set to take place Thursday, Trump rallygoers weighed in on how the former president should conduct himself onstage. Most voters argued that Trump should just \u201clet Biden speak,\u201d as they said the president should do Trump\u2019s work for him in the CNN showdown. Some others said the presumptive GOP nominee should \u201cbe Trump\u201d and pull no punches during the debate. An orthodox Jewish voter, who asked only to be identified as Akiva, said Trump needs to be \u201chis unhinged self\u201d at the debate because he does not want someone who will \u201cbow down\u201d to his adversaries. Morgan, who was with Akiva at the rally, said she wants to see Trump \u201cdrag Biden all over the floor.\u201d Slim Robinson, 32, from Bucks County, said Trump should just \u201csit on his record\u201d and keep himself tight-lipped apart from that in order to best Biden on Thursday. Brian George, from Philadelphia, echoed a similar sentiment, saying Trump shouldn\u2019t get \u201coverly excited\u201d and should instead focus on \u201cspeaking facts.\u201d Rallygoers identify border and economy as main issues The two main topics those in attendance for Trump\u2019s rally identified in interviews with the Washington Examiner are border security and the economy. They pointed to how they felt Trump handled those issues in particular better than Biden. Freeman said he supports Trump because of Biden\u2019s \u201copen border [and] high inflation,\u201d and because he hopes the former president will \u201clower our taxes even more.\u201d Joseph Kuna, 33, who works for event staff security, pointed to the border, gas prices, \u201ckeeping America first and not feeding the enemy \u2026 and protecting the unborn\u201d as his main concerns going into the election. Brian Rivers, who does fencing work, said the \u201cborders need to be shut down\u201d and that \u201cwe need businesses back in America.\u201d Akiva said the rampant campus antisemitism, which has sparked over 100 civil rights investigations across the country, is why \u201cTrump has to win.\u201d He agreed with the former president\u2019s suggestion at his Wildwood, New Jersey, rally, that Biden should \u201cgive back the money\u201d donated to his campaign by those who fund anti-Israel protests. Owen McLain, 19, from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, is an undecided voter who attended the rally. However, he said Trump could earn his vote at the Saturday event. McLain said he is looking for \u201chow are we going to lower our budget, cut federal spending, fix the border,\u201d and implement \u201cAmerica-first\u201d policies. Michael Picard, 35, was dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit at the rally. He said he was attending as a voice for \u201cfelons for Trump.\u201d Picard, who is a convicted felon, believes felons should be allowed to vote in the election and said the former president\u2019s 34 felony convictions make him want to vote for him even more. Protesters shouted down with \u2018USA\u2019 chants As rallygoers filled the streets near the Liacouras Center, few protesters were spotted until closer to the event time. One protester walked back and forth next to the main admission line, agitating Trump supporters with a megaphone. After things got especially heated, with the protester shouting obscenities and mocking remarks to the crowd and Trump supporters responding with \u201cUSA\u201d chants, one supporter popped a balloon in the protester\u2019s face before others crowded around to engage. Police were on the scene within minutes, and eventually, those who left the area were not allowed back in. The Democratic National Committee also had a billboard truck driving around and parking near the event, playing a DNC-sponsored video criticizing Trump as being bad for the black community. As the rally approached, several protesters wearing orange set up across the street from the Liacouras Center outside Klein Hall, wearing orange Biden-Harris shirts, holding signs, and chanting anti-Trump slogans. Republican congressmen help from afar Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-PA) was in State College, Pennsylvania, for the opening of the Trump Force 47 headquarters in his home county on Saturday. Thompson\u2019s chief of staff, Matt Brennan, told the Washington Examiner that Pennsylvania is seeing an \u201cincredible ground operation come together,\u201d and that the House Republican will \u201ccontinue to do his part to help deliver the 15th Congressional District and Pennsylvania for President Trump, our Senate nominee Dave McCormick, and the unified Republican ticket this November.\u201d CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA) attended a parade Saturday in Pennsylvania, but his campaign manager, Melanie Brewer, told the Washington Examiner that he is involved in expediting entry requests for Trump when he\u2019s in western Pennsylvania and that he has financially contributed to the former president\u2019s 2024 campaign. Brewer said \u201cevery American is feeling\u201d the effects of Biden\u2019s economy \u201cin their pocketbook,\u201d and that people ought to ask themselves if they were better off today than they were four years ago under Trump. She also said the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine would likely not exist to the same extent if Trump had been reelected in 2020.", "summary": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Former President Donald Trump vowed to a Philadelphia crowd that he would win Pennsylvania in November, a feat that has only been accomplished by a Republican once since 1988 when Trump did so in 2016.

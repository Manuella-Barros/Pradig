Thousands of people attempt to enter Spain each year by scaling or swimming around large fences that separate the territories.\n\nAs of Aug. 13, the IOM says total arrivals in Spain were almost 12,000 this year, while more than 124,000 migrants arrived in all of Europe.\n\nMore than 2,400 migrants died in the Mediterranean each year in the last four years, the agency says.", "id": "9769911", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Spain Rescues Nearly 600 People At Sea As Migration Patterns Change | From the Trenches World Report", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 2054, "date": "2017-08-13", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2061}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "88", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "109", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Libya"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "136", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya", "label": {"eng": "Libya"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Morocco"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "137", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Morocco"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Ceuta"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "79981", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta", "label": {"eng": "Ceuta"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Andaluc\u00eda"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "81029", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia", "label": {"eng": "Andaluc\u00eda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Melilla"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "245841", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla", "label": {"eng": "Melilla"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC"}, "id": "302926", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC"}, {"location": null, "score": 4, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "303539", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}, "id": "305067", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sea"}, "id": "306965", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea"}, {"label": {"eng": "RTVE"}, "id": "308163", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTVE"}, {"label": {"eng": "People smuggling"}, "id": "312932", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_smuggling"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "313896", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}, "id": "317111", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times"}, {"label": {"eng": "International Organization for Migration"}, "id": "328709", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Migration"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alboran Sea"}, "id": "334580", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alboran_Sea"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strait of Gibraltar"}, "id": "355898", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar"}, {"label": {"eng": "C.S.

There, they would be held until their relatives on Ceuta, the Spanish territory on Morocco's northern coast, had paid their debt.\n\nPolice arrested one of the smugglers at Algeciras, another two in Ceuta and said two more were on the run and subject to international arrest warrant.\n\nYesterday, Spanish coastguards rescued nearly 600 people from 15 boats and recovered a jet ski in the waters between Morocco and Spain, a route increasingly used by migrants.\n\nAmong them, there were at least 35 children and a baby.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), 8,385 migrants had arrived in Spain this year by August 9.\n\nBut at least 121 had drowned trying to make the same crossing.\n\nAt this rate, the IOM has noted, Spain could overtake Greece as the main route for migrants attempting the Mediterranean crossing.\n\nThe smugglers use small crafts to make the crossing in an effort to slip past Spanish police and coastguard. -- AFP",

The previous month, the body of a child aged between eight and ten was found on a beach in an Almeria national park.\n\nSpain has also seen a surge in arrivals in Ceuta, its enclave in Morocco, where large groups of migrants regularly try to break through the border fence.

suffocate to death.\n\nJames Bradley, 60, already faced one charge of transporting undocumented immigrants, after his truck was found last month near the US-Mexico border in Texas with migrants

There, they would be held until their relatives on Ceuta, the Spanish territory on Morocco's northern coast, had paid their debt.\n\nPolice arrested one of the smugglers at Algeciras, another two in Ceuta and said two more were on the run and subject to international arrest warrant.\n\nOn Wednesday, Spanish coastguards rescued nearly 600 people from 15 boats and recovered a jet ski in the waters between Morocco and Spain, a route increasingly used by migrants.\n\nAmong them, there were at least 35 children and a baby.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 8,385 migrants had arrived in Spain this year by August 9.\n\nBut at least 121 had drowned trying to make the same crossing.\n\nAt this rate, the IOM has noted, Spain could overtake Greece as the main route for migrants attempting the Mediterranean crossing.\n\nThe smugglers use small crafts to make the crossing in an effort to slip past Spanish police and coastguard.", "id":

In the west, migrants mainly leave in the type of boat commonly seen on other European smuggling routes - small fishing boats and motorised rubber dinghies.\n\nTo the east of Tangier, migrants are crossing the Strait of Gibraltar in cheaper options: tiny, rubber paddle boats, with no motor and no need for smugglers and their fees.\n\nBen Khadair, from the Ivory Coast, said he put in \u20ac20 (\u00a318; $23) to contribute to the \u20ac100 cost of a \"toy boat\" bought from a local shop. He and ten others spent 14 hours paddling in a boat designed for four, in a voyage he described as \"suicidal\".\n\nHe made it to a beach in Spain's southernmost city, Tarifa, but the majority don't make it to shore. Nor do they need to. Some aim only for Spanish waters, where they float and call for help.\n\nThis routine is now familiar. Some migrants are even using social media to alert the coastguard, dropping a Whatsapp location pin.\n\nSpain rescues 600 migrants in a day\n\nDeadly Spanish route attracting migrants to Europe\n\nFewer migrants - those who can afford to - pay smugglers up to \u20ac4,000 to take them across by jet ski in just 35 minutes. The Spanish coastguard says it is almost impossible to prevent, and about four to five people are landing on the beaches this way every day.\n\nSo what are the reasons for the increase?\n\nAuthorities and aid workers say they do not know, but sense a number of things. One, that Morocco is a cheaper option than Libya for those using \"toy boats\", and one that bypasses the need for smugglers.\n\nThere is also a slight surge in the number of sub-Saharans travelling to Spain. Many migrants told me they had spent months researching the best routes, and via social media saw the Moroccan sea route had become more established, increasing the number willing to try.\n\nEU coastguard staff at the border agency Frontex say that, from interviews they have held, another factor is the influence of some local Moroccan fishermen, who allegedly have become more willing to act as traffickers. It is apparently a quick way to make money - they allow migrants to disembark halfway across the Strait of Gibraltar, to make the rest of the journey in their smaller dinghies.", "id": "9688309", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Migrants on flimsy boats leave Tangier coast for Spain - BBC News", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/560x315/p05cm09x.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Libya"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "136", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya", "label": {"eng": "Libya"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Morocco"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "137", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Morocco"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Tarifa"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "79030", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarifa", "label": {"eng": "Tarifa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Morocco"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Tangier"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "80682", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangier", "label": {"eng": "Tangier"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coast guard"}, "id": "303604", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_guard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boat"}, "id": "304155", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fishing vessel"}, "id": "305459", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_vessel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sail"}, "id": "306155", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sail"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "306179", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast", "label": {"eng": "Ivory Coast"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}, "id": "306307", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Natural rubber"}, "id": "307272", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber"}, {"label": {"eng": "Border"}, "id": "308560", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smuggling"}, "id": "312714", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toy"}, "id": "323859", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dinghy"}, "id": "329440", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinghy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frontex"}, "id": "334787", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontex"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jet Ski"}, "id": "346313", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Ski"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strait of Gibraltar"}, "id": "355898", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade route"}, "id": "371241", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_route"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 452, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Watercraft", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Watercraft"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 456, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 602, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1354, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Canals", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Canals"}], "time": "12:44:00"}

Orange life vests covered the beaches of northern Lesbos while multiplying numbers of new arrivals slept in fields and at the island's main port.\n\nThat was the fall of 2015.\n\nNow, with international efforts underway to block smugglers and their human cargo on one of the Mediterranean Sea routes to Europe, smugglers are finding alternatives. As a result, Spain is set to overtake Greece this year as a key entry point for migrants, although Italy far and away outpaces the two other countries.\n\nRescue workers carry an injured Moroccan migrant on a stretcher as they arrive to the port of Tarifa, southern Spain, after being rescued with others in the Strait of Gibraltar, Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017. Spain's maritime rescue service has saved more than 600 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea from Morocco in the past 24 hours, making it one of its busiest days so far this year. (AP Photo/ Marcos Moreno)\n\nHere's a look at relocation trends so far this year, based on data from the International Organization for Migration and the United Nations Refugee Agency.\n\n___\n\nITALY APPLIES BRAKES\n\nItaly is bearing the heaviest share of the exodus to Europe, with 97,000 refugees and economic migrants arriving illegally by boat so far this year. The government recently responded with more aggressive policies to prevent migrant boats that typically originate in Libya from reaching its ports.\n\nActions include sending Italian military ships and personnel to assist Libya's coast guard with patrols and interceptions. Human rights groups warn that stopping the boats will expose refugees and migrants to abuse and inhuman living conditions in Libyan detention camps. The Italian government says the stepped-up enforcement appears to be achieving its goal.\n\n___\n\nGREEK RELIEF\n\nThe number of refugees and migrants making it to Greece dropped dramatically last year after several Balkan countries tightened their borders, closing off a main land route migrants were using to reach their destinations in Europe.\n\nA deal the European Union brokered with Turkey to deter people from setting off for Greece also has largely held, despite the ongoing political crisis in that country. NATO-backed patrolling in the Aegean Sea has helped with enforcement of the agreement.\n\nThe number of people arriving to Greek islands fell to 173,450 in 2016 after peaking at more than 850,000 the year before, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. So far this year, 12,440 had arrived as of Aug. 10, the agency said.\n\n___\n\nSURGE IN SPAIN\n\nThe choke points applied to routes that were used to get to Italy and Greece has made Spain a more attractive destination. The 8,385 migrants who reached Spain by sea so far this year is more than double the number for the same period last year.\n\nThe recent surge in boat traffic has alarmed authorities, including the videotaped arrival of a migrant dinghy on a beach filling with vacationers.\n\nThe EU's border protection agency, Frontex, says migrant smuggling networks operating in southern Europe are becoming more skilled.\n\n\"Organized crime groups involved in migrant smuggling have become more flexible and sophisticated,\" the agency said in a 2017 report .\n\n\"Migrant smugglers anticipate law-enforcement actions and prepare for policy changes.\"\n\nEDS NOTE : SPANISH LAW REQUIRES THAT THE FACES OF MINORS ARE MASKED IN PUBLICATIONS WITHIN SPAIN - Young migrants from Morocco queue to change their clothes at the port of Tarifa, southern Spain, after being rescued in the Strait of Gibraltar, Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017.

The numbers heading to Spain and Greece are dwarfed by Italy, which has seen 97,376 arrivals in the first eight months of this year. Although this is a reduction on the 101,512 people who arrived during the same period in 2016, the issue continues to cause problems for the authorities, with almost 5,000 people reaching Italy on one day in June.\n\nWilliam Spindler, a spokesman for UNHCR in Geneva, said: \"There have been three main routes in Europe for many years, for decades: the central Mediterranean one, the eastern one from Turkey to Greece, and there has always been Spain.\n\n\"What is true is that when efforts are made to clamp down on one route, another tends to open up.\"\n\nUNHCR figures show that most of those arriving in Spain by sea set out from Morocco, although some also embark from Algeria. The majority of the migrants are from Cameroon, Guinea and Gambia.\n\nVega said the continuing instability in Libya meant people trying to escape the war in Syria were trying to reach Europe via Ceuta and Melilla.\n\nShe said the agency had noticed an increase in the number of Moroccans travelling to Spain, coinciding with the end of Ramadan and unrest in the Rif region.\n\nAlthough Vega stressed that the situation in Spain was hardly comparable with Italy, she said Madrid needed to do much more.\n\n\"This could be managed quite simply if it were properly addressed,\" she said.\n\n\"[But] if there isn't a proper response, we could see people who have fallen into the clutches of people traffickers becoming merchandise. We're going to see people who should have international protection facing danger if they're returned home.\"\n\nStatistics compiled by the IOM show that more than 113,000 migrants and refugees have entered Europe by sea this year. To date, more than 2,300 have died in the attempt, 119 of them while trying to reach Spain.\n\nItaly has embarked on a flurry of initiatives to reduce numbers, including a diplomatic campaign to persuade tribes in the south of Libya to clamp down on people smugglers.\n\nMarco Minniti, the Italian interior minister, has insisted that NGOs involved in sea rescues sign a code of conduct, which was sharply criticised by the UN-backed IOM.\n\nSeveral aid groups refused to sign the code of conduct because they thought their neutrality would be compromised by taking armed police officers on board. At least three organisations signed it.\n\nThe Italian government remains under pressure, as neighbouring countries have tightened border controls, meaning refugees and migrants are unable to head north to France or Austria as they have done in the past.\n\nOn Wednesday, 70 Austrian troops were deployed to the Brenner pass to help police with border checks, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.\n\nUNHCR said it was too soon to tell whether the recent dip in arrivals in Italy represented a downward trend or a temporary fluctuation.\n\nUnder pressure from the EU, the Libyan coastguard has stepped up interceptions of boats, while some NGOs have suspended work in the central Mediterranean because they felt threatened by Libya's coastguard.\n\nBoth could explain the recent fall in sea crossings, but Spindler said: \"We don't have any hard evidence. We could see an increase in the next few weeks.\"\n\nVega said the international community needed to do more to tackle the root causes of migration, such as conflict, climate change and economic instability, to reduce numbers.\n\n\"It's clear that walls and fences aren't going to deter anyone who's desperate enough to risk their life and those of their children. Whatever lies ahead of them, it can't be worse than what they're leaving behind. They know they could die,\" she said.\n\nThe Spanish government did not respond to a request for comment.", "id": "9681631", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Spain lacks capacity to

There were 35 minors, including a baby among those rescued, AFP reported.\n\nThe number is considered large for Spain, which is becoming an increasingly popular destination for people seeking to reach Europe in the hopes of asylum.\n\nEarlier, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), a UN-related intergovernmental body monitoring and aiding displaced persons and refugees, said Spain may overtake Greece as second most-used gateway to Europe for cross-Mediterranean migration. As of August 9, the IOM recorded 8,385 arrivals in Spain this year compared to 12,191 in Greece over the same period. Italy remains the primary destination for refugees, with 97,293 arrivals recorded by the organization.\n\nThe number of refugee arrivals in Spain has tripled compared to the same period in 2016, according to IOM statistics.\n\nIn July alone, an estimated 2,300 people reached Spain across the sea, more than four times the number of a year ago, according to Frontex, the EU's border agency, which said the dismantling of makeshift camps in Morocco and Algeria contributed to the rise.\n\n\"The high number of boats coming to the Spanish coast this summer is unusual,\" a spokeswoman for Spain's coastguard said on Thursday.\n\nIOM figures say the western route across the Mediterranean Sea is almost as deadly for refugees as the others. An estimated 121 people, or 1.4 percent, died while attempting to cross into Spain. This is compared to 2,242 deaths for the route from Libya to Italy, where over 2 percent of people died in attempts to cross the Mediterranean.\n\nThe organization warned on Friday that the situation may evolve into a major emergency.\n\n\"We understand from our experts in the field that Spain now is going through something like what Greece saw in the beginning of 2015 or Italy even earlier,\" IOM spokesman Joel Millman told a Geneva news briefing. \"Obviously if this grows at the rate it's growing it could be a big emergency.\"\n\nIncreasing pressure on Spain was highlighted last week when refugees arrived in an inflatable dingy at the Los Alemanes beach in the Spanish province of Cadiz right in front of holidaymakers.\n\nPeople trying to get into Spain from Morocco also regularly try to do so on foot, trying to cross into the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in Northern Africa.

The service said it rescued 16 migrants early Thursday in the Strait of Gibraltar, a narrow passage that separates Spain from Morocco. On Wednesday, its vessels rescued 601 migrants, including two in a canoe and six in a beach paddle boat. The service said of the 601, 432 migrants were rescued in the Strait and 169 further east in the Mediterranean. Some 550 of the migrants were from Maghreb countries of northwest Africa and the rest from sub-Saharan African countries. Joel Millman, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration in Geneva, called the influx \"a big number\" for Spain, though Italy has received far more migrants this year. More than 9,000 migrants have reached Spain by sea so far this year, more than the total for all of 2016.\n\n2 Abortion case: A 10-year-old Indian girl who was raped by an uncle, and then lost her legal battle to have an abortion, gave birth Thursday to a girl in Chandigarh. The girl, who was under general anesthesia while the baby was delivered by cesarean section, had not been told she was pregnant and had no idea that she had given birth, doctors said. She was told instead that she had a kidney stone that needed to be removed. The baby was premature and weighed a bit more than 5 pounds. She was placed in an intensive care unit and will ultimately be put up for adoption. \"Neither the girl nor her family even saw the child,\" said Dr. Dasari Harish, head of the team that performed the surgery, adding that the family wanted nothing to do with the newborn. The case, which many Indians found shocking, was watched closely by activists working to overhaul India's abortion law. In India, it is forbidden to abort a fetus after more than 20 weeks unless an exception is granted.\n\n3 Conservationist slain: A U.S. conservation group says its South African co-founder has been shot and killed in Tanzania. The PAMS Foundation said Thursday on Facebook that Wayne Lotter was killed Wednesday night in the Masa-ki district of Dar es Salaam. It says Tanzanian police are investigating.

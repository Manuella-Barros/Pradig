{"id": 227478562, "title": "OpenAI's Apple Deal Sparks Concerns In Microsoft, Could Shift AI Market Dynamics", "text": "Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is concerned about some of OpenAI\u2019s business dealings, particularly a potential agreement between OpenAI and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Satya Nadella recently met with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to discuss this deal involving integrating OpenAI services into Apple products. Nadella\u2019s concerns stem from the potential impact on Microsoft\u2019s product ambitions, the Business Insider reports. Apple\u2019s deal with OpenAI will solidify Altman\u2019s control over the company after his brief ouster last fall. Altman, who has pushed out rivals from the board, aims to replace Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google as Apple\u2019s search partner for Safari and build AI chip factories. However, Microsoft, a significant investor in OpenAI, is concerned about the impact of the Apple deal on its own AI ambitions, according to the New York Post. Apple considered both Google and OpenAI for this multi-billion-dollar deal. If confirmed, this agreement would be a significant win for Altman, who has faced scrutiny from former employees and board members. Tensions within OpenAI have reportedly been brewing since Altman\u2019s brief ouster in November. An insider revealed to The Financial Times that Microsoft pressured OpenAI to prioritize commercial products, exacerbating existing tensions between executives. Despite these challenges, OpenAI\u2019s valuation has soared to $90 billion since launching ChatGPT. Altman is considering converting OpenAI into a for-profit corporation to attract significant capital and expand its AI infrastructure. OpenAI\u2019s annual revenue crossed the $2 billion mark. The ChatGPT parent eyes doubling revenue by 2025. Microsoft stock gained over 26% in the last 12 months. Apple gained 8%. Price Actions: MSFT shares traded higher by 0.06% at $414.93 premarket at the last check Friday. AAPL is down 0.14% at $191.03.

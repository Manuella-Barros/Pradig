Anyone who has ever tried their hand at gardening will know that pests can cause a major blockage in achieving your green space goals. Slugs and snails in particular are known for munching their way through many beloved plants, causing shredded leaves and sometimes even killing plants altogether. Slugs have their preferences when it comes to what to eat, with new growth being in their eyes a seriously tasty snack, along with stunning plants like Delphiniums and Hostas. If you're struggling to find a way to beat the slugs and snails that live in your garden, then this hack is perfect for you. Expert-approved and seriously easily to implement, it's also incredibly inexpensive and will only set you back a mere 83p - leaving your plants and your wallet in tact. Whether you've got a huge garden or a city patio, anyone can enact this incredibly simple gardening hack, that comes straight from garden expert Simon Wardle, the owner of Armstrong Cheshire Patios. As reported in The Sun, this hack requires one common item that is, for a lot of Brits, a summer staple: beer. The yeast in the beer will attract the garden pests, diverting them away from your prized blooms and seedlings and straight towards a good drink of beer instead. The expert explains if your trouble area is in a bed, you should dig a small hole that is the size of a plastic container you have to hand - takeaway containers or ice cream tubs work well he explains - and then simply pour some beer into it to distract the slugs and snails from your plants. If you are worried about potted plants, then you should use a low bowl instead and position it close to the plants in question. \"Make sure you keep the beer topped up as this trick works best with fresh beer,\" the expert explains. \"It works for all beers, so use whatever you already have in the fridge\". The slugs will either meet a watery, yeasty end in the liquid or if you are looking for a more human approach then you simply need to whisk them out and take them to a new habitat outside your garden. The Sun reports \"You can pick up 12 bottles of San Miguel from Tesco for just \u00a310 with a clubcard, which means this trick works out at just 83p - and you can kick back and enjoy a drink when the job is done too.\" Do you have a story to tell?

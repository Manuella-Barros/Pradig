But there is a simple way that they can try. Do you know what it is? It's SMEP - the Sperm-Meets-Egg-Plan. So, let's learn more about it. Calling the plan a \"straightforward and practical approach to help couples trying to conceive\", Dr Ritu Hinduja, fertility consultant, Nova IVF Fertility, Mumbai said, \"It's essentially a structured plan for timing intercourse to maximise the chances of pregnancy.\" How SMEP works The strategy details how you should be timing intercourse for pregnancy or \"baby dance\" as a couple, as shared by Gabriella Shaw, who often shares tips and tricks to beat infertility on Instagram. *Day 8 of your cycle, start baby dancing (sexually active) every other day *Day 10 of your cycle, start taking ovulation tests every day *Once that test is positive (as dark or darker than the control line) the magic starts to happen *Baby dance on the day of the positive test *Baby dance the day after the positive test *Baby dance again the day after the day after (yes, 3rd day in a row) *Skip one day (no, seriously SKIP) *Baby dance one last time after the skip day Here\u2019s a simple breakdown: Understanding the cycle - The menstrual cycle starts on the first day of a woman's period. - Around the middle of the cycle, typically day 14 in a 28-day cycle, ovulation occurs. This is when an egg is released from the ovary. Timing intercourse \"From day 8 of the cycle, couples should start having intercourse every other day. This continues until they get a positive ovulation test,\" said Dr Hinduja. *Once ovulation is detected, they should have intercourse for three consecutive days, skip one day, and then have intercourse once more, added Dr Hinduja. \"This approach is based on the idea that sperm can live inside the female reproductive tract for up to five days, and the egg is viable for about 24 hours after ovulation. By timing intercourse around these fertile days, the chances of sperm meeting the egg are maximised,\" elucidated Dr Hinduja.

Things to note If a woman under 35 has been trying this method for a year without success, or if a woman over 35 has been trying for six months without success, it's advisable to see a fertility physician, said Dr Hinduja. \"Fertility issues can have various causes, and a specialist can help identify and address any underlying problems, increasing the chances of conception,\" said Dr Hinduja.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/sperm-egg-plan-beat-infertility-conceive-naturally-experts-benefits-timing-sex-9358670/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/couples-therapy_1600_freepik.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:04:11", "author": "Lifestyle Desk", "authors": ["Lifestyle Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.17}

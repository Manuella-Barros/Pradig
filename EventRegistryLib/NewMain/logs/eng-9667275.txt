Chambers said the shooting happened at 8:45 p.m.\n\nChambers said as officers tried to get the crowd to safety that several people struck OPD officers. At least one person was taken into custody for assaulting an officer, he said. Police did not say how many officers were struck in the face or pushed.\n\nA KTVU crew at the scene saw a large police presence with as many as two dozen police vehicles. Multiple ambulances were at the scene and several city blocks were closed. Police said 28 officers and four sergeants were at the scene to monitor the event.\n\nThe mood at the scene was described as chaotic and confrontational. Participants in the celebration were seen getting verbal with police. Some people at the event criticized the police response, saying they didn't respond quickly enough when people were injured. We have also heard that police were overwhelmed by the size of the crowd.\n\nWhen KTVU arrived, one man was seen being loaded into an ambulance. There were early reports of four people who were shot and another person who was hit by a car. The police did not confirm this information.\n\nTamia Robinson of Richmond said her friend was shot and killed at the event. She said there were sideshows, fighting and that fireworks were going off, which added to the confusion. She said she ran from the sound of the fireworks.\n\nRobinson said she had gone to the celebration at around 7 p.m. and noticed things started to go south at around 8:45 p.m. She claimed police used excessive force.\n\nPolice said they could not confirm any deaths.\n\n\"We don't have enough love in the community. We don't have enough outreach for the youth. And this is what happens when you do not have enough resources and you just have bulls in a ring,\" Robinson said. \"I'm very disappointed.

The incident occurred at Lake Merritt on Wednesday night, just before 9 PM. At least four individuals were hospitalized with gunshot wounds.\n\nThe violence erupted after a mostly peaceful Juneteenth celebration that drew around 5,000 people to the lake earlier in the evening. Michael Hunt, spokesperson for the Oakland Fire Department, indicated the number of injured might have increased since his last update at 10:24 PM, according to CBS News.\n\nAuthorities received reports of gunfire near Grand and Euclid Avenues around 9 PM, where a large crowd had gathered for an unsanctioned sideshow event. Witness Tamia Robinson told ABC7 News that what initially sounded like fireworks soon turned into multiple gunshots, causing panic. She described how her sister ran to a friend who was lying on the ground.\n\nAnother witness, Tamira Robinson from Richmond, expressed her disappointment to KTVU, lamenting the inability to gather as a community without violence. Footage from journalist Jaden Shaul of KTVU and user @1SaltyDorito on X shows the chaotic aftermath, with people fleeing the scene. An Instagram video by user 28madi_ captured a woman kneeling before multiple gunshots rang out, prompting her to flee.\n\nThe condition of the gunshot victims remains unknown, and additional injuries were reported. Oakland Police Department's strategic communications manager, Paul Chambers, noted that the event had been largely peaceful until about 8:15 PM when a sideshow involving motorbikes and vehicles began at Bellevue and Grand Avenues. A fight broke out nearby, and multiple shots were fired around 8:45 PM.\n\nChambers reported that some officers were struck by the crowd as they tried to ensure safety, with one person arrested for assaulting an officer. Residents have been advised to avoid the area of I-580 at Grand Avenue as the investigation continues.\n\nIn a statement, Oakland Police said they are investigating the shooting, which occurred just after 8:45 PM on June 19, 2024, in the 400 block of Grand Avenue. Preliminary findings show that 28 officers and four sergeants were monitoring a crowd of roughly 5,000 people at Lake Merritt. The gathering was peaceful until an illegal sideshow led to a fight and subsequent gunfire.\n\nSeveral victims were transported to hospitals, some by medical personnel and others by private means. There are no reported fatalities, and the number of injured is still being determined. No arrests have been made in connection with the shooting, and it is unclear if there was one or multiple shooters. During the incident, officers were assaulted as they tried to guide the crowd to safety, resulting in minor injuries and one arrest for assaulting an officer.\n\nJuneteenth, celebrated on June 19, marks the emancipation of enslaved African Americans and is recognized as America's Second Independence Day.

During the sideshow, someone walked across the hood of a vehicle, which lead to multiple people exiting the car and \"violently attacking\" the person. This then led to multiple fights breaking out along Grand Avenue between Euclid and Bellevue avenues.\n\n\"Unfortunately, these fights escalated into multiple people discharging firearms, with more than 50 shell casings being recovered,\" said Mitchell.\n\nAs officers arrived and began to render aid to injured people, Mitchell said individuals within the crowd began to attack officers. Deputy Chief James Beere said that officers were punched in the face and upper body.\n\nIn total, 15 people went to the hospital with gunshot wounds and one person was treated for an undisclosed injury. The victims are between 20 to 30 years of age, Mitchell said. Their injuries ranged from minor gunshot or flesh wounds to loss of fingers.

He also said a larger police presence will be planned for the Fourth of July.\n\n\"The opportunity to celebrate with your family and friends should never be marred by gunfire,\" said Mitchell, adding that the department will \"work tirelessly\" to identify and arrest the suspects involved in Wednesday's shootings.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideshow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sideshow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Merritt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Merritt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-terrain_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-terrain vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunshot_wound", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gunshot wound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cartridge (firearms)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bellevue, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bellevue, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Oakland,_Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Oakland, Oakland, California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/20/2d3e013f-740c-4d22-9c66-684515dc4e5d/thumbnail/1200x630/314c5e88528ed52ff99b594509fa14e8/oakshootscn.jpg?v=cb1f2643a8816828741cfb3a3fb2d931", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667275", "eventUri": "eng-9667275", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 456620540, "relevance": 2}

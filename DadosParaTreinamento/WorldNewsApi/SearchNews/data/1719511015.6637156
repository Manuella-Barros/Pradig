Musker, who co-directed some of the studio\u2019s most popular films in recent decades, like \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d \u201cAladdin\u201d and \u201cMoana,\u201d commented on the state of Disney in a recent interview, saying the company needs to steer away from pushing a woke message and focus on characters and story above all. \u201cI think they need to do a course correction a bit in terms of putting the message secondary, behind entertainment and compelling story and engaging characters,\u201d Musker told Spanish outlet El Pa\u00eds while at the Animayo International Summit in Gran Canaria last week. The director, who also helmed 2009\u2019s \u201cThe Princess and The Frog\u201d alongside co-director Ron Clements, got onto the subject of wokeness at Disney by bringing up criticism that the film about a Black princess was woke. \u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to be woke, although I understand the criticism,\u201d Musker said, following with commentary that the more recent films seem to be opting for message over story. \u201cThe classic Disney films didn\u2019t start out trying to have a message. They wanted you to get involved in the characters and the story and the world, and I think that\u2019s still the heart of it,\u201d Musker said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to exclude agendas, but you have to first create characters who you sympathize with and who are compelling.\u201d Disney has faced significant backlash in recent years from critics arguing that the media giant has promoted a woke agenda. Its corporate leaders have repeatedly clashed with conservative lawmakers, most notably Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The company has experienced box office disappointments \u2014 like 2022\u2019s pro-LGBTQ \u201cLightyear\u201d \u2014 massive layoffs and a loss of 2.4 million subscribers from its Disney+ streaming service. Musker noted that the political agenda was never as aggressive at Disney during his heyday in the 1990s and 2000s as it is now, but he did have to alter some content for the sake of political correctness. He told El Pa\u00eds that he had to change the name of the city of Baghdad to \u201cAgrabah\u201d in \u201cAladdin\u201d because of the Gulf War happening at the time. \u201cBecause of the war, we couldn\u2019t even go there to do research. Our big research took place at the Saudi Arabian expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center,\u201d Musker said.

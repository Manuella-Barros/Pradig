So we do hope it could be a potential cure.\"\n\nAuditory neuropathy can be caused by a fault in the OTOF gene, which is responsible for making a protein called otoferlin. This enables cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve.\n\nTo overcome the fault, the \"new era\" gene therapy - from biotech firm Regeneron - delivers a working copy of the gene to the ear.\n\nIn Opal's case, she received an infusion containing the working gene to her right ear during surgery last September.\n\nHer parents Jo and James, both 33, noticed improvements to her hearing in four weeks when Opal turned her head to loud clapping.\n\n\"When she first turned, I couldn't believe it,\" said Mrs Sandy, \"I thought it was a fluke or like a change in light or something that had caught her eye, but I repeated it a few times.\"\n\n\"I picked my phone up and texted James, and said 'I think it's working'. I was absolutely gobsmacked. I thought it was a fluke.\"\n\nBut even more impressive results were on the horizon. Some 24 weeks after surgery, in February this year, tests in Cambridge showed Opal could also hear soft sounds such as a whisper.\n\n\"The audiologist played back some of the sounds that she was responding to and they were ridiculously quiet sort of sounds that in the real world wouldn't catch your attention during a conversation,\" Mrs Sandy said.\n\n\"Certainly since February, we've noticed her sister (Nora) waking her up in the morning because she's running around on the landing, or someone rings on the door so her nap's cut short.\"\n\n\"She's definitely responding more to sort of what we would call functional sounds rather than just sounds that we use to test her.\"\n\n\"We were told she had near normal hearing last time - I think they got responses at sort of 25 to 30 decibels. I think normal hearing is classed at 20 decibels, so she's not far off. Before, she had no hearing whatsoever.\"\n\nProf Bance said Opal's hearing is now \"close to normal\", adding, \"We hope she'll get back to normal by the next testing.\"\n\nHe added that the treatment is \"a one-and-done therapy, so hopefully you have your treatment and then you go back to your life\".\n\nA second child has also received the gene therapy treatment at Cambridge University Hospitals, with positive results seen recently, six weeks after surgery.\n\nThe overall phase 1/2 Chord trial consists of three parts, with three deaf children, including Opal, receiving a low dose of gene therapy in one ear only.\n\nA different set of three children will get a high dose on one side. Then, if that is shown to be safe, more children will receive a dose in both ears at the same time.\n\nUp to 18 youngsters from the UK, Spain and the US are being recruited to the trial and will be followed up for five years. Prof Bance said, \"My entire life, gene therapy has been 'five years away', and I've been in practice about 30 years.\n\n\"So, for me, it was almost unreal that this moment had arrived.\"\n\n\"It was just the fact that we've been hearing about this for so long, and there's been so much work, decades of work ... to finally see something that actually worked in humans ... It was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really. It felt very special.\"\n\nAt the moment, the gold standard treatment for auditory neuropathy is cochlear implants.\n\nOpal had one fitted to her left ear at the same time as she underwent gene therapy in her right ear, to ensure she got hearing as soon as possible.\n\nThe toddler is the first patient globally to receive the Regeneron therapy and \"she's the youngest globally that's been done to date as far as we know,\" Prof Bance said.\n\nChina has also been working on targeting the same gene, with positive results, though Prof Bance said theirs uses a different technology and slightly different mode of delivery.\n\nMedics in Philadelphia have also reported a good outcome with a type of gene therapy on an 11-year-old boy, who was operated on after Opal.\n\nProf Bance said he believes the trial is \"just the beginning of gene therapies\", adding, \"It marks a new era in the treatment for deafness.\"\n\nThe treatment was currently not available on the NHS.\n\nWant a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories? Listen to our latest podcasts to find out What You Need To Know...\n\nMartin McLean, senior policy adviser at the National Deaf Children's Society, welcomed the study, saying it would lead to learning regarding gene therapies for deafness with a specific genetic cause.\n\n\"We would like to emphasise that, with the right support from the start, deafness should never be a barrier to happiness or fulfilment,\" he said.\n\n\"As a charity, we support families to make informed choices about medical technologies, so that they can give their deaf child the best possible start in life.\"\n\nProfessor Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, said: \"This trial will transform the life of 18-month-old Opal Sandy while offering hope to many others like her, and is another example of the NHS being a global leader in developing gene therapy for patients.\"", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

So we do hope it could be a potential cure.\"\n\nAuditory neuropathy can be caused by a fault in the OTOF gene, which is responsible for making a protein called otoferlin. This enables cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve.\n\nTo overcome the fault, the \"new era\" gene therapy - from biotech firm Regeneron - delivers a working copy of the gene to the ear.\n\nIn Opal's case, she received an infusion containing the working gene to her right ear during surgery last September.\n\nWhen (Opal) first turned (her head to loud clapping), I couldn't believe it. I thought it was a fluke ... but I repeated it a few times. I picked my phone up and texted James, and said 'I think it's working'. I was absolutely gobsmacked\n\nHer parents Jo and James, both 33, noticed improvements to her hearing in four weeks when Opal turned her head to loud clapping.\n\n\"When she first turned, I couldn't believe it,\" Mrs Sandy told PA.\n\n\"I thought it was a fluke or like a change in light or something that had caught her eye, but I repeated it a few times.\n\n\"I picked my phone up and texted James, and said 'I think it's working'. I was absolutely gobsmacked. I thought it was a fluke.\"\n\nBut even more impressive results were on the horizon.\n\nSome 24 weeks after surgery, in February this year, tests in Cambridge showed Opal could also hear soft sounds such as a whisper.\n\n\"The audiologist played back some of the sounds that she was responding to and they were ridiculously quiet sort of sounds that in the real world wouldn't catch your attention during a conversation,\" Mrs Sandy said.\n\n\"Certainly since February, we've noticed her sister (Nora) waking her up in the morning because she's running around on the landing, or someone rings on the door so her nap's cut short.\n\n\"She's definitely responding more to sort of what we would call functional sounds rather than just sounds that we use to test her.\n\n\"We were told she had near normal hearing last time - I think they got responses at sort of 25 to 30 decibels.\n\n\"I think normal hearing is classed at 20 decibels, so she's not far off. Before, she had no hearing whatsoever.\"\n\nProf Bance said Opal's hearing is now \"close to normal\", adding: \"We hope she'll get back to normal by the next testing.\"\n\n(The trial) marks a new era in the treatment for deafness. It also supports the development of other gene therapies that may prove to make a difference in other genetic-related hearing conditions\n\nHe added that the treatment is \"a one-and-done therapy, so hopefully you have your treatment and then you go back to your life\".\n\nA second child has also received the gene therapy treatment at Cambridge University Hospitals, with positive results seen recently, six weeks after surgery.\n\nThe overall phase 1/2 Chord trial consists of three parts, with three deaf children, including Opal, receiving a low dose of gene therapy in one ear only.\n\nA different set of three children will get a high dose on one side. Then, if that is shown to be safe, more children will receive a dose in both ears at the same time.\n\nUp to 18 youngsters from the UK, Spain and the US are being recruited to the trial and will be followed up for five years.\n\nProf Bance said: \"My entire life, gene therapy has been 'five years away', and I've been in practice about 30 years.\n\n\"So, for me, it was almost unreal that this moment had arrived.\n\n\"It was just the fact that we've been hearing about this for so long, and there's been so much work, decades of work ... to finally see something that actually worked in humans ... It was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really.\n\n\"It felt very special.\"\n\nAt the moment, the gold standard treatment for auditory neuropathy is cochlear implants.\n\nOpal had one fitted to her left ear at the same time as she underwent gene therapy in her right ear, to ensure she got hearing as soon as possible.\n\nThe youngster is the first patient globally to receive the Regeneron therapy and \"she's the youngest globally that's been done to date as far as we know,\" Prof Bance said.\n\nAs a charity, we support families to make informed choices about medical technologies, so that they can give their deaf child the best possible start in life\n\nChina has also been working on targeting the same gene, with positive results, though Prof Bance said theirs uses a different technology and slightly different mode of delivery.\n\nMedics in Philadelphia have also reported a good outcome with a type of gene therapy on an 11-year-old boy, who was operated on after Opal.\n\nProf Bance said he believes the trial is \"just the beginning of gene therapies\", adding: \"It marks a new era in the treatment for deafness.\n\n\"It also supports the development of other gene therapies that may prove to make a difference in other genetic-related hearing conditions, many of which are more common than auditory neuropathy.\"\n\nHe said it could take a while for more children to benefit from gene therapy. The treatment was currently not available on the NHS.\n\n\"What's really helped though is that the NHS does pay for genetic testing now for hearing loss,\" he said.\n\nOpal's surgery, which was carried out under general anaesthetic, was very similar to fitting a cochlear implant, Prof Bance continued.\n\n\"So basically, we find the inner ear and we open the inner ear and we infuse the treatment, in this particular case using a catheter, over 16 minutes,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to make a release hole in another part of the ear to let the treatment out because it has to go all the way through the ear.\n\n\"And then we just repair and close up, so it's actually a very similar approach to a cochlear implant, except we don't put the implant in.\"\n\nMartin McLean, senior policy adviser at the National Deaf Children's Society, welcomed the study, saying it would lead to learning regarding gene therapies for deafness with a specific genetic cause.\n\n\"We would like to emphasise that, with the right support from the start, deafness should never be a barrier to happiness or fulfilment,\" he said.\n\nThis trial will transform the life of 18-month-old Opal Sandy while offering hope to many others like her, and is another example of the NHS being a global leader in developing gene therapy for patients\n\n\"As a charity, we support families to make informed choices about medical technologies, so that they can give their deaf child the best possible start in life.\"\n\nProfessor Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, said: \"This trial will transform the life of 18-month-old Opal Sandy while offering hope to many others like her, and is another example of the NHS being a global leader in developing gene therapy for patients.\n\n\"The NHS has led the world in the development of a range of other innovations and therapies, and this is a very welcome addition to the work going on with life sciences organisations around England to expand the range of treatments available.\"\n\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Victoria Atkins said: \"I am delighted and proud of what this government-backed trial has done for Opal, and what it could eventually do for children like her across the world.\n\n\"It marks an historic milestone as we develop a cure for this kind of deafness.\"", "source": {"uri": "indy100.com", "dataType": "news",

So we do hope it could be a potential cure.\"\n\nAuditory neuropathy can be caused by a fault in the OTOF gene. This gene is responsible for making a protein called otoferlin, which enables cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve.\n\nTo overcome the fault, the \"new era\" gene therapy - from biotech firm Regeneron - delivers a working copy of the gene to the ear.\n\nIn Opal's case, she received an infusion containing the working gene in her right ear during surgery last Sept.\n\nHer parents, Jo and James, both 33, noticed improvements to her hearing in four weeks when Opal turned her head to loud clapping.\n\n\"When she first turned, I couldn't believe it,\" Mrs Sandy told PA.\n\n\"I thought it was a fluke or like a change in light or something that had caught her eye, but I repeated it a few times.\n\n\"I picked up my phone and texted James, 'I think it's working.' I was absolutely gobsmacked. I thought it was a fluke.\"\n\nBut even more impressive results were on the horizon.\n\nSome 24 weeks after surgery, in February this year, tests in Cambridge showed Opal could hear soft sounds such as a whisper.\n\n\"The audiologist played back some of the sounds that she was responding to and they were ridiculously quiet sort of sounds that in the real world wouldn't catch your attention during a conversation,\" Mrs Sandy said.\n\n\"Certainly, since February, we've noticed her sister (Nora) waking her up in the morning because she's running around on the landing or someone rings on the door, so her nap's cut short. She's definitely responding more to sort of what we would call functional sounds rather than sounds that we use to test her. We were told she had a near-normal hearing last time - I think they got responses at sort of 25 to 30 decibels. I think normal hearing is classed at 20 decibels, so she's not far off. Before, she had no hearing whatsoever.\"\n\nProf Bance said Opal's hearing is now \"close to normal,\" adding: \"We hope she'll get back to normal by the next testing.\"\n\nHe added that the treatment is \"a one-and-done therapy, so hopefully you have your treatment and then you go back to your life.\"\n\nA second child has also received gene therapy treatment at Cambridge University Hospitals, with positive results seen recently, six weeks after surgery.\n\nThe overall phase 1/2 Chord trial consists of three parts, with three deaf children, including Opal, receiving a low dose of gene therapy in one ear only. A different set of three children will get a high dose on one side. Then, if that is shown to be safe, more children will receive a dose in both ears at the same time. Up to 18 youngsters from the U.K., Spain, and the U.S. are being recruited for the trial and will be followed up for five years.\n\nAt the moment, the gold standard treatment for auditory neuropathy is cochlear implants.\n\nOpal had one fitted to her left ear at the same time as she underwent gene therapy in her right ear to ensure she got hearing as soon as possible.\n\nThe youngster is the first patient globally to receive the Regeneron therapy, and \"she's the youngest globally, and that's been done to date as far as we know,\" professor Bance said.\n\nChina has also been working on targeting the same gene, with positive results, though professor Bance said theirs uses a different technology and slightly different mode of delivery.\n\nMedics in Philadelphia have also reported a good outcome with a type of gene therapy on an 11-year-old boy who was operated on after Opal.\n\nOpal's surgery, which was carried out under general anesthetic, was very similar to fitting a cochlear

So we do hope it could be a potential cure.\"\n\nAuditory neuropathy can be caused by a fault in the OTOF gene, which is responsible for making a protein called otoferlin. This enables cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve.\n\nTo overcome the fault, the \"new era\" gene therapy - from biotech firm Regeneron - delivers a working copy of the gene to the ear.\n\nIn Opal's case, she received an infusion containing the working gene to her right ear during surgery last September.\n\nHer parents Jo and James, both 33, noticed improvements to her hearing in four weeks when Opal turned her head to loud clapping.\n\n\"When she first turned, I couldn't believe it,\" Mrs Sandy told PA.\n\n\"I thought it was a fluke or like a change in light or something that had caught her eye, but I repeated it a few times.\n\n\"I picked my phone up and texted James, and said 'I think it's working'. I was absolutely gobsmacked. I thought it was a fluke.\"\n\nBut even more impressive results were on the horizon.\n\nSome 24 weeks after surgery, in February this year, tests in Cambridge showed Opal could also hear soft sounds such as a whisper.\n\n\"The audiologist played back some of the sounds that she was responding to and they were ridiculously quiet sort of sounds that in the real world wouldn't catch your attention during a conversation,\" Mrs Sandy said.\n\n\"Certainly since February, we've noticed her sister (Nora) waking her up in the morning because she's running around on the landing, or someone rings on the door so her nap's cut short.\n\n\"She's definitely responding more to sort of what we would call functional sounds rather than just sounds that we use to test her.\n\n\"We were told she had near normal hearing last time - I think they got responses at sort of 25 to 30 decibels.\n\n\"I think normal hearing is classed at 20 decibels, so she's not far off. Before, she had no hearing whatsoever.\"\n\nProf Bance said Opal's hearing is now \"close to normal\", adding: \"We hope she'll get back to normal by the next testing.\"\n\nHe added that the treatment is \"a one-and-done therapy, so hopefully you have your treatment and then you go back to your life\".\n\nA second child has also received the gene therapy treatment at Cambridge University Hospitals, with positive results seen recently, six weeks after surgery.\n\nThe overall phase 1/2 Chord trial consists of three parts, with three deaf children, including Opal, receiving a low dose of gene therapy in one ear only.\n\nA different set of three children will get a high dose on one side. Then, if that is shown to be safe, more children will receive a dose in both ears at the same time.\n\nUp to 18 youngsters from the UK, Spain and the US are being recruited to the trial and will be followed up for five years.\n\nProf Bance said: \"My entire life, gene therapy has been 'five years away', and I've been in practice about 30 years.\n\n\"So, for me, it was almost unreal that this moment had arrived.\n\n\"It was just the fact that we've been hearing about this for so long, and there's been so much work, decades of work ... to finally see something that actually worked in humans ... It was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really.\n\n\"It felt very special.\"\n\nAt the moment, the gold standard treatment for auditory neuropathy is cochlear implants.\n\nOpal had one fitted to her left ear at the same time as she underwent gene therapy in her right ear, to ensure she got hearing as soon as possible.\n\nThe youngster is the first patient globally to receive the Regeneron therapy and \"she's the youngest globally that's been done to date as far as we know,\" Prof Bance said.\n\nChina has also been working on targeting the same gene, with positive results, though Prof Bance said theirs uses a different technology and slightly different mode of delivery.\n\nMedics in Philadelphia have also reported a good outcome with a type of gene therapy on an 11-year-old boy, who was operated on after Opal.\n\nProf Bance said he believes the trial is \"just the beginning of gene therapies\", adding: \"It marks a new era in the treatment for deafness.\n\n\"It also supports the development of other gene therapies that may prove to make a difference in other genetic-related hearing conditions, many of which are more common than auditory neuropathy.\"\n\nHe said it could take a while for more children to benefit from gene therapy.

So we do hope it could be a potential cure.\"\n\nAuditory neuropathy can be caused by a fault in the OTOF gene, which is responsible for making a protein called otoferlin. This enables cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve.\n\nTo overcome the fault, the \"new era\" gene therapy - from biotech firm Regeneron - delivers a working copy of the gene to the ear.\n\nIn Opal's case, she received an infusion containing the working gene to her right ear during surgery last September.\n\nHer parents Jo and James, both 33, noticed improvements to her hearing in four weeks when Opal turned her head to loud clapping.\n\n\"When she first turned, I couldn't believe it,\" Mrs Sandy told PA.\n\n\"I thought it was a fluke or like a change in light or something that had caught her eye, but I repeated it a few times.\n\n\"I picked my phone up and texted James, and said 'I think it's working'. I was absolutely gobsmacked. I thought it was a fluke.\"\n\nBut even more impressive results were on the horizon.\n\nSome 24 weeks after surgery, in February this year, tests in Cambridge showed Opal could also hear soft sounds such as a whisper.\n\n\"The audiologist played back some of the sounds that she was responding to and they were ridiculously quiet sort of sounds that in the real world wouldn't catch your attention during a conversation,\" Mrs Sandy said.\n\n\"Certainly since February, we've noticed her sister (Nora) waking her up in the morning because she's running around on the landing, or someone rings on the door so her nap's cut short.\n\n\"She's definitely responding more to sort of what we would call functional sounds rather than just sounds that we use to test her.\n\n\"We were told she had near normal hearing last time - I think they got responses at sort of 25 to 30 decibels.\n\n\"I think normal hearing is classed at 20 decibels, so she's not far off. Before, she had no hearing whatsoever.\"\n\nProf Bance said Opal's hearing is now \"close to normal\", adding: \"We hope she'll get back to normal by the next testing.\"\n\nHe added that the treatment is \"a one-and-done therapy, so hopefully you have your treatment and then you go back to your life\".\n\nA second child has also received the gene therapy treatment at Cambridge University Hospitals, with positive results seen recently, six weeks after surgery.\n\nThe overall phase 1/2 Chord trial consists of three parts, with three deaf children, including Opal, receiving a low dose of gene therapy in one ear only.\n\nA different set of three children will get a high dose on one side. Then, if that is shown to be safe, more children will receive a dose in both ears at the same time.\n\nUp to 18 youngsters from the UK, Spain and the US are being recruited to the trial and will be followed up for five years.\n\nProf Bance said: \"My entire life, gene therapy has been 'five years away', and I've been in practice about 30 years.\n\n\"So, for me, it was almost unreal that this moment had arrived.\n\n\"It was just the fact that we've been hearing about this for so long, and there's been so much work, decades of work ... to finally see something that actually worked in humans ... It was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really.\n\n\"It felt very special.\"\n\nAt the moment, the gold standard treatment for auditory neuropathy is cochlear implants.\n\nOpal had one fitted to her left ear at the same time as she underwent gene therapy in her right ear, to ensure she got hearing as soon as possible.\n\nThe youngster is the first patient globally to receive the Regeneron therapy and \"she's the youngest globally that's been done to date as far as we know,\" Prof Bance said.\n\nChina has also been working on targeting the same gene, with positive results, though Prof Bance said theirs uses a different technology and slightly different mode of delivery.\n\nMedics in Philadelphia have also reported a good outcome with a type of gene therapy on an 11-year-old boy, who was operated on after Opal.\n\nProf Bance said he believes the trial is \"just the beginning of gene therapies\", adding: \"It marks a new era in the treatment for deafness.\n\n\"It also supports the development of other gene therapies that may prove to make a difference in other genetic-related hearing conditions, many of which are more common than auditory neuropathy.\"\n\nHe said it could take a while for more children to benefit from gene therapy. The treatment was currently not available on the NHS.\n\n\"What's really helped though is that the NHS does pay for genetic testing now for hearing loss,\" he said.\n\nOpal's surgery, which was carried out under general anaesthetic, was very similar to fitting a cochlear implant, Prof Bance continued.\n\n\"So basically, we find the inner ear and we open the inner ear and we infuse the treatment, in this particular case using a catheter, over 16 minutes,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to make a release hole in another part of the ear to let the treatment out because it has to go all the way through the ear.\n\n\"And then we just repair and close up, so it's actually a very similar approach to a cochlear implant, except we don't put the implant in.\"\n\nMartin McLean, senior policy adviser at the National Deaf Children's Society, welcomed the study, saying it would lead to learning regarding gene therapies for deafness with a specific genetic cause.\n\n\"We would like to emphasise that, with the right support from the start, deafness should never be a barrier to happiness or fulfilment,\" he said.\n\n\"As a charity, we support families to make informed choices about medical technologies, so that they can give their deaf child the best possible start in life.\"\n\nProfessor Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, said: \"This trial will transform the life of 18-month-old Opal Sandy while offering hope to many others like her, and is another example of the NHS being a global leader in developing gene therapy for patients.\n\n\"The NHS has led the world in the development of a range of other innovations and therapies, and this is a very welcome addition to the work going on with life sciences organisations around England to expand the range of treatments available.\"\n\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Victoria Atkins said: \"I am delighted and proud of what this government-backed trial has done for Opal, and what it could eventually do for children like her across the world.\n\n\"It marks an historic milestone as we develop a cure for this kind of deafness.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

I thought it was a fluke or like a change in light or something that had caught her eye, but I repeated it a few times. I picked my phone up and texted James, and said 'I think it's working'. I was absolutely gobsmacked. I thought it was a fluke.\"\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, clinicians noticed continuous improvement in Opal's hearing and at 24 weeks confirmed that she has close to normal hearing levels for soft sounds, such as whispering, in her treated ear.\n\n\"We were so happy when the clinical team confirmed at 24 weeks that her hearing was also picking up softer sounds and speech. Everyone was so excited such amazing results had been achieved,\" said Jo.\n\n\"The audiologist played back some of the sounds that she was responding to and they were ridiculously quiet sort of sounds that in the real world wouldn't catch your attention during a conversation.\n\n\"Since February, we've noticed her sister (Nora) waking her up in the morning because she's running around on the landing, or someone rings on the door so her nap's cut short.\n\n\"She's definitely responding more to sort of what we would call functional sounds rather than just sounds that we use to test her.\n\n\"We were told she had near normal hearing last time - I think they got responses at sort of 25 to 30 decibels.\n\n\"I think normal hearing is classed at 20 decibels, so she's not far off. Before, she had no hearing whatsoever.\"\n\nThe gene therapy was created by US biotech firm Regeneron.\n\nProf Manohar Bance, chief investigator of the trial, and an ear surgeon at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Addenbrooke's, said: \"These results are spectacular and better than I expected. Gene therapy has been the future of otology and audiology for many years and I'm so excited that it is now finally here. This is hopefully the start of a new era for gene therapies for the inner ear and many types of hearing loss.\"\n\nAuditory neuropathy can be caused by the variation of a single gene - OTOF - which produces a protein called otoferlin that is needed to allow the inner hair cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve.\n\nAbout 20,000 people across the UK, Germany, France, Spain and Italy are deaf due to a mutation in the OTOF gene.\n\nChildren with a variation in this gene often pass the standard newborn screening test because the hair cells are working, but they are not communicating with the nerve.\n\nThis means their hearing loss may not be detected until they are two or three years old, by which time it will have caused a noticeable delay in their speech development.\n\nThe CHORD trial, which was launched in May 2023, was designed to show whether gene therapy can provide hearing for children born with auditory neuropathy.\n\nProf Bance said: \"We have a short time frame to intervene because of the rapid pace of brain development at this age. Delays in the diagnosis can also cause confusion for families as the many reasons for delayed speech and late intervention can impact a children's development.\"\n\nStandard NHS genetic testing can detect mutations in the OTOF gene.\n\nIn Opal's case, she was identified as being at risk as her older sister has the condition. A genetic test when she was three weeks old confirmed she had it too.\n\nIn the trial, Opal was given an infusion containing a harmless virus called AAV1, which delivered a working copy of the OTOF gene via an injection in the cochlea during surgery carried out under general anaesthesia.\n\nWhile Opal, from Oxfordshire, was being given the gene therapy in right ear during the procedure, a cochlear implant was also fitted in her left ear.\n\nJames Sandy, Opal's father said: \"It was our ultimate goal for Opal to hear all the speech sounds. It's already making a difference to our day-to-day lives, like at bath-time or swimming, when Opal can't wear her cochlear implant.\n\n\"We feel so proud to have contributed to such pivotal findings, which will hopefully help other children like Opal and their families in the future.\"\n\nOpal's 24-week results and other scientific data from the CHORD trial are being presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGC) in Baltimore, USA, this week.\n\nProf Bance said: \"More than 60 years after the cochlear implant was first invented - the standard of care treatment for patients with OTOF related hearing loss - this trial shows gene therapy could provide a future alternative. It marks a new era in the treatment for deafness.\n\n\"It also supports the development of other gene therapies that may prove to make a difference in other genetic related hearing conditions, many of which are more common than auditory neuropathy.\"\n\nA second child has also received the gene therapy treatment at Cambridge University Hospitals, and positive results have recently been recorded, just six weeks after surgery.\n\nThree phases of the CHORD trial are planned, with three children, including Opal, receiving a low dose of gene therapy in one ear only in the first.\n\nAnother three children are due to receive a high dose in one ear in phase two. And if that too proves safe, a third phase will look at gene therapy in both ears with the dose selected after ensuring the safety and effectiveness in the first two parts.\n\nUp to 18 children from the UK, Spain and the US are being recruited to the trial, with follow-up appointments continuing for five years for enrolled patients to show how patients adapt to understand speech in the longer term.\n\nProf Bance said: \"My entire life, gene therapy has been 'five years away', and I've been in practice about 30 years.\n\n\"So, for me, it was almost unreal that this moment had arrived. We've been hearing about this for so long, and there's been so much work, decades of work - to finally see something that actually worked in humans, it was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really. It felt very special.\"\n\nDr Richard Brown, consultant paediatrician at CUH, who is an investigator on the CHORD trial, said: \"The development of genomic medicine and alternative treatments is vital for patients worldwide, and increasingly offers hope to children with previously incurable disorders.\n\n\"It is likely that in the long run such treatments require less follow-up so may prove to be an attractive option, including within the developing world. Follow-up appointments have shown effective results so far with no adverse reactions and it is exciting to see the results to date.\n\n\"Within the new planned Cambridge Children's Hospital, we look forward to having a genomic centre of excellence which will support patients from across the region to access the testing they need, and the best treatment, at the right time.\"\n\nMartin McLean, senior policy advisor at the National Deaf Children's Society, said:\n\n\"Many families will welcome these developments, and we look forward to learning about the long-term outcomes for the children treated. This trial will teach us more about the effectiveness of gene therapy in those cases where deafness has a specific genetic cause.\n\n\"We would like to emphasise that, with the right support from the start, deafness should never be a barrier to happiness or fulfilment. As a charity, we support families to make informed choices about medical technologies, so that they can give their deaf child the best possible start in life.\"\n\nIn Cambridge, the trial is supported

So we do hope it could be a potential cure.\"\n\nAuditory neuropathy can be caused by a fault in the OTOF gene, which is responsible for making a protein called otoferlin. This enables cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve.\n\nTo overcome the fault, the \"new era\" gene therapy - from biotech firm Regeneron - delivers a working copy of the gene to the ear.\n\nIn Opal's case, she received an infusion containing the working gene to her right ear during surgery last September.\n\nWhen (Opal) first turned (her head to loud clapping), I couldn't believe it. I thought it was a fluke ... but I repeated it a few times. I picked my phone up and texted James, and said 'I think it's working'. I was absolutely gobsmacked Opal's mother Jo Sandy\n\nHer parents Jo and James, both 33, noticed improvements to her hearing in four weeks when Opal turned her head to loud clapping.\n\n\"When she first turned, I couldn't believe it,\" Mrs Sandy told PA.\n\n\"I thought it was a fluke or like a change in light or something that had caught her eye, but I repeated it a few times.\n\n\"I picked my phone up and texted James, and said 'I think it's working'. I was absolutely gobsmacked. I thought it was a fluke.\"\n\nBut even more impressive results were on the horizon.\n\nSome 24 weeks after surgery, in February this year, tests in Cambridge showed Opal could also hear soft sounds such as a whisper.\n\nOpal with her family (Andrew Matthews/PA)\n\n\"The audiologist played back some of the sounds that she was responding to and they were ridiculously quiet sort of sounds that in the real world wouldn't catch your attention during a conversation,\" Mrs Sandy said.\n\n\"Certainly since February, we've noticed her sister (Nora) waking her up in the morning because she's running around on the landing, or someone rings on the door so her nap's cut short.\n\n\"She's definitely responding more to sort of what we would call functional sounds rather than just sounds that we use to test her.\n\n\"We were told she had near normal hearing last time - I think they got responses at sort of 25 to 30 decibels.\n\n\"I think normal hearing is classed at 20 decibels, so she's not far off. Before, she had no hearing whatsoever.\"\n\nProf Bance said Opal's hearing is now \"close to normal\", adding: \"We hope she'll get back to normal by the next testing.\"\n\n(The trial) marks a new era in the treatment for deafness. It also supports the development of other gene therapies that may prove to make a difference in other genetic-related hearing conditions Professor Manohar Bance\n\nHe added that the treatment is \"a one-and-done therapy, so hopefully you have your treatment and then you go back to your life\".\n\nA second child has also received the gene therapy treatment at Cambridge University Hospitals, with positive results seen recently, six weeks after surgery.\n\nThe overall phase 1/2 Chord trial consists of three parts, with three deaf children, including Opal, receiving a low dose of gene therapy in one ear only.\n\nA different set of three children will get a high dose on one side. Then, if that is shown to be safe, more children will receive a dose in both ears at the same time.\n\nUp to 18 youngsters from the UK, Spain and the US are being recruited to the trial and will be followed up for five years.\n\nProf Bance said: \"My entire life, gene therapy has been 'five years away', and I've been in practice about 30 years.\n\nOpal is the first patient globally to receive the Regeneron therapy (Andrew Matthews/PA)\n\n\"So, for me, it was almost unreal that this moment had arrived.\n\n\"It was just the fact that we've been hearing about this for so long, and there's been so much work, decades of work ... to finally see something that actually worked in humans ... It was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really.\n\n\"It felt very special.\"\n\nAt the moment, the gold standard treatment for auditory neuropathy is cochlear implants.\n\nOpal had one fitted to her left ear at the same time as she underwent gene therapy in her right ear, to ensure she got hearing as soon as possible.\n\nThe youngster is the first patient globally to receive the Regeneron therapy and \"she's the youngest globally that's been done to date as far as we know,\" Prof Bance said.\n\nAs a charity, we support families to make informed choices about medical technologies, so that they can give their deaf child the best possible start in life Martin McLean, National Deaf Children's Society\n\nChina has also been working on targeting the same gene, with positive results, though Prof Bance said theirs uses a different technology and slightly different mode of delivery.\n\nMedics in Philadelphia have also reported a good outcome with a type of gene therapy on an 11-year-old boy, who was operated on after Opal.\n\nProf Bance said he believes the trial is \"just the beginning of gene therapies\", adding: \"It marks a new era in the treatment for deafness.\n\n\"It also supports the development of other gene therapies that may prove to make a difference in other genetic-related hearing conditions, many of which are more common than auditory neuropathy.\"\n\nHe said it could take a while for more children to benefit from gene therapy. The treatment was currently not available on the NHS.\n\n\"What's really helped though is that the NHS does pay for genetic testing now for hearing loss,\" he said.\n\nHealth Secretary Victoria Atkins said she was 'delighted and proud\u00b4 of the government-backed trial (Jeff Moore/PA)\n\nOpal's surgery, which was carried out under general anaesthetic, was very similar to fitting a cochlear implant, Prof Bance continued.\n\n\"So basically, we find the inner ear and we open the inner ear and we infuse the treatment, in this particular case using a catheter, over 16 minutes,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to make a release hole in another part of the ear to let the treatment out because it has to go all the way through the ear.\n\n\"And then we just repair and close up, so it's actually a very similar approach to a cochlear implant, except we don't put the implant in.\"\n\nMartin McLean, senior policy adviser at the National Deaf Children's Society, welcomed the study, saying it would lead to learning regarding gene therapies for deafness with a specific genetic cause.\n\n\"We would like to emphasise that, with the right support from the start, deafness should never be a barrier to happiness or fulfilment,\" he said.\n\nThis trial will transform the life of 18-month-old Opal Sandy while offering hope to many others like her, and is another example of the NHS being a global leader in developing gene therapy for patients Professor Stephen Powis, NHS England\n\n\"As a charity, we support families to make informed choices about medical technologies, so that they can give their deaf child the best possible start in life.\"\n\nProfessor Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, said: \"This trial will transform the life of 18-month-old Opal Sandy while offering hope to many others like her, and is another example of the NHS being a global leader in developing gene therapy for patients.\n\n\"The NHS has led the world in the development of a range of other innovations and therapies, and this is a very welcome addition to the work going on with life sciences organisations around England to expand the range of treatments available.\"\n\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Victoria Atkins said: \"I am delighted and proud of what this government-backed trial has done for Opal, and what it could eventually do for children like her across the world.\n\n\"It marks an historic milestone as we develop a cure for this kind of deafness.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail

Then, if that is shown to be safe, more children will receive a dose in both ears at the same time.\n\nUp to 18 youngsters from the UK, Spain and the US are being recruited to the trial and will be followed-up for five years.\n\nRegarding the success of Opal's case, Prof Bance said: \"My entire life, gene therapy has been 'five years away', and I've been in practice about 30 years.\n\n\"So, for me, it was almost unreal that this moment had arrived.\n\n\"It was just the fact that we've been hearing about this for so long, and there's been so much work, decades of work.. to finally see something that actually worked in humans....It was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really.\n\n\"It felt very special.\"\n\nAt the moment, the gold standard treatment for auditory neuropathy is cochlear implants.\n\nOpal had one fitted to her left ear at the same time as she underwent gene therapy in her right ear, to ensure she got hearing as soon as possible.\n\nHowever, according to Prof Bance, implants can have limitations such as difficulty filtering out background noise when multiple people are speaking.\n\nAs a result, scientists have been working on experimental gene therapies to advance the field.\n\nOpal is the first patient globally to receive the Regeneron therapy and \"she's the youngest globally that's been done to date as far as we know,\" Prof Bance said.\n\nChina has also been working on targeting the same gene, with positive results, though Prof Bance said theirs uses a different technology and slightly different mode of delivery.\n\nMedics in Philadelphia have also reported a good outcome with a type of gene therapy on an 11-year-old boy, who was operated on after Opal.\n\nProf Bance said he believes the trial is \"just the beginning of gene therapies\", adding: \"It marks a new era in the treatment for deafness.\n\n\"It also supports the development of other gene therapies that may prove to make a difference in other genetic-related hearing conditions, many of which are more common than auditory neuropathy.\"\n\nHe said it could take a while for more children to benefit from gene therapy, depending on how quickly the trial can enrol patients, costs to the NHS and whether it can be scaled up.\n\nOpal's surgery, which was carried out under general anaesthetic, was very similar to fitting a cochlear implant, Prof Bance continued.\n\n\"So basically, we find the inner ear and we open the inner ear and we infuse the treatment, in this particular case using a catheter, over 16 minutes.\n\n\"We have to make a release hole in another part of the ear to let the treatment out because it has to go all the way through the ear.\n\n\"And then we just repair and close up, so it's actually a very similar approach to a cochlear implant, except we don't put the implant in.\"\n\nThe gene therapy used in the Chord trial is called DB-OTO and is specifically for children with OTOF mutations.\n\nA modified and harmless virus is used to carry the working gene, enabling genetic material to be delivered to specific cells to restore hearing function.\n\nProf Bance estimates that around 20,000 people in the US, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the UK have auditory neuropathy due to OTOF mutations.\n\nChildren with a variation in the OTOF gene are born with severe to profound hearing loss, but they often pass the newborn hearing screening tests and people think they can hear.\n\nMartin McLean, senior policy adviser at the National Deaf Children's Society, said: \"Many families will welcome these developments, and we look forward to learning about the long-term outcomes for the children treated.\n\n\"This trial will teach us more about the effectiveness of gene therapy in those cases where deafness has a specific genetic cause.\n\n\"We would like to emphasise that, with the right support from the start, deafness should never be a barrier to happiness or fulfilment.\n\n\"As a charity, we support

So we do hope it could be a potential cure\".\n\nHe said it came on the back of decades of work and marked \"a new era in the treatment of deafness\".\n\nWhat genetic defect caused hearing loss?\n\nThe little girl, from Oxfordshire in south central England, has a genetic form of auditory neuropathy, which is caused by the disruption of nerve impulses travelling from the inner ear to the brain.\n\nAuditory neuropathy can be caused by a fault in the OTOF gene, which is responsible for making a protein called otoferlin. This enables cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve.\n\nHow was it rectified?\n\nThe therapy uses a modified, harmless virus to deliver a working copy of the Otof gene into these cells. Given as an infusion into the ear, the therapy replaces faulty DNA causing her type of inherited deafness.\n\nOpal had the therapy in her right ear, under general anaesthetic, and a cochlear implant put into her left.\n\nHow gene therapy works? First, DNA is added to a harmless virus to create the gene therapy. Then, the gene therapy is introduced into the inner ear to repair the damaged hair cells, enabling the child to hear.\n\nJust a few weeks later, she could hear loud sounds, such as clapping, in her right ear. And after six months, her doctors, at Addenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge, confirmed that ear had almost normal hearing for soft sounds - even very quiet whispers.\n\nBance said that following surgery last September, Opal's hearing was now \"close to normal\" with further improvement expected.\n\nA second child received the gene therapy in Cambridge with positive results seen six weeks after the surgery.\n\nWhat percentage of hearing loss in babies is due to genetic cause?\n\nExperts hope the therapy could also work for other types of profound hearing loss. Up to 60% of hearing-loss cases in children have a genetic cause.\n\n3-stage trial The trial consists of three parts, with three deaf children, including Opal, receiving a low dose of gene therapy in one ear only.\n\nA different set of three children will get a high dose on one side. Then, if that is shown to be safe, more children will receive a dose in both ears at the same time.\n\nUp to 18 youngsters from the UK, Spain and the United States are being recruited to the trial and will be followed up for five years.\n\nAnd Prof Bance hopes the trial can lead to gene therapy being used for more common types of hearing loss.\n\n\"What I am hoping is that we can start to use gene therapy in young children... where we actually restore the hearing and they don't have to have cochlear implants and other technologies that have to be replaced,\" he told BBC.\n\nWhat's the current treatment for auditory neuropathy?\n\nChina has been working on targeting the same gene though Bance said theirs used a different technology and slightly different mode of delivery.\n\nMedics in Philadelphia have also reported a good outcome with a type of gene therapy on an 11-year-old boy.\n\nOpal was the first person to take part in a gene therapy trial being carried out in Cambridge by Bance. \"My entire life, gene therapy has been 'five years away'... to finally see something that actually worked in humans... It was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really,\" he said.\n\nBance said the current treatment for auditory neuropathy was implants.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news",

The malfunction causes severe hearing loss.\n\nNora's diagnosis meant Opal was eligible for genetic testing on the NHS, which detected she also had the faulty gene. The condition had not been picked up by newborn screening tests in either child.\n\nWhile Nora has cochlear implants in both ears, which are the current gold-standard treatment, Opal was able to join the gene therapy trial, although she also has an implant in one ear as a safety measure.\n\nThe gene therapy, called DB-OTO and manufactured by Regeneron, works by replacing the faulty gene with a working version. It is administered by a single injection of a modified and harmless virus carrying the new genetic material.\n\nThe treatment means the ear's sensory cells are able to produce a vital protein called otoferlin that is required for the tiny hair cells in the ear to transmit signals to the brain.\n\nOpal's parents, Jo and James Sandy, noticed improvements after just three weeks and things have only improved since. Opal's doctors say her hearing is now \"almost normal for her age\" although progress will become clearer as she learns to talk.\n\nMs Sandy, a 33-year-old geography teacher, said it was \"bonkers\" how quickly her daughter became able to hear.\n\nShe videoed her daughter responding to the sound for the first time.\n\nThe parents had become accustom to trying to get Opal's attention by making loud noise from behind her back but to little avail.\n\nUntil one day she turned to the sound of her mother clapping as she played.\n\n\"We were in the routine of testing quite loud sounds like banging, clapping, wooden spoons on saucepans, that kind of really intermittent loud noise,\" she said.\n\n\"I was testing that with her implant on and hadn't realised that her implant had actually come off, and she turned to pretty loud clapping. When she first turned, I couldn't believe it.\n\n\"I thought it was a fluke or like a change in light or something that had caught her eye, but I repeated it a few times. I was absolutely gobsmacked.\"\n\nOpal, who had her surgery at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, is one of up to 18 children due to be enrolled on the trial, which is taking place in the UK, US and Spain.\n\nWhile Opal received a low dose to one ear, others will be given higher doses to the other ear, before some children receive the treatment in both ears once there is more evidence it is safe.\n\nProf Manohar Bance, an ear surgeon at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Addebnbrooke's, and the trial's chief investigator, said the results were \"better than I hoped or expected\" after 24 weeks.\n\n\"We have results from [Opal] which are very spectacular - so close to normal hearing restoration. So we do hope it could be a potential cure.\n\n\"In terms of being able to hear soft sounds (like a soft whisper), she can hear almost normal for her age,\" he said. \"We don't know that she can understand speech in the same way because she's too young, but certainly she can respond to soft sounds.\"\n\nA second child has also received the gene therapy treatment at Cambridge University Hospitals, with positive results seen recently, six weeks after surgery, while other gene therapies for deafness are being trialled in China and the US.\n\nProf Bance estimates that around 20,000 people in the US, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the UK have auditory neuropathy due to OTOF mutations.\n\nMartin McLean, the senior policy adviser at the National Deaf Children's Society, said: \"This trial will teach us more about the effectiveness of gene therapy in those cases where deafness has a specific genetic cause.\n\n\"We would like to emphasise that, with the right support from the start, deafness should never be a barrier to happiness or fulfilment.\"\n\nMrs Sandy said Opal had started to talk in the last six weeks and now both her daughters like \"seeing who can make the most noise\".\n\n\"She's good at all your common first baby words, so 'daddy' is a favourite, 'uh oh', 'bye bye',\" she said.\n\n\"I always said I'd never get annoyed with them making noise and I do get annoyed with them making noise,\" Mrs Sandy joked.\n\n\"Opal loves playing with her little musical instrument set ... playing the drums, playing her little piano, tapping some of her wooden blocks and things like that.\n\n\"Nora got into music quite recently and [Opal] likes to put her arms up and does little dances in the kitchen.\n\n\"So they like dancing together. Nora likes reading to her, they like fighting, they like jumping off the sofa.\"\n\nThe results from the Chord trial were presented on Wednesday to the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy conference in Baltimore in the US.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss", "type":

The surgeon and chief investigator for the trial said he hoped she would be the first of many people to benefit from new kinds of gene therapies that can treat inner ear issues, such as hers, and potentially other kinds of hearing loss as well further down the line.\n\n\"These results are spectacular and better than I expected,\" said Professor Manohar Bance, a surgeon and chief investigator for the trial.\n\n\"Gene therapy has been the future of otology and audiology for many years and I'm so excited that it is now finally here. This is hopefully the start of a new era for gene therapies for the inner ear and many types of hearing loss,\" he said.\n\nHow does the treatment work?\n\nAuditory neuropathy can be caused by a fault in the OTOF gene, which is responsible for making a protein called otoferlin. This enables cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve.\n\nTo overcome the fault, the \"new era\" gene therapy - from biotech firm Regeneron - delivers a working copy of the gene to the ear.\n\nIn Opal's case, she received an infusion containing the working gene to her right ear during surgery last September.\n\nOpal's surgery was very similar to fitting a cochlear implant, according to Professor Bance.\n\nHe said the inner ear (cochlea) was opened and the treatment infused using a catheter over 16 minutes.\n\n\"We have to make a release hole in another part of the ear to let the treatment out because it has to go all the way through the ear,\" he said.\n\n\"And then we just repair and close up, so it's actually a very similar approach to a cochlear implant, except we don't put the implant in.\"\n\nCan anyone who is deaf benefit?\n\nChildren with a variation in the OTOF gene often pass the newborn screening, as the hair cells are working, but they are not talking to the nerve.\n\nIt means this hearing loss is not commonly detected until children are 2 or 3 years of age - when a delay in speech is likely to be noticed.\n\nProfessor Bance said: \"We have a short time frame to intervene because of the rapid pace of brain development at this age. Delays in the diagnosis can also cause confusion for families as the many reasons for delayed speech and late intervention can impact children's development.\"\n\nAbout 20,000 people across the US, the UK, Germany, France, Spain and Italy are thought to have auditory neuropathy due to OTOF mutations.\n\nA second child has also received the gene therapy treatment at Cambridge University Hospitals, with positive results seen recently, six weeks after surgery.\n\nThe overall phase 1/2 Chord trial consists of three parts, with three deaf children, including Opal, receiving a low dose of gene therapy in one ear only.\n\nA different set of three children will get a high dose on one side. Then, if that is shown to be safe, more children will receive a dose in both ears at the same time.\n\nUp to 18 youngsters from the UK, Spain and the US are being recruited to the trial and will be followed up for five years.\n\nProfessor Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, said: \"This trial will transform the life of 18-month-old Opal Sandy while offering hope to many others like her, and is another example of the NHS being a global leader in developing gene therapy for patients.\"\n\nMartin McLean, of the National Deaf Children's Society, welcomed the study and said: \"We would like to emphasise that, with the right support from the start, deafness should never be a barrier to happiness or fulfilment.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

She is the first British patient in the world and the youngest child to receive this type of treatment.\n\nOpal was born completely deaf because of a rare genetic condition, auditory neuropathy, caused by the disruption of nerve impulses travelling from the inner ear to the brain.\n\nWithin four weeks of having the gene therapy infusion to her right ear, Opal responded to sound, even with the cochlear implant in her left ear switched off.\n\nClinicians noticed continuous improvement in Opal's hearing in the weeks afterwards. At 24 weeks, they confirmed Opal had close to normal hearing levels for soft sounds, such as whispering, in her treated ear.\n\nNow 18 months old, Opal can respond to her parents' voices and can communicate words such as \"Dada\" and \"bye-bye.\"\n\nOpal's mother, Jo Sandy, said: \"When Opal could first hear us clapping unaided it was mind-blowing - we were so happy when the clinical team confirmed at 24 weeks that her hearing was also picking up softer sounds and speech. The phrase 'near normal' hearing was used and everyone was so excited such amazing results had been achieved.\"\n\nAuditory neuropathy can be due to a variation in a single gene, known as the OTOF gene. The gene produces a protein called otoferlin, needed to allow the inner hair cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve. Approximately 20,000 people across the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy and UK and are deaf due to a mutation in the OTOF gene.\n\nThe CHORD trial, which started in May 2023, aims to show whether gene therapy can provide hearing for children born with auditory neuropathy.\n\nProfessor Manohar Bance from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge and an ear surgeon at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is chief investigator of the trial. He said:\n\n\"These results are spectacular and better than I expected. Gene therapy has been the future of otology and audiology for many years and I'm so excited that it is now finally here. This is hopefully the start of a new era for gene therapies for the inner ear and many types of hearing loss.\"\n\nChildren with a variation in the OTOF gene often pass the newborn screening, as the hair cells are working, but they are not talking to the nerve.

Delays in the diagnosis can also cause confusion for families as the many reasons for delayed speech and late intervention can impact a children's development.\"\n\n\"More than sixty years after the cochlear implant was first invented - the standard of care treatment for patients with OTOF related hearing loss - this trial shows gene therapy could provide a future alternative. It marks a new era in the treatment for deafness. It also supports the development of other gene therapies that may prove to make a difference in other genetic related hearing conditions, many of which are more common than auditory neuropathy.\"\n\nMutations in the OTOF gene can be identified by standard NHS genetic testing. Opal was identified as being at risk as her older sister has the condition; this was confirmed by genetic test result when she was 3 weeks old.\n\nOpal was given an infusion containing a harmless virus (AAV1). It delivers a working copy of the OTOF gene and is delivered via an injection in the cochlea during surgery under general anaesthesia. During surgery, while Opal was given the gene therapy in right ear, a cochlear implant was fitted in her left ear.\n\nJames Sandy, Opal's father said: \"It was our ultimate goal for Opal to hear all the speech sounds. It's already making a difference to our day-to-day lives, like at bath-time or swimming, when Opal can't wear her cochlear implant. We feel so proud to have contributed to such pivotal findings, which will hopefully help other children like Opal and their families in the future.\"\n\nOpal's 24-week results, alongside other scientific data from the CHORD trial are being presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGC) in Baltimore, USA this week.\n\nDr Richard Brown, Consultant Paediatrician at CUH, who is an Investigator on the CHORD trial, said: \"The development of genomic medicine and alternative treatments is vital for patients worldwide, and increasingly offers hope to children with previously incurable disorders. It is likely that in the long run such treatments require less follow up so may prove to be an attractive option, including within the developing world. Follow up appointments have shown effective results so far with no adverse reactions and it is exciting to see the results to date.\n\n\"Within the new planned Cambridge Children's Hospital, we look forward to having a genomic centre of excellence which will support patients from across the region to access the testing they need, and the best treatment, at the right time.\"\n\nThe CHORD trial has been funded by Regeneron. Patients are being enrolled in the study in the US, UK and Spain.\n\nPatients in the first phase of the study receive a low dose to one ear. The second phase are expected to use a higher dose of gene therapy in one ear only, following proven safety of the starting dose. The third phase will look at gene therapy in both ears with the dose selected after ensuring the safety and effectiveness in parts 1 and 2. Follow up appointments will continue for five years for enrolled patients, which will show how patients adapt to understand speech in the longer term.\n\nIn Cambridge, the trial is supported by NIHR Cambridge Clinical Research Facility and NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nAdapted from a press release from CUH\n\n/University Release.

More deaf children from the UK, Spain and the US are being recruited to the trial and will all be followed up for five years.\n\nProf Manohar Bance, an ear surgeon at the trust and chief investigator for the trial, said the initial results were \"better than I hoped or expected\" and could cure patients with this type of deafness.\n\n\"We have results from [Opal] which are very spectacular - so close to normal hearing restoration. So we do hope it could be a potential cure.\"\n\nHe added: \"There's been so much work, decades of work ... to finally see something that actually worked in humans ... It was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really. It felt very special.\"\n\nAuditory neuropathy can be caused by a fault in the OTOF gene, which makes a protein called otoferlin. This enables cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve. To overcome the fault, the new therapy from biotech firm Regeneron sends a working copy of the gene to the ear.\n\nA second child has also recently received the gene therapy treatment at CCambridge University Hospitals, with positive results.\n\nThe overall Chord trial consists of three parts, with three deaf children including Opal receiving a low dose of gene therapy in one ear only.\n\nA different set of three children will get a high dose on one side.

The malfunction causes severe hearing loss.\n\nNora's diagnosis meant Opal was eligible for genetic testing on the NHS, which detected she also had the faulty gene.The condition had not been picked up by newborn screening tests in either child.\n\nWhile Nora has cochlear implants in both ears, which are the current gold-standard treatment, Opal was able to join the gene therapy trial, although she also has an implant in one ear as a safety measure.\n\nThe gene therapy, called DB-OTO and manufactured by Regeneron, works by replacing the faulty gene with a working version. It is administered by a single injection of a modified and harmless virus carrying the new genetic material.\n\nThe treatment means the ear's sensory cells are able to produce a vital protein called otoferlin that is required for the tiny hair cells in the ear to transmit signals to the brain.\n\nOpal's parents, Jo and James Sandy, noticed improvements after just three weeks and things have only improved since. Opal's doctors say her hearing is now \"almost normal for her age\" although progress will become clearer as she learns to talk.\n\nJo Sandy, a 33-year-old geography teacher, said it was \"bonkers\" how quickly her daughter became able to hear.\n\n\"We were in the routine of testing quite loud sounds like banging, clapping, wooden spoons on saucepans, that kind of really intermittent loud noise,\" she said.\n\n\"I was testing that with her implant on and hadn't realised that her implant had actually come off, and she turned to pretty loud clapping. When she first turned, I couldn't believe it.\n\n\"I thought it was a fluke or like a change in light or something that had caught her eye, but I repeated it a few times. I was absolutely gobsmacked.\"\n\nOpal, who had her surgery at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, is one of up to 18 children due to be enrolled on the trial, which is taking place in the UK, US and Spain.\n\nWhile Opal received a low dose to one ear, others will be given higher doses to the other ear, before some children receive the treatment in both ears once there is more evidence it is safe.\n\nProfessor Manohar Bance, an ear surgeon at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Addebnbrooke's, and the trial's chief investigator, said the results were \"better than I hoped or expected\" after 24 weeks.\n\n'We hope it could be a potential cure'\n\n\"We have results from [Opal] which are very spectacular - so close to normal hearing restoration. So we do hope it could be a potential cure.\n\n\"In terms of being able to hear soft sounds (like a soft whisper), she can hear almost normal for her age,\" he said. \"We don't know that she can understand speech in the same way because she's too young, but certainly she can respond to soft sounds.\"\n\nA second child has also received the gene therapy treatment at Cambridge University Hospitals, with positive results seen recently, six weeks after surgery, while other gene therapies for deafness are being trialled in China and the US.\n\nProf Bance estimates that around 20,000 people in the US, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the UK have auditory neuropathy due to OTOF mutations.\n\nMartin McLean, the senior policy adviser at the National Deaf Children's Society, said: \"This trial will teach us more about the effectiveness of gene therapy in those cases where deafness has a specific genetic cause.\n\n\"We would like to emphasise that, with the right support from the start, deafness should never be a barrier to happiness or fulfilment.\"\n\nSisters 'compete to make most noise'\n\nMrs Sandy said Opal had started to talk in the last six weeks and now both her daughters like \"seeing who can make the most noise\".\n\n\"She's good at all your common first baby words, so 'daddy' is a favourite, 'uh oh', 'bye bye',\" she said.\n\n\"I always said I'd never get annoyed with them making noise and I do get annoyed with them making noise,\" Mrs Sandy joked.\n\n\"Opal loves playing with her little musical instrument set ... playing the drums, playing her little piano, tapping some of her wooden blocks and things like that.\n\n\"Nora got into music quite recently and (Opal) likes to put her arms up and does little dances in the kitchen.\n\n\"So they like dancing together. Nora likes reading to her, they like fighting, they like jumping off the sofa.\"\n\nThe results from the Chord trial were presented on Wednesday to the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy

Opal is \"the first British patient in the world and the youngest child to receive this type of treatment,\" the hospital said.\n\nThe treatment is already having practical results, the hospital said: Opal can now respond to her parents' voices and can communicate words such as \"Dada\" and \"bye-bye.\"\n\n\"When Opal could first hear us clapping unaided it was mind-blowing,\" her mother, Jo Sandy, said in a statement. \"We were so happy when the clinical team confirmed at 24 weeks that her hearing was also picking up softer sounds and speech.\"\n\nHer father, James Sandy, said that it was \"already making a difference to our day-to-day lives, like at bath-time or swimming. ... We feel so proud to have contributed to such pivotal findings, which will hopefully help other children like Opal and their families in the future.\"\n\nThe results are another example of the potential of gene therapies, which use the insertion of genetic material to treat diseases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpal, like her elder sister, was born deaf because of a rare genetic condition known as auditory neuropathy, which is caused by the disruption of nerve impulses traveling from the inner ear to the brain, the hospital said. However, within four weeks of having the gene therapy infusion to her right ear, Opal \"responded to sound,\" it added. Now, at 24 weeks after treatment, clinicians have been able to confirm \"close to normal hearing levels for soft sounds,\" even including \"whispering, in her treated ear.\"\n\nManohar Bance, chief investigator of the trial and an ear surgeon at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said the results were \"spectacular and better than I expected.\"\n\n\"This is hopefully the start of a new era for gene therapies for the inner ear and many types of hearing loss,\" he said.\n\nAuditory neuropathy can be due to a variation in a gene, known as the OTOF gene, which produces a protein needed to allow the inner hair cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve. According to the NHS, about 20,000 people across Britain, Germany, France, Spain and Italy are deaf because of a mutation in the OTOF gene.\n\nThis type of hearing loss is not commonly detected until children are about 2 or 3 years of age, when a delay in speech is likely to be noticed, the Cambridge hospital said. However, Opal's was detected earlier, when she was just 3 weeks old, as her older sister also has the same genetic condition.\n\nThe trial that Opal was a part of began in May last year and was sponsored by U.S. biotechnology company Regeneron. It is continuing to enroll patients in the study in the U.S., Britain and Spain, it said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe procedure involved Opal being given an infusion via an injection into her right cochlea during surgery, containing a modified virus known as AAV1, which acts as a \"working copy of the OTOF gene.\" A cochlear implant was also fitted at the same time to her left ear.\n\nCongenital deafness - hearing loss present at birth - is a \"significant unmet medical need that affects approximately 1.7 out of every 1,000 children born\" in the United States, according to Regeneron.\n\n\"While hearing aids and cochlear implants can amplify sound to improve hearing for individuals with a range of hearing loss, these devices do not currently restore the full spectrum of sound,\" it added.\n\nThe news has been welcomed in Britain, making national headlines, but it could have a global impact.\n\n\"Many families will welcome these developments, and we look forward to learning about the long-term outcomes for the children treated,\" Martin McLean of Britain's National Deaf Children's Society said in an emailed statement Thursday. \"This trial will teach us more about the effectiveness of gene therapy in those cases where deafness has a specific genetic cause.\"\n\nThe trial was expected to include up to 18 children from Britain, the U.S. and Spain, the hospital said in a statement when the trial began last year. Their progress will be followed for up to five years to see the extent to which their hearing improves.\n\nOther clinical trials looking into gene therapies as a way to restore hearing in children with deafness caused by OTOF gene variations are also underway elsewhere in the world. Last year, an 11-year-old boy, Aissam Dam, received treatment in a separate gene therapy trial at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. China is also conducting a number of trials.\n\nOpal's tentatively successful results at 24 weeks after treatment, along with other scientific data from the trial, are set to be presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy in Baltimore this week.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

It was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really,\" he said.\n\nThe treatment was developed especially for children with OTOF mutations, and a second child who has had the same surgery is also seeing positive results.\n\nThe trial has three parts - with three deaf children, including Opal, getting a low dose in just one ear.\n\nAnother three children will get a high dose on one side. Then, if safe, a new set of children will get a dose in both ears at the same time.\n\nUp to 18 people from the UK, US and Spain are being recruited and will be followed up for five years.\n\nResults of the study were presented on Wednesday to the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy conference in Baltimore.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cochlear implant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hearing loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_neuropathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Auditory neuropathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addenbrooke's_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addenbrooke's Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_ear", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inner ear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gene therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Action potential"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cambridge"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cambridge"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otoferlin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Otoferlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decibel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biotechnology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phonetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangutan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orangutan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sperm whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cochlea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/24/05/1600x900/skynews-hearing-ear-deaf-opel-sandy_6547155.jpg?20240508113336", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551507", "eventUri": "eng-9551507", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

After 24 weeks, she had hearing levels that were \"close to normal,\" according to a press release from Britain's health service.\n\nShe can hear whispering in her treated ear, respond to her parents' voices, and has even begun saying words such as \"daddy\" and \"bye-bye\" herself.\n\nAround 1 in 500 babies are born with hearing loss or develop it in early childhood, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US. 50 to 60% of this hearing loss is due to genetic causes.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that unaddressed hearing loss represents a global cost of $980 billion a year in costs such as healthcare and educational support.\n\nThe \"start of a new era\"\n\nAuditory neuropathy is caused by a faulty gene and isn't usually detected until a child is 2 to 3 years old, when delays in speech are more noticeable. But Opal's was picked up early through gene testing, which she was eligible for because her older sister has the condition.\n\nUsually, auditory neuropathy is treated with implants, but Opal was put on a trial at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England, which is trialing gene therapy on children.\n\nHer treatment was part of phase one of the trial, where children are given a low dose in one ear. Phase two will involve a higher dose, still in one ear, and phase three will move on to treating both ears at a dose deemed safe from the previous phases.\n\nOpal was the first patient, treated in September 2023 when she was 11 months old. A second child received the therapy and has seen good results six weeks post-treatment, according to a release from Regeneron, the pharmaceutical company that makes the infusion.\n\nProfessor Manohar Bance, an ear surgeon and chief investigator of the trial, said the results were \"spectacular and better than I expected.\"\n\n\"This is hopefully the start of a new era for gene therapies for the inner ear and many types of hearing loss,\" Bance said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "serafina_kenny@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Serafina Kenny", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hearing loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_neuropathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Auditory neuropathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General anaesthesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_ear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inner ear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Implant (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pharmaceutical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cambridge"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cambridge"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/663cba9cb4abc992e8c732e4?format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551507", "eventUri": "eng-9551507", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

But it also sounded like a really unique opportunity.\n\n\"We sort of had a relatively reliable safety net that, even if it didn't work, Opal would still be eligible to have a cochlear implant in her other ear six months down the line.\n\n\"So that was like a really good sort of safety blanket that we could fall back on if we needed to.\"\n\nOpal received a gene therapy infusion in her right ear during surgery last September. At the same time, a cochlear implant was fitted in her left ear to ensure she had hearing.\n\nThere was then a tense wait to see if the therapy had worked, but it became apparent quite quickly that Opal could hear.\n\n\"It was about three weeks post-surgery, which was about a week after her implant had been turned on,\" Mrs Sandy explained.\n\n\"So we were sort of in the routine of testing quite loud sounds like banging, clapping, wooden spoons on saucepans, that kind of really intermittent loud noise.\n\n\"I was testing that with her implant on and hadn't realised that her implant had actually come off, and she turned to pretty loud clapping. When she first turned, I couldn't believe it.\n\n\"I thought it was a fluke or like a change in light or something that had caught her eye, but I repeated it a few times.\n\n\"I picked my phone up and texted James, and said 'I think it's working'. I was absolutely gobsmacked. I thought it was a fluke.\"\n\nThe couple had been told they might notice a change within the first six weeks, hence Mrs Sandy's surprise.\n\n\"I couldn't really believe it,\" she said. \"It was ... bonkers.\"\n\nShe added that \"there is no way in a million years I thought that Opal would be able to turn to sound without wearing an implant\".\n\nSome 24 weeks after surgery, in February this year, tests in Cambridge showed Opal could also hear soft sounds such as a whisper.\n\n\"The audiologist played back some of the sounds that she was responding to and they were ridiculously quiet sort of sounds that in the real world wouldn't catch your attention during a conversation,\" Mrs Sandy said.\n\nNow, even without the implant in her left ear, Opal can hear perfectly well thanks to the gene therapy.\n\nMrs Sandy said: \"Without an implant, she can understand basically the same things that she can understand when it's on, so 'Opal, where's your nose? 'Where's daddy?' 'Who's at the door?' 'Bye bye' ...sort of basic language acquisition, that she can understand just as well with her implant on and off.\"\n\nMr Sandy said he noticed a \"massive\" improvement in the 18 to 24 weeks post-surgery and the \"big moment\" was hearing from the team at Cambridge University Hospitals that Opal had near-normal hearing at 24 weeks.\n\nMrs Sandy added: \"Certainly since February, we've noticed her sister waking her up in the morning because she's running around on the landing, or someone rings on the door so her nap's cut short.\n\n\"She's definitely responding more to sort of what we would call functional sounds rather than just sounds that we use to test her.\n\n\"We were told she had near normal hearing last time - I think they got responses at sort of 25 to 30 decibels.\n\n\"I think normal hearing is classed at 20 decibels, so she's not far off. Before, she had no hearing whatsoever.\"\n\nOpal has also started speaking in the last six weeks.\n\n\"She's good at all your common first baby words, so 'daddy' is a favourite, 'uh oh', 'bye bye',\" Mrs Sandy said.\n\nAs for playing, Mrs Sandy said both Nora and Opal like \"seeing who can make the most noise\".\n\nShe joked: \"I always said I'd never get annoyed with them making noise and I do get annoyed with them making noise.\n\n\"So, Opal loves playing with her little musical instrument set ... playing the drums, playing her little piano, tapping some of her wooden blocks and things like that.\n\n\"She's started becoming more interested in books, so like lots of lift the flap books, 'where's Spot?'...those kinds of really interactive books, she really likes.\n\n\"She loves slamming her cutlery on the table asking us where her dinner is.\n\n\"Nora got into music quite recently and (Opal) likes put her arms up and does little dances in the kitchen.\n\n\"So they like dancing together. Nora likes reading to her, they like fighting, they like jumping off the sofa.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hearing loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cochlear implant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Implant (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genetic disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_neonatal_hearing_screening", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Universal neonatal hearing screening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech\u2013language_pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speech\u2013language pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_neuropathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auditory neuropathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hearing test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutlery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cutlery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cambridge"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cambridge"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Radcliffe_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Radcliffe Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/09/00/wire-84637867-1715209698-839_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551507", "eventUri": "eng-9551507", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Opal is \"the first British patient in the world and the youngest child to receive this type of treatment,\" the hospital said.\n\nThe treatment is already having practical results, the hospital said: Opal can now respond to her parents' voices and can communicate words such as \"Dada\" and \"bye-bye.\"\n\n\"When Opal could first hear us clapping unaided it was mind-blowing,\" her mother, Jo Sandy, said in a statement. \"We were so happy when the clinical team confirmed at 24 weeks that her hearing was also picking up softer sounds and speech.\"\n\nHer father, James Sandy, said that it was \"already making a difference to our day-to-day lives, like at bath-time or swimming. ... We feel so proud to have contributed to such pivotal findings, which will hopefully help other children like Opal and their families in the future.\"\n\nThe results are another example of the potential of gene therapies, which use the insertion of genetic material to treat diseases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpal, like her elder sister, was born deaf because of a rare genetic condition known as auditory neuropathy, which is caused by the disruption of nerve impulses traveling from the inner ear to the brain, the hospital said. However, within four weeks of having the gene therapy infusion to her right ear, Opal \"responded to sound,\" it added. Now, at 24 weeks after treatment, clinicians have been able to confirm \"close to normal hearing levels for soft sounds,\" even including \"whispering, in her treated ear.\"\n\nManohar Bance, chief investigator of the trial and an ear surgeon at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said the results were \"spectacular and better than I expected.\"\n\n\"This is hopefully the start of a new era for gene therapies for the inner ear and many types of hearing loss,\" he said.\n\nAuditory neuropathy can be due to a variation in a gene, known as the OTOF gene, which produces a protein needed to allow the inner hair cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve. According to the NHS, about 20,000 people across Britain, Germany, France, Spain and Italy are deaf because of a mutation in the OTOF gene.\n\nThis type of hearing loss is not commonly detected until children are about 2 or 3 years of age, when a delay in speech is likely to be noticed, the Cambridge hospital said. However, Opal's was detected earlier, when she was just 3 weeks old, as her older sister also has the same genetic condition.\n\nThe trial that Opal was a part of began in May last year and was sponsored by U.S. biotechnology company Regeneron. It is continuing to enroll patients in the study in the U.S., Britain and Spain, it said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe procedure involved Opal being given an infusion via an injection into her right cochlea during surgery, containing a modified virus known as AAV1, which acts as a \"working copy of the OTOF gene.\" A cochlear implant was also fitted at the same time to her left ear.\n\nCongenital deafness - hearing loss present at birth - is a \"significant unmet medical need that affects approximately 1.7 out of every 1,000 children born\" in the United States, according to Regeneron.\n\n\"While hearing aids and cochlear implants can amplify sound to improve hearing for individuals with a range of hearing loss, these devices do not currently restore the full spectrum of sound,\" it added.\n\nThe news has been welcomed in Britain, making national headlines, but it could have a global impact.\n\n\"Many families will welcome these developments, and we look forward to learning about the long-term outcomes for the children treated,\" Martin McLean of Britain's National Deaf Children's Society said in an emailed statement Thursday. \"This trial will teach us more about the effectiveness of gene therapy in those cases where deafness has a specific genetic cause.\"\n\nThe trial was expected to include up to 18 children from Britain, the U.S. and Spain, the hospital said in a statement when the trial began last year. Their progress will be followed for up to five years to see the extent to which their hearing improves.\n\nOther clinical trials looking into gene therapies as a way to restore hearing in children with deafness caused by OTOF gene variations are also underway elsewhere in the world. Last year, an 11-year-old boy, Aissam Dam, received treatment in a separate gene therapy trial at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. China is also conducting a number of trials.\n\nOpal's tentatively successful results at 24 weeks after treatment, along with other scientific data from the trial, are set to be presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy in Baltimore this week.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

NHS\n\nOpal Sandy, now an 18-month-old toddler from Oxfordshire, England, has become the first patient to undergo a groundbreaking gene therapy trial for auditory neuropathy, a rare genetic condition causing deafness. Opal's journey from complete deafness to responding to her parents' voices and uttering her first words has captured global attention.\n\nOpal was born deaf due to a fault in the OTOF gene, which disrupts nerve impulses essential for transmitting sounds to the brain. She became the first participant in the CHORD trial, a global initiative aiming to explore the efficacy of gene therapy in restoring hearing for children with auditory neuropathy.\n\nExpressing her joy, Opal's mother Jo Sandy said, \"When Opal could first hear us clapping unaided it was mind-blowing - we were so happy when the clinical team confirmed at 24 weeks that her hearing was also picking up softer sounds and speech. The phrase 'near normal' hearing was used and everyone was so excited such amazing results had been achieved.\"\n\nWhat does the treatment comprise?\n\nAdministered at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, the trial involved infusing Opal's right ear with a harmless virus carrying a functional copy of the OTOF gene, reported the NHS website.\n\n\"These results are spectacular and better than I expected. Gene therapy has been the future in otology and audiology for many years and I'm so excited that it is now finally here. This is hopefully the start of a new era for gene therapies for the inner ear and many types of hearing loss,\" said Professor Manohar Bance, an ear surgeon at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and chief investigator of the trial.\n\nOpal is the first patient globally to receive the therapy and is \"the youngest globally that's been done to date as far as we know\", Bance said.\n\nAlso Read: World's first patient begins sickle cell gene therapy treatment: What is it?\n\nBance added, \"We have a short time frame to intervene because of the rapid pace of brain development at this age. Delays in the diagnosis can also cause confusion for families as the many reasons for delayed speech and late intervention can impact a children's development.\"\n\nIn the initial phase of the study, participants are administered a minimal dosage targeted at one ear. Subsequently, in the second phase, a higher dosage is anticipated for unilateral gene therapy, contingent upon the established safety of the initial dosage.\n\nThe third phase will evaluate the efficacy of gene therapy in both ears, with the dosage determined based on safety and effectiveness assessments from the preceding phases. Follow-up appointments spanning five years will monitor patients' progress in adapting to speech comprehension over the long term.\n\nThe treatment showed promising results\n\nWithin weeks of the gene therapy infusion, Opal began responding to sounds, even with her cochlear implant switched off. Continuous improvement was observed in her hearing, culminating in near-normal hearing levels for soft sounds within 24 weeks post-treatment.\n\nOpal's parents, Jo and James Sandy, expressed their elation at witnessing her newfound ability to engage with the world of sound.\n\n\"It was our ultimate goal for Opal to hear all the speech sounds. It's already making a difference to our day-to-day lives, like at bath-time or swimming, when Opal can't wear her cochlear implant. We feel so proud to have contributed to such pivotal findings, which will hopefully help other children like Opal and their families in the future,\" said Opal's father James Sandy.\n\nWhat does this trial mean for the future?\n\nThe success of Opal's treatment heralds a new era in the management of genetic hearing disorders. Professor Bance emphasised the potential of gene therapy as an alternative to conventional treatments like cochlear implants, particularly for conditions linked to specific genetic mutations.\n\nOpal's 24-week results, alongside other scientific data from the CHORD trial are being presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGC) in Baltimore, USA this week, reported UK's NHS.\n\nAlso Read: 5-month-old in UK suffers cardiac arrest: How common is this heart ailment in children?\n\nDr Richard Brown, Consultant Paediatrician said, \"The development of genomic medicine and alternative treatments is vital for patients worldwide, and increasingly offers hope to children with previously incurable disorders.\"\n\nAs the CHORD trial progresses, researchers anticipate further insights into the long-term effectiveness and safety of gene therapy for auditory neuropathy. With ongoing enrollment in the US, UK, and Spain, the study aims to explore escalating doses of gene therapy and its potential application in bilateral treatment.\n\nThe establishment of genomic centres of excellence, as envisioned in the forthcoming Cambridge Children's Hospital, underscores the commitment to advancing precision medicine on a global scale.", "source": {"uri":

It can cause degrees of hearing loss, but in Opal's case, she was fully deaf from birth.\n\nNow Opal, who lives in Oxfordshire in England, can hear almost normally thanks to a 16-minute long gene therapy procedure.\n\nDoctors injected Opal's right ear with a harmless virus that carried a working version of the faulty gene while she was under general anesthesia.\n\nWithin four weeks of receiving the gene therapy, Opal could respond to sound. After 24 weeks, she had hearing levels that were \"close to normal,\" according to a press release from Britain's health service.\n\nShe can hear whispering in her treated ear, respond to her parents' voices, and has even begun saying words such as \"daddy\" and \"bye-bye\" herself.\n\nAround 1 in 500 babies are born with hearing loss or develop it in early childhood, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US. 50 to 60% of this hearing loss is due to genetic causes.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that unaddressed hearing loss represents a global cost of $980 billion a year in costs such as healthcare and educational support.\n\nAuditory neuropathy is caused by a faulty gene and isn't usually detected until a child is 2 to 3 years old, when delays in speech are more noticeable. But Opal's was picked up early through gene testing, which she was eligible for because her older sister has the condition.\n\nUsually, auditory neuropathy is treated with implants, but Opal was put on a trial at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England, which is trialing gene therapy on children.\n\nHer treatment was part of phase one of the trial, where children are given a low dose in one ear. Phase two will involve a higher dose, still in one ear, and phase three will move on to treating both ears at a dose deemed safe from the previous phases.\n\nOpal was the first patient, treated in September 2023 when she was 11 months old.

Opal was born with complete deafness caused by auditory neuropathy, a condition that hinders the transmission of nerve signals from the inner ear to the brain.\n\nAlso Read: Sylvester Stallone to auction $6 million watch collection\n\nThanks to the \"one and done\" gene therapy currently being tested in the UK and globally, Opal's hearing has been restored to near perfection, with the potential for further improvement in the future, reports The National.\n\nThe girl hailing from Oxfordshire, possesses a hereditary variant of auditory neuropathy. She received medical care at Addenbrooke's Hospital, an integral part of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nProf Manohar Bance, an esteemed ear surgeon at the trust and the primary researcher for the trial, conveyed that the outcomes surpassed his initial expectations, offering potential for a complete recovery for individuals afflicted with this particular form of hearing impairment.\n\nAuditory neuropathy may result from a defect in the Otof gene, responsible for producing otoferlin protein, which facilitates communication between ear cells and the hearing nerve.\n\nTo address this issue, a cutting-edge gene therapy developed by biotech company Regeneron provides a functional version of the gene to the ear. In the case of Opal, a dose containing the functional gene was administered to her right ear during a surgical procedure in September.\n\nOpal's parents, Jo and James, aged 33, observed improvements in her hearing after four weeks, as Opal responded to loud clapping by turning her head. Professor Bance mentioned that Opal's hearing is now nearly normal, expressing optimism that she will fully recover during the upcoming evaluations. He emphasized that this treatment is a one-time therapy, offering hope for a return to normal life after the treatment.\n\nAnother child has also undergone the gene therapy treatment at Cambridge University Hospitals, showing promising results six weeks post-surgery.\n\nAlso Read: Apple iPad Pros with OLED displays and thinnest design ever announced", "source": {"uri": "me.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable ME"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_neuropathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Auditory neuropathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hearing loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Stallone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sylvester Stallone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_ear", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inner ear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Action potential"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University_Hospitals_NHS_Foundation_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addenbrooke's_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addenbrooke's Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biotechnology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_me/seo/default/ear_n1zt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551507", "eventUri": "eng-9551507", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

But it also sounded like a really unique opportunity.\n\n\"We sort of had a relatively reliable safety net that, even if it didn't work, Opal would still be eligible to have a cochlear implant in her other ear six months down the line.\n\n\"So that was like a really good sort of safety blanket that we could fall back on if we needed to.\"\n\nOpal received a gene therapy infusion in her right ear during surgery last September. At the same time, a cochlear implant was fitted in her left ear to ensure she had hearing.\n\nThere was then a tense wait to see if the therapy had worked, but it became apparent quite quickly that Opal could hear.\n\n\"It was about three weeks post-surgery, which was about a week after her implant had been turned on,\" Mrs Sandy explained.\n\n\"So we were sort of in the routine of testing quite loud sounds like banging, clapping, wooden spoons on saucepans, that kind of really intermittent loud noise.\n\n\"I was testing that with her implant on and hadn't realised that her implant had actually come off, and she turned to pretty loud clapping. When she first turned, I couldn't believe it.\n\n\"I thought it was a fluke or like a change in light or something that had caught her eye, but I repeated it a few times.\n\n\"I picked my phone up and texted James, and said 'I think it's working'. I was absolutely gobsmacked.

'Where's daddy?' 'Who's at the door?' 'Bye bye' ...sort of basic language acquisition, that she can understand just as well with her implant on and off.\"\n\nMr Sandy said he noticed a \"massive\" improvement in the 18 to 24 weeks post-surgery and the \"big moment\" was hearing from the team at Cambridge University Hospitals that Opal had near-normal hearing at 24 weeks.\n\nMrs Sandy added: \"Certainly since February, we've noticed her sister waking her up in the morning because she's running around on the landing, or someone rings on the door so her nap's cut short.\n\n\"She's definitely responding more to sort of what we would call functional sounds rather than just sounds that we use to test her.\n\n\"We were told she had near normal hearing last time - I think they got responses at sort of 25 to 30 decibels.\n\n\"I think normal hearing is classed at 20 decibels, so she's not far off. Before, she had no hearing whatsoever.\"\n\nOpal has also started speaking in the last six weeks.\n\n\"She's good at all your common first baby words, so 'daddy' is a favourite, 'uh oh', 'bye bye',\" Mrs Sandy said.\n\nAs for playing, Mrs Sandy said both Nora and Opal like \"seeing who can make the most noise\".\n\nShe joked: \"I always said I'd never get annoyed with them making noise and I do get annoyed with them making noise.\n\n\"So, Opal loves playing with her little musical instrument set ... playing the drums, playing her little piano, tapping some of her wooden blocks and things like that.\n\n\"She's started becoming more interested in books, so like lots of lift the flap books, 'where's Spot?'...those kinds of really interactive books, she really likes.\n\n\"She loves slamming her cutlery on the table asking us where her dinner is.\n\n\"Nora got into music quite recently and (Opal) likes put her arms up and does little dances in the kitchen.\n\n\"So they like dancing together.

But it also sounded like a really unique opportunity.\n\n\"We sort of had a relatively reliable safety net that, even if it didn't work, Opal would still be eligible to have a cochlear implant in her other ear six months down the line.\n\n\"So that was like a really good sort of safety blanket that we could fall back on if we needed to.\"\n\nOpal received a gene therapy infusion in her right ear during surgery last September. At the same time, a cochlear implant was fitted in her left ear to ensure she had hearing.\n\nThere was then a tense wait to see if the therapy had worked, but it became apparent quite quickly that Opal could hear.\n\n\"It was about three weeks post-surgery, which was about a week after her implant had been turned on,\" Mrs Sandy explained.\n\n\"So we were sort of in the routine of testing quite loud sounds like banging, clapping, wooden spoons on saucepans, that kind of really intermittent loud noise.\n\n\"I was testing that with her implant on and hadn't realised that her implant had actually come off, and she turned to pretty loud clapping. When she first turned, I couldn't believe it.\n\n\"I thought it was a fluke or like a change in light or something that had caught her eye, but I repeated it a few times.\n\n\"I picked my phone up and texted James, and said 'I think it's working'.

No matter how loud or close a sound, she did not respond. Today, Opal's able to hear -- unaided -- after receiving a single dose of a groundbreaking gene therapy as part of an ongoing clinical trial.\n\nOpal, whose family lives in Oxfordshire outside London, became the first patient in the UK -- and the youngest in the world -- to receive an injection of a gene intended to repair the defect that made her deaf. She began responding to sounds within three weeks of the injection, and nearly six months later, she has functional hearing in her treated right ear and no longer requires the use of a cochlear implant in her left.\n\nBaby Opal, with her strawberry-blonde hair and blue eyes, now recognizes her parents' voices and responds with words like \"Dada\" and \"bye-bye\" -- just like any other kid her age.\n\nWhen her mom asks for a kiss, Opal turns her head and presents her with a rosy cheek.\n\n\"When Opal first heard us clapping unaided, it was mind-blowing. We were overjoyed when the clinical team confirmed at 24 weeks that she was also picking up softer sounds and speech,\" said Jo Sandy, Opal's mother.\n\n\"They described her hearing as 'near normal,' and everyone was thrilled with such amazing results,\" she added.\n\nOpal was born with a condition called auditory neuropathy, a rare genetic defect caused by disruptions in nerve impulses from the inner ear to the brain. This condition is linked to a mutation in the OTOF gene, which impairs the production of the otoferlin protein, crucial for communication between the sensory cells of the inner ear and the auditory nerve. Without the protein, pulses are translated into electric signals but don't make to the brain.\n\nChildren with a mutation in the OTOF gene often pass newborn screenings, meaning this type of hearing loss is typically not detected until later.\n\nThe clinical trial, named CHORD and sponsored by the American biotech company Regeneron, began a year ago. It aims to determine whether cutting-edge gene therapies can restore hearing in children with the same condition that has afflicted Opal.\n\nThe trial outcomes so far have been nothing short of extraordinary.\n\n\"These results are spectacular and exceeded my expectations,\" said Professor Manohar Bance, an ear surgeon at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and lead on the trial.\n\nGene therapies like the one sponsored by Regeneron have long been anticipated as potential game-changers for people with hearing defects.\n\nIn a press release published by Cambridge to coincide with Opal's story being presented at a medical conference this week, Bance expressed excitement that the biotechnology is finally becoming a reality, potentially marking the beginning of a new era for gene therapies targeting the inner ear and various types of hearing loss that, until now, have largely been treated via invasive cochlear implants.\n\nThe CHORD trial, currently enrolling infants and children in the U.S., UK and Spain, is assessing the safety and efficacy of the gene therapy, according to a press release from Regeneron.\n\nThe therapy, known as DB-OTO, involves a one-time injection into the inner ear that delivers a correct copy of the defective gene. In Opal's case, she received an infusion containing a harmless virus that carried a functional copy of the OTOF gene, delivered via injection into the inner ear during surgery under general anesthesia.\n\nThe method is seen as a promising alternative to traditional hearing aids and cochlear implants, which only amplify sounds and do not address underlying genetic issues.\n\n\"It was our ultimate goal for Opal to hear all the speech sounds. It's already making a difference to our day-to-day lives, like at bath-time or swimming, when Opal can't wear her cochlear implant,\" said James Sany, Opal's father.\n\nOpal's 24-week results, along with other scientific data from the CHORD trial, are being presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGC) conference in Baltimore this week.\n\n\"The results are jaw-droppingly good, just shockingly impressive. They exceeded the wildest expectations of everyone involved in this work,\" said Larry Lustig, an otolaryngologist at Columbia University and an investigator on the study, during the case presentation at the ASGC conference.\n\nHearing loss affects about 1.5 billion people, while congenital deafness -- hearing loss present at birth -- affects approximately 1.7 out of every 1,000 children born in the U.S. The OTOF-related deafness experienced by Opal is exceedingly rare, affecting just 200,000 people worldwide.\n\n\"Many families will welcome these developments, and we look forward to learning about the long-term outcomes for the children treated,\" said Martin McLean, Senior Policy Advisor at the National Deaf Children's Society.\n\n\"This trial will teach us more about the effectiveness of gene therapy in those cases where deafness has a specific genetic cause.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

At 18 months old, he underwent a nearly 16-minute operation during which he received an infusion with a working copy of the gene.\n\nThe little one's hearing has now almost completely recovered, she enjoys playing with toy drums and, according to her parents, they also have to deal with a new problem: their daughter's new favorite hobby is hitting the table with cutlery to make something out of it make as much noise as possible.\n\nThe toddler, from Oxfordshire, was treated at Addenbrooke's, part of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, where the Chord trial is taking place.\n\nAccording to Professor Manohar Bance, the foundation's ear surgeon and leader of the study, the initial results are better than their preliminary expectations and they are confident that further tests will prove that this type of hearing loss can be treated with gene therapy. By the way, the first operation was preceded by several decades of research, and according to the doctors, they were also surprised that the treatment on Opal brought such a spectacular result.\n\nNot long after Opal, another child underwent the treatment, also with positive results.\n\nThe full Chord trial is in three parts, with three deaf children, including Opal, receiving low-dose gene therapy in one ear only. Another group of three children received a high dose unilaterally. Then, if it proves safe, more children will receive the dose in both ears at the same time.\n\nAfter the first successful missions, additional deaf children from the United Kingdom, Spain and the United States are now being recruited and will be looked after for five years. A total of 18 children worldwide are taking part in the study.\n\nAuditory neuropathy can be caused by a defect in the OTOF gene, which produces a protein called otoferlin. This allows the cells in the ear to communicate with the auditory nerve.

But it also sounded like a really unique opportunity.\n\n\"We sort of had a relatively reliable safety net that, even if it didn't work, Opal would still be eligible to have a cochlear implant in her other ear six months down the line.\n\n\"So that was like a really good sort of safety blanket that we could fall back on if we needed to.\"\n\nOpal received a gene therapy infusion in her right ear during surgery last September. At the same time, a cochlear implant was fitted in her left ear to ensure she had hearing.\n\nThere was then a tense wait to see if the therapy had worked, but it became apparent quite quickly that Opal could hear.\n\n\"It was about three weeks post-surgery, which was about a week after her implant had been turned on,\" Mrs Sandy explained.\n\n\"So we were sort of in the routine of testing quite loud sounds like banging, clapping, wooden spoons on saucepans, that kind of really intermittent loud noise.\n\n\"I was testing that with her implant on and hadn't realised that her implant had actually come off, and she turned to pretty loud clapping. When she first turned, I couldn't believe it.\n\n\"I thought it was a fluke or like a change in light or something that had caught her eye, but I repeated it a few times.\n\n\"I picked my phone up and texted James, and said 'I think it's working'. I was absolutely gobsmacked. I thought it was a fluke.\"\n\nThe couple had been told they might notice a change within the first six weeks, hence Mrs Sandy's surprise.\n\n\"I couldn't really believe it,\" she said. \"It was ... bonkers.\"\n\nShe added that \"there is no way in a million years I thought that Opal would be able to turn to sound without wearing an implant\".\n\nSome 24 weeks after surgery, in February this year, tests in Cambridge showed Opal could also hear soft sounds such as a whisper.\n\n\"The audiologist played back some of the sounds that she was responding to and they were ridiculously quiet sort of sounds that in the real world wouldn't catch your attention during a conversation,\" Mrs Sandy said.\n\nNow, even without the implant in her left ear, Opal can hear perfectly well thanks to the gene therapy.\n\nMrs Sandy said: \"Without an implant, she can understand basically the same things that she can understand when it's on, so 'Opal, where's your nose? 'Where's daddy?' 'Who's at the door?' 'Bye bye' ...sort of basic language acquisition, that she can understand just as well with her implant on and off.\"\n\nMr Sandy said he noticed a \"massive\" improvement in the 18 to 24 weeks post-surgery and the \"big moment\" was hearing from the team at Cambridge University Hospitals that Opal had near-normal hearing at 24 weeks.\n\nMrs Sandy added: \"Certainly since February, we've noticed her sister waking her up in the morning because she's running around on the landing, or someone rings on the door so her nap's cut short.\n\n\"She's definitely responding more to sort of what we would call functional sounds rather than just sounds that we use to test her.\n\n\"We were told she had near normal hearing last time - I think they got responses at sort of 25 to 30 decibels.\n\n\"I think normal hearing is classed at 20 decibels, so she's not far off. Before, she had no hearing whatsoever.\"\n\nOpal has also started speaking in the last six weeks.\n\n\"She's good at all your common first baby words, so 'daddy' is a favourite, 'uh oh', 'bye bye',\" Mrs Sandy said.\n\nAs for playing, Mrs Sandy said both Nora and Opal like \"seeing who can make the most noise\".\n\nShe joked: \"I always said I'd never get annoyed with them making noise and I do get annoyed with them making noise.\n\n\"So, Opal loves playing with her little musical instrument set ... playing the drums, playing her little piano, tapping some of her wooden blocks and things like that.\n\n\"She's started becoming more interested in books, so like lots of lift the flap books, 'where's Spot?'...those kinds of really interactive books, she really likes.\n\n\"She loves slamming her cutlery on the table asking us where her dinner is.\n\n\"Nora got into music quite recently and (Opal) likes put her arms up and does little dances in the kitchen.\n\n\"So they like dancing together.

Opal Sandy was born with a hearing impairment and underwent treatment shortly after her first birthday. Now, six months since, the toddler can hear unaided and is starting to talk. Her parents, Jo and James, proudly shared with BBC News that their little girl can hear sounds as soft as whispers and says words like 'mama', 'dada', or 'uh-oh!'\n\nOpal Sandy's story of being born with a hearing and speech impairment to now responding to sounds and interacting is heartwarming. The little girl is one of the world's first patients to receive this one-of-a-kind gene therapy, BBC News reported.\n\nDeveloped by a biotechnology Research and Development firm called Regeneron, the therapy involves an infusion into the ear which reportedly replaces the faulty DNA causing the inherited deafness.\n\nDoctors are also exploring similar treatments for the Otof gene mutation that Sandy has. Sandy's parents told the outlet about the nerve-wracking experience of allowing the little girl to be one of the first to test this treatment.\n\nJo explained, \"It was really scary, but I think we'd been given this unique opportunity.\" Opal's sister Nora also reportedly has the same type of deafness and manages well wearing an electrical cochlear implant.\n\nLittle girl Opal had the therapy in her right ear, under general anaesthetic, and a cochlear implant put into her left. For a few weeks, she could only hear loud sounds, but six months on, doctors reported that her hearing was now normal.\n\nBBC reported that the implant that Nora uses does not make sounds louder, but rather gives the \"sensation\" of hearing by directly stimulating the auditory nerve that communicates with the brain.\n\nThe device bypasses the damaged sound-sensing hair cells in a part of the inner ear known as the cochlea. On the other hand, Opal's gene therapy treatment uses a modified, harmless virus to deliver a working copy of the Otof gene into these cells.\n\nThe gene therapy reportedly replaces the damaged sound-sensing DNA with a working copy. Experts have commended the scientists for the successful experiment. Scientists hope that the therapy can also work for profound hearing loss.\n\n\"It's wonderful seeing her respond to sound,\" chief investigator and ear surgeon Prof Manohar Bance at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge told BBC News. \"What I am hoping is that we can start to use gene therapy in young children.\"\n\nAccording to experts, hearing loss caused by a variation in the Otof gene is not commonly detected until children are two or three years old when a speech delay is likely. They are hopeful that gene therapy can replace implants or aids.\n\n\"The younger we can restore hearing, the better for all children because the brain starts to shut down its plasticity [adaptability] after the age of about three or so,\" Prof Bance told BBC.

The girl -- 18-month-old Opal Sandy from Oxfordshire -- received an experimental treatment for auditory neuropathy, a condition that results from a mutation in a gene called Biallelic otoferlin gene (OTOF), as part of an ongoing clinical trial.\n\nAs the BBC reports, the mutation results in incorrect development of tiny hairs in the cochlea that are crucial for magnifying sound waves and converting the resultant information into signals that can be passed onto the brain. This results in what the case description describes as \"severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss.\"\n\nUntil now, this hearing loss has been treated with cochlear implants -- Opal's older sister Nora, who also has the genetic mutation, has these in both ears, and Opal herself has one in the ear that didn't receive the new treatment. While implants bypass the damaged areas to send sound directly to the auditory nerve, the new treatment aims to repair the damage instead. It does so by repairing the faulty gene, which in turn prompts the growth of functional hairs. To do this, the healthy gene is placed into an otherwise inert virus -- \"a dual adeno-associated virus (AAV1) vector designed for intracochlear delivery of a full-length copy of the human OTOF gene.\" This virus, referred to as DB-OTO, is injected into the cochlea, and facilitates the replacement of the faulty gene with the healthy one.\n\nThe BBC reported on the successful trial of a similar treatment in mice back in 2017, and at the time, the scientists behind that study predicted that the technique could be extended to humans \"in the near future.\" Opal's case is the first attempt at doing so, and so far, it seems to be a success. She received the treatment at 10 months of age, and as the case description reports, \"twelve weeks after treatment [Opal] did not have any side effects related to the treatment, and improvements in hearing were reported in the treated ear.\" Now, more than six months later, her hearing has gone from strength to strength: \"[Opal] can hear sounds as soft as a whisper and is starting to talk.\"\n\nWhile the case report describes the results as \"encouraging,\" The Guardian spoke to the girl's mother, who summed the improvement up rather more charmingly: \"Bonkers.\" It's not all sweetness and light, though, because Opal's newfound hearing has apparently led to the development of a new hobby: \"Slamming cutlery on the table to make as much noise as possible.\"", "source":

The toddler was also fitted with a cochlear implant in her left ear to ensure she had hearing.\n\nHowever, her parents soon noticed she could hear without the implant.\n\nOpal's parents said they were \"gobsmacked\" when they realised she could hear just weeks after the surgery.\n\n\"It was about three weeks post-surgery, which was about a week after her implant had been turned on,\" Jo said.\n\n\"We were sort of in the routine of testing quite loud sounds like banging, clapping, wooden spoons on saucepans, that kind of intermittent loud noise.\n\n\"I was testing that with her implant on and hadn't realised that her implant had actually come off, and she turned to pretty loud clapping. I couldn't believe it.\n\n\"I thought it was a fluke or like a change in light or something that had caught her eye, but I repeated it a few times.\n\n\"I picked my phone up and texted James, and said 'I think it's working'. I was absolutely gobsmacked.\"\n\nShe added that there was \"no way in a million years\" that she thought Opal would be able to turn to sound without wearing an implant.\n\nThe surgeon at the Sandys local hospital knew of Professor Manohar Bance's work and that he was running a trial using a gene therapy from biotech firm Regeneron at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.\n\nThe couple was told they would notice a change in Opal's hearing within the first six months, which is why Jo was so surprised it happened so soon.\n\nThe Sandys have an older daughter, Nora, 5, who has the same genetic form of auditory neuropathy as Opal and wears cochlear implants, which is the current standard treatment.\n\nThe couple said they found out Nora was deaf at nine months old, and was told that any subsequent children could have additional hearing tests at birth.\n\n\"Hearing that Opal was deaf - of course there was a grieving process that we went through the same as when we found out that Nora was as well - but Nora had set the bar really high and we knew what was possible with lots of hard work and support from lots of people,\" Jo said.\n\nJames said he noticed a massive improvement in his little girl's hearing in the 18 to 24 weeks post-surgery.\n\nNow, even without the implant in her left ear, Opal can hear perfectly well thanks to the gene therapy.\n\nThe team at Cambridge University Hospitals said she had near-normal hearing by 24 weeks post-surgery.", "source": {"uri": "kenyan-post.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DAILY POST"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hearing loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Implant (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otorhinolaryngology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Otorhinolaryngology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cochlear implant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_neuropathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auditory neuropathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addenbrooke's_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Addenbrooke's Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hearing test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biotechnology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cambridge"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cambridge"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhUghChLjt3AwRWymvRx8j-FwYQ0ingbxm1ZVZH8sbRQo2satNpjzxN2jhBk-XdW8e_rWrg45-8Zs_WolE3o1iO9f8b1aEn0Gr7axbIw0aM5CZPH3weB2W43ovcQO0sts9PEFi1EBX9QV-LGv-zMDWjNxjBIVmNV3BxgL3yOQ5dwdkkfc-Js8bnAwgV9JE/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551507", "eventUri": "eng-9551507", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 452990497, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 51, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 51}}}

It was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [{"uri":

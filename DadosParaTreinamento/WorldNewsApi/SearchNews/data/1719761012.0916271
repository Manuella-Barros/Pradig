Forbes Travel Guide Four-Star Raffles Makati offers a journey through the rich tapestry of Filipino creativity with its ARTour, the city\u2019s only tour led by an art concierge outside of a museum. The property\u2019s exceptional collection, which spans more than 1,600 works, has become a must-see for art enthusiasts and cultural connoisseurs.

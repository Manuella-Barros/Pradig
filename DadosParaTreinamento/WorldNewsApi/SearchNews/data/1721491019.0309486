Paul revealed last summer that he had been diagnosed with stage four rectal cancer. The musician shared the sad news with fans on Twitter, but vowed he's 'staying positive' as he prepares to discuss the next steps with doctors. Posting an image from a recent performance, Dario wrote: 'Hard to write this. I've just found out that I've got stage 4 rectal cancer and a shadow on my liver. That's damn hard to read too I'm sure. 'Gonna give it my best shot though. Stay positive, cos I am. Always. Seeing the doctors on Friday to discuss the next steps.' He ended his post with '#f**kcancer' and a four-leaf clover Emoji. After sharing the diagnosis, Paul was flooded with messages of support, with one writing: 'Sending all my love.' A second put: 'Stay Strong,' as a third then wrote: 'I am so so sorry. Sending all my love xx.' In April, Paul shared an update on his condition, writing: 'I\u2019m a fighter but wow this is a fight. I\u2019d appreciated your love, prayers, healing energy & vibes. 'A cure would be pretty useful too :) Currently in hospital for acute pain. Radio therapy next week. 'Looking to future therapies too. Thank you all. Happy thoughts only please. Happy.' Rectal cancer is a disease in which cancerous cells form in the tissues of the rectum, and signs can include blood in stools, irregular bowel habits, unexplained weight loss, or a change in appetite. Stage four cancer is where the cancer has spread from where it started to another organ in the body and is often called secondary cancer. When caught early enough, rectal cancer is relatively treatable. Paul was previously part of the electronic music trio known as Dario G, with their house track Sunchyme reaching Number Two in the charts. The song's iconic video featured dancers in safari costumes and matching makeup. While the trio has since disbanded, Paul continues to perform under its stage name. More recently, Paul took to the stage for the Biggest 90s Disco, which featured fellow music legends Vengaboys, 2 Unlimited, Haddaway and Phats & Small. Snaps from his recent performances showed Paul delighting crowds in venues across the UK by playing the electric piano and performing Sunchyme. In 1997, Dario G reached number five in the charts, with their follow-up single Carnaval de Paris, which was later made the official song of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, which was held in France.", "summary": "The DJ,\u00a0real name Paul Spencer, lost his battle with the disease aged 53 it was announced in a statment on Monday as tributes posed in for the 90s icon.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13539885/Dario-g-final-post-death-tragic-cancer.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/17/21/86236655-0-image-m-23_1718656613868.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:11:08", "author": "Editor,Geraint Llewellyn", "authors": ["Editor", "Geraint Llewellyn"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.129}

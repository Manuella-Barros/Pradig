Chief Oliver Okpala, the Senior Special Assistant on Public Enlightenment to the All Progressives Congress (APC), National Chairman stated this while reacting to Primate Ayodele who had a few days ago prophesied that the National Chairman of the APC, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje\u2019s time was up and that he would soon be replaced. He further stated \u201dhe won\u2019t be appreciated, there\u2019ll be problems between him and other party members. He should watch his back, they want to stab him. Somebody is about to replace him. Let them be careful so that there won\u2019t be any crisis or unexpected gunshot inside the secretariat. According to the press statement on Wednesday signed by Okpala, the constant prophesying of doom and disaster by Primate Ayodele are to say the least ungodly, against the doctrines of Christianity and acceptable tenets of humanity. Recall that Primate Ayodele in the statement spoke through his media aide Oluwatosin Osho Ayodele. \u201cSince Primate Ayodele hasn\u2019t denied this politically motivated prophecy, the conclusion then is that he authorised it. \u201cOne wonders how a man of God can be prophesying catastrophic events always and warning of gunshots. \u201cMen of God, both in the bible and even the holy Koran are known to always preach peace, unity, love and happiness. \u201cEven when such negative things are revealed to them about their nation or individuals, they pray fervently against such occurrences and anything to the contrary is deviant and ungodly. \u201cThrough this and similar prophecies, Primate Ayodele tends to make people believe that he is a politician in cassock. \u201cFrom the presentation and analysis of the prophecy in question, it is clear that it is a personal, politically motivated opinion by a man of god. \u201cIt\u2019s condemnable for ministers of gospel to increasingly be tarnishing the glorious image of christianity in our country. \u201cOur Muslim brothers hardly descend to this banal religious denigration and manipulation. \u201cIf his prophecies in the past have failed to come true, he should look back and return to the divine path of religious rectitude. \u201cGod warned in Jeremiah 23:16 \u201cthus saith the Lord of hosts, hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you. They lead you unto vanity. They speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the Lord\u2019. \u201cDr. Ganduje knows too well that no religion preaches confusion. He remains focused working closely with our amiable leader, President Bola Tinubu. \u201cThe National Chairman, irrespective of prophecies of doom and catastrophe will never succumb to politics of bad blood for he is widely known as a man who has love for his people and the nation. \u201cLet our prophets preach and work for the unity and stability of our beloved country for the holy bible warns against false prophecies or prophets speaking out of their own minds under the guise of prophesying,\u201d he added.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"442\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Primate-Ayodele-9.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Primate-Ayodele-9.jpg 442w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Primate-Ayodele-9-300x250.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" /></div>LAGOS &#8211; Primate Elijah Ayodele of the INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church has been told to desist from political prophecies of doom for governments in power, and the downfall of politicians in the country.

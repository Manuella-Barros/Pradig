Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nFire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nFires in several western states and Canada have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze. In the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage.\n\nThe Durkee Fire, burning near the Oregon-Idaho border about 130 miles (209 kilometers) west of Boise, Idaho, caused the closure of a stretch of Interstate 84 again Wednesday. Amid rapidly forming storms in the afternoon, the blaze crossed the interstate near the town of Huntington, home to about 500 people. It also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release Wednesday evening, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nKotek said she had deployed the National Guard to the region. The Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities at risk.\n\nThe nearly 420-square-mile (1,088-square-kilometer) blaze had prompted the evacuation of Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power. City officials also said Wednesday that gas service to residents had been shut off until the evacuation orders are lifted.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boise said the storms were capable of producing wind gusts up to 70 mph with blowing dust reducing visibility. A storm about 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Huntington near Baker City on Wednesday afternoon had recorded a wind gust of 66 mph (106 kph), the weather service said.\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain fell that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, authorities said. Flash flood warnings were issued for Huntington and in a nearby burn scar area.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages, and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said. The utility also cut power to customers in the Boise foothills and other nearby areas, citing extreme weather and wildfire risk.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nA fire in southern California also was moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nThe smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Durkee and other fires. A red flag warning was in effect, and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lisa Baumann contributed from

The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nFire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nFires in several western states and Canada have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze. In the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage.\n\nThe Durkee Fire, burning near the Oregon-Idaho border about 130 miles (209 kilometers) west of Boise, Idaho, caused the closure of a stretch of Interstate 84 again Wednesday. Amid rapidly forming storms in the afternoon, the blaze crossed the interstate near the town of Huntington, home to about 500 people. It also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release Wednesday evening, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nKotek said she had deployed the National Guard to the region. The Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities at risk.\n\nThe nearly 420-square-mile (1,088-square-kilometer) blaze had prompted the evacuation of Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power. City officials also said Wednesday that gas service to residents had been shut off until the evacuation orders are lifted.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boise said the storms were capable of producing wind gusts up to 70 mph with blowing dust reducing visibility. A storm about 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Huntington near Baker City on Wednesday afternoon had recorded a wind gust of 66 mph (106 kph), the weather service said.\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain fell that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, authorities said. Flash flood warnings were issued for Huntington and in a nearby burn scar area.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages, and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said. The utility also cut power to customers in the Boise foothills and other nearby areas, citing extreme weather and wildfire risk.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nA fire in southern California also was moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nThe smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Durkee and other fires. A red flag warning was in effect, and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lisa Baumann contributed from Bellingham, Washington and Martha Bellisle contributed from Seattle.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nFire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nFires in several western states and Canada have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze. In the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage.\n\nThe Durkee Fire, burning near the Oregon-Idaho border about 130 miles (209 kilometers) west of Boise, Idaho, caused the closure of a stretch of Interstate 84 again Wednesday. Amid rapidly forming storms in the afternoon, the blaze crossed the interstate near the town of Huntington, home to about 500 people. It also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release Wednesday evening, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nKotek said she had deployed the National Guard to the region. The Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities at risk.\n\nThe nearly 420-square-mile (1,088-square-kilometer) blaze had prompted the evacuation of Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power. City officials also said Wednesday that gas service to residents had been shut off until the evacuation orders are lifted.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boise said the storms were capable of producing wind gusts up to 70 mph with blowing dust reducing visibility. A storm about 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Huntington near Baker City on Wednesday afternoon had recorded a wind gust of 66 mph (106 kph), the weather service said.\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain fell that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, authorities said. Flash flood warnings were issued for Huntington and in a nearby burn scar area.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages, and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said. The utility also cut power to customers in the Boise foothills and other nearby areas, citing extreme weather and wildfire risk.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nA fire in southern California also was moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nThe smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Durkee and other fires. A red flag warning was in effect, and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Lisa Baumann contributed from

Amid rapidly forming storms in the afternoon, the blaze crossed the interstate near the town of Huntington, home to about 500 people. It also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release Wednesday evening, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nShe said she had deployed the National Guard to the region.\n\nThe nearly 420-square-mile (1,088-square-kilometer) blaze had prompted the evacuation of Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power. City officials also said Wednesday that gas service to residents had been shut off until the evacuation orders are lifted.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small dozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire came down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boise said the storms were capable of producing wind gusts up to 70 mph with blowing dust reducing visibility. A storm about 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Huntington near Baker City on Wednesday afternoon had recorded a wind gust of 66 mph (106 kph), the weather service said.\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain fell that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, authorities said. Flash flood warnings were issued for Huntington and in a nearby burn scar area.\n\nA flash flood warning was issued for the Cow Valley burn scar in Eastern Oregon at about 8 p.m. Wednesday and was expected to last until 10:30 p.m., said Les Colin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, Idaho. A strong thunderstorm moved into a burned area that is especially susceptible to flooding, he said. No homes are in the area but Interstate 84 runs close by.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires on Wednesday.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages, and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said. The utility also cut power to customers in the Boise foothills and other nearby areas, citing extreme weather and wildfire risk.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nA fire in southern California also was moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire is spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square mile (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nThe smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Durkee and other fires. A red flag warning was in effect, and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lisa Baumann contributed from

Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nFire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines.

It also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov.

City officials also said Wednesday that gas service to residents had been shut off until the evacuation orders are lifted.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small dozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire came down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\nWildfires prompted evacuations in Northern California amid a rapidly growing wildfire Thursday, a day after powerful winds and lightning strikes from thunderstorms rattled eastern Oregon and Idaho, cutting power and stoking fires, including one in Oregon that was the largest active blaze in the United States. Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nFire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nFires in several western states and Canada have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze. In the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage.\n\nThe Durkee Fire, burning near the Oregon-Idaho border about 130 miles (209 kilometers) west of Boise, Idaho, caused the closure of a stretch of Interstate 84 again Wednesday. Amid rapidly forming storms in the afternoon, the blaze crossed the interstate near the town of Huntington, home to about 500 people. It also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release Wednesday evening, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nKotek said she had deployed the National Guard to the region. The Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities at risk.\n\nThe nearly 420-square-mile (1,088-square-kilometer) blaze had prompted the evacuation of Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power. City officials also said Wednesday that gas service to residents had been shut off until the evacuation orders are lifted.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boise said the storms were capable of producing wind gusts up to 70 mph with blowing dust reducing visibility. A storm about 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Huntington near Baker City on Wednesday afternoon had recorded a wind gust of 66 mph (106 kph), the weather service said.\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain fell that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, authorities said. Flash flood warnings were issued for Huntington and in a nearby burn scar area.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages, and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said. The utility also cut power to customers in the Boise foothills and other nearby areas, citing extreme weather and wildfire risk.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nA fire in southern California also was moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nThe smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Durkee and other fires. A red flag warning was in effect, and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

Amid rapidly forming storms in the afternoon, the blaze crossed the interstate near the town of Huntington, home to about 500 people. It also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release Wednesday evening, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nShe said she had deployed the National Guard to the region.\n\nThe nearly 420-square-mile (1,088-square-kilometer) blaze had prompted the evacuation of Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power. City officials also said Wednesday that gas service to residents had been shut off until the evacuation orders are lifted.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small dozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire came down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boise said the storms were capable of producing wind gusts up to 70 mph with blowing dust reducing visibility. A storm about 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Huntington near Baker City on Wednesday afternoon had recorded a wind gust of 66 mph (106 kph), the weather service said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain fell that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, authorities said. Flash flood warnings were issued for Huntington and in a nearby burn scar area.\n\nA flash flood warning was issued for the Cow Valley burn scar in Eastern Oregon at about 8 p.m. Wednesday and was expected to last until 10:30 p.m., said Les Colin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, Idaho. A strong thunderstorm moved into a burned area that is especially susceptible to flooding, he said. No homes are in the area but Interstate 84 runs close by.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires on Wednesday.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages, and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said. The utility also cut power to customers in the Boise foothills and other nearby areas, citing extreme weather and wildfire risk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nA fire in southern California also was moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire is spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square mile (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nThe smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Durkee and other fires. A red flag warning was in effect, and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily.

Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nFire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nFires in several western states and Canada have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze. In the Canadian Rockies\u00b4 largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage.\n\nThe Durkee Fire, burning near the Oregon-Idaho border about 130 miles (209 kilometers) west of Boise, Idaho, caused the closure of a stretch of Interstate 84 again Wednesday. Amid rapidly forming storms in the afternoon, the blaze crossed the interstate near the town of Huntington, home to about 500 people. It also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release Wednesday evening, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nIn this photo provided by Alison Oszman, a fast-moving wildfire near the Orego-Idaho border moves toward a home on Rye Valley Lane in Huntington, Ore., in the afternoon o fWednesday, July 24, 2024. (Alison Oszman via AP Photo)\n\nKotek said she had deployed the National Guard to the region. The Oregon State Fire Marshal\u00b4s office also mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities at risk.\n\nThe nearly 420-square-mile (1,088-square-kilometer) blaze had prompted the evacuation of Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power. City officials also said Wednesday that gas service to residents had been shut off until the evacuation orders are lifted.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman\u00b4s home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn\u00b4t land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boise said the storms were capable of producing wind gusts up to 70 mph with blowing dust reducing visibility. A storm about 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Huntington near Baker City on Wednesday afternoon had recorded a wind gust of 66 mph (106 kph), the weather service said.\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain fell that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, authorities said. Flash flood warnings were issued for Huntington and in a nearby burn scar area.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages, and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said. The utility also cut power to customers in the Boise foothills and other nearby areas, citing extreme weather and wildfire risk.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nA fire in southern California also was moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nThe smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it\u00b4s so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman\u00b4s shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Durkee and other fires. A red flag warning was in effect, and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don\u00b4t light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Lisa Baumann contributed from Bellingham, Washington and Martha Bellisle contributed from Seattle.\n\nThis photo provided by the Oregon Department of Transportation shows the Durkee Fire burning in eastern Ore., Monday, July 22, 2024.

Amid rapidly forming storms in the afternoon, the blaze crossed the interstate near the town of Huntington, home to about 500 people. It also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release Wednesday evening, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nShe said she had deployed the National Guard to the region.\n\nThe nearly 420-square-mile (1,088-square-kilometer) blaze had prompted the evacuation of Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power. City officials also said Wednesday that gas service to residents had been shut off until the evacuation orders are lifted.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boise said the storms were capable of producing wind gusts up to 70 mph with blowing dust reducing visibility. A storm about 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Huntington near Baker City on Wednesday afternoon had recorded a wind gust of 66 mph (106 kph), the weather service said.\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain fell that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, authorities said. Flash flood warnings were issued for Huntington and in a nearby burn scar area.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires on Wednesday.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages, and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said. The utility also cut power to customers in the Boise foothills and other nearby areas, citing extreme weather and wildfire risk.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nThe smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Durkee and other fires. A red flag warning was in effect, and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Lisa Baumann contributed from

Amid rapidly forming storms in the afternoon, the blaze crossed the interstate near the town of Huntington, home to about 500 people. It also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release Wednesday evening, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nShe said she had deployed the National Guard to the region.\n\nThe nearly 400-square-mile (1036-square-kilometer) blaze had prompted the evacuation of Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boise said the storms were capable of producing wind gusts up to 70 mph with blowing dust reducing visibility. A storm about 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Huntington near Baker City on Wednesday afternoon had recorded a wind gust of 66 mph (106 kph), the weather service said.\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain was expected that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, the sheriff's office said on Facebook.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires on Wednesday.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages, and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said. The utility also cut power to customers in the Boise foothills, citing extreme weather and wildfire risk.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nThe smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Durkee and other fires. A red flag warning was in effect, and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily.

Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFires in several western states and Canada have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze. In the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage.\n\nThe Durkee Fire, burning near the Oregon-Idaho border about 130 miles (209 kilometers) west of Boise, Idaho, caused the closure of a stretch of Interstate 84 again Wednesday.

City officials also said Wednesday that gas service to residents had been shut off until the evacuation orders are lifted.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boise said the storms were capable of producing wind gusts up to 70 mph with blowing dust reducing visibility. A storm about 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Huntington near Baker City on Wednesday afternoon had recorded a wind gust of 66 mph (106 kph), the weather service said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain fell that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, authorities said. Flash flood warnings were issued for Huntington and in a nearby burn scar area.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages, and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said. The utility also cut power to customers in the Boise foothills and other nearby areas, citing extreme weather and wildfire risk.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nA fire in southern California also was moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nThe smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond.

Amid rapidly forming storms in the afternoon, the blaze crossed the interstate near the town of Huntington, home to about 500 people. It also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release Wednesday evening, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nShe said she had deployed the National Guard to the region.\n\nThe nearly 400-square-mile (1036-square-kilometer) blaze had prompted the evacuation of Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boise said the storms were capable of producing wind gusts up to 70 mph with blowing dust reducing visibility. A storm about 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Huntington near Baker City on Wednesday afternoon had recorded a wind gust of 66 mph (106 kph), the weather service said.\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain was expected that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, the sheriff's office said on Facebook.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires on Wednesday.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages, and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said. The utility also cut power to customers in the Boise foothills, citing extreme weather and wildfire risk.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nThe smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Durkee and other fires. A red flag warning was in effect, and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Lisa Baumann contributed from

Evacuations were ordered in Butte and Tehama counties, with the blaze only 3% contained early Thursday.\n\nCalifornia authorities did not immediately name the man they arrested.\n\nAs evacuations continued in California, some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the biggest active blaze in the United States. Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nOfficials remain concerned that lightning from the storm -- which brought wind gusts of up to 75 mph -- could spark new blazes. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nThe lightning strikes along the Oregon-Idaho border started 15 new fires overnight in Idaho, the U.S. Forest Service told Boise's KBOI-TV, but several had already been extinguished. Overall, nearly 1 million acres (1,562 square miles) had burned so far this summer in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon alone has 34 large fires, almost all of them in the eastern part of the state far from\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time done a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nThe storms are bringing cooler air, but the wind could stoke more fires, warned Mike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise.\n\n\"Every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nThe Durkee Fire was burning near the Oregon-Idaho state line, shutting down a stretch of Interstate 84 and leaving ranchers in the largely rural area fighting to save their cattle and grasslands their herds rely upon for food.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nMore than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, state officials said. Hurricane-force winds carried strong thunderstorms into western Montana, toppling trees, downing power lines and damaging gas lines in the Missoula area. A fire warning was in effect in central Montana due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front said temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius).\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nAssociated Press

A storm with lightning and high winds exacerbates it", "body": "BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- A wildfire burning in Oregon that's kicking smoke into neighboring states is now the largest active blaze in the U.S., authorities said, and a storm Wednesday with lightning and strong winds was prompting additional evacuations.\n\nThe Durkee Fire, burning near the Oregon-Idaho border about 130 miles (209 kilometers) west of Boise shut down part of Interstate 84 Tuesday as the flames approached the vital link between the states. The freeway briefly reopened Wednesday, but closed again as officials warned of frequent disruptions because of the nearly 400-square-mile (1036-square-kilometer) blaze.\n\nThe town of Huntington, Oregon, home to about 500 people, remained evacuated for a third full day, and authorities issued warnings about the coming storm to those who have remained behind. The blaze crossed the interstate near Huntington Wednesday afternoon and additional mandatory evacuations were issued. Wind gusts of up to 75 mph (121 kph), lightning and heavy rain was expected that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, the Baker County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.\n\n\"This continues to be an incredibly dynamic situation,\" the sheriff's office posted later Wednesday.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also cautioned residents about the risk posed by the storm and the expected \"abundant\" lightning. The agency mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires nearby.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said.\n\n\"Power outages and freeway closures are expected. In the event that the fire reaches the City of Huntington, there may be delays in assisting residents that have not previously evacuated,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nAlready, the smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Oregon fire. A red flag warning was in effect and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nAP writer Lisa Baumann contributed from Bellingham,

In eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire, the nation's biggest, and another nearby blaze.\n\nA burning car pushed into a gully sparked California's largest wildfire of the year, authorities said Thursday as they announced the arrest of a suspect. Meanwhile other blazes scorched the Pacific Northwest.\n\nFlames from the fire the man is accused of starting exploded into what is now the Park Fire, which has burned more than 110 square miles (289 square kilometers) near the city of Chico. Evacuations were ordered in Butte and Tehama counties, with the blaze only 3% contained by midday Thursday.\n\nCalifornia authorities did not immediately name the man they arrested.\n\nAs evacuations continued in California, some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the biggest active blaze in the United States. More than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, and another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze.\n\nBaker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend\" and the Oregon State Fire Marshal said firefighters were set to \"seize the opportunity\" of better conditions to push back the fire on the Oregon-Idaho border that remained unpredictable and just 20% contained, according to the government website InciWeb.\n\nLightning strikes along the Oregon-Idaho border started 15 new fires overnight in Idaho, the U.S. Forest Service told Boise's KBOI-TV, but several had already been extinguished by Thursday afternoon. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nOverall, nearly 1,562 square miles (4,045 square kilometers) have burned so far this summer in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon alone has 34 large fires, almost all of them in the central or eastern part of the state.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time instituted a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a Thursday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was heading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.4 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) overnight and was 10% contained by Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn Montana, a fire warning was in effect in the central part of the state due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front meant temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). After hurricane-force winds toppled trees, downed power lines and damaged gas lines in the Missoula area, authorities urged people to stay out of rivers because they might be electrified.\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' Jasper National Park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the park's namesake town, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nAssociated Press writers Claire

The freeway briefly reopened Wednesday, but closed again as officials warned of frequent disruptions because of the nearly 400-square-mile (1036-square-kilometer) blaze.\n\nThe town of Huntington, Oregon, home to about 500 people, remained evacuated for a third full day, and authorities issued warnings about the coming storm to those who have remained behind. The blaze crossed the interstate near Huntington Wednesday afternoon and additional mandatory evacuations were issued. Wind gusts of up to 75 mph (121 kph), lightning and heavy rain was expected that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, the Baker County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.\n\n\"This continues to be an incredibly dynamic situation,\" the sheriff's office posted later Wednesday.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also cautioned residents about the risk posed by the storm and the expected \"abundant\" lightning. The agency mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires nearby.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said.\n\n\"Power outages and freeway closures are expected. In the event that the fire reaches the City of Huntington, there may be delays in assisting residents that have not previously evacuated,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nAlready, the smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Oregon fire. A red flag warning was in effect and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nAP writer Lisa Baumann contributed from Bellingham,

Meanwhile other blazes scorched the Pacific Northwest.\n\nFlames from the fire the man is accused of starting exploded into what is now the Park Fire, which has burned more than 110 square miles (289 square kilometers) near the city of Chico. Evacuations were ordered in Butte and Tehama counties, with the blaze only 3% contained by midday Thursday.\n\nCalifornia authorities did not immediately name the man they arrested.\n\nAs evacuations continued in California, some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the biggest active blaze in the United States. More than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, and another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze.\n\nBaker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend\" and the Oregon State Fire Marshal said firefighters were set to \"seize the opportunity\" of better conditions to push back the fire on the Oregon-Idaho border that remained unpredictable and just 20% contained, according to the government website InciWeb.\n\nLightning strikes along the Oregon-Idaho border started 15 new fires overnight in Idaho, the U.S. Forest Service told Boise's KBOI-TV, but several had already been extinguished by Thursday afternoon. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nOverall, nearly 1,562 square miles (4,045 square kilometers) have burned so far this summer in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon alone has 34 large fires, almost all of them in the central or eastern part of the state.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time instituted a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a Thursday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was heading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.4 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) overnight and was 10% contained by Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn Montana, a fire warning was in effect in the central part of the state due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front meant temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). After hurricane-force winds toppled trees, downed power lines and damaged gas lines in the Missoula area, authorities urged people to stay out of rivers because they might be electrified.\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' Jasper National Park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the park's namesake town, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers

Officials Warn an Impending Storm Could Exacerbate It", "body": "BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- A wildfire burning in Oregon that's kicking smoke into neighboring states is now the largest active blaze in the U.S., authorities said, and fire crews are bracing for a storm late Wednesday that's expected to bring lightning, strong winds and the risk of flash floods.\n\nThe Durkee Fire, burning near the Oregon-Idaho border about 130 miles (209 kilometers) west of Boise, Idaho, shut down Interstate 84 for hours on Tuesday as the flames approached the vital link between the states. The freeway briefly reopened Wednesday, but then closed again as officials warned of frequent disruptions because of the nearly 400-square-mile (1036-square-kilometer) blaze.\n\nThe town of Huntington, Oregon, home to about 500 people, remained evacuated for a third full day, and authorities issued warnings about the coming storm to those who have remained behind. The storm could bring wind gusts of up to 75 mph (121 kph), lightning and heavy rain that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, the Baker County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also cautioned residents about the risk posed by the storm and the expected \"abundant\" lightning. The agency has mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires nearby.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages.\n\n\"Power outages and freeway closures are expected. In the event that the fire reaches the City of Huntington, there may be delays in assisting residents that have not previously evacuated,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nAlready, the smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Oregon fire. A red flag warning was in effect and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The freeway briefly reopened Wednesday, but then closed again as officials warned of frequent disruptions because of the nearly 400-square-mile (1036-square-kilometer) blaze.\n\nThe town of Huntington, Oregon, home to about 500 people, remained evacuated for a third full day, and authorities issued warnings about the coming storm to those who have remained behind. The storm could bring wind gusts of up to 75 mph (121 kph), lightning and heavy rain that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, the Baker County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also cautioned residents about the risk posed by the storm and the expected \"abundant\" lightning. The agency has mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires nearby.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages.\n\n\"Power outages and freeway closures are expected.

The DA says his name will be released later Thursday.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nBOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Rapidly growing wildfires prompted evacuations in Northern and Southern California on Thursday, while some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the largest active blaze in the United States. Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nOfficials remain concerned that lightning from the storm -- which brought wind gusts of up to 75 mph -- could spark new blazes. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time done a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nThe storms are bringing cooler air, but the wind could stoke more fires, warned Mike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise.\n\n\"Every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nThe Durkee Fire was burning near the Oregon-Idaho state line, shutting down a stretch of Interstate 84 and leaving ranchers in the largely rural area fighting to save their cattle and grasslands their herds rely upon for food.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire, which burned more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) near Chico. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nMore than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, state officials said. Hurricane-force winds carried strong thunderstorms into western Montana, toppling trees, downing power lines and damaging gas lines in the Missoula area. A fire warning was in effect in central Montana due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front said temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius).\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick

The DA says his name will be released later Thursday.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nBOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Rapidly growing wildfires prompted evacuations in Northern and Southern California on Thursday, while some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the largest active blaze in the United States. Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nOfficials remain concerned that lightning from the storm -- which brought wind gusts of up to 75 mph -- could spark new blazes. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time done a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nThe storms are bringing cooler air, but the wind could stoke more fires, warned Mike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise.\n\n\"Every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nThe Durkee Fire was burning near the Oregon-Idaho state line, shutting down a stretch of Interstate 84 and leaving ranchers in the largely rural area fighting to save their cattle and grasslands their herds rely upon for food.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire, which burned more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) near Chico. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nMore than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, state officials said. Hurricane-force winds carried strong thunderstorms into western Montana, toppling trees, downing power lines and damaging gas lines in the Missoula area. A fire warning was in effect in central Montana due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front said temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius).\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nAssociated Press

The freeway briefly reopened Wednesday, but then closed again as officials warned of frequent disruptions because of the nearly 400-square-mile (1036-square-kilometer) blaze.\n\nThe town of Huntington, Oregon, home to about 500 people, remained evacuated for a third full day, and authorities issued warnings about the coming storm to those who have remained behind. The storm could bring wind gusts of up to 75 mph (121 kph), lightning and heavy rain that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, the Baker County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also cautioned residents about the risk posed by the storm and the expected \"abundant\" lightning. The agency has mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires nearby.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages.\n\n\"Power outages and freeway closures are expected. In the event that the fire reaches the City of Huntington, there may be delays in assisting residents that have not previously evacuated,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nAlready, the smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Oregon fire. A red flag warning was in effect and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nSalt Lake City celebrates

The DA says his name will be released later Thursday.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nBOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Rapidly growing wildfires prompted evacuations in Northern and Southern California on Thursday, while some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the largest active blaze in the United States. Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nOfficials remain concerned that lightning from the storm -- which brought wind gusts of up to 75 mph -- could spark new blazes. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time done a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nThe storms are bringing cooler air, but the wind could stoke more fires, warned Mike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise.\n\n\"Every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nThe Durkee Fire was burning near the Oregon-Idaho state line, shutting down a stretch of Interstate 84 and leaving ranchers in the largely rural area fighting to save their cattle and grasslands their herds rely upon for food.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire, which burned more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) near Chico. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nMore than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, state officials said. Hurricane-force winds carried strong thunderstorms into western Montana, toppling trees, downing power lines and damaging gas lines in the Missoula area. A fire warning was in effect in central Montana due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front said temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius).\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\n___\n\nAssociated

Meanwhile other blazes scorched the Pacific Northwest.\n\nFlames from the fire the man is accused of starting exploded into what is now the Park Fire, which has burned more than 110 square miles (289 square kilometers) near the city of Chico. Evacuations were ordered in Butte and Tehama counties, with the blaze only 3% contained by midday Thursday.\n\nCalifornia authorities did not immediately name the man they arrested.\n\nAs evacuations continued in California, some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the biggest active blaze in the United States. More than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, and another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nLightning strikes along the Oregon-Idaho border started 15 new fires overnight in Idaho, the U.S. Forest Service told Boise's KBOI-TV, but several had already been extinguished by Thursday afternoon. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nOverall, nearly 1,562 square miles (4,045 square kilometers) have burned so far this summer in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon alone has 34 large fires, almost all of them in the eastern part of the state.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time instituted a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a Thursday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was heading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.4 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) overnight and was 10% contained by Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn Montana, a fire warning was in effect in the central part of the state due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front meant temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). After hurricane-force winds toppled trees, downed power lines and damaged gas lines in the Missoula area, authorities urged people to stay out of rivers because they might be electrified.\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' Jasper National Park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the park's namesake town, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa

Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nPeople are also reading...

No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nFires in several western states and Canada have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze. In the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage.\n\nThe Durkee Fire, burning near the Oregon-Idaho border about 130 miles (209 kilometers) west of Boise, Idaho, caused the closure of a stretch of Interstate 84 again Wednesday. Amid rapidly forming storms in the afternoon, the blaze crossed the interstate near the town of Huntington, home to about 500 people. It also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release Wednesday evening, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nKotek said she had deployed the National Guard to the region. The Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities at risk.\n\nThe nearly 420-square-mile (1,088-square-kilometer) blaze had prompted the evacuation of Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power. City officials also said Wednesday that gas service to residents had been shut off until the evacuation orders are lifted.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boise said the storms were capable of producing wind gusts up to 70 mph with blowing dust reducing visibility. A storm about 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Huntington near Baker City on Wednesday afternoon had recorded a wind gust of 66 mph (106 kph), the weather service said.\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain fell that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, authorities said. Flash flood warnings were issued for Huntington and in a nearby burn scar area.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages, and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said. The utility also cut power to customers in the Boise foothills and other nearby areas, citing extreme weather and wildfire risk.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nA fire in southern California also was moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nThe smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Durkee and other fires. A red flag warning was in effect, and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Lisa Baumann contributed from Bellingham, Washington and Martha Bellisle contributed from Seattle.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The DA says his name will be released later Thursday.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nBOISE, Idaho -- Rapidly growing wildfires prompted evacuations in Northern and Southern California on Thursday, while some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the largest active blaze in the United States. Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nPHOTOS: A man is under arrest on suspicion of starting a California wildfire, prosecutor says\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles to more than 70 square miles and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nOfficials remain concerned that lightning from the storm - which brought wind gusts of up to 75 mph - could spark new blazes. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time done a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nThe storms are bringing cooler air, but the wind could stoke more fires, warned Mike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise.\n\n\"Every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nThe Durkee Fire was burning near the Oregon-Idaho state line, shutting down a stretch of Interstate 84 and leaving ranchers in the largely rural area fighting to save their cattle and grasslands their herds rely upon for food.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire, which burned more than 70 square miles near Chico. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nMore than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, state officials said. Hurricane-force winds carried strong thunderstorms into western Montana, toppling trees, downing power lines and damaging gas lines in the Missoula area. A fire warning was in effect in central Montana due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front said temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\n___\n\nAssociated

Wind gusts of up to 75 mph (121 kph), lightning and heavy rain was expected that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, the Baker County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.\n\n\"This continues to be an incredibly dynamic situation,\" the sheriff's office posted later Wednesday.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also cautioned residents about the risk posed by the storm and the expected \"abundant\" lightning. The agency mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires nearby.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said.\n\n\"Power outages and freeway closures are expected. In the event that the fire reaches the City of Huntington, there may be delays in assisting residents that have not previously evacuated,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nAlready, the smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond.

Amid rapidly forming storms in the afternoon, the blaze crossed the interstate near the town of Huntington, home to about 500 people. It also merged with the Cow Valley fire that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\nThe lightning-sparked fire started July 17 about 5 miles southwest of Durkee in Baker County and has grown to 268,492 acres. It is 0% contained.\n\n\"The wildfires in eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nShe said she had deployed the National Guard to the region.\n\nEvacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nOfficials had been concerned that lightning from the storm could spark new blazes. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nThe wildfire had prompted the evacuation of Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power. City officials also said Wednesday that gas service to residents had been shut off until the evacuation orders could be lifted.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small dozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire came down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the fire.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain remain ongoing dangers and could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, authorities said. Flash flood warnings were issued for Huntington and in a nearby burn scar area.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new fires in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nThe smoke from the Durkee fire was choking the air, with an air quality warning in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri":

Evacuations were ordered in Butte and Tehama counties, with the blaze only 3% contained early Thursday.\n\nCalifornia authorities did not immediately name the man they arrested.\n\nAs evacuations continued in California, some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the biggest active blaze in the United States. Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nOfficials remain concerned that lightning from the storm -- which brought wind gusts of up to 75 mph -- could spark new blazes. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nThe lightning strikes along the Oregon-Idaho border started 15 new fires overnight in Idaho, the U.S. Forest Service told Boise's KBOI-TV, but several had already been extinguished. Overall, nearly 1 million acres (1,562 square miles) had burned so far this summer in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon alone has 34 large fires, almost all of them in the eastern part of the state far from\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time done a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nThe storms are bringing cooler air, but the wind could stoke more fires, warned Mike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise.\n\n\"Every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nThe Durkee Fire was burning near the Oregon-Idaho state line, shutting down a stretch of Interstate 84 and leaving ranchers in the largely rural area fighting to save their cattle and grasslands their herds rely upon for food.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nMore than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, state officials said. Hurricane-force winds carried strong thunderstorms into western Montana, toppling trees, downing power lines and damaging gas lines in the Missoula area. A fire warning was in effect in central Montana due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front said temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius).\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Baumann in Bellingham, Washington; Martha Bellisle in Seattle; Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon; and Amy Hanson in Helena, Montana, contributed to this report.\n\nR\n\nFOX41

(Oregon Department of Transportation via AP)\n\nA prosecutor says a 42-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of starting a wildfire that has become California's largest this year.\n\nButte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey says Cal Fire arson investigators made the arrest early Thursday after a man was seen pushing a burning car into a gully Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe flames exploded into what is now the Park Fire, which has scorched more than 70 square miles near the city of Chico.\n\nAuthorities later identified the man and a warrant was issued. The DA says his name will be released later Thursday.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nBOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Rapidly growing wildfires prompted evacuations in Northern and Southern California on Thursday, while some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the largest active blaze in the United States. Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nOfficials remain concerned that lightning from the storm -- which brought wind gusts of up to 75 mph -- could spark new blazes. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time done a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nThe storms are bringing cooler air, but the wind could stoke more fires, warned Mike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise.\n\n\"Every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nThe Durkee Fire was burning near the Oregon-Idaho state line, shutting down a stretch of Interstate 84 and leaving ranchers in the largely rural area fighting to save their cattle and grasslands their herds rely upon for food.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire, which burned more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) near Chico. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nMore than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, state officials said. Hurricane-force winds carried strong thunderstorms into western Montana, toppling trees, downing power lines and damaging gas lines in the Missoula area. A fire warning was in effect in central Montana due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front said temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius).\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\n___\n\nAssociated

More than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, and another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nLightning strikes along the Oregon-Idaho border started 15 new fires overnight in Idaho, the U.S. Forest Service told Boise's KBOI-TV, but several had already been extinguished by Thursday afternoon. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nOverall, nearly 1,562 square miles (4,045 square kilometers) have burned so far this summer in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon alone has 34 large fires, almost all of them in the eastern part of the state.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time instituted a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a Thursday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was heading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.4 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) overnight and was 10% contained by Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn Montana, a fire warning was in effect in the central part of the state due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front meant temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). After hurricane-force winds toppled trees, downed power lines and damaged gas lines in the Missoula area, authorities urged people to stay out of rivers because they might be electrified.\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' Jasper National Park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the park's namesake town, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa

Amid rapidly forming storms in the afternoon, the blaze crossed the interstate near the town of Huntington, home to about 500 people. It also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release Wednesday evening, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nShe said she had deployed the National Guard to the region.\n\nThe nearly 420-square-mile blaze had prompted the evacuation of Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boise said the storms were capable of producing wind gusts up to 70 mph with blowing dust reducing visibility. A storm about 44 miles northwest of Huntington near Baker City on Wednesday afternoon had recorded a wind gust of 66 mph, the weather service said.\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain was expected that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, the sheriff's office said on Facebook.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires on Wednesday.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages, and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said. The utility also cut power to customers in the Boise foothills, citing extreme weather and wildfire risk.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nThe smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond.

The freeway briefly reopened Wednesday, but then closed again as officials warned of frequent disruptions because of the nearly 256,000-acre blaze.\n\nThe town of Huntington, about 25 miles northwest of Ontario and home to about 500 people, remained evacuated for a third full day, and authorities issued warnings about the coming storm to those who have remained behind. The storm could bring wind gusts of up to 75 mph, lightning and heavy rain that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, the Baker County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also cautioned residents about the risk posed by the storm and the expected \"abundant\" lightning on Wednesday and Thursday. The agency has mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires nearby.\n\nGov. Tina Kotek invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act for the fires burning in Baker, Malheur, Grant and Umatilla counties. The act allows the state to seek more firefighting help through mutual aid.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" the governor said in a news release. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power. The situation is dynamic, and the teams on the ground are taking it day by day.\n\n\"I have deployed resources from the National Guard that are currently serving Eastern and Southwestern Oregon. I know these communities are supporting one another, doing their part to heed the guidance from officials and showing tremendous gratitude for our firefighters.\"\n\nThe major electricity utility serving parts of Eastern Oregon, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages.\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99\n\n\"Power outages and freeway closures are expected. In the event that the fire reaches the City of Huntington, there may be delays in assisting residents that have not previously evacuated,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\nThe National Interagency Fire Center reported 31 large fires burning in Oregon, higher than in any other state. In an update issued Thursday morning, the agency reported 12 large fires burning in both Arizona and California, the second highest number. The center considers large fires those burning more than 100 acres in timber and 300 acres in grass.\n\nOregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nAlready, the smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise, Idaho, and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it; it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Oregon fire.

A storm about 44 miles (71 kilometers) northwest of Huntington near Baker City on Wednesday afternoon had recorded a wind gust of 66 mph (106 kph), the weather service said.\n\nWind, lightning and heavy rain was expected that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, the sheriff's office said on Facebook.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also cautioned residents about the \"abundant\" lightning. The agency mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires nearby.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages and by late Wednesday afternoon, nearly 7,000 customers were without electricity, the utility said.\n\n\"Power outages and freeway closures are expected. In the event that the fire reaches the City of Huntington, there may be delays in assisting residents that have not previously evacuated,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nAlready, the smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Durkee and other fires. A red flag warning was in effect and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire and be very careful around grass.\"\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news",

Amid rapidly forming storms in the afternoon, the blaze crossed the interstate near the town of Huntington, home to about 500 people. It also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release Wednesday evening, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nShe said she had deployed the National Guard to the region.\n\nThe nearly 420-square-mile (1,088-square-kilometer) blaze had prompted the evacuation of Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power. City officials also said Wednesday that gas service to residents had been shut off until the evacuation orders are lifted.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small dozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire came down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boise said the storms were capable of producing wind gusts up to 70 mph with blowing dust reducing visibility.

Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nOfficials remain concerned that lightning from the storm -- which brought wind gusts of up to 75 mph -- could spark new blazes. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time done a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nThe storms are bringing cooler air, but the wind could stoke more fires, warned Mike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise.\n\n\"Every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nThe Durkee Fire was burning near the Oregon-Idaho state line, shutting down a stretch of Interstate 84 and leaving ranchers in the largely rural area fighting to save their cattle and grasslands their herds rely upon for food.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire, which burned more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) near Chico. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nMore than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, state officials said. Hurricane-force winds carried strong thunderstorms into western Montana, toppling trees, downing power lines and damaging gas lines in the Missoula area. A fire warning was in effect in central Montana due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front said temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius).\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nAssociated Press

Officials warn an...", "body": "BOISE, Idaho (AP) - A wildfire burning in Oregon that's kicking smoke into neighboring states is now the largest active blaze in the U.S., authorities said, and fire crews are bracing for a storm late Wednesday that's expected to bring lightning, strong winds and the risk of flash floods.\n\nThe Durkee Fire, burning near the Oregon-Idaho border about 130 miles (209 kilometers) west of Boise, Idaho, shut down Interstate 84 for hours on Tuesday as the flames approached the vital link between the states. The freeway briefly reopened Wednesday, but then closed again as officials warned of frequent disruptions because of the nearly 400-square-mile (1036-square-kilometer) blaze.\n\nThe town of Huntington, Oregon, home to about 500 people, remained evacuated for a third full day, and authorities issued warnings about the coming storm to those who have remained behind. The storm could bring wind gusts of up to 75 mph (121 kph), lightning and heavy rain that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, the Baker County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also cautioned residents about the risk posed by the storm and the expected \"abundant\" lightning. The agency has mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities that could be threatened by wildfires nearby.\n\nThe major electricity utility in the region, Idaho Power, warned customers to prepare for possible outages.\n\n\"Power outages and freeway closures are expected. In the event that the fire reaches the City of Huntington, there may be delays in assisting residents that have not previously evacuated,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\nIn this image provided by the Oregon Department of Transportation, the Durkee fire burns in the background as it nears Interstate 84 near Huntington, Ore., early Tuesday, July 23, 2024. (Oregon Department of Transportation via AP)\n\nMore than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.\n\nAlready, the smoke from the Durkee Fire in Oregon was choking the air in Boise and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it\u00b4s so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman\u00b4s shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nMike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise, said cooler air moving into the region Wednesday evening could stoke the Oregon fire. A red flag warning was in effect and the area has been suffering through a heat wave, including many days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).\n\n\"With these winds showing up today, every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don\u00b4t light anything on fire and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nIn this image provided by the Oregon Department of Transportation, the Durkee fire burns in the background as it nears Interstate 84 near Huntington, Ore., early Sunday, July 21, 2024.

(AP) -- A California man was accused Thursday of starting the state's largest wildlife of the year by pushing a burning car into a gully.\n\nCalifornia authorities on Thursday arrested the man, whom they did not immediately name publicly. Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Cal Fire arson investigators made the arrest early Thursday.\n\nFlames from the fire the suspect is accused of starting exploded into what is now the Park Fire, which has scorched more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) near the city of Chico. Evacuations were ordered in Butte and Tehama counties, with the blaze only 3% contained early Thursday.\n\nAs evacuations continued in California, some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the biggest active blaze in the United States. Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nOfficials remain concerned that lightning from the storm -- which brought wind gusts of up to 75 mph -- could spark new blazes. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nThe lightning strikes along the Oregon-Idaho border started 15 new fires overnight in Idaho, the U.S. Forest Service told Boise's KBOI-TV, but several had already been extinguished. Overall, nearly 1 million acres (1,562 square miles) had burned so far this summer in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon alone has 34 large fires, almost all of them in the eastern part of the state far from\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time done a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nThe storms are bringing cooler air, but the wind could stoke more fires, warned Mike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise.\n\n\"Every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nThe Durkee Fire was burning near the Oregon-Idaho state line, shutting down a stretch of Interstate 84 and leaving ranchers in the largely rural area fighting to save their cattle and grasslands their herds rely upon for food.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire, which burned more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) near Chico. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nMore than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, state officials said. Hurricane-force winds carried strong thunderstorms into western Montana, toppling trees, downing power lines and damaging gas lines in the Missoula area. A fire warning was in effect in central Montana due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front said temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius).\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\nAssociated Press

The DA says his name will be released later Thursday.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nBOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Rapidly growing wildfires prompted evacuations in Northern and Southern California on Thursday, while some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the largest active blaze in the United States. Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nOfficials remain concerned that lightning from the storm -- which brought wind gusts of up to 75 mph -- could spark new blazes. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time done a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nThe storms are bringing cooler air, but the wind could stoke more fires, warned Mike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise.\n\n\"Every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nThe Durkee Fire was burning near the Oregon-Idaho state line, shutting down a stretch of Interstate 84 and leaving ranchers in the largely rural area fighting to save their cattle and grasslands their herds rely upon for food.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire, which burned more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) near Chico. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nMore than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, state officials said. Hurricane-force winds carried strong thunderstorms into western Montana, toppling trees, downing power lines and damaging gas lines in the Missoula area. A fire warning was in effect in central Montana due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front said temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius).\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\n___\n\nAssociated

In eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire, the nation's biggest, and another nearby blaze.\n\nA California man under arrest Thursday was accused of starting the state's largest wildlife of the year by pushing a burning car into a gully as other fires scorched the Pacific Northwest.\n\nFlames from the fire the suspect is accused of starting exploded into what is now the Park Fire, which has burned more than 110 square miles (289 square kilometers) near the city of Chico. Evacuations were ordered in Butte and Tehama counties, with the blaze only 3% contained by midday Thursday.\n\nCalifornia authorities did not immediately name the man they arrested.\n\nAs evacuations continued in California, some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the biggest active blaze in the United States. More than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, and another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nLightning strikes along the Oregon-Idaho border started 15 new fires overnight in Idaho, the U.S. Forest Service told Boise's KBOI-TV, but several had already been extinguished by Thursday afternoon. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nOverall, nearly 1,562 square miles (4,045 square kilometers) have burned so far this summer in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon alone has 34 large fires, almost all of them in the eastern part of the state.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time instituted a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a Thursday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was heading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.4 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) overnight and was 10% contained by Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn Montana, a fire warning was in effect in the central part of the state due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front meant temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). After hurricane-force winds toppled trees, downed power lines and damaged gas lines in the Missoula area, authorities urged people to stay out of rivers because they might be electrified.\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' Jasper National Park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the park's namesake town, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nButte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey says Cal Fire arson investigators made the arrest early Thursday after a man was seen pushing a burning car into a gully Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe flames exploded into what is now the Park Fire, which has scorched more than 70 square miles near the city of Chico.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAuthorities later identified the man and a warrant was issued. The DA says his name will be released later Thursday.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nBOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Rapidly growing wildfires prompted evacuations in Northern and Southern California on Thursday, while some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the largest active blaze in the United States. Another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nEvacuations were ordered in California's Butte and Tehama counties as crews battled a fire reported near Chico just before 3 p.m. Wednesday. The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, quickly spread from about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) to more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) and was only 3% contained early Thursday, according to CAL FIRE. The cause was under investigation.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nOfficials remain concerned that lightning from the storm -- which brought wind gusts of up to 75 mph -- could spark new blazes. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time done a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nThe storms are bringing cooler air, but the wind could stoke more fires, warned Mike Cantin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boise.\n\n\"Every little spark could get out of hand very easily. It could be a really hazardous situation very fast,\" Cantin said. \"Don't light anything on fire, and be very careful around grass.\"\n\nThe Durkee Fire was burning near the Oregon-Idaho state line, shutting down a stretch of Interstate 84 and leaving ranchers in the largely rural area fighting to save their cattle and grasslands their herds rely upon for food.\n\nThe fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSince their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said. On Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\n\n\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\n\n\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"Everybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire, which burned more than 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) near Chico. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a late Wednesday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles (3.4 square kilometers) within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nMore than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, state officials said. Hurricane-force winds carried strong thunderstorms into western Montana, toppling trees, downing power lines and damaging gas lines in the Missoula area. A fire warning was in effect in central Montana due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front said temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius).\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\n___\n\nAssociated

Storms Wednesday night brought nearly 3,000 lightning strikes across the region, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAmid rapidly forming storms Wednesday afternoon, the blaze has crossed the interstate near Huntington, home to about 500 people.\n\nIt also merged with the Cow Valley Fire, another large blaze that had been burning nearby, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said in a news release Wednesday evening, calling it a dynamic situation. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.\"\n\nKotek said she had deployed the National Guard to the region. The Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also mobilized nearly 500 firefighters to help protect communities at risk.\n\nThe blaze had firest prompted the Level 3 evacuations in Huntington on Sunday, and on Wednesday city officials had posted on Facebook that people remaining in town, especially those with \"major health issues,\" needed to leave their homes because of wildfire smoke and the lack of power.\n\nCity officials also said Wednesday that gas service to residents had been shut off until the evacuation orders were lifted.The fire approached Alison Oszman's home in Rye Valley, a small ranching area north of Huntington, last week, but they were able to protect their property with the help of Bureau of Land Management firefighters and neighbors, using small tanker trucks and shovels. They used a small bulldozer to keep it away from the house, she said.Since their property was already burned and safe, her neighbor moved his horses and cattle over as the fire moved toward his ranch, she said.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Oszman went to check his property and found that the fire had come down a steep hillside and threatened his home.\"I went and parked our truck out in the field just in case those big trees by his house caught fire,\" she said. \"I was making sure sparks didn't land in the dirt or the dry grass. But as the fire passed his house, it started raining.\" The rain helped the firefighters get on top of the blaze.\"It was pretty scary but everything seemed to fall into place,\" she said. \"\n\nEverybody helped everybody. It was actually pretty amazing for how crummy it really was.\"More than 60 significant fires are burning in Oregon and Washington alone, and Oregon has been plagued with hundreds of lightning strikes from thunderstorms in recent days that have started new blazes in bone-dry vegetation.", "source": {"uri": "opb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "opb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Kotek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tina Kotek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington,_West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Huntington, West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Huntington, West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Oregon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Oregon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_County,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baker County, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baker County, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shovel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shovel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Land_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Land Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tank truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegetation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldozer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bulldozer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/7CMRUBXPPVGYRN3SETOIAUYVZA.jpg?auth=01de786f49cfa270db5c576c00f925b819acb55c28ea3641e123bb37e8346d4d&width=1200&height=675&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761049", "eventUri": "eng-9761049", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Fire officials say the Grove Fire was spreading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.3 square miles within a few hours but was 5% contained just before 8 p.m., Cal Fire said on the social media platform X.\n\nMore than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, state officials said. Hurricane-force winds carried strong thunderstorms into western Montana, toppling trees, downing power lines and damaging gas lines in the Missoula area. A fire warning was in effect in central Montana due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front said temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' largest national park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the town of Jasper, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nPatrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, near the Oregon border, said driving into town Wednesday morning was \"like driving into a fog bank, because it's so thick and low to the road.\"\n\nNauman's shop is on the main intersection in town and is typically a popular spot to stop for lunch or a sugar fix, but customer traffic has dropped by half in the past few days as thick smoke and triple-digit temperatures dogged the region.\n\n\"Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,\" Nauman said of the smoke.\n\n___", "source":

Evacuations were ordered in Butte and Tehama counties, with the blaze only 3% contained by midday Thursday.\n\nCalifornia authorities did not immediately name the man they arrested.\n\nAs evacuations continued in California, some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the biggest active blaze in the United States. More than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, and another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nIn eastern Oregon, evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, after a severe thunderstorm late Wednesday brought some rain and cooler temperatures to the nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) burned by the Durkee Fire - the nation's biggest - and another nearby blaze. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nLightning strikes along the Oregon-Idaho border started 15 new fires overnight in Idaho, the U.S. Forest Service told Boise's KBOI-TV, but several had already been extinguished by Thursday afternoon. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nOverall, nearly 1,562 square miles (4,045 square kilometers) have burned so far this summer in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon alone has 34 large fires, almost all of them in the eastern part of the state.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time instituted a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a Thursday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was heading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.4 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) overnight and was 10% contained by Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn Montana, a fire warning was in effect in the central part of the state due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front meant temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). After hurricane-force winds toppled trees, downed power lines and damaged gas lines in the Missoula area, authorities urged people to stay out of rivers because they might be electrified.\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' Jasper National Park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the park's namesake town, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa

The freeway briefly reopened Wednesday, but then closed again as officials warned of frequent disruptions because of the nearly 400-square-mile (1036-square-kilometer) blaze.\n\nThe town of Huntington, Oregon, home to about 500 people, remained evacuated for a third full day, and authorities issued warnings about the coming storm to those who have remained behind. The storm could bring wind gusts of up to 75 mph (121 kph), lightning and heavy rain that could cause flash flooding and debris flows in recently burned areas, the Baker County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.\n\nThe Oregon State Fire Marshal's office also cautioned residents about the risk posed by the storm and the expected \"abundant\" lightning.

Meanwhile other blazes scorched the Pacific Northwest.\n\nFlames from the fire the man is accused of starting exploded into what is now the Park Fire, which has burned more than 110 square miles (289 square kilometers) near the city of Chico. Evacuations were ordered in Butte and Tehama counties, with the blaze only 3% contained by midday Thursday.\n\nCalifornia authorities did not immediately name the man they arrested.\n\nAs evacuations continued in California, some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the biggest active blaze in the United States. More than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, and another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nLightning strikes along the Oregon-Idaho border started 15 new fires overnight in Idaho, the U.S. Forest Service told Boise's KBOI-TV, but several had already been extinguished by Thursday afternoon. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nOverall, nearly 1,562 square miles (4,045 square kilometers) have burned so far this summer in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon alone has 34 large fires, almost all of them in the eastern part of the state.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time instituted a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a Thursday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was heading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.4 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) overnight and was 10% contained by Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn Montana, a fire warning was in effect in the central part of the state due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front meant temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). After hurricane-force winds toppled trees, downed power lines and damaged gas lines in the Missoula area, authorities urged people to stay out of rivers because they might be electrified.\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' Jasper National Park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the park's namesake town, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Baumann in Bellingham, Washington; Martha Bellisle in Seattle; Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon; and Amy Hanson in Helena, Montana, contributed to this report.\n\nR\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Fire personnel are prioritizing evacuations and protecting structures while bulldozers create containment lines, reported AP.\n\nAccording to the CAL FIRE/Butte County fire department's Thursday update, no deaths or structural damages have been reported so far.\n\nMeanwhile, in Oregon, residents of Huntington were allowed to return home following a thunderstorm that provided much-needed rain but also posed a risk of new fires with its lightning. The Durkee Fire, the largest active blaze in the US, has burned close to 630 square miles. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash described the rain as a \"godsend,\" though he reminded residents to stay prepared for sudden evacuation orders.\n\nLightning strikes along the Oregon-Idaho border started 15 new fires overnight in Idaho, according to the US Forest Service.

Evacuations were ordered in Butte and Tehama counties, with the blaze only 3% contained by midday Thursday.\n\nCalifornia authorities did not immediately name the man they arrested.\n\nAs evacuations continued in California, some Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the biggest active blaze in the United States. More than two dozen new fires started in Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, and another fast-moving wildfire forced thousands to abandon a town in Canada.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nLightning strikes along the Oregon-Idaho border started 15 new fires overnight in Idaho, the U.S. Forest Service told Boise's KBOI-TV, but several had already been extinguished by Thursday afternoon. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.\n\nOverall, nearly 1,562 square miles (4,045 square kilometers) have burned so far this summer in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon alone has 34 large fires, almost all of them in the eastern part of the state.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires sparked by lightning across the Pacific Northwest and western Canada as the region endures recording-breaking heat, with many triple-digit days and bone-dry conditions. Idaho Power has for the first time instituted a pre-emptive power outage, shutting off electricity to thousands of customers to prevent new fire starts and other power grid issues from wires downed by the high winds, the utility said.\n\nIn northern California, fire personnel were focusing on evacuations and defending structures while using bulldozers to build containment lines ahead of the Park Fire. No deaths or damage to structures had been reported, CAL FIRE/ Butte County Fire Department said in a Thursday update.\n\nA fire in southern California was much smaller, but moving fast and threatening homes.\n\nEvacuation orders were in effect Wednesday night in San Diego County after a wildfire began to spread fast near the San Diego and Riverside county line. Fire officials say the Grove Fire was heading southeast through steep and challenging terrain. The fire grew to 1.4 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) overnight and was 10% contained by Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn Montana, a fire warning was in effect in the central part of the state due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. An extreme heat warning east of the storm front meant temperatures could soar up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). After hurricane-force winds toppled trees, downed power lines and damaged gas lines in the Missoula area, authorities urged people to stay out of rivers because they might be electrified.\n\nIn the Canadian Rockies' Jasper National Park, a fast-moving wildfire this week hit the park's namesake town, forcing thousands to flee and causing significant damage in the World Heritage Site. That blaze, as well as those in the western United States, have forced some areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories as skies filled with smoke and haze.\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Baumann in Bellingham, Washington; Martha Bellisle in Seattle; Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon; and Amy Hanson in Helena, Montana, contributed to this report.\n\nR\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

A postcard-perfect mountain town, Jasper is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking, and biking. It is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears, and grizzly bears.\n\n\"We share the sense of loss with all who live in town,\" Smith said at a news conference in Edmonton, Alberta, while pledging her government's support for the community to rebuild.\n\nJasper and the neighboring Jasper National Park had been menaced by fires from both the north and south, and the town's 5,000 full-time residents -- along with 20,000 visitors -- fled on short notice late Monday and Tuesday when the fires flared up.\n\nOne of the fires raced into the southern edge of the community Wednesday evening as firefighters tried to limit the damage.\n\nAlberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis said a wind gust moved the wildfire about about 3 miles in probably less than 30 minutes toward the town with a wall of fire that he estimated was 100 meters high.\n\n\"People need to picture what those wildfire folks were experiencing at that time. Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when a wall of fire like that is coming at you,\" Ellis said. \"Nobody anticipated the fire to come so fast, so large.\"\n\n\"It's just a monster at that point,\" said Pierre Martel, director of fire management at Parks Canada. \"There are no tools we have in our tool box to deal with that at that point. You get out of the way.\"\n\nPark officials said efforts to fight the fire were continuing and that it was too early to give details of the damage. They asked for patience, and said the fire remains out of control despite a small amount of rain that fell overnight.\n\nAnnelies Lagger, who has owned and lived in the Austrian Haven B&B for 30 years, said she's waiting to hear if it's been destroyed but isn't optimistic because all the houses nearby are gone. She said she fled with her 13 cats and dog.\n\n\"I have no clue where I go now. Heaven or hell. It was my life. You can imagine how much work it was,\" she said. \"I think I'm in shock.\"\n\nAlberta has been baking under scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people out of remote communities. About 176 wildfires were burning across the province, including 54 that are burning out of control.\n\nFires were also menacing Northern California and Oregon.\n\nA burning car pushed into a gully sparked California's largest wildfire of the year, authorities said Thursday as they announced the arrest of a suspect.\n\nFlames from the fire the man is accused of starting exploded into what is now the Park Fire, which has burned more than 110 square miles near the city of Chico. Evacuations were ordered in Butte and Tehama counties, with the blaze only 3 percent contained by midday Thursday.\n\nCalifornia authorities did not immediately name the man they arrested.\n\nAs evacuations continued in California, some eastern Oregon residents were cleared to return home after a thunderstorm dropped welcome rain but also potentially dangerous lightning on the biggest active blaze in the United States.\n\nThe evacuation orders were lifted Thursday for the city of Huntington, population 500, which was threatened by The Durkee Fire, the nation's biggest. That blaze has burned nearly 630 square miles. Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash called the rain a \"godsend,\" but residents were warned to be ready to go again at a moment's notice.\n\nLightning strikes along the Oregon-Idaho border started 15 new fires overnight in Idaho, the US Forest Service told Boise's KBOI-TV, but several had already been extinguished by Thursday afternoon. More than 2,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes were detected across southeast Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday alone, the National Weather Service in Boise said Thursday.", "source": {"uri":

{"id": 231316362, "title": "Talent doesn\u2019t have a class, it doesn\u2019t have a race or an agenda. The fire these dancers have is from somewhere deeper", "text": "In a dance studio somewhere in the city centre, a pole dancer, a singer and a burlesque performer are all practising their routines in the same room together. Rather than the potential set-up for a low-effort joke, it\u2019s all part of the early stages of what could be one of the most riveting shows to come to Manchester in years. For three nights this month (June 20-22), the House of MCR show will, quite literally, take over Aviva Studios, the home of Factory International, with an explosion of dance, music, vogue, performance and everything else you could possibly imagine. Curated by Ghetto Fabulous pioneer Darren Pritchard with the assistance of actor and playwright Rikki Beadle-Blair, the show has been described as something that\u2019s been a long time coming - and it\u2019s the biggest project that Darren says he has ever worked on.

It's a fully realised vision of all of that in the best possible way.\" With more than 20 years of experience, it's clear Darren knows how to put on a show. Having helped vogue outfit the House of Ghetto evolve into the Ghetto Fabulous collective, who can now be regularly seen on stage dancing with artists including Fatboy Slim and The Blessed Madonna, he has also contributed to the likes of Black Pride MCR at Manchester Pride and hosted catwalk extravaganza events on a national scale. But, despite all of that, Darren, who grew up in a council flat in Hulme, says he still can\u2019t quite believe the level of attention that the House of MCR show has been receiving. Chances are that you will have already seen a billboard poster at your nearby tram stop or outside your favourite bar, whilst a trailer with high-scale production values also recently debuted to a positive response. It\u2019s a world institution, isn\u2019t it?,\u201d Darren says of Aviva Studios. \u201cMaxine Peake has just been there, so has David Hoyle, and we\u2019re on the week before ANOHNI and the Johnsons. To be in the same mix as those legends is just unreal to me.\u201d At its heart, Darren explains that the House of MCR show will be a culmination of all of the projects he\u2019s worked on and the experience he\u2019s learnt from that. Featuring 27 artists, ranging from a broad spectrum of performance, it is also likely to be the biggest celebration of Queer, Trans, and Intersex Black People and People of Colour (QTIBPoC) talent in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s a seminal and historical moment, for sure,\u201d Darren explains. \u201cAs people of colour, we are always a minority but this show is unapologetic. It\u2019s a massive show that gives us that space and kudos. Manchester just feels like the right place for something like this. I don\u2019t give a damn, I do not think that this show could have happened anywhere else - just because of that Manchester spirit.\u201d And Darren is also keen to highlight that the show is not just about Manchester artists - it\u2019s about artists who have found themselves in the city through different journeys and experiences. \u201cI\u2019ve specially curated the cast with who I think are the best of the best,\u201d Darren explains. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s all subjective but the talent level is exceptional. Every performer has made it through circumstances that just didn\u2019t want them to be able to be who they are. \u201cBut not all of the artists are from Manchester. Some have found their home and a safe space here - there are a few who have come from quite difficult places. I know every single person\u2019s back story and to be celebrated in this show and on that stage is just going to be a phenomenal moment for every single person. \u201cWhen I first started, I was struggling to find performers, but there\u2019s been a massive explosion of Black, Asian and Trans talent. Now, it\u2019s like I lift a rock and there\u2019s a new QTIBPoC artist emerging.\u201d Some of the artists taking place, in addition to Darren and Ricky, include Jalebi Bebe, Joshua Adedoyin, Tolu Ajayi, Saki Yew, Bola Olagunju and Lucky Roy Singh. There will also be a band, and a string quartet from the Untold Orchestra, to add to proceedings too. \u201cSome of the dancers are coming off big, big shows whilst others have never ever had a chance like this before,\u201d Darren explains. \u201cWhat makes a show like this so special is that you will never really tell who has years of training. \u201cTalent doesn\u2019t have a class, it doesn\u2019t have a race or an agenda. The dancers and the fire they have is from somewhere deeper than within themselves, it\u2019s a release.\u201d The cabaret show will be divided into different sections - all offering different takes on runway performance: 'We dress, we sing, we dance, we strip, we lip sync and we are family'. And the winner of each category will be chosen by the audience. There will also be outfits created by award-winning designer Gavin Douglas with the support of students from the Fashion Institute at Manchester Metropolitan University. Getting to the point where a show like this can take place, Darren says it has all come through hard work and graft. \u201cGhetto Fabulous has pretty much danced with every big DJ in the world,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut that started because I didn\u2019t want to be the only one and I wanted to have people who looked and sounded like me, a queer black man, on the stage. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard industry and navigating it as queer black people is really tough. We have had a lot of members come out as non-binary and discover their gender fluidity through Ghetto Fabulous. The people who walked in on the first day are not who they are today - they found themselves through this. I always say we are the biggest dysfunctional family ever, I will cuss any of them but let anyone come for them and we\u2019re all like vipers. \u201cWe have also had artists, like The Bollywitch, tell us that the work we\u2019ve done through Ghetto Fabulous and Black Pride MCR has inspired them. The House of Spice, who now do the Queer Asian Takeover, started life at Black Pride MCR. It\u2019s only through all of the groundwork that we\u2019ve done to establish ourselves and fight for what we\u2019re worth that we are able to be in this position now. And we get paid for what we do. \u201cI am pure executive realness; we get some of the best gigs but it\u2019s about getting paid for what we do. And, in actual fact, it\u2019s not just about being in queer spaces. Our allies have kept more food and water in our dancers mouths than queer spaces have just because of the way things are. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got some standing and support, I\u2019m in a position to fight for what we do. Our name is no longer in Times New Roman size ten on the poster, you best be scaling that up to at least a 36 now.\u201d House of MCR takes place at AVIVA Studios from June 22 to 24.

Ulla\u2019s return to Ireland coincides with 15 years of VISUAL in Carlow with the contemporary arts centre celebrating its birthday later this year. German-born von Brandenburg, whose early career in stage design and theatre deeply influences her art, invites visitors into her world through the enchanting use of curtains and drapery. Her work creates immersive environments that blur the boundaries between the audience and the artwork. This exhibition, on display in VISUAL\u2019s Main Gallery from June to late August 2024, officially opens on Thursday, June 6. Benjamin Stafford, Visual Arts Curator at VISUAL said: \"Bringing Ulla von Brandenburg to Irish audiences is a privilege for VISUAL, especially as we celebrate 15 years of being Ireland\u2019s largest contemporary art space. Her return to Ireland after 15 years is a milestone we would like to mark.\u201d Von Brandenburg\u2019s distinguished career includes exhibitions at prestigious venues such as the Weserburg Museum f\u00fcr moderne Kunst in Bremen, the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, Whitechapel Gallery in London, Kunstmuseum Bonn, the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami, and the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis. Her upcoming exhibition at VISUAL will feature an immersive installation of large-scale textiles, sculpture and film, including the European premiere of her latest film, Un bal sous l\u2019eau (2023), co-commissioned by VISUAL. In addition to these installations, VISUAL will present a series of unique commissioned performances by von Brandenburg, her collaborators, and a troupe of Irish dancers, actors, and performers. These performances will be showcased during the Carlow Arts Festival from June 6 to June 8. Puppet making, performance and storytelling will form part of the learning programme running alongside the exhibition. \u201cIt\u2019s natural when adults and children come into VISUAL, they want to touch and feel what they see. We have created a space upstairs that allows them to get hands-on in a way that is not always possible in an exhibition space,\u201d explained Learning Curator at VISUAL Clare Breen. Clare Breen has developed a summer programme of workshops, summer camps and school tours. There will also be a sustainability summer school for adults this August 16-18. A shadow puppet theatre has been handcrafted by the VISUAL team and is located upstairs in the gallery. \u201cThe space is free for people to perform their own shadow puppet show with space for an audience. Learning through play is at the core of our learning programme and everyone is welcome.\u201d Alongside von Brandenburg\u2019s exhibition, VISUAL will host Artworks, an annual open-call exhibition presented in collaboration with the Carlow Arts Festival. This eagerly awaited event features a diverse array of local, national, and international artists. Five emerging artists will be awarded prizes of \u20ac1000 each, with winners announced during the launch on June 6th. Ulla von Brandenburg will be among the judges. \"We are delighted by the high standard of entries this year and the event promises to generate significant interest and offers a unique opportunity for artists to exhibit alongside Ulla von Brandenburg,\" said Ben Stafford. Artworks has attracted talents such as Irish artist and former fashion designer Richard Malone and Polish artist Olga Anacka, based in Ireland. Carlow-based artist Tobi Balogun will also be featured. Balogun, who works across dance, theatre, fashion, and design, embodies the vibrant and innovative spirit of the local arts community.", "summary": "<table><tr><td><img src=\"https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/resizer/300/200/true/2024_06_01/29_HQ4A3105-1717251895134.JPG--international_artist_ulla_von_brandenburg_to_present_solo_exhibition_at_visual___kilkenny_live.JPG?1717251897566\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" />VISUAL Carlow will be transformed by the captivating work of renowned artist Ulla von Brandenburg in her first solo exhibition in Ireland in 15 years.

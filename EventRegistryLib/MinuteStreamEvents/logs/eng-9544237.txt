Ballard's 1962 short story of the same name.\n\nAfter the fact, numerous famous faces attended the Apr\u00e8s Met 2 Met Gala Afterparty at WSA in New York City.\n\nTwo of the attendees were Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny. And they weren't simply attending the afterparty together. They mingled.\n\nAccording to Page Six, multiple sources spotted Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny staying close to each other during the Met Gala afterparty.\n\n\"They were at the same table, laughing and flirting,\" one insider reported.\n\nThat same source detailed: \"She was rubbing his head.\"\n\nKendall and Bad Bunny's alleged PDA was reportedly pretty chaste\n\nA second inside source clarified that, to the best of anyone's knowledge, Kendall and Bad Bunny did not kiss during the event.\n\nHowever, the insider did describe the two as cuddling on couches at the party during the night.\n\nThis source even specified that they were drinking Clase Azul cocktails during their cuddle time.\n\nThe report also specifies that Kendall and Bad Bunny both changed out of their extremely stylish Met Gala looks for the party.\n\nMost attendees at the Met Gala wear expensive designer clothes, often in unique looks specifically to fit the year's prompt.\n\nWhile Kendall seemingly prioritized style and beauty over artistic risk-taking, Bad Bunny balanced the prompt with looks to delivery a stunning matador-inspired look. Which, for the record, is well in keeping with thematic elements of the The Garden of Time short story -- which is about nobility and the inevitability of death.\n\nAs we previously reported, Kendall and Bad Bunny seemingly ended things in December of 2023. At that point, they had been dating for less than one year.\n\nThough neither addressed the breakup directly with the public, reports described the breakup as amicable. The blame did not go to the supermodel or to the singer, but to their busy schedules.\n\nThere have been whispers of reconnections early this year.

Jenner appeared to lean in close to Bad Bunny, indicating that there was still a lingering attraction between them.\n\nSo, does this mean the exes are back together? So far, neither Bad Bunny nor Jenner has commented on the rumors. But many fans hope they'll stay in touch after getting cozy at the star-studded event.\n\nKendall Jenner and Bad Bunny seemed like the perfect match. So, why did the couple break up? A source told Entertainment Tonight that their romance \"fizzled out\" over time.\n\n\"Kendall and Bad Bunny have been doing their own things lately, and things slowly started to fizzle out between them,\" the source shared. \"They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn't be a forever type of relationship, and that was mutually understood from the get-go. They have crazy busy schedules and know they're still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down.\"\n\nJenner and Bad Bunny left their romance on good terms, leading fans to believe they'd get back together when ready. There \"isn't any negativity between them, and they still want the best for one another,\" the source added.\n\n\"Kendall's family still thinks highly of him,\" the insider said. \"They just want her to be with whoever makes her happy, treats her with love and respect, and someone that understands and can handle the attention that comes along with dating her with poise and grace.\"\n\nKendall Jenner has gotten back together with exes in the past. She and Devin Booker sparked dating rumors just two months after her split from Bad Bunny. In February 2023, sources reported that Jenner and Booker were spending time together and taking their relationship slow as they rekindled their romance.\n\nJenner and Booker were first linked on Valentine's Day 2021, and they reportedly broke up in 2022 due to their ultra-busy schedules. As of February 2024, a source shared with People that the couple was \"definitely slowly navigating a restart.\" It's unclear where they stand in May 2024.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_weiler@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Lauren Weiler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashian_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kardashian family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valentine's Day"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kendall-Jenner-Met-Gala-2024.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544237", "eventUri": "eng-9544237", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

They were introduced via mutual friends Justin and Hailey Bieber, and they started hanging out and enjoying each other's company, going together to fun events and activities like horseback riding and attending Coachella. (via People)\n\nThe two reportedly kept their relationship private for much of their time together. This was evident by how both Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner kept mum when asked about their relationship on separate occassions in June 2023, in interviews with Rolling Stone and WSJ Magazine.\n\nThe Puerto Rican musician even stressed his wishes to keep his relationship with Jenner private in a Vanity Fair piece published in mid-September.

The former couple was photographed seated next to each other, smiling and in deep conversation. It is the most revealing look at their post-breakup dynamic that has come out so far, as both stars are very private:\n\nBad Bunny and Kendall dated for almost a year before their December split; their relationship was first reported in February 2023. While news of their breakup came out before the holidays, they went on to spend New Year's Eve together with friends in Barbados.\n\nRegarding why the pair ultimately called it quits, a source told The Messenger on December 16, \"There's no bad blood. They are even still in contact. Their relationship had been rocky due to their busy schedules.\" Bad Bunny was planning a 2024 world tour and \"felt the relationship truly ran its course.\"\n\nA separate source explained to Entertainment Tonight a day later that \"Kendall and Bad Bunny have been doing their own things lately, and things slowly started to fizzle out between them.\"\n\n\"They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn't be a forever type of relationship and that was mutually understood from the get-go,\" the source added. \"They have crazy busy schedules and know they're still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down.

I know [people are] going to say something. People know everything about me, so what's left for me to protect? My private life, my personal life.\"\n\nWhen asked if he wanted to address any rumors about his relationship with Kendall, he reiterated his stance: \"That's the only answer. In the end, the only thing I have is my privacy.\"\n\nThat same month, Kendall explained to WSJ magazine why she has \"no comment\" on Bad Bunny or their relationship. \"I try [to] find the balance of keeping things private and keeping things sacred, [and] also not letting the unfortunate frustration and stress of everyone trying to get in on it stop me from enjoying my side,\" she said. \"Does that make sense?

His hat also included flowers to pair with the theme \"The Garden of Time,\" which coordinated with the benefit's \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" costume exhibition.\n\nAs a co-chair for this year's star-studded event, the \"MONACO\" rapper is working alongside Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth as they all support the event's biggest name: Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of Vogue.

They didn't officially go public, though, until that September when they appeared on Gucci's travel campaign photo shoot.\n\nJust weeks following their split, Kendall reportedly reconciled with Devin Booker, whom she's had an off-and-on relationship with since 2020.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elisabeth_mcgowan@hollywoodlife.com", "name": "Elisabeth McGowan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibraphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vibraphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gucci", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gucci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bad-bunny-featured.jpg?quality=100&w=620", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544237", "eventUri": "eng-9544237", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

His ex, Kendall Jenner, was also at the event, with the two spending some time together at the after-party, where they were photographed.\n\nBad Bunny was one of the first to walk the red carpet while Jenner was one of the last. They both made their impressions on the event, as they tend to do, with Bad Bunny wearing a Maison Margiela navy suit that had some red details. Jenner wore a never-been-worn Givenchy design that was a part of Alexander McQueen's fall-winter lineup of 1999.\n\nAfter walking the red carpet located on the otuside of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, Bad Bunny and Jenner entered the event separately. According to reports and videos that have been released, Ariana Grande was the show's main source of entertainment, where she performed some of her own songs and a duet with Cynthia Erivo, her \"Wicked\" co-star.\n\nVarious Met Gala after-parties were hosted in New York City. According to a report from Entertainment Tonight, Jenner and Bad Bunny attended a party called Apr\u00e8s Met 2 Met Gala After Party, presented by Carlos Nazario, Emily Ratajkowski, Francesco Russo, Paloma Elsesser, Raul Lopez and Renell Medra.

They reportedly split in December, but still celebrated New Year's together, per People. TODAY.com has not independently confirmed the report.\n\nHowever, they were recently spotted together, sparking rumors that they rekindled their romance.\n\nBoth stars attended the 2024 Met Gala on May 6. They did not attend or pose for photos together on the stairs but were photographed at an after-party.\n\nThe pair, with drinks in hand, were seated next to each other, smiling wide at the Apr\u00e8s Met 2 Met Gala after-party hosted by Carlos Nazario, Emily Ratajkowski, Francesco Risso, Paloma Elsesser, Raul Lopez and Renell Medra.\n\nThe two did not address their outing, but their photo did make headlines the following day.\n\nWhile they have been hush-hush about their time together, the Puerto Rican rapper appeared to sing about their relationship in the song \"Fina\" off his latest album.\n\n\"The whole world talks, but they're spectators,\" he said on the track, according to a TODAY.com translation. \"They wonder how we communicate, but better to not even tell them.\"\n\nWhat have they said? Here's a breakdown and timeline of everything we know so far about Bad Bunny and Jenner's rumored relationship.\n\nRumors started swirling that Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner were dating after they were reportedly spotted leaving a Los Angeles restaurant together.\n\nBad Bunny appeared on Eladio Carri\u00f3n's \"Coco Chanel\" song in March. His verse seemed to contain what appeared to be a dig at Jenner's ex-boyfriend Devin Booker, who plays for the Phoenix Suns.\n\nBad Bunny sings, \"Yo no soy malo, nah, beb\u00e9, eso e' un gimmick/ Pero el sol de PR calienta m\u00e1' que el de Phoenix/ Ella lo sabe,\" which translates to \"I'm not bad, baby that's a gimmick/ But the sun in Puerto Rico is hotter than in Phoenix/ She knows it,\" in English.\n\nIn the song, Bad Bunny also said, \"Las de escorpio son peligro,\" which translates to \"Scorpio women are dangerous.\" Born Nov. 3, 1995, Jenner's zodiac sign is Scorpio.\n\nBad Bunny performed a headlining set at Coachella in April. Jenner, who was in the audience, was seen dancing along to his music in the crowd.\n\nIn a video that a fan shared on TikTok, Jenner does a little twirl in the audience as the singer performed his hit song \"Despu\u00e9s de la Playa.\"\n\nFollowing Coachella, Bad Bunny and Jenner were then seen publicly hanging out multiple times.\n\nThey attended a Met Gala afterparty together in May in New York City, then headed to LA to watch the Lakers face off against the Golden State Warriors.\n\nWhile sitting courtside, Jenner and Bad Bunny were seen getting cozy. One picture taken during the evening shows Jenner whispering in Bad Bunny's ear as he laughs, and another pic shows Bad Bunny putting his arm around Jenner's chair.\n\nIn a June interview with Rolling Stone, Bad Bunny acknowledged the dating rumors.\n\n\"I know something is going to come out,\" he told the outlet. \"I know (people are) going to say something. People know everything about me, so what's left for me to protect? My private life, my personal life.\"\n\nWhen he was directly asked about his relationship status, Bad Bunny doubled down on his need for privacy.\n\n\"That's the only answer,\" he said. \"In the end, the only thing I have is my privacy.\"\n\nBad Bunny noted that he doesn't \"focus\" on fans paying too much attention to his personal life.\n\n\"Fans are always going to want to know more, but I don't focus on that,\" he said. \"I'm always going to keep living my way.\"\n\nBad Bunny and Jenner were seen attending a Drake concert together in Inglewood, California, according to E! News.\n\nA video shared by a fan on X shows the two celebs getting close to one another in the crowd. At one point in the clip, the two hold each other close.\n\nBad Bunny spoke about his love life again during an interview with Vanity Fair. He said he doesn't feel the need to \"clarify anything\" to the public.\n\n\"They don't know how you feel, they don't know how you live, they don't know anything, and I really don't want them to know. I'm not really interested in clarifying anything because I have no commitment to clarify anything to anyone,\" Bad Bunny said.\n\n\"There are people who say that artists have to put up with it. I don't have to accept anything and everything because I wanted to be an artist. At the end of the day, you listen to me because you want to. I don't force you to.\"\n\nJenner and Bad Bunny appeared in an ad for the new Gucci Valigeria campaign in September.\n\nThe campaign released multiple photographs, including one of them strolling through an airport carrying luggage and another of Bad Bunny hugging Jenner, smiles on their faces.\n\nPeople were enthusiastic in the comments, with one writing, \"They are so hot together. power couple.\"\n\nAnother said, \"It makes me so happy to see a couple so in love like them creating a wholesome environment,\" with flower and heart emoji.\n\nA third added, \"I LOVE THISSSSSSS!!!! GOALS to look like this arriving to the airport for a long vacation,\" with several heart face emoji.\n\nOn Oct. 13, photographer Jomo Davila shared a picture of Bad Bunny wearing a white T-shirt that said \"818 Outpost\" on it.\n\nEagle-eyed fans quickly noticed the singer was seemingly paying tribute to Jenner's 818 tequila brand.\n\n\"Bad bunny wearing 818 \ud83d\ude2e,\" one person commented.\n\nTo promote his \"SNL\" hosting gig, Bad Bunny released a short promo video with \"SNL\" cast member Heidi Gardner. He appeared to reference a moment he had with Jenner on Instagram back in August 2023.\n\nBad Bunny had previously shared a video of him telling Jenner to watch out for mosquitos. He warned Garner about mosquitos in the \"SNL\" video, an apparent nod to the moment with Jenner, and fans quickly noticed.\n\n\"Someone give the writers a raise,\" one person commented. \"Not the mosquitoes,\" another wrote.\n\nPeople reported on Dec. 17 that an inside source said the couple split. Representatives for each party did not respond to People's requests for comment. TODAY.com has not independently confirmed the reporting.\n\nPeople reported on Jan. 4 that an inside source said they rang in 2024 together in Barbados with a group of friends that included Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin Bieber. The source added that the duo are not back together. TODAY.com has not independently confirmed this reporting.\n\nJenner posted on Instagram on Jan. 3, \"Presence and time is all i can ask for.\"\n\n\"So grateful for what has past, so optimistic for what's to come. go love on the people you hold close to your heart, and don't waste a second,\" she wrote. \"2024, shower me with love and laughter, gratitude and growth, patience and presence.\"\n\nAfter months of reports that the two had gone their separate ways, the two cozied up at the Apr\u00e8s Met 2 Met Gala after-party on May 6 in New York.\n\nAfter attending the Met Gala separately, the pair was photographed together. With drinks in their hand and sitting very close to one another, fans began to wonder if they had rekindled their rumored romance.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachella_(festival)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coachella (festival)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paloma_Elsesser", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paloma Elsesser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Chanel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Chanel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Ratajkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emily Ratajkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E!

So in honour of this very chic rendezvous, we're taking a look back at their entire relationship history, from February 2023 to now.\n\nWe didn't have this on our 2024 Bingo cards, but apparently Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny have rekindled their romance.\n\nWho is Bad Bunny?\n\nBad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, is a 28-year-old rapper and singer, who also recently appeared alongside Brad Pitt in the action comedy Bullet Train, as skilled assassin \"The Wolf.\"\n\nAnd while Bunny is yet to go public with a romantic relationship, you might recognise him from that photo with Taylor Swift at the Grammys.\n\nThen, in a clip that (unsurprisingly) sent TikTok and Twitter into meltdown, DeuxMoi herself confirmed that the model in question was none other than Jenner. The mysterious social media sensation said on her podcast, DeuxU: \"So I'm revealing it was Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny, I have witnesses on the scene who saw her in the club.\"\n\nFebruary 18, 2023\n\nJenner and Bunny are spotted again, this time leaving restaurant Wally's in Beverly Hills, and adding fuel to the rumours that the pair are an item.\n\nJenner cut a low-key figure in brown leather pants and a distressed leather jacket, as she was seen exiting the venue solo, with her rumoured flame walking out not long after from the back entrance.\n\nBut the plot thickens, with Jenner's bestie and Rhode Beauty founder Hailey Bieber also spotted with husband Justin Bieber at the same restaurant. The couple were sighted leaving almost an hour earlier, hinting at a potential double date.\n\nFebruary 20, 2023\n\nJust a few days later, a source gave People the inside scoop, saying the model and Bunny \"are spending time together.\"\n\nAnother source seemed to confirm this info, adding \"They were introduced by friends. He moved to L.A. a few weeks ago and bought a house.\"\n\nThe source also hinted at Jenner's recent ex, Devin Booker, saying Bunny is \"different from guys that she dated in the past. He is very charming.\"\n\nMarch 9, 2023\n\nIf this isn't proof of a burgeoning relationship, we don't know what is.\n\nIn photos published by TMZ, Jenner and Bunny were seen kissing in a car park. According to the outlet, the kiss came after dinner with friends, including Kylie Jenner, at a sushi restaurant in West Hollywood.\n\nMarch 13, 2023\n\nJenner and Bunny were spotted leaving together from arguably the coolest party to score an invite to.\n\nAccording to reports, Jenner and Bunny were both in attendance at Beyonce\u0301 and Jay-Z's Oscars after-party at the Chateau Marmont. In pictures obtained by the Daily Mail, the pair can be seen leaving the party at about 4am, with Kendall shielding her face from cameras as they enter the back seat of a car.\n\nAnd while they could just be splitting the cost of a ride home, we expect there's a little more to this story than meets the eye.\n\nApril 15, 2023\n\nKendall Jenner was spotted showing her support for Bad Bunny in the crowd at his Coachella set over the weekend.\n\nIn a video posted to TikTok, Kendall can be seen dancing in the audience, at one point even doing a little spin. As a Coachella-regular, she cut a low-key figure for the occasion, opting for an oversized bomber jacket and denim shorts for the first weekend of this year's festival.\n\nAnd while we're still yet to hear from Bunny or Jenner with confirmation of their rumoured romance, we think this adorable video speaks volumes.\n\n2 May, 03\n\nThey might've opted to walk the Met steps alone, but shortly after, Kendall and Bad Bunny were spotted en route to a Met Gala after party... together.\n\nThe pair stepped out of New York's Rtiz Carlton Hotel in quick succession, before jumping into a black car.\n\nJenner traded her Met Gala look for an equally glam after party situation, in a vintage 1994 Chanel look. Her rumoured beau also swapped his backless Jacquemus tux for a casual brown bomber and dark pants.\n\nWe'd love to be a fly on the wall at the after party, but for now, we'll settle for admiring the pictures.\n\nDecember 2023\n\nAfter nearly a year of dating, a source told PEOPLE that it was officially the end for the genetically blessed couple. While this particular source remained tight-lipped on the details, another insider spilled to Entertainment Tonight that \"Kendall and Bad Bunny have been doing their own things lately, and things slowly started to fizzle out between them.\"\n\n\"They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn't be a forever type of relationship, and that was mutually understood from the get-go,\" the source continued. \"They have crazy-busy schedules and know they're still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down.\"", "source": {"uri": "elle.com.au", "dataType":

In December 2023, a source informed that the couple had broken up after less than a year of being together. Their relationship began with a double date alongside Jenner's close friends Hailey and Justin Bieber in February 2023.\n\nDuring their time together, Jenner showed her support for the Puerto Rican artist during his headline performance at Coachella, and the couple enjoyed a romantic getaway to Idaho.This connection blossomed after Jenner ended her two-year relationship with NBA player Devin Booker in November 2022. On the other hand, Bad Bunny was previously associated with Gabriela Berlingeri. From enjoying horseback riding dates to parting ways, here's the scoop on Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny's romance.\n\nThe supermodel and singer were seen leaving a restaurant in Los Angeles together in late February following a possible double date with the Biebers. Jenner rocked a laid-back style with leather pants, black boots, and an oversized grey jacket, while Bad Bunny opted for cream pants, a brown jacket, and a khaki hat. Jenner showed her support for her rumored beau as Bad Bunny headlined Coachella. The 818 Tequila founder was spotted dancing to Bad Bunny's tunes, notably his hit track \"Despu\u00e9s de la Playa,\" which was the final song of his set that night.\n\nLater, Jenner and Bad Bunny were spotted heading to dine at Carbone in New York City. The model looked chic in a sheer brown top and a leather miniskirt, while the rapper sported a black T-shirt under a black and yellow jacket. The following day, a source shared with PEOPLE that Jenner and Bad Bunny's relationship was \"becoming more serious.\"\n\nAbout six months after their split, Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny were captured in a photo at the Apr\u00e8s Met 2 Met Gala afterparty.

They are even still in contact. Their relationship had been rocky due to their busy schedules.\" Bad Bunny was planning a 2024 world tour and \"felt the relationship truly ran its course.\"\n\nA separate source explained to Entertainment Tonight a day later that \"Kendall and Bad Bunny have been doing their own things lately, and things slowly started to fizzle out between them.\"\n\n\"They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn't be a forever type of relationship and that was mutually understood from the get-go,\" the source added. \"They have crazy busy schedules and know they're still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down.

I know [people are] going to say something. People know everything about me, so what's left for me to protect? My private life, my personal life.\"\n\nWhen asked if he wanted to address any rumors about his relationship with Kendall, he reiterated his stance: \"That's the only answer. In the end, the only thing I have is my privacy.\"\n\nThat same month, Kendall explained to WSJ magazine why she has \"no comment\" on Bad Bunny or their relationship. \"I try [to] find the balance of keeping things private and keeping things sacred, [and] also not letting the unfortunate frustration and stress of everyone trying to get in on it stop me from enjoying my side,\" she said. \"Does that make sense? I'll go out of my way to do things as privately as possible because I just think that that's the healthier way of dealing with relationships anyway.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Eve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Eve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kylie Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/27229411dd22b49d3a57d3168c5ba589", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544237", "eventUri": "eng-9544237", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-16", "textStart": 726, "textEnd": 737}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

"INTERNATIONAL superstar Bad Bunny rose to prominence after releasing several hit singles.\n\nThe Puerto Rican rapper stunned fans at the 2024 Met Gala after he rocked up wearing a custom Maison Margiela Artisanal Collection by John Galliano.\n\nWho is Bad Bunny?\n\nBorn On March 10, 1994, Bad Bunny was born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio in Puerto Rico.\n\nFollowing the success of his many reggaet\u00f3n, pop, and crossover releases from 2016 onwards, Bad Bunny saw his stardom cross from the Latin charts into the mainstream.\n\nHe has collaborated with artists including J Balvin, Ozuna, Farruko, El Alfa, Arc\u00e1ngel, and Daddy Yankee.\n\nHe's also made guest appearances on songs by Drake, Dua Lipa, Cardi B, Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, and Will Smith.\n\nWhile speaking to Rolling Stone, the musician described himself as being a wallflower, though he developed a reputation at school for coming up with creative raps.\n\nHe was raised in the Catholic church and knew from a young age he wanted to be a singer, so he would sing in his church's choir.\n\nBad Bunny has released five studio albums.\n\nThey are X 100pre (2018), YHLQMDLG (2020), El Ultimo Tour Del Mundo (2020), Un Verano Sin Ti (2022), and Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana (2023).\n\nHe has also released a joint album with J Balvin in 2019 titled Oasis.\n\nBad Bunny claimed the top spot as Spotify's most-streamed artist globally, with more than 8.3 billion streams in 2020.\n\nYHLQMDLG, which was released in February 2020, was the number-one streamed album on Spotify by the end of 2021.\n\nThe rapper beat the likes of Drake, The Weeknd, J Balvin, and late rapper Juice WRLD, to claim the number-one spot.\n\nIn November 2023, Bad Bunny was listed just below Taylor Swift on Spotify's top 10 global artists list.\n\nIn January 2021, Bad Bunny performed his song Booker T, named after a pro wrestler, at WWE's Royal Rumble.\n\nHe later got roped into a storyline with the wrestling promotion that saw him make his in-ring debut with a win at WrestleMania.\n\nIn October 2022, it was announced that Bad Bunny would star as El Muerto in Sony and Marvel's Spider-Man Universe spinoff.\n\nHe would have been Marvel's first live-action Latino hero, but the film had many setbacks and he ultimately dropped out from the role.\n\nThe film is still in production.\n\nBad Bunny returned to the WWE in 2023, where he faced off against his former tag-team partner and fellow Puerto Rican, Damien Priest in WrestleMania Backlash, which took place in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nIn February 2024, Bad Bunny was named a co-chair of the 2024 Met Gala, along with Jennifer Lopez, Zendaya, and Chris Hemsworth.\n\nThe outlet reported a bulk of his earnings came from his tours El \u00daltimo Tour Del Mundo and The World's Hottest Tour, as well as his lucrative endorsement deals with Corona, Cheetos, and Adidas.\n\nWhat song made Bad Bunny famous?\n\nBad Bunny rose to fame almost immediately after he released \"Soy Peor\" (\"I'm Worse\") in 2016.\n\nHe would later collaborate with Cardi B and Balvin in 2018 which grew his audience in the states.\n\nHe rapped in English and Spanish and the song reached number one on the Billard Top 100.\n\nThis paved the way for the Puerto Rican singer to work with Drake later that year.\n\nWho has Bad Bunny dated?\n\nThe internet was set on fire when rumors of Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner dating began spreading.\n\nWhile the supermodel and the Latin superstar haven't commented publicly on the relationship, they were spotted on dates and attending events together, like Coachella and NBA games.\n\nHowever, as of December 2023, the pair seemingly split up.\n\nBy January 2024, it was reported that the two were back together.\n\nBefore Kendall, the rapper was in a long-term relationship with model Gabriela Berlingeri.\n\nThe two often shared loved-up photos across social media.\n\nBad Bunny was previously linked to rapper Cazzu, even sharing photos of them kissing onstage.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanyel_mustafa@thesun.co.uk", "name":

From dating Kendall Jenner to huge following", "body": "Bad Bunny is taking to the famous steps as this year's Met Gala co-host, alongside Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth. The international superstar, whose real name is Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, is no stranger to presenting gigs having hosted Saturday Night Live, among sell-out music gigs and A-list romances.\n\nThe Puerto Rican rapper, singer, and record producer, 30, is known as the 'King of Latin Trap' having shot to fame from the Latin charts into the mainstream from 2016 onwards. This followed a series of successes collaborations with artists such as J Balvin, Ozuna, Farruko, El Alfa, Arc\u00e1ngel, and Daddy Yankee.\n\nHe has also made guest appearances on songs by the likes of Drake, Dua Lipa, Cardi B, Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, and Will Smith. The rapper became the first \"non-English-language\" act in Spotify's most streamed artist of the year, leading the way from 2020 to 2022.\n\nBad Bunny also holds the second-biggest streaming year of any artist in Spotify history, having secured over a whopping 18.5 billion streams in 2022. He has released five studio albums, which are: X 100pre (2018), YHLQMDLG (2020), El Ultimo Tour Del Mundo (2020), Un Verano Sin Ti (2022), and Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana (2023).\n\nIn November 2023, he was listed just below Taylor Swift on Spotify's top 10 global artists list. And it seems his love for creating music has been at the heart of his passion from a young age.\n\nUntil the age of 13, Bad Bunny sang in his church's choir and when he was 14 years old started releasing his own songs on SoundCloud. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Bad Bunny described himself as a wallflower but said he had a reputation at school for creating raps.\n\nKendall Jenner romance\n\nIn February 2023, rumours emerged that the rapper was dating supermodel Kendall Jenner after they were introduced by mutual friends. The following month they were reportedly spotted sharing a kiss while out in Hollywood.\n\nWhile neither of the pair spoke out about their relationship, they were spotted on several dates and even attended events such as Coachella and the Met Gala together. They kept their romance under wraps, other than the very public outings, and were reported to have become more serious by the summer of 2023.\n\nIn September, they even appeared alongside each other in a Gucci campaign, which showed some very loved-up snaps. But in December an insider revealed that the pair had called it quits.\n\nA source told Entertainment Tonight: \"Kendall and Bad Bunny have been doing their own things lately, and things slowly started to fizzle out between them. They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn't be a forever type of relationship, and that was mutually understood from the get-go.\"\n\nThey added: \"They have crazy-busy schedules and know they're still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down.\" Bad Bunny and Kendall remained on good terms and even spent New Years together in Barbados with their mutual friends.\n\nBy January 2024, it was reported that they were back together - however, the pair are yet to confirm this.\n\nInternet sensation\n\nThe rapper boasts a whopping 46.3 million Instagram followers which is followed by the likes of Kendall Jenner and model Emily Ratajkowski. While he's made a huge name for himself in the music industry, he's only posted six times on the account, @badbunnypr, so far, having shared his first post in January this year.\n\nIn his first Instagram post, Bad Bunny was seen eating a bowl of cereal with a whopping pile of dollar notes by his side. He wrote the simple caption \"desayuno\", which translates to \"breakfast.\"\n\nIn another post in February, the superstar showed off his array of tattoos in a steamy bath selfie. The 30-year-old is often displaying his tattoos that are dotted all over his body, including on his thighs and forearms.", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors":

Before the Met Gala 2024 red carpet even started, we all somewhat anticipated Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny having a run-in since the model has become a staple at the event, and the Puerto Rican star serves as one of this year's hosts.\n\nAs expected, both Jenner and Bad Bunny arrived at the 2024 Met Gala separately, him in a Maison Margiela Artisanal suit complete with a corset and her in a trompe l'oeil sheer dress from Lee McQueen's Givenchy era. Celebs tend to walk the red carpet on their own unless they are currently couples (and lest we forget, Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny reportedly broke up in December) so until here, everything seems normal.\n\nUnfortunately, only the red carpet portion of the Met Gala is made available to the public so we don't know for sure if Jenner and Bad Bunny got to exchange words during the actual event, but what we do know is they attended the same after party together. Not only that but they were photographed cozying up in a corner together.\n\nAs pictured above, Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny spent some time together at the Apr\u00e8s Met 2 Met Gala After Party hosted by Carlos Nazario, Emily Ratajkowski, Francesco Risso, Paloma Elsesser, Ra\u00fal Lopez of Luar, and Renell Medra. The former couple were spotted laughing while having a drink and a conversation together, naturally reigniting rumors.\n\nNews of Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny reuniting comes just days after the Puerto Rican singer seemed to allude to their breakup in new song \"Adivino\" with Myke Towers, where he sings, \"Don't know if 'I love you' is worth the same in English.\" In the song, Bad Bunny does mention still feeling attracted to the person he's singing about but reinstates that getting together again, even if only physically, might be a bad idea.

It's fashion's biggest night, and when stars and their stylists bring their A-game, they really bring their A-game. Granted, when looking at menswear, a lot of guys tend to play it safe with a simple, monochrome look or -- heaven forbid -- a penguin suit. But not Bad Bunny.\n\nBad Bunny, certified fashionhead, is the kind of guy who shows up to the red carpet an hour early, with a playful little hat, hoofed Tabi shoes, tiny sunglasses, and the kind of swagger that only an artisanal Maison Margiela couture look could grant.\n\nBenito, Benito, Benito, I knew better than to ever doubt you. You, who is wearing goat-like shoes with literal animal hair on them, and a big floppy hat that makes me yearn for when the Renaissance Fair might come into town. You, clutching a fistful of all-black roses in your leather glove on the red carpet, because the power of accessorizing doesn't just end at a hat and sunglasses.\n\nBad Bunny has turned out many an iconic look in his time (I still think about his all-white, floral look by Jacquemus from last year's Met Gala quite often), and he's a man who knows how to dress to a theme.\n\nTonight, for instance, the Met Gala's theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" with a dress code that suggests guests to arrive according to the \"Garden of Time.\" Bad Bunny, you have outdone yourself. The timelessness of the almost utilitarian squared tailoring with white pinstripes and flashes of red, the ephemerality (and garden-ness!) of the decayed flowers, the contrast between eccentricity and modernity. What more is there to say?\n\nWell, there's this -- the rest of the guys following Bad Bunny's footsteps on the red carpet tonight have a very, very high bar set for them.", "source": {"uri": "esquire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Esquire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_Margiela", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maison Margiela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monochrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penguin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artisan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Porte_Jacquemus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simon Porte Jacquemus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemerality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ephemerality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Modernity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utilitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bad-bunny-attends-the-2024-met-gala-celebrating-sleeping-news-photo-1715030556.jpg?crop=1xw:0.74963xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544237", "eventUri": "eng-9544237", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The highly-anticipated event saw Bad Bunny serving as one of the co-chairs, while Kendall graced the red carpet in her signature style.\n\nHowever, it wasn't just their presence at the gala that turned heads; it was their cozy reunion at the afterparty that set tongues wagging. Both Kendall and Bad Bunny traded their gala ensembles for chic afterparty outfits as they mingled and celebrated at the exclusive Apr\u00e8s Met 2 Met Gala Afterparty at WSA in New York City.\n\nPhotographs and videos capturing the exes laughing and flirting at the event quickly made waves on social media. An eyewitness spilled the tea to Page 6, revealing, \"They were at the same table, laughing and flirting. She was rubbing his head.\"\n\nWhile rumors of a rekindled romance swirled among fans, sources close to the pair suggested that their relationship status remains ambiguous. Despite their apparent closeness at the afterparty, Kendall and Bad Bunny stopped short of sharing a kiss but remained glued to each other's side throughout the night.\n\nThe duo called it quits on their romance in December of 2023, after less than a year of dating. Since then, Kendall has been linked to her ex, Devin Booker. However, insiders hinted that their split was amicable and mutually understood from the beginning. A source shared with Page 6, \"They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn't be a forever type of relationship, and that was mutually understood from the get-go.\"\n\nWith their busy schedules and a desire to explore individual paths before settling down, Kendall and Bad Bunny seem to have embraced the notion of taking life one step at a time. As their reunion at the Met Gala suggests, sparks may still fly whenever these two cross paths.

Despite being public figures, the pair managed to keep their romance out of the spotlight leading up to their split in December 2023.\n\nOne month after they called it quits, an insider told Us Weekly that Kendall and Bad Bunny reconnected. \"Kendall's friends aren't surprised whatsoever that she's seeing Bad Bunny again.

I just do it.\"\n\nNot to be outdone, Simmons, 27, came ready to play in a Thom Browne ensemble styled by Wesmore Perriott.

Among the dazzling attendees, the unexpected cozy reunion of former couple Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny at the Met Gala afterparties stole the spotlight, sparking speculation about the status of their relationship months after their break up.\n\nThe morning following the Gala, both were seen leaving Greenwich Hotel in casual attire, adding fuel to the fire of ongoing speculation. In stark contrast to their glamorous Met gala outfits, the two stepped out of the same hotel in t-shirt, hoodie, and sweats.\n\nKendall Jenner, a supermodel with a history of turning heads at the Met Gala, made her tenth appearance in a stunning Alexander McQueen Fall 1999 look for Givenchy haute couture.\n\nIn contrast, Bad Bunny, wearing a matador-inspired custom Maison Margiela navy suit for the Gala and later changing into a relaxed leather trench coat, co-chaired the event alongside luminaries such as Zendaya Coleman and Jennifer Lopez.\n\nThe pair, once a hot topic of celebrity gossip since their rumored romance began in February 2023, seemed to have buried the hatchet, presenting a cozy reunion at the post-Gala festivities.\n\nSources indicate that while Kendall and Bad Bunny, aged 28 and 30 respectively, have decided not to rekindle their romance after their split in December 2023, their interaction at the afterparty suggested a warm and affectionate dynamic. Witnesses reported moments of shared laughter and friendly exchanges, including the affectionate gesture of Jenner rubbing Bad Bunny's head and cuddling.\n\nThe theme of the Gala, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" might as well have hinted at the possibility of reawakened feelings between the two stars.

The former couple was photographed seated next to each other, smiling and in deep conversation. It is the most revealing look at their post-breakup dynamic that has come out so far, as both stars are very private:\n\nBad Bunny and Kendall dated for almost a year before their December split; their relationship was first reported in February 2023. While news of their breakup came out before the holidays, they went on to spend New Year's Eve together with friends in Barbados.\n\nRegarding why the pair ultimately called it quits, a source told The Messenger on December 16, \"There's no bad blood. They are even still in contact. Their relationship had been rocky due to their busy schedules.\" Bad Bunny was planning a 2024 world tour and \"felt the relationship truly ran its course.\"\n\nA separate source explained to Entertainment Tonight a day later that \"Kendall and Bad Bunny have been doing their own things lately, and things slowly started to fizzle out between them.\"\n\n\"They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn't be a forever type of relationship and that was mutually understood from the get-go,\" the source added. \"They have crazy busy schedules and know they're still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down. [There] isn't any negativity between them, and they still want the best for one another.\"\n\nKendall and Bad Bunny made a point to protect their privacy and not speak about their relationship in interviews while they dated.\n\nIn June, Bad Bunny talked to Rolling Stone about his decision to keep his personal life private. \"I know something is going to come out. I know [people are] going to say something. People know everything about me, so what's left for me to protect? My private life, my personal life.\"\n\nWhen asked if he wanted to address any rumors about his relationship with Kendall, he reiterated his stance: \"That's the only answer. In the end, the only thing I have is my privacy.\"\n\nThat same month, Kendall explained to WSJ magazine why she has \"no comment\" on Bad Bunny or their relationship. \"I try [to] find the balance of keeping things private and keeping things sacred, [and] also not letting the unfortunate frustration and stress of everyone trying to get in on it stop me from enjoying my side,\" she said. \"Does that make sense? I'll go out of my way to do things as privately as possible because I just think that that's the healthier way of dealing with relationships anyway.\"", "source": {"uri": "cosmopolitan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cosmopolitan"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Eve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Eve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kendall-jenner-bad-bunny-and-guests-at-the-apr-c3-a8s-met-2-met-news-photo-1715083958.jpg?crop=0.774xw:0.502xh;0.196xw,0.0705xh&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544237", "eventUri": "eng-9544237", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-16", "textStart": 794, "textEnd": 805}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

All About Bad Bunny's Net Worth in 2024", "body": "This bunny may be bad, yet Bad Bunny's net worth is anything but. After being named one of TIME's Most Influential People in 2020 and being the first non-English language act to become the most streamed artist on Spotify (for two years in a row!), Bad Bunny -- real name Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio -- has the world at his feet. You have to wonder, what is Bad Bunny's net worth with all of this success?\n\nAnd we didn't even mention his appearances in the WWE! The Puerto Rican artist has taken the movie world by storm, too. He made his movie debut in 2021's F9, followed that up with the Brad Pitt action movie Bullet Train. Most recently, he was in 2023's Cassandro.\n\nIn 2024, he adds a Met Gala co-chair role to his credits, joining Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth alongside Vogue's Anna Wintour.\n\nHere is everything you could ever wonder about Bad Bunny's net worth in 2024.\n\nWhat's Bad Bunny's net worth in 2024?\n\nAh yes, the question of the hour! According to Celebrity Net Worth, Bad Bunny's net worth in 2024 is $50 million. Considering the fact that he has become one of the most streamed artists in the world -- often the most streamed -- with his songs totaling over 14.8 billion plays and counting, it's no surprise Bad Bunny is rolling in money. Plus, he now has acting roles and appearances in the WWE to add to his growing fortune.\n\nRelated: Find Out Ariana Grande's Net Worth and How She Made It\n\nHow much money does Bad Bunny make per concert?\n\nPollstar estimates that Bad Bunny earns as much as $4.1 million for each performance. However, keep in mind that all of this money would not go directly to the singer, as there are many people who earn a percentage of this performance money.\n\nRelated: Bullet Train Star Sandra Bullock's Astronomical Net Worth Revealed\n\nHow much does Bad Bunny make on Spotify?\n\nBad Bunny has over 58 billion streams on Spotify, putting him in the top five most-streamed artists of all time in the platform's history. One calculation values that at over $280 million. However, keep in mind that this money does not go directly into Bad Bunny's pocket. He has to pay a percentage to his label, for instance. Even so, because he is often the most streamed artist on the platform, Bad Bunny has been able to earn a pretty penny from Spotify.\n\nHow much does Bad Bunny make per year?\n\nBecause Bad Bunny had a meteoric rise in a relatively short period of time, we cannot know exactly how much the artist makes in a year. This is especially true as the number will be changing frequently as his star power continues to grow. However, it has been reported that he makes over $4 million annually. Not bad for a year's work!\n\nHow much does Bad Bunny make per album?\n\nIt is not known exactly how much Bad Bunny makes per album. Because of streaming, artists can be earning money on their entire discography each year. However, it has been reported that Bad Bunny has earned over $20 million from his songs and albums. As of May 2024, he has reached 86,316,000 equivalent album sales, with his best-selling album, Un Verano Sin Ti, selling over 16,287,000 copies.\n\nHow much did Bad Bunny get paid for WWE?\n\nBad Bunny and the WWE have not publicized how much the artist makes per appearance in the WWE ring. However, wrestling experts have estimated that the 28-year-old could be earning upwards of $100,000 per appearance. Remember, he once won the WWE 24/7 Championship, so clearly the partnership is working out!\n\nRelated: Find Out The Weeknd's Net Worth\n\nHow much did Bad Bunny get paid for Narcos?\n\nBad Bunny was lucky enough to earn the role of Everardo Arturo \"El Kitty\" Paez in the third season of Narcos: Mexico. But, it has not been revealed how much he was paid for his role. Considering his celebrity and the payment actors on streaming shows usually receive, we can imagine his salary was anywhere in the tens of thousands of dollars range.\n\nIn Entertainment Weekly, showrunner Carlo Bernard discussed the reggaeton artist's casting. \"Everybody under 30 in the office lost their s**t. I was like, 'Oh, I should probably pay more attention to this!' He put himself on tape, and -- to no surprise -- he's very watchable, and you're innately drawn to him.\" In fact, Bernard's one regret about the casting decision was that he felt the young star didn't have enough to do, adding, \"Whatever we gave him, he killed.\"\n\nHow much does Bad Bunny make on tour?\n\nBad Bunny's El \u00daltimo Tour del Mundo in 2022 became the highest-grossing tour ever by a Latinx artist, taking in more than $435 million.

Which is a big honor for anyone very famous and very fashion-adjacent. But it also means you're one of the first to cut the ribbon on the red carpet, and thus, there comes some added responsibility. Go too quiet, and you'll be eclipsed by the dozens of other fits that'll come after. And Bad Bunny avoided that entirely, because he went into full Tudor prince of chaos mode.\n\nWearing Maison Margiela, which is like high fashion's equivalent of one of those medieval paintings that depicts a terrifying/quite fun idea of heaven and hell, the '25/8' singer kept up a track record for good and mad fits. Last year, at the Met Gala's tribute to the late Karl Lagerfeld, he arrived in a heavenly white Jacquemus suit with the back cut out. And before that, there's been a slew of wild, wild looks: at 2022's Met Gala ode to American fashion, there was a blend of Puerto Rican menswear and womenswear; at last year's Grammys, a nu metal ch'yeah bro cap above a tux; on every single red carpet ever, something people like to tweet about. OK, you get it.\n\nBut for the Met Gala 2024, it was more theatrical. The oversized bonnet (with an abstract tassel, because of course) was equally as bold as an open-stitched suit and, of course, a pair of Tabis that a Tinder date may or may not want to steal -- especially if they want their Tabis to be slightly Mr-Tumnus-at-the-4-a.m.-rave coded. Lest we forget the sunglasses too, which aren't too dissimilar to Pharrell's famed Tiffany shades.\n\nAnd yeah, we've come to expect this sort of good and mad fit from Bad Bunny.

Exes Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny may have individually made headlines at the Met Gala, but they immediately sent tongues wagging after they were photographed cozying up together at an after-party.\n\nIn a photo that immediately went viral in the early hours of May 7, Jenner, 28, was photographed laughing while leaning into the \"Yo Perreo Sola\" artist, 30, as they sat next to each other at the Apr\u00e8s Met 2 Met Gala After Party on May 6. Bad Bunny (real name: Benito Martinez Ocasio) -- who served as a co-chair at this year's Met Gala -- grinned back at Jenner, whom he dated for a little less than a year in 2023. The duo both held drinks in their hands as they appeared to be enjoying the intimate interaction.\n\nWhile Jenner made history at the Met Gala earlier in the night by donning a jaw-dropping cut-out Givenchy dress that had never been worn before, she changed into a white lace mini dress by Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood for the after-party. Bad Bunny sported an all-black ensemble from the Maison Margiela Artisanal Collection by John Galliano during the gala, a couture piece that featured multiple nods to his native Puerto Rico.\n\nThe exes' fashion night out comes six months after their December 2023 split (and one year after attending the Met as a couple in May 2023).\n\nAt the time of their breakup, a source told Entertainment Tonight that the pair \"both knew going into this that it likely wouldn't be a forever type of relationship and that was mutually understood from the get-go.\"\n\n\"They have crazy busy schedules and know they're still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down,\" the insider added.\n\nDespite their split, they still kicked off 2024 together, celebrating the New Year with close friends Justin and Hailey Bieber.\n\n\"Kendall and Bad Bunny are still close and have a good time when they're together,\" a source told ET at the time.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michelle_mcgahan@newsweek.com", "name": "Michelle McGahan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Kronthaler_(fashion_designer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andreas Kronthaler (fashion designer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivienne_Westwood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vivienne Westwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniskirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miniskirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givenchy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Givenchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailey_Bieber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hailey Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_Margiela", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maison Margiela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galliano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Galliano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/New_Year", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/New Year", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2389173/kendall-jenner.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=c202573707c7102b8e11e6fd11381e98", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544237", "eventUri": "eng-9544237", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 363, "textEnd": 368}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 535, "textEnd": 540}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

While many attendees are sporting straightforward florals, the Latin legend opted for only a small bundle of fabric blooms to clutch between his leather gloves. The rest of the artist's custom Maison Margiela look instead paid homage to the protagonist of J.G. Ballard's 1962 short story \"The Garden of Time,\" after which the gala's theme is titled.\n\nIn Ballard's story, the courtly Count Axel resides over an Italian villa, on whose grounds grow a collection of so-called \"time flowers,\" which Axel and his wife pick to turn back time and ward off the army advancing on them. The story -- a symbolic portrait of time's inevitable creep and the ultimate plight of nobility -- describes Axel as \"a tall, imperious figure in a black velvet jacket, a gold tie-pin glinting below his George V beard, cane held stiffly in a white-gloved hand.\"\n\nAlthough Bad Bunny's Margiela look takes liberties with Ballard's description of Axel, it still plays clear homage to the count: Where Axel dons black velvet, the singer wears navy with white stripes. The gold tie-pin is now a pair of diamond-shaped gold sunglasses. Bad Bunny wears black gloves instead of white, and he holds flowers instead of a cane.

This encounter comes nearly five months after their breakup in December 2023, stirring rumors about a potential rekindling of their romance.\n\nThe supermodel, 28, and the Puerto Rican rapper, 30, were all smiles as they shared laughs and drinks at the WSA in downtown New York. Witnesses described them sitting together, engaging in private conversations, and enjoying moments of laughter. Jenner was notably dressed in a fairy-tale ensemble by Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood, juxtaposed against Bunny's relaxed leather look later in the evening.\n\nDespite their split, Jenner and Bunny have maintained a friendly rapport, evident from their interactions at the Met Gala afterparty. The two had initially sparked romance rumors in February 2023 and were seen on multiple dates, including horseback riding together and cozying up at Coachella 2023. Their last public appearance as a couple was at Gucci's Spring/Summer 2024 fashion show in Milan.\n\nThe theme for this year's Met Gala was \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" where Jenner made an impact by wearing a unique Alexander McQueen fall 1999 look for Givenchy haute couture, marking her tenth appearance at the Gala. Meanwhile, Bad Bunny, who co-chaired the event alongside notables like Zendaya Coleman and Jennifer Lopez, opted for a matador-inspired custom Maison Margiela navy suit for the Gala and a more laid-back leather trench coat for the afterparty.\n\nWhile insiders have shared that the two did not rekindle their romance post-split, their recent cozy appearance has fans speculating about their current status. Reports have highlighted their jovial interaction, with Jenner seen affectionately rubbing Bad Bunny's head although they were not seen kissing.\n\nThis encounter has certainly sparked interest among their fanbase and the public alike, as both stars navigate their post-breakup relationship under the watchful eyes of the media and fans. Whether they are rekindling their romance or simply enjoying a friendly reunion, Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny continue to captivate audiences with their dynamic.", "source": {"uri": "aceshowbiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AceShowbiz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aceshowbiz_team@aceshowbiz.com", "name": "AceShowbiz Team", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant-garde", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avant-garde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachella_(festival)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coachella (festival)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Ricans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Ricans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivienne_Westwood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vivienne Westwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermodel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermodel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gucci", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gucci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_Margiela", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maison Margiela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_coat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trench coat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_McQueen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander McQueen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givenchy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Givenchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Genres", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Fiction", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Rabbits", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Rabbits", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/photo/2024/05/07/00223988.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544237", "eventUri": "eng-9544237", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 402, "textEnd": 407}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The Kardashians star and the \"Tit\u00ed Me Pregunto\" singer sparked dating rumors after they were seen walking out of Wally's in Beverly Hills, California on February 18, 2023, according to TMZ. The two left after Hailey and Justin Bieber were seen walking out of the same restaurant. Kendall left right before Bad Bunny through a different exit with security in tow. Kendall was wearing leather pants, black boots and a gray oversized jacket while Bad Bunny wore a similar color palette with a brown jacket and a khaki-colored hat.\n\nIn February 2023, sources told People that the pair were \"spending time together.\" According to one insider who spoke to the publication at the time, Kendall and Bad Bunny were introduced by mutual friends after the Puerto Rican rapper purchased a new home in Los Angeles. \"She likes him and is having fun,\" the source shared. \"He is different from guys that she dated in the past. He is very charming.\"\n\nAnother source told Entertainment Tonight the pair were having fun and keeping things casual at the time. \"Kendall and Bad Bunny are attracted to each other and definitely have a flirty vibe,\" the source shared. \"It is still new, but they're enjoying each other's company and like each other. They have mutual friends and had dinner with Hailey, Justin and friends at Wally's in Beverly Hills on Saturday night. It's been fun for both of them so far.\"\n\nSoon after, they were seen at a Met Gala afterparty together in May. Sources told People that the two may be becoming exclusive and are in fact \"getting more serious\". \"They are very cute together. Kendall is happy. He is a fun guy. Very much a gentleman and charming. She likes his vibe. He is very chill.\"\n\nThe insider continued, \"It was a slow start, but they spend almost every day together now. He hangs out with her friends and she hangs out with his. It's more of a relationship now. Kendall is not seeing anyone else. She really likes him.\"\n\nNews of their breakup was first reported by People in December. \"Kendall and Bad Bunny have been doing their own things lately and things slowly started to fizzle out between them,\" said a source to Entertainment Tonight. \"They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn't be a forever type of relationship and that was mutually understood from the get-go. They have crazy busy schedules and know they're still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down.\"\n\nThe source clarified that there \"isn't any negativity between them and they still want the best for one another. Kendall's family still thinks highly of him. They just want her to be with whoever makes her happy, treats her with love and respect, and someone that understands and can handle the attention that comes along with dating her with poise and grace.\"", "source": {"uri": "stylecaster.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StyleCaster"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophie_hanson@stylecaster.com", "name": "Sophie Hanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailey_Bieber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hailey Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_Margiela", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maison Margiela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Browne", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thom Browne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galliano", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Galliano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givenchy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Givenchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Louboutin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Louboutin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beverly Hills, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverly Hills, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kardashians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Kardashians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Ricans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Ricans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Cyber_Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Cyber Relationships", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kendall-Jenner-Bad-Bunny-Met-Gala.png?w=650", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544237", "eventUri": "eng-9544237", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-02-", "textStart": 1125, "textEnd": 1136}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Sitting close and whispering to each other.\"\n\nAnother source told Page Six that the former couple did not kiss, but they were together all night on one of the venue's sofas. They were also spotted dancing together.\n\nWhat was the relationship between Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner?\n\nRumours of romance emerged in February of last year after the gossip account DeuxMoi revealed that both were seen together kissing at a private club in Los Angeles. Subsequently, the model and the \"Where She Goes\" singer were spotted leaving the same restaurant in Beverly Hills. Although they never publicly confirmed their relationship, they were photographed together on various outings and dinners, such as Coachella, last year's Met Gala, vacationing together in Puerto Rico, attending a Lakers game, and they were even recorded kissing at a Drake concert.\n\nIn September 2023, the couple debuted their romance on social media by starring together in a campaign for Gucci, however, three months later, the relationship ended. In mid-December, news broke that they had ended their relationship. However, both spent New Year's Eve together near Barbados, casting doubt on their separation.\n\nNevertheless, shortly after, having not being seen together again, it was concluded that they had indeed split.

The meticulous attention to detail, from the press walls adorned with greenery to the tent walls featuring larger-than-life images of leafy trees, set the stage for an unforgettable evening.\n\nThe focus on reviving unique garments from various centuries offered a fresh perspective on fashion, celebrating pieces often deemed too delicate for wear.\n\nThe Costume Institute's exhibition, 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion', paid homage to legendary designers and showcased iconic designs spanning over 400 years of fashion history.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_Margiela", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maison Margiela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trousers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burberry", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burberry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_role", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculinity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masculinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant-garde", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avant-garde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Varied_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Varied Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Garden_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Garden Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/07/1600x900/bad_bunny_met_gala_1715052904853_1715052905087.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544237", "eventUri": "eng-9544237", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Martinez Ocasio, served as a co-chair for this year's event, and later spent part of his evening with his supermodel ex.\n\nThe former pair were all smiles sitting close on a couch together at the Apr\u00e8s Met 2 Met Gala After Party, which was hosted by Carlos Nazario, Emily Ratajkowski, Francesco Russo, Paloma Elsesser, Raul Lopez, and Renell Medra.\n\nIn the pic, Kendall and Bad Bunny both appear to be drinking cocktails while laughing together.\n\nThe reality star dazzled in a custom white corset, lace-covered mini-dress, by Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood. The chic piece showed off her impressive legs.\n\nThis wasn't Kendall's first look of the night. After wowing at the gala in a never-worn archival piece from Givenchy, which was designed by the late Alexander McQueen, Kendall donned another archival Givenchy by Alexander McQueen white strapless dress. In the piece of fashion history, Kendall looked angelic in the winged design with a short front and lengthy back.\n\nBack in December ET confirmed that Kendall and Bad Bunny had called it quits after less than a year of dating.\n\nA source told ET at the time, \"Kendall and Bad Bunny have been doing their own things lately and things slowly started to fizzle out between them.\"\n\n\"They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn't be a forever type of relationship and that was mutually understood from the get-go,\" the source continued. \"They have crazy busy schedules and know they're still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down.\"\n\nThe source said that there \"isn't any negativity between them and they still want the best for one another.\"\n\nCoincidentally, the former couple attended the 2023 Met Gala together. Though they posed separately on the carpet, they were later seen heading to an after-party together after the annual event.\n\nAnd despite their split, the exes have remained amicable, ringing in the New Year together shortly after their breakup.\n\n\"Kendall and Bad Bunny celebrated New Year's Eve together while on vacation near Barbados with friends including Justin and Hailey [Bieber],\" another source told ET at the time. \"Kendall and Bad Bunny are still close and have a good time when they're together.\"", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermodel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supermodel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paloma_Elsesser", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paloma Elsesser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Ratajkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emily Ratajkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_McQueen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander McQueen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givenchy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Givenchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Kronthaler_(fashion_designer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andreas Kronthaler (fashion designer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivienne_Westwood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vivienne Westwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailey_Bieber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hailey Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Eve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Eve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2024-05/main-GettyImages-2151316862.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544237", "eventUri": "eng-9544237", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

In Tabis. In everyone's best-dressed top five\n\nBad Bunny was announced as one of the co-chairs of the Met Gala 2024. Which is a big honour for anyone very famous and very fashion-adjacent. But it also means you're one of the first to cut the ribbon on the red carpet, and thus, there comes some added responsibility. Go too quiet, and you'll be eclipsed by the dozens of other fits that'll come after. And Bad Bunny avoided that entirely, because he went into full Tudor prince of chaos mode.\n\nWearing Maison Margiela, which is like high fashion's equivalent of one of those medieval paintings that depicts a terrifying/quite fun idea of heaven and hell, the '25/8' singer kept up a track record for good and mad fits. Last year, at the Met Gala's tribute to the late Karl Lagerfeld, he arrived in a heavenly white Jacquemus suit with the back cut out. And before that, there's been a slew of wild, wild looks: at 2022's Met Gala ode to American fashion, there was a blend of Puerto Rican menswear and womenswear; at last year's Grammys, a nu metal ch'yeah bro cap above a tux; on every single red carpet ever, something people like to tweet about. OK, you get it.\n\nBut for the Met Gala 2024, it was more theatrical. The oversized bonnet (with an abstract tassel, because of course) was equally as bold as an open-stitched suit and, of course, a pair of Tabis that a Tinder date may or may not want to steal - especially if they want their Tabis to be slightly Mr-Tumnus-at-the-4am-rave coded.

The theme of the night was \"The Garden of Time,\" based on the art museum's Costume Institute's spring exhibition \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" From jaw-dropping ensembles to daring style statements, the red carpet was a feast for the eyes. One standout among the stars was none other than the famous rapper Bad Bunny, who turned heads and sparked conversations with his impeccably stylish attire.\n\nBad Bunny, known for his hit 'Me Porto Bonito,' appeared at the Met Gala resembling a luxurious matador. His ensemble featured a navy jacket paired with matching trousers, distinguished by subtle red accents lining the inside of the legs. The intricate design, reminiscent of measuring tape, added an experimental touch to the outfit. This striking look was custom-crafted by Maison Margiela Artisanal Couture, showcasing Bad Bunny's unique sense of style and flair for high fashion.\n\nTo top off his ensemble, Bad Bunny infused his signature style with his unique touches. He wore Tabi boots adorned with fur, paired with sleek black leather gloves. His accessories included diamond-shaped glasses and a striking bullfighter-inspired hat with a playful twist which evoked a sense of drama to his overall attire. Bunny didn't shy away from sparkle, sporting two large diamond studs for extra dazzle. And for an unexpected touch, he carried a bouquet of black faux flowers.\n\nSee his pics here:\n\nLast year, Bad Bunny made a striking departure from his current look, opting for an extravagant ensemble that turned heads at the Met Gala. He donned an opulent eight-meter (26-foot) flower train, flawlessly paired with a pristine white suit crafted by designer Simon Porte Jacquemus. The suit, featuring a daring backless blazer, added an unexpected twist to the traditional formal attire, perfectly embracing the event's theme, \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty.\" With his hair slicked back, the superstar exuded sophistication, while pearl stud earrings and a silver chain necklace added the classic touch to the overall look.\n\nFor his first appearance at the Met Gala 2022, Bad Bunny made a memorable statement with his choice of attire. He opted for a custom Burberry boilersuit, distinguished by its poofy shoulders. He wore the suit over a classic white dress shirt and a sleek black tie. He completed his look with white bolero shoes for a polished finish.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Porto_Bonito", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Me Porto Bonito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gala (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_Margiela", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maison Margiela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Experimental music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trousers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Porte_Jacquemus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simon Porte Jacquemus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Lagerfeld", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl Lagerfeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_wear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formal wear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleat_(shoe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleat (shoe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burberry", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burberry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pearl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dress shirt"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Dolls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Dolls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/1950s_Memorabilia", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/1950s Memorabilia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Wildcrafting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Wildcrafting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll_Making", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll Making", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/courchevel-2024-05-b0b44c58e5655b47a1c1386ffb7f3d59-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544237", "eventUri": "eng-9544237", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

The rapper wore a black leather jacket with a white undershirt and brown slacks.\n\nTheir night out comes less than six months after the former couple split in December 2023. An insider exclusively told Us Weekly at the time that \"friends aren't surprised\" by the separation, adding, \"They never really saw their relationship going the distance anyway.\"\n\nAccording to the source, Jenner's friends doubted the depth of their relationship to begin with. \"Of course, they want the best for their friend, but they really didn't feel like Kendall was as compatible with Bad Bunny as she was in past relationships with other people,\" the insider added. \"At the same time, Kendall has had a few on-off relationships in the past, so they wouldn't be totally surprised if she got back together with him at some point.\"\n\nThe Grammy winner and Jenner were initially linked in February 2023 when they were seen on a date in Beverly Hills. They attended the 2023 Met Gala separately that spring before being spotted together at an afterparty.\n\nBad Bunny addressed speculation about the duo's romance during a June 2023 interview with Rolling Stone. \"I know something is going to come out,\" he said at the time. \"I know [people are] going to say something. People know everything about me, so what's left for me to protect? My private life, my personal life.\"\n\nWhen asked specifically about Jenner, he replied, \"That's the only answer. In the end, the only thing I have is my privacy.\"\n\nIn her own interview with WSJ. Magazine, Jenner said, \"I try [to] find the balance of keeping things private and keeping things sacred, [and] also not letting the unfortunate frustration and stress of everyone trying to get in on it stop me from enjoying my side. Does that make sense?\"\n\nShe added: \"I'll go out of my way to do things as privately as possible because I just think that that's the healthier way of dealing with relationships anyway.\"\n\nServing as a co-chair alongside Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth and Jennifer Lopez on Monday, Bad Bunny arrived in a custom navy blue suit from Maison Margiela to mark the debut of the Met Costume Institute's \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" exhibit. He accessorized with an oversized beret, quirky sunglasses, leather gloves and a bouquet of flowers. Jenner, for her part, made her entrance in a shimmering floor-length Givenchy gown.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_lee_simpson@usmagazine.com", "name": "Michael Lee Simpson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corset", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Corset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Kronthaler_(fashion_designer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andreas Kronthaler (fashion designer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivienne_Westwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vivienne Westwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniskirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miniskirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather_jacket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leather jacket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givenchy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Givenchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beverly Hills, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverly Hills, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_Margiela", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maison Margiela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beret", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kendall-Jenner-Snuggles-Up-Next-to-Ex-Bad-Bunny-at-2024-Met-Gala-Afterparty.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544237", "eventUri": "eng-9544237", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

After the 2024 Met Gala Monday (May 6), the Puerto Rican musician and model -- who reportedly began dating last year before sparking breakup rumors in December -- were all smiles while enjoying drinks together at an afterparty hosted by Carlos Nazario, Emily Ratajkowski, Francesco Risso, Paloma Elsesser, Raul Lopez and Renell Medra in New York City.\n\nIn a photo from the night, Jenner squeezes in next to the \"Titi Me Pregunto\" musician -- who co-chaired this year's gala alongside Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth and Jennifer Lopez -- on a couch with two other friends. She leans in to chat with Benito as they both appear to laugh, visibly smiling wide in the snap.\n\nBoth stars changed out of their red-carpet outfits for the party, with the 818 Tequila founder sporting a lacy white dress and Bunny looking dapper in a leathery black jacket. Earlier that night, Jenner had walked the Metropolitan Museum of Art steps in an archival Alexander McQueen design, while the three-time Grammy winner had worn a theatrical Maison Margiela creation by John Galliano.\n\nThe gala comes about five months after reports emerged that the rumored couple had broken up, which Bunny seemingly went on to confirm in April with his Myke Towers collaboration, \"Adivino.\" \"Our love story is beautiful and weird,\" he sang on the track, as translated from Spanish by Genius. \"I was faithful to your eyes and to your lips loyal/ But no, we're not what we were/ You were one of my loves, I was just another of your exes.\"\n\nThe song -- which debuted at No. 53 on the Billboard Hot 100 -- dropped more than a year after he and Jenner were first spotted together at a Los Angeles restaurant in February 2023, after which they went to Coachella, attended a Lakers game, cuddled up at a Drake concert, vacationed in Idaho and had a number of other public sightings together over the next 10 months. They also attended last year's Met Gala afterparty together.\n\nSee the photo of Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny hanging out at the Met Gala afterparty below.", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com",

For example, they were spotted together in the front row at Milan Fashion Week in September, and courtside at a basketball game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Golden State Warriors in LA in May.\n\nInterestingly, Kendall and Benito had already hung out at a Met Gala after-party in 2023.

The former couple was photographed seated next to each other, smiling and in deep conversation. It is the most revealing look at their post-breakup dynamic that has come out so far, as both stars are very private:\n\nBunny and Jenner dated for almost a year before their December split; their relationship was first reported in February 2023. While news of their breakup came out before the holidays, they went on to spend New Year's Eve together with friends in Barbados.\n\nRegarding why the pair ultimately called it quits, a source told The Messenger on December 16, \"There's no bad blood. They are even still in contact. Their relationship had been rocky due to their busy schedules.\" Bunny was planning a 2024 world tour and \"felt the relationship truly ran its course.\"\n\nA separate source explained to Entertainment Tonight a day later that \"Kendall and Bad Bunny have been doing their own things lately, and things slowly started to fizzle out between them.\"\n\n\"They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn't be a forever type of relationship and that was mutually understood from the get-go,\" the source added. \"They have crazy busy schedules and know they're still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down. [There] isn't any negativity between them, and they still want the best for one another.\"\n\nJenner and Bunny made a point to protect their privacy and not speak about their relationship in interviews while they dated.\n\nIn June, Bunny talked to Rolling Stone about his decision to keep his personal life private. \"I know something is going to come out. I know [people are] going to say something. People know everything about me, so what's left for me to protect? My private life, my personal life.\"\n\nWhen asked if he wanted to address any rumors about his relationship with Jenner, he reiterated his stance: \"That's the only answer. In the end, the only thing I have is my privacy.\"\n\nThat same month, Jenner explained to WSJ magazine why she has \"no comment\" on Bunny or their relationship. \"I try [to] find the balance of keeping things private and keeping things sacred, [and] also not letting the unfortunate frustration and stress of everyone trying to get in on it stop me from enjoying my side,\" she said. \"Does that make sense? I'll go out of my way to do things as privately as possible because I just think that that's the healthier way of dealing with relationships anyway.\"\n\nSee how the stars interpreted this year's \"The Garden of Time\" dress code.\n\nThe dress code is a little more complicated than previous years'.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Eve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Eve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/27229411dd22b49d3a57d3168c5ba589", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544237", "eventUri": "eng-9544237", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-16", "textStart": 721, "textEnd": 732}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

However, after nearly 17 years of chronicling life in front of the cameras, Kendall admits the show is \"not my biggest cup of tea.\"\n\n\"To be honest, I've never been very comfortable filming,\" The Kardashians star tells the magazine. \"I just feel I'm not good at it.\"\n\nShe addressed her behavior on the show in a new trailer for the upcoming season, speaking into the cameras as she broke the fourth wall: \"I want to say something... I watch the show back, and I'm just like, I talk about the same thing over and over again, but I'm not boring, and ask any one of my best friends -- I am a good time, k?\"\n\nOf course, Kendall does not lack things to do should she ever decide to split from her reality show roots.

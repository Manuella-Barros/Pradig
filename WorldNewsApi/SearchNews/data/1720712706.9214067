It was rejected a second time. And then we developed this and have implemented it and we are at an early stage.\u201d He continued, \u201cAnd let\u2019s not minimize the significance of this move and the significance of operationalizing it. And it requires the cooperation of other countries which we have secured.\u201dRaddatz also asked Mayorkas if he expected illegal immigration to drop in the coming months, as Biden\u2019s order will stay in place until the rolling 14-day average falls below 1,500, which Raddatz pointed out has not happened under the Biden administration. Mayorkas said that the goal of the administration was to change the \u201crisk calculus\u201d of those coming over the border with the ban, something Raddatz was openly skeptical about. She replayed an interview from three years ago with Mayorkas, during which he expressed confidence that the Department of Homeland Security would \u201caccomplish our mission\u201d on the southern border. \u201cThat was three years ago. Since then, 6.5 million migrants have been apprehended along the southern border. It would be very hard to call that a success,\u201d she said. Mayorkas responded by saying that immigration is a \u201cdynamic phenomenon\u201d that the DHS couldn\u2019t fully control, and shifting blame to Congress. \u201cLet\u2019s recall what everyone expected when Title 42 was lifted in May of 2023. People expected pandemonium. Our model worked. We drove the numbers down,\u201d he said. \u201cThey go down, they go up. What we need? What we need is congressional action. We cannot resource the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, the Department of Justice with additional personnel. We need Congress to legislate.\u201d Rabbatz also asked Mayorkas about criticisms from the left about Biden\u2019s asylum ban, mentioning the lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, and comparing it to former President Donald Trump\u2018s policies. \u201cMartha, well, we\u2019ve talked about that, and Congress needs to act. And in the wake of congressional action, this is the step that we take, and it\u2019s not the first step that we\u2019ve taken, but I respectfully disagree with the ACLU. I anticipate they will sue us. We stand by the legality of what we have done. We stand by the value proposition,\u201d he said, adding that they had a \u201chumanitarian obligation\u201d to protect migrants from human smugglers. \u201cHow does this actually do that?\u201d Rabbatz retorted skeptically. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s obviously something you\u2019ve been trying to do for a long time.\u201d Mayorkas pointed to other policies meant to \u201cmaintain the integrity of the asylum process,\u201d such as increasing the number of refugees from the Western Hemisphere.Mayorkas was impeached by House Republicans earlier this year for his role in the handling of the southern border. He was the first Cabinet member to be impeached in nearly 150 years.", "summary": "Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was confronted over the timing of President Joe Biden&#8216;s executive order that bars migrants from seeking asylum when the number of illegal migrant apprehensions exceeds 2,500 per day.

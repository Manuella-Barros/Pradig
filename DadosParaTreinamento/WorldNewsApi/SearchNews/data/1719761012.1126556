{"id": 225039246, "title": "Met Office speaks out over UK facing 'three heatwaves' in June", "text": "The Met Office has spoken out over whether the UK will be hit by three heatwaves in June. There are hopes of a balmy sixth month of the year with maps and charts from forecasting agency Netweather turning orange and red as the heat rises. \"It is not possible to forecast heatwaves at this range, let alone the specific number for June,\" Met Office press officer Andrea Bishop warned. \"When looking at forecasts beyond five days into the future, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere starts to come into play - small events currently over the Atlantic can have potentially significant impacts on our weather in the UK in several days' or weeks\u2019 time. \"Therefore, while our long-range forecast can forecast the general feel of the weather to a relatively high level of accuracy using our ensemble models, it becomes harder to offer local detail to as high a level of accuracy as our shorter-range forecasts. For this reason, longer-range forecasts tend to be for the average conditions over the UK as a whole. Regional deviations from the UK average can occur.\" Netweather predicts: \u201cIt looks likely that pressure will fall substantially over the eastern North Atlantic, allowing low pressure to push in from the west, resulting in increasingly unsettled and wet weather for most of the UK.\" The maps and charts have breathed life into reports from Brian Glaze, from the Weather Outlook, and James Madden, from Exacta Weather, who said June could trigger heatwaves in the UK with the first 30C day of the year set to be felt in some areas. But Netweather, like the Met Office, is tempering expectations. It said: \u201cWe can expect above-average temperatures during this week, but not exceptionally so, probably by between 1 and 2C in most parts of the UK.\u201d The amount of rainfall will be \u201cabove normal for most\u201d and from June 3 to June 9, it is likely there will be \u201cplenty of dry and sunny weather in Northern Ireland, Wales and western and southern England, and probably also in south-west Scotland\u201d, it adds.", "summary": "There are hopes of a balmy sixth month of the year with maps and charts from forecasting agency Netweather turning orange and red as the heat rises.", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/met-office-speaks-out-over-29258462", "image": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:49:08", "author": "James Rodger", "authors": ["James Rodger"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.059}

There were 26 cases of suicide reported from the coaching hub last year.\n\nThe victim, Sandeep Kumar Kurmi, was a native of Nalanda district in Bihar and was enrolled in a coaching for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) in Kota for the last two years. He lived in a paying guest (PG) room in the Kota district of Mahaveer Nagar- III, PTI quoted police as saying.\n\nOn Thursday, at around 7 am, a classmate of the teen went to his room. When he did not get any response, he peeped through the window and discovered that Kurmi was hanging from the ceiling fan, Mahaveer Nagar SHO Mahendra Maru said.\n\nALSO READ | Woman Dies by Suicide in West Bengal's Jalpaiguri After 'Mob Flogging' Amid Tajmul Alias 'JCB' Row\n\nThe caretaker of the PG was alerted by the classmate, who subsequently informed the police. The SHO mentioned that the suicide took place between Wednesday night and Thursday morning, with no suicide note found in the room, according to the police.\n\nKurmi's older brother, Sanjeet, also resides in Kota and is preparing for the medical entrance exam NEET in a separate PG accommodation in the Dadabari area, informed Head Constable Mahaveer Prasad. He also added that education of the both brothers has been supported by his uncle since the demise of their parents four years ago.\n\nA preliminary investigation revealed that Kurmi was an average student who frequently used to miss his coaching classes, the SHO further added. As per the report of the police, it was also disclosed that the ceiling fan in the PG room of Kurmi did not have an anti-suicide device installed.\n\nTo prevent such incidents, the district administration has declared a mandate to install anti-suicide devices in all hostels and PG accommodations in Kota. An anti-suicide device is a structure that resembles a spring and is fixed with ceiling fans. The fan's spring expands and emits a siren when an object heavier than twenty kilograms is dangled from it.\n\nThe body of Kurmi was handed over on Thursday to his brother after a post-mortem. A case of unnatural death has been lodged under section 194 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and an investigation is underway, the SHO said, PTI reported.\n\nLike Kurmi, the two most recent coaching students who died by suicide in Kota were also from Bihar.

The news of the coaching student's suicide created a stir in the administration. Local police officials quickly reached the spot and began their investigation.\n\nIt is reported that Sandeep Kumar was staying in a PG in Mahavir Nagar Second. Sandeep Kumar had been living in Kota for the past two years, preparing for the JEE. According to the police, the student hanged himself from the ceiling fan at his paying guest accommodation. This morning, when someone saw the rope hanging from the fan in the student's room, they informed the landlord. The Mahavir Nagar police team reached the spot and sent the body to the mortuary.\n\nAccording to the police, no suicide note was found. The body has been sent for an autopsy.\n\nAccording to landlord Mahendra, Sandeep returned after having dinner at the mess, and they spoke. After that, he went to his room. It is reported that Sandeep Kumar's parents had died four years ago. Hence, he and his brother were living in Kota and studying. Initial investigations revealed that Sandeep Kumar's room did not have an anti-hanging device.\n\nLast month, a 17-year-old medical aspirant allegedly took his own life by hanging himself from a ceiling fan in his rented accommodation.\n\nAlso Read: Why AI Literacy Should Be Essential In School Education Now (& How To Go About It)\n\nIt should be noted that the administration has ordered the installation of anti-hanging devices in all hostels and PGs in the city, but these instructions have not been followed. To keep students stress-free in Kota, the district administration, along with coaching institutes, is taking several steps in compliance with government guidelines. Despite this, the cases of coaching student suicides continue to occur.

The number of student suicides in Kota stood at 26 in 2023.\n\nSandeep Kumar Kurmi, a native of Bihar's Nalanda district, was taking coaching for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) in Kota for the last two years and lived in a paying guest (PG) room in Mahaveer Nagar - III, the police said.\n\nAt around 7 am on Thursday, the teen's classmate went to his room. When he did not get any response, he peeped through the window and found Kurmi hanging from the ceiling fan, Mahaveer Nagar SHO Mahendra Maru said.\n\nKurmi's classmate informed the PG caretaker who then informed the police, he said.\n\nAccording to the SHO, the student committed suicide on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nNo suicide note was recovered from the room, the police said.\n\nKurmi's brother, Sanjeet, is taking coaching for the medical entrance exam NEET in Kota and lives in a separate PG room in Dadabari area, Head Constable Mahaveer Prasad said.\n\nThe two brothers reportedly lost their parents four years ago and their uncle was funding for their education, he added.\n\nDuring a preliminary probe it was found that Kurmi was an average student and would often miss his coaching classes, the SHO said.\n\nAccording to the police, the PG room where Kurmi lived did not have any anti-suicide device installed on the ceiling fan.\n\nThe district administration has made it mandatory for all hostels and PGs in the coaching hub to install anti-suicide devices in their rooms to prevent such cases.\n\nAn anti-suicide device is a spring-like structure which is attached to the ceiling fans. When an object weighing more than 20 kilos is hung from the fan, the spring attached to it expands and a siren goes off.\n\nLike Kurmi, the last two coaching students who committed suicide in Kota were Bihar natives.\n\nOn June 26, NEET aspirant Hrishit Kumar Agrawal (17), from Bihar's Bhagalpur, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself from a ceiling fan in his rented accommodation here Ayush Jaiswal (17), from Bihar's Motihari, committed suicide inside his PG room in Kota on June 16. He was preparing also taking coaching for JEE competitive exam.\n\nKurmi's body was handed over to his brother after a post-mortem on Thursday. A case of unnatural death has been lodged under section 194 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and a probe is underway, the SHO said.

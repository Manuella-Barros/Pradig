Details of the contract have not emerged, but Penny is slated to join his third NFL team in his seventh season in the league.\n\nPenny spent last year with the Philadelphia Eagles after signing a one-year deal with them as a free agent. He did not see much playing time as D'Andre Swift emerged as the feature back. Penny dressed for only three games and saw the field for 31 offensive snaps. He rushed 11 times for 33 yards and had one reception for five yards.\n\nBefore that Penny was a member of the Seattle Seahawks for the first five years of his NFL career after Seattle selected him with the 27th overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. However, Penny did not start a game until 2021 as injuries took a toll on his career.\n\nHe tore his ACL late in the 2019 season and missed most of the 2020 season because of it, appearing in three games in the latter.\n\nHis best season came in 2021 as he suited up for 10 games, starting six of them. Penny rushed for 749 yards and six touchdowns for a seven-win Seahawks team. He led the league in rushing yards per attempt after a monster finish to the season in which he rushed for over 134 yards per game across Seattle's final five games. Penny scored all of his touchdowns during that span.\n\nPenny reunites with Panthers head coach Dave Canales who held various roles with the Seahawks during Penny's time there. Canales was Seattle's passing game coordinator during the 2021 season.\n\nPanthers offense trying to get out of the basement\n\nThe Panthers suffered their sixth consecutive losing season in 2023, finishing with a 2-15 record, their worst since 2010. Canales will be the fifth different head coach (including interims) to lead the Panthers since the 2022 season.\n\nFrank Reich lasted 11 games last season before getting the boot. It's hard to argue with his dismissal given the dumpster fire of an offense the Panthers had. Carolina finished last in total offense and scoring offense with averages of 265.3 yards and 13.9 points per game. The yardage total was the worst by any team since the 2018 Arizona Cardinals, who averaged 241.6 yards per game.\n\nThings didn't get much better after Reich's firing as the Panthers' numbers dropped even more. Carolina scored 63 points across its final six games, a stretch that included a 30-point outing and two shutouts. Their lone win without Reich came in a 9-7 thriller against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 15.\n\nRashaad Penny joins a running back room that includes Chuba Hubbard, Miles Sanders and rookie second-round pick Jonathon Brooks. Hubbard grappled the starting role away from Sanders in the middle of the season and rushed for 902 yards. He'll likely have the edge again for the starting job, though Brooks will certainly have something to say about that if he is cleared following an ACL tear in November.\n\nPenny might just be a depth move at the moment for the Panthers, but it never hurts to have too many bodies at the running back position. He should get an opportunity to carve out a role in the NFL's worst offense.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_meyers@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Andrew Meyers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Andre_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D'Andre Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashaad_Penny", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rashaad Penny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Reich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frank Reich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuba_Hubbard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuba Hubbard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miles Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Carolina-adds-former-1st-round-pick-to-Bryce-Young-led-offense.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543356", "eventUri": "eng-9543356", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Several members of Carolina's coaching staff have ties to Seattle as well, including offensive coordinator Brad Idzik and passing game coordinator Nate Carroll.\n\nA 2018 first-round pick out of San Diego State, Penny struggled to find his footing in Seattle. He was constantly plagued with injuries, leading to him playing just 42 out of a possible 82 games for the Seahawks, including just 11 starts. Over that time, he rushed for 1,918 yards and 13 touchdowns while managing a solid 5.7 yards per carry.\n\nEven though his time in Seattle wasn't great overall, Penny showed flashes of his first-round talent. The most notable example came at the end of the 2021 season, when he ran for at least 135 yards in four of the Seahawks' last five games.

Penny, a 2018 first-round pick, was an afterthought with the Philadelphia Eagles last season -- having just 11 carries for 33 yards (3.0 yards per carry) in three games played with the team. He was a healthy scratch for most of the year.\n\nPenny has been one of the most productive running backs in the NFL in the two seasons prior to Philadelphia. He led the NFL in yards per carry among running backs with 150 carries (6.2) during that stretch -- the only players higher were quarterbacks Justin Fields and Lamar Jackson.\n\nOver his last 10 games played before arriving in Philadelphia, Penny had 149 carries for 1,017 yards and eight touchdowns -- and averaged 6.8 yards per carry. He couldn't see the field in Philadelphia last season, playing behind D'Andre Swift, Kenneth Gainwell, and Boston Scott.\n\nThe Panthers are banking on Penny becoming the player he was the Seattle Seahawks. Does Penny have a chance in Carolina?\n\nHow Penny fits in the Panthers running back room\n\nThe Panthers have been revamping the running back position after finishing 30th in rushing touchdowns (seven) and 23rd in yards per carry (4.0), part of an offense that finished 30th in points per possession (1.19) and 29th in yards per possession (25.1).\n\nMiles Sanders and Chuba Hubbard are still on the roster, but the Panthers drafted Jonathan Brooks in the second round of the 2024 draft (Brooks was the first running back taken). Penny was also added as veteran competition for Sanders and Hubbard.\n\nHubbard led the Panthers with 902 yards and five touchdowns, averaging 3.8 yards per carry. Sanders had just 432 rushing yards and a touchdown, averaging only 3.3 yards per carry in the first year of a four-year, $25.4 million deal.\n\nPenny has a history with head coach Dave Canales, as he was on the offensive coaching staff when Penny was in Seattle (even though Canales worked with the quarterbacks and passing game). There's still familiarity with how the offense ran, which plays to Penny's strengths.\n\nThe Panthers could see how Penny performs in training camp before making the final call on him, or have already made a decision on a running back with a huge contract.\n\nWill Miles Sanders be back?\n\nThe Panthers may just cut their losses with the 27-year-old Sanders, who still has three years remaining on his deal. Sanders could be designated as a post-June 1 cut, which Carolina would eat $7.495 million in dead cap space spread out over the next two years while saving $200,000 for 2024.\n\nCarolina could just wait a year until moving on from Sanders, saving $5.225 million if they release him in 2025. The Panthers could hope Canales could get the most out of Sanders before deciding to move on, should they remain unhappy with the contract.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_kerr@cbssports.com", "name": "Jeff Kerr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashaad_Penny", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rashaad Penny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Gainwell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth Gainwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuba_Hubbard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuba Hubbard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miles Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Andre_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D'Andre Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/08/14/1b9bb050-718c-4c86-b6a2-39d52ddb05f3/thumbnail/1200x675/a193c91ceb26066da26c3f5da862235b/gettyimages-1594546863.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543356", "eventUri": "eng-9543356", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2524, "textEnd": 2530}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

D'Andre Swift signed with the Bears, Boston Scott signed with the Rams and now Penny is heading to Carolina.\n\nDespite his incredible career average of 5.6 yards per carry, Penny was buried on the Eagles' depth chart last season behind Swift, Kenny Gainwell and Scott. Penny saw action in just three games all season and had just 11 carries for 33 yards.\n\nSwift was a Pro Bowler in 2023, his only season with the Eagles, and remained healthy. He played in 16 of 17 games. Gainwell also played in 16 of 17 and Scott played in 15 of 17. So there just wasn't much work left for Penny, who seemed to be a break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option for the Eagles.\n\nIn 2024, the Eagles will be relying heavily on free agent pickup Saquon Barkley.

The Eagles barely used him last season; he logged just 31 out of 1,147 possible offensive snaps (2.7%). Penny took 11 carries for just 33 yards and caught his sole target for a five-yard gain.\n\nPenny turning out to be such a non-factor was a bit bizarre in the context of the buzz that was generated by the Eagles originally signing him in March 2023. He was their first external free agent signing last offseason! We had a great Jonny Page article titled \"Eagles All-22 Film Review: Rashaad Penny is one of the most talented running backs in the NFL\"! As evidenced by a poll conducted here at Bleeding Green Nation, there was legitimate thought (including from yours truly) he could be the Eagles' leading rusher!\n\nThe Eagles clearly didn't love what they saw from Penny in offseason practices; he didn't see much run with the first team unit. D'Andre Swift and Kenny Gainwell were regularly ahead of him.\n\nThough Penny failed to majorly stand out, I don't think he looked bad. I actually thought he flashed more than Gainwell did in training camp.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how Penny fares in Carolina, where he's reunited with former Seattle Seahawks assistant and current Panthers head coach Dave Canales. Maybe he's truly cooked and the Eagles were right to not use him more often. Or maybe there's something to the same Eagles coaching staff that tried to make Gainwell their lead back (see: 18 touches for him in Week 1 to just two for Swift) not having the best read on their own running back room?\n\nPenny is the second former Eagles running back to sign with the Panthers since last offseason. He joins Miles Sanders there, though there seems to be speculation Sanders could be traded. The Panthers were the first team to select a running back in the 2024 NFL Draft by taking Jonathon Brooks at No. 46 overall.

The Panthers are likely to trade or release halfbacks Miles Sanders & Chuba Hubbard to streamline their RB depth chart.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers were once a perennial threat for the NFC South crown. Now, they're the punching bag of the division.\n\nA year ago, they mortgaged their future to trade up for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. They chose to select Bryce Young with that pick, which immediately proved to be disastrous as C.J. Stroud had a historic rookie season with the Houston Texans and Frank Reich was fired 11 games into his Panthers tenure.\n\nThe team is attempting to reset this offseason. They hired a new head coach in Dave Canales, and they've made a number of additions to the roster, including wide receiver Diontae Johnson and edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney. They also had a solid draft class, which included the team trading back into the first round for wide receiver Xavier Legette.\n\nThat draft class also included Texas running back Jonathan Brooks in the second round. The former Longhorn rushed for 1,139 yards on 187 attempts last season, good for an astonishing 6.1 yards per carry. For all intents and purposes, he appears to be the favorite to fill the Rachaad White, three-down role in Canales' offense.\n\nHowever, the team has added yet another halfback to their backfield rotation, bringing in Rashaad Penny on a one-year deal, per ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.\n\nPenny's best season came in 2021 with the Seattle Seahawks, when Canales was the passing game coordinator and new Carolina offensive coordinator Brad Idzik was an offensive assistant. It makes sense that the team would want an experienced runner as a backup to the rookie Brooks (who is recovering from an ACL tear), but the running back room in Carolina may be untenable as currently constructed.\n\nRelated What Jonathon Brooks Brings To the Panthers' Offense The Panthers added a new weapon to their offense, grabbing Jonathon Brooks in the second round. Here's how he'll fit on their offense. Panthers Have 5 Running Backs With Starting Experience Besides Brooks & Penny, the Panthers' RB depth chart is loaded with capable veterans\n\nPenny carried the ball 119 times for 749 yards and six touchdowns during that 2021 season under Canales, though that campaign remains the only one in which the former first-round pick has garnered 100+ rushes.\n\nIn some sense, that means Penny is far fresher than other 28-year-old running backs with multiple 300+ touch seasons on their resum\u00e9. However, Penny's limited usage has always stemmed from his inability to stay on the field, rather than any lapses in his talent.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: Since entering the NFL in 2018, Penny has sustained eight injuries that have caused him to miss a preseason, regular season or postseason game, including two season-ending lower body injuries in 2019 (torn ACL) and 2022 (tibia fracture).\n\nHe played last season for the Philadelphia Eagles after Canales left for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but he appeared in just three games before being benched due to ineffectiveness (11 rushes, 33 yards).\n\nBrooks is coming off surgery to repair a torn ACL that he suffered last season at Texas. It is expected that he'll be medically cleared in time for training camp, but it never hurts to have a veteran option behind a rookie who's learning the pro game.\n\nSpeaking of veteran options, the Panthers are loaded with them now. Besides Brooks and Penny, the team employs Miles Sanders, Chuba Hubbard, and Raheem Blackshear, all of whom have started a game in the Panthers' backfield over the last two seasons.\n\nPanthers' 2024 RB Depth Chart\n\nPlayer\n\nAge\n\nCareer Starts (NFL)\n\nJonathon Brooks\n\n20\n\n0\n\nRashaad Penny\n\n28\n\n11\n\nMiles Sanders\n\n27\n\n54\n\nChuba Hubbard\n\n24\n\n24\n\nRaheem Blackshear\n\n24\n\n1\n\nIt's likely that the team will look to trade at least Sanders, who is entering the second year of a four-year, $25.4 million deal he signed as a free agent last offseason. Hubbard may also be a popular name on the trade block in the coming weeks, given that he'll be a free agent next offseason and was drafted in the fourth-round under a regime that's long been ousted from Carolina.\n\nRegardless of how the Panthers solve the conundrum at the back-end of their RB depth chart, expect the team to divvy up carries between Brooks and Penny for the lion's share of the work early in the season. If and when Brooks proves his health, he'll likely be tasked with a heavy workload as the team tries to coax big improvements out of quarterback Bryce Young in his sophomore season.\n\nSource: Jeremy

Penny played last season with the Philadelphia Eagles in a limited role -- playing only three games and notching 11 carries -- and spent the previous five seasons with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nRookie minicamp, the first organized team activities that includes the Panthers' draft picks and undrafted free agents, begins Friday.\n\nPenny's best season in Seattle came in 2021, when Canales was passing game coordinator and current Panthers offensive coordinator Brad Idzik was an offensive assistant, as well. The 28-year-old Penny took 119 carries for 749 yards and six touchdowns in 10 games played that year. Since then, though, he's only played in eight games -- five of which came in 2022 with Seattle, before a broken fibula in Week 5 sullied his stint there.\n\nPenny is expected to join a room that's already a bit crowded. The running back room as it's set up now includes three players in whom the Panthers invested heavily last year, and one the Panthers drafted a few weeks ago.\n\nThose players:\n\n\u25aa Chuba Hubbard. The Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, native earned the starting running back spot early on last year and is expected to be the starter again in 2024. Last year's breakout came by virtue of the fact that Hubbard was healthy for the first time in his career -- after undergoing double abductor surgery and meniscus surgery not many knew about early on in his NFL life. As a result he put up career numbers: 238 carries for 902 yards and five touchdowns on the ground, adding 233 yards receiving. The former fourth-round draft pick out of Oklahoma State is entering his final year under contract with the Panthers.\n\n\u25aa Miles Sanders. The 1,000-yard running back from 2022 in Philadelphia didn't have a great 2023. After starting the first few games, Hubbard took his spot as primary ball-carrier by Week 4, and Sanders finished the season with 432 yards on 129 carries and one touchdown. The former Penn State star signed a four-year, $25 million deal before 2022 -- one of the most lucrative deals on the sparse running back market -- meaning a trade out of Carolina seems unlikely. Adding to that unlikelihood? General manager Dan Morgan, when asked about it post-draft, told reporters that \"we love Miles\" and that \"we see a big role for him\" and that \"he can do a lot for our offense.\"\n\n\u25aa Jonathon Brooks. The Panthers took Brooks in the second round of this year's draft and feel confident that they have the best running back in the class. Brooks, fresh out of Texas, had a remarkable season cut a few games short after tearing his ACL. It was a clean tear, Brooks said, which leads to a less complicated recovery, and he said after the draft he expects to be fully healthy by training camp. The hefty investment in Brooks -- particularly when the Panthers had so many other offensive holes to fill -- drew questions about the room's size immediately, to which Canales replied that Brooks is versatile and that the Panthers will be stubborn about running the ball and plan to use several backs during the season.\n\n\u25aa Raheem Blackshear. Let's not forget Blackshear, who was not only a reliable back in 2023 on an offense that lacked explosiveness but was also one of the best kick returners in the league. Blackshear was second in average yards on kick returns among all returners who had 11 returns or more in 2023 at 26.9 yards; Velus Jones Jr. of the Bears sat right ahead of him at 27.2 yards per return. And with a new kickoff rule adding to the importance of the position and the phase of the game, it's logical to think Blackshear's value went up this offseason.\n\nA few weeks ago, Canales said he was \"fired up\" about running backs Carolina already had. A few weeks after the draft, it appears he's still looking for more.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Beginning March 11 through March 13 teams could enter into a legal negotiation with players who will become unrestricted free agents.\n\nIn addition to NFL free agency, the new year also marked the beginning of all trades being made official by the league office. April 19 marked the deadline to sign restricted free agents to offer sheets. On April 24, the deadline for teams to match restricted free agent offers sheets hit. Following the restricted free agent deadline followed the 2024 NFL Draft, which ran from April 25-27.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_chavanelle@on3.com", "name": "Nikki Chavanelle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashaad_Penny", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rashaad Penny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_State_Aztecs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego State Aztecs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2023/01/27190733/carolina-panthers-helmet.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543356", "eventUri": "eng-9543356", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-11", "dateEnd": "2024-03-13", "textStart": 875, "textEnd": 900}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "dateEnd": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 1379, "textEnd": 1390}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-13", "textStart": 589, "textEnd": 597}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-20", "textStart": 821, "textEnd": 828}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-05", "textStart": 856, "textEnd": 863}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 1127, "textEnd": 1135}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 1207, "textEnd": 1215}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Penny saw action in just three games all season and had just 11 carries for 33 yards.\n\nSwift was a Pro Bowler in 2023, his only season with the Eagles, and remained healthy. He played in 16 of 17 games. Gainwell also played in 16 of 17 and Scott played in 15 of 17. So there just wasn't much work left for Penny, who seemed to be a break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option for the Eagles.\n\nIn 2024, the Eagles will be relying heavily on free agent pickup Saquon Barkley. The former No. 2 overall pick signed a three-year, $37.75 million deal to join the Eagles in March. He'll obviously be the top running back and will take a huge portion of the touches in that room.\n\nAfter Barkley, the Eagles have Gainwell under contract for one more season and just drafted Clemson running back Will Shipley in the fourth-round. There's a chance they keep just three backs on the 53-man roster but if they keep a fourth, the other options are Tyrion Davis-Price, Kendall Milton and Lew Nichols.\n\nIn Carolina, Penny will join a backfield that includes second-round pick Jonathan Brooks, former Eagles running back Miles Sanders and former fourth-rounder Chuba Hubbard.\n\nPanthers head coach Dave Canales was on staff in Seattle for all five of Penny's seasons with the Seahawks.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashaad_Penny", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rashaad Penny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Philadelphia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Philadelphia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saquon_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saquon Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrion_Davis-Price", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrion Davis-Price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Shipley", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Shipley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuba_Hubbard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuba Hubbard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miles Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clemson Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aF332E6A.wU4LddNjdvEcg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnphilly.com/79ad330a31bc897caba6d75e261619fb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543356", "eventUri": "eng-9543356", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

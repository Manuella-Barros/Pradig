{"id": 243322060, "title": "Double amputee who was injured in train accident loses mobility car", "text": "Tariq (right) was left with life-changing injuries following the train accident (Picture: Tariq Hussain) A man who had his leg and fingers cut off by a freight train has lost his mobility car he relied on to live independently. Tariq Hussain, from Slough, miraculously survived a catastrophic train accident in his early 20s that cost him limbs and put him in a coma for almost a month. He was crushed under a heavy train carrying bricks after he fell off the platform at Reading station at 3am, dragging the young man for a third of a mile before it was able to stop. Tariq, now 44, has been able to focus on his job as a customer service adviser, take his teenage son to practice, and coach kids\u2019 football thanks to his adjusted car making it possible for him to drive with one leg Tariq (first left) says he feels for the first time his independent life is threatened after losing his car (Picture: Tariq Hussain) With his body breaking down, Tariq decided to apply for extra care allowance to pay his mum for cleaning help as he can\u2019t reach certain places and has to top around to hoover. And basic tasks such as cooking, cleaning and even buttoning up a shirt are difficult and take a toll on his body as he uses crutches most of the time. But now the dad-of-one has lost the car after a change to his benefits. Walking on crutches and being on the move as a \u2018one legged football coach\u2019 for a years means Tariq\u2019s wrist and knee are \u2018shot through\u2019 with terrible pain, he explained. What is left of his other hand (Picture: Tariq Hussain) However, his bid for enhanced mobility rate was refused by an independent tribunal when he appealed a decision by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). While he now receives more money directly after the benefits change, he no longer qualifies for the car provided by Motability, an independent charity. Previously, money for the car was paid directly to the charity from his previous benefit, meaning for years Tariq didn\u2019t see a penny on his account but he got a suitable car. Despite having more cash now, the standard amount is not enough to pay for an adjusted car on his own, meaning he is facing an uncertain future relying on others. He told Metro.co.uk: \u2018It\u2019s barbaric. I\u2019ve made that point at the tribunal. It\u2019s also for those who can\u2019t fight like I can.\u2019 Tariq\u2019s life evolves around his job, family, and coaching kids\u2019 football (Picture: Tariq Hussain) He praised Motability for being \u2018bloody amazing.\u2019 Since they were stopped being paid last August, the charity still kept providing him with an almost brand-new car. \u2018They said a couple of weeks ago they need it back, and I said I can\u2019t argue with that. Nine months, not having been paid. I gave it back, but it makes you feel really disabled,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve always had very independent way of living. \u2018I\u2019ve been really good for the town. I don\u2019t just sit by, I\u2019m a full time worker, I\u2019ve always paid my National Insurance, I\u2019ve coached children, I\u2019ve mentored newly disabled, I\u2019ve had a family, and this is the first time this feels very threatened.\u2019 Tariq balancing while doing DIY work (Picture: Tariq Hussain) After the devastating news at the beginning of June, his friend set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to help him buy an adapted car of his own. The life-changing train accident Tariq said doesn\u2019t remember what happened, but he was told his leg was amputated at the scene just below the hip and he had \u2018degloved\u2019 both of his arms and wrists. On his left hand, surgeons managed to reconstruct what was left into one finger-like shape along with his thumb, while on his right hand the wrist does not move. He said: \u2018I was 21, it was entirely my fault and I fell of the station. I was drunk. I don\u2019t blame anyone else. His right hand was also degloved up to the arm, and his wrist barely moves now (Picture: Tariq Hussain) \u2018The recovery was not as difficult as you might think. I was very angry for a few years, angry at myself. How stupid was this.\u2019 Despite the horrific incident, Tariq has managed to \u2018half of my life with the injuries\u2019 and been able to cope, work full-time and start a family. While he has been able to adjust mentally and physically, including driving, he said the phantom pains \u2018can be really, really bad.\u2019 Tariq said all he has done this week is to \u2018ask for lifts.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve taken a week off because I\u2019ve been really upset. I\u2019m going back to work but the first thing I\u2019ve had to do is ask for lifts. Tariq has not been able to see his son as much after losing the car (Picture: Tariq Hussain) \u2018My boy lives across the town, and I\u2019ve not been able to see his as much. \u2018I\u2019ve only got a couple of really important things in my life \u2013 my family, job, football, and I can\u2019t do any of those without it.\u2019 While is work is located a less than a mile away from his home, hopping on crutches on an uneven and wet surfaces can be dangerous. \u2018In the meantime, when my wrist goes, and it goes, I\u2019ll be back in hospital, which will cost way more than that.\u2019 \u2018There is something inherently wrong with the system here. Somebody\u2019s got to take a look at how it works.\u2019 He said the decision to not award him the enhanced mobility element that qualifies him for the car is \u2018so daft.\u2019 \u2018They are going to make my disability worse, which means I\u2019m going to rely more on the NHS, whereas now I can be a positive force.\u2019 While Tariq was in a position of getting support from his work and family, he said he was worried for those with a disability who struggled mentally, who could not defend themselves.

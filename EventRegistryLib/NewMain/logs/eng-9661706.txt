He reportedly told officials that he heard her speaking with the two men at the gas station before they hung up.\n\nChristian Goffney, who works at the 7-Eleven off Rankin and Kuykendahl, said he just got off his shift when he noticed Jocelyn hiding behind a nearby storage unit around 11:30 p.m. He noticed police in the area but did not think anything was wrong.\n\nJune 17, 2024\n\nAround 12:17 a.m., surveillance photos show Jocelyn at the 7-Eleven convenience store. In these images, investigators saw two persons of interest they would like to question in connection to the girl's death.\n\nAround 3 a.m., Alexis said Jocelyn's cat was \"going crazy\" but thought the cat was with her daughter since she sleeps with her pet at night.\n\nA woman said she drove past the creek near 400 West Rankin Road saw a body and immediately called 911 around 6:15 a.m.\n\nWoman describes moment she discovered 12-year-old girl's body in N. Houston creek\n\nThe Houston Police Department Dive Team responded and recovered the body.\n\nAt the same time, Alexis woke up around 6 a.m. and started her normal routine to wake up her 5-year-old son and Jocelyn. This is when she noticed Jocelyn was missing.\n\nShe said she looked everywhere around the house, walked around their apartment complex and then got into her car. Alexis reportedly pinged her daughter's cell phone location, which traced back to the creek where she ran and saw police officers canvassing in the area.\n\nShe said she told officers that her daughter was missing, and it wasn't until an hour later she received a call that it was possibly Jocelyn.\n\n'Smart and sweet': Family shares memories of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray after she was found dead in Houston creek\n\nAt 5:30 p.m., a news conference was held by the Houston Police Department to alert the media and community about a body being found in a creek. Houston Mayor John Whitmire joined police officers to discuss the discovery of the young girl's body being recovered.\n\nInvestigators said foul play was involved in her death and searching for those involved.\n\nJune 18, 2024\n\nDuring a Houston City Council meeting around noon, Mayor Whitmire gave more details about the case, stating that the boyfriend of the 12-year-old girl was talking with two adults before she was killed.\n\n\"It appears that he last talked to her at a convenience store around midnight, heard her talking to two grown-ups,\" he said that Tuesday.\n\nA source told KPRC 2 the 7/11 off Rankin and Kuykendahl had surveillance of the girl inside the store. Christian Goffney, who works at the store, told KPRC 2 reporter Corley Peel that he would see the 12-year-old girl at the 7/11 on a regular basis.\n\nNew clues in the case of 12-year-old girl found dead in north Houston creek\n\nAt 8:14 p.m., Houston police announced that the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences ruled that the 12-year-old died from strangulation. Police also released several surveillance photos from the 7-Eleven convenience store of two persons of interest they would like to question in connection to the girl's death.\n\n'Like a bad dream': Police say 12-year-old found dead in N. Houston creek was strangled, seek 2 persons of interest\n\nInvestigators told KPRC 2's Bryce Newberry the two men were the last to be seen with the girl and they don't believe they ever left the area. The men did not arrive at the store with the girl, investigators said, but instead initially crossed paths there.\n\nThe family asked for help in getting the perpetrators off the streets.\n\nJune 19, 2024\n\nHarris County medical examiners confirmed the girl's identity as 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray.\n\nA source gave KPRC 2 reporter Corley Peel new surveillance photos of Jocelyn at the convenience store around 12:17 a.m. on June 17. In the video, she reportedly came back to the store where she and the man in the white hat were at the door around 12:58 a.m.\n\nThe family set up a GoFundMe for a tribute to Jocelyn. They also told us that they are planning a memorial for her, and they'll let us know when an official date is set.\n\nAround 5 p.m., The mother of 12-year-old Jocelyn, Alexis Nungaray, talked about her loss for the first time since she learned about her daughter's murder.\n\n'They took away my first born': Mother shares heartfelt plea for answers after 12-year-old daughter found strangled\n\nTears streamed down Alexis' face as she spoke with KPRC 2 reporter Corley Peel about her daughter.\n\nAlexis described her first-born daughter as \"goofy\" and said she had her own \"little spunk.\"\n\nShe also said Jocelyn never followed the crowd. \"She always stood up for what was right,\" said Alexis.\n\nThe heartbroken mom said she feels like she's in an alternative universe where she is living this ongoing nightmare that doesn't stop.\n\nAlexis said she knows her daughter fought hard and was a fighter, repeating that, \"she needs justice, she didn't deserve this.\"\n\nShe said she and Jocelyn have gone through a lot these past few months with her mental health.\n\nAlexis hopes that someone comes forward and hopes the universe gives her daughter's killers \"what they deserve.\"\n\nJune 20, 2024\n\nSources tipped KPRC 2 that two men, considered persons of interest, were captured by police. The unidentified men were also last seen on surveillance videos with Jocelyn hours before her death.\n\nKPRC 2 reporter Re'Chelle Turner and photojournalist Roger Franco were at the scene in north Houston, where there was heavy law enforcement presence at an apartment complex on Northborough Drive in north Houston near where Jocelyn's body was found.\n\nPersons of interest linked to Jocelyn Nungaray's murder in north Houston detained by police\n\nOur cameras were the only ones present at the scene and captured the moment when both men were placed in handcuffs and put in the back of police cruisers.\n\nSources also corroborated and confirmed to KPRC 2 Investigates Mario Diaz what we saw at the scene. Minutes after KPRC 2 Investigates reached out to HPD Chief Larry Satterwhite for confirmation regarding what we uncovered, HPD put out a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, the two are being detained but did not disclose any additional details.\n\nHPD confirmed they would be holding a press conference to share more details at 2 p.m.\n\nAnyone with information on the identities of the two persons of interest or in this case is urged to contact the HPD Homicide Division at 713-308-3600 or speak anonymously with Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS.", "source": {"uri": "click2houston.com",

Stephen Hope said at a press conference on Monday.\n\nDive teams recovered the victim, who Hope only identified as a 12-year-old girl. Hope said the Harris County Medical Examiner's Office is completing an autopsy to determine the circumstances surrounding the girl's death.\n\nAccording to Hope, investigators believe the girl snuck out of her home at a nearby apartment complex sometime after 10 p.m. Sunday, June 16, before being found in the shallow water.\n\n\"We have reason to believe that the family did not know she was leaving the house,\" Lt. Hope said.\n\nHe clarified that the area where her body was found was within walking distance from her house, leading investigators to suspect foul play. Hope declined to share whether police believe she was killed prior to being found in the water, saying he's unable to speculate without the medical examiner's full report.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

'Smart and sweet': Family shares memories of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray after she was found dead in Houston creek\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nEarly Thursday morning, sources tipped KPRC 2 that two men, considered persons of interest, were captured by police. The unidentified men were also last seen on surveillance videos with Jocelyn hours before her death.\n\nKPRC 2 reporter Re'Chelle Turner and photojournalist Roger Franco were at the scene in north Houston, where there was heavy law enforcement presence at the apartment complex where Jocelyn lived.\n\nOur cameras were the only ones present at the scene and captured the moment when both men were placed in handcuffs and put in the back of police cars.\n\nSources also corroborated and confirmed to KPRC 2 Investigates Mario Diaz what we saw at the scene. Minutes after KPRC 2 Investigates reached out to HPD Chief Larry Satterwhite for confirmation regarding what we uncovered, HPD put out a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, the two are being detained but did not share any additional details.\n\nWe've also learned City Hall is monitoring the developments surrounding this case throughout the morning.\n\nThe news comes a day after Jocelyn's mother, Alexis Nungary, spoke for the first time about her loss since learning about her daughter's murder. Tears streamed down her face as she spoke with KPRC 2 reporter Corley Peel about her 12-year-old daughter, Jocelyn.\n\nMORE: 'They took away my first born': Mother shares heartfelt plea for answers after 12-year-old daughter found strangled\n\nThe heartbroken mom said she felt like she was in a living, ongoing nightmare that didn't stop.\n\n\"It's like it's not real,\" Mrs. Nungary said. \"I keep hearing everything and everybody tells me everything, and I hear it and it's not registering.\"\n\nThe last time Mrs. Nungary said she saw her daughter alive was Sunday night before they went to bed around 10 p.m. Her last words to Jocelyn were to not stay up late and that she was coming with her mother to work the next day. However, Houston PD said Jocelyn snuck out of the family's apartment off Rankin Rd. sometime between 10 p.m. - 12 a.m.\n\nAround 6 a.m. Monday, a woman said she called 911 to report the child's body in the water. The Houston Police Department Dive Team responded and recovered her body. The Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences ruled the 12-year-old died from strangulation on Tuesday. Medical examiners confirmed the next day that the body was identified as Jocelyn's.\n\nRELATED: Medical examiner releases identity of 12-year-old girl found strangled in Houston creek\n\nPolice also released surveillance photos Tuesday from the 7-Eleven convenience store where the girl was last seen. In these images, investigators saw two persons of interest they would like to question in connection to the girl's death.\n\nInvestigators told KPRC 2 reporter Bryce Newberry the two men were the last to be seen with the girl, and they seemed to have first encountered her at the store.\n\nOn Wednesday, a source gave KPRC 2 reporter Corley Peel new surveillance photos of Jocelyn at the convenience store around 12:17 a.m. Monday.\n\nMrs. Nungaray said she has no clue who those men were in the surveillance photos but suspected that they are Hispanic men, possibly who live in their apartment complex or walked from the skate park.\n\n\"I want karma to hit them,\" she said. \"I'm angry. They took advantage of her. She's so young. She's 12. I want justice. I want them to come forward. I want whoever has seen them to please call police. They took my baby away.\"\n\nThis is a developing story and will continue to be updated as more information becomes available.\n\nRELATED LINKS:'Like a bad dream': Police say 12-year-old found dead in N.

Her mother last saw her when she went to bed, according to police.\n\nABC13 obtained surveillance camera images that appear to show Jocelyn's last moments alive.\n\nOn Wednesday, ABC13 spoke to Jocelyn's grandmother, who told us, \"We really want justice for her. We are asking for everyone's help.\"\n\nShe describes her as an incredibly kind and loving girl. The family recently came back from their annual vacation at Garner State Park.\n\nLater in the day, ABC13 spoke to the girl's mother.\n\n\"She's meant to be here. She's supposed to be here,\" Alexis Nungaray said. \"She had aspirations for life. She loved everyone, was so kind. Greatest friend. Very goofy.\"\n\nAlexis Nungaray doesn't believe her daughter knew the men caught on surveillance camera.\n\n\"She's not one to be aggressive and be like, 'Stop talking to me,'\" she said. \"She is very shy and quiet and keeps to herself.

I parked right here and called 911 immediately.'\n\nHer grieving mother, Alexis Nungaray, is now struggling to process what had happened.\n\n'It's like it's not real,' she told Click2Houston. 'I keep hearing everything, and everybody tell me everything, and I hear it and it's not registering.'\n\nShe recalled telling her daughter on Sunday not to stay up too late, as she was joining her at work the next day. Those would be the last words she ever spoke to her daughter.\n\nBy 3am on Monday, Alexis said she noticed Jocelyn's cat was 'going crazy,' but assumed the cat was with her daughter, who always slept with her pet at night.\n\nIt wasn't until she woke up at 6am and started her normal routine to wake up her five-year-old son and Jocelyn that she noticed her daughter was missing.\n\nEarlier this week police in Houston issued a notice saying the two men were both persons of interest in the case. Neither has been identified or arrested\n\nNungaray began searching frantically around the house and apartment complex for her daughter before pinging her cellphone which traced it back to the creek.\n\nHer mom is now seeking justice for her young daughter, and added that she does not believe she knows the two men seen with Jocelyn at the convenience store.\n\nShe said she suspects they either live in the apartment complex or may have walked to the store from a nearby state park.\n\n'I want karma to hit them, I'm angry,' Alexis told Click2Houston. 'They took advantage of her. She's so young, she's 12.\n\n'I want justice,' she continued. 'I want whoever has seen them to please call police. They took my baby away.'\n\nAlexis also said that she does not know why Jocelyn snuck out of the house, though she noted that she has struggled in recent months with her mental health.\n\n'I don't know why, what possessed her to walk around late at night in this area out of all places,' Alexis said.\n\nBillie Jackson said she noticed Jocelyn's body in the creek on her way home from dropping her husband off at work Monday morning\n\n'I always told her to never leave the house, never leave unattended, always be safe.\n\n'There's people around here that are crazy.

In one photo, they are walking into a convenience store. In the other, they're in a parking lot.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Houston police released separate surveillance photos of the same man and a second man. HPD described the persons of interest as \"two males of an unknown age, wearing baseball-style caps.\"\n\nEarlier, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Jocelyn was at a convenience store when she spoke with her 13-year-old boyfriend on the phone after she snuck out of her family's apartment late Sunday. The boyfriend told police that he could hear Jocelyn talking with two grown-ups.\n\nHours later, Jocelyn was found in shallow water below a bridge on West Rankin Road near I-45. She'd been strangled and Whitmire said she was also raped.\n\nIf you recognize either man or have any other information about this case, you're asked to call Houston police at 713-308-3600 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 713-222-TIPS.

Her absence from that meeting was highlighted during a meeting to discuss what had been a completed investigation. However, after the revelation, Internal Affairs was required to open the investigation again.\n\nWhen KPRC 2 Investigates asked interim chief Larry Satterwhite about Hatcher's status and the allegations over her actions he did not hold back, \"I think we have to wait and see how she explains that,\" said Satterwhite.\n\nHowever, it's been over a month since Chief Satterwhite made those comments.

Alexis then got into her car and used her daughter's cellphone to try to locate her.\n\nThe phone's signal led her to a creek where police were already conducting an investigation.\n\nRaped and Murdered\n\nEarlier that morning, Billie Jackson was driving home after dropping her husband off at work when she discovered Jocelyn's body in a shallow creek. \"I drove past, and when I looked up the creek, I thought it was a mannequin,\" Jackson told ABC 13.\n\n\"I did a U-turn, and I stopped on the bridge, put my flashers on, looked down and realized it was someone. I parked right here and called 911,\" she said.\n\nAlexis now seeks justice for her young daughter. She said that she does not recognize the two men Jocelyn was seen with at the convenience store, whom the Houston Police Department has labeled as 'persons of interest in the case.'\n\nHowever, Alexis suspects they either live in the apartment complex or walked to the store from a nearby state park.\n\n\"I want karma to hit them, I'm angry,\" Alexis told Click2Houston. \"They took advantage of her. She's so young, she's 12. I want justice,\" she said.\n\n\"I want whoever has seen them to please call police. They took my baby away.\"\n\nAlexis also mentioned that she is unsure why Jocelyn sneaked out of the house, although she acknowledged that her daughter had been dealing with mental health challenges in recent months.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_ghosh@ibtimes.sg", "name": "R.

I thought it was a mannequin,\" said Jackson.\n\nSEE OUR FIRST REPORT: New clues in the case of 12-year-old girl found dead in north Houston creek\n\nJackson told KPRC 2 Reporter Corley Peel she immediately called 911 around 6:15 am. She learned the 12-year-old girl she found was murdered.\n\n\"How can somebody do this? How can somebody leave someone lying there? It's not something you expect to see anywhere,\" Jackson said.\n\nMayor John Whitmire spoke during City Council Tuesday, sharing how the devastating timeline began.\n\n\"Her mother last saw her daughter at 10:00 pm when she put everybody to bed. Sometime between 10 p.m. and 12 a.m. she left,\" Whitmire said.\n\nHPD said the girl snuck out of her apartment off Rankin Road. At some point, she spoke with her 13-year-old boyfriend on the phone.\n\n\"It appears that he last talked to her at a convenience store around midnight. He heard her talking to two grown-ups,\" Whitmire said.\n\nA source tells KPRC 2 the 7/11 off Rankin and Kuykendahl has surveillance of the girl inside the store.\n\nChristian Goffney works at the store. He told Corley he sees the 12-year-old girl at the 7/11 on a regular basis. He said he just got off his shift when he noticed her hiding behind a nearby storage unit around 11:30 pm. He noticed police in the area but did not think anything was wrong.\n\n\"I can't forget that I saw her moments before she died. Waiting on my Uber.

On Wednesday, a source gave KPRC 2 reporter Corley Peel new surveillance photos of Jocelyn at the convenience store around 12:17 a.m. Monday.\n\nAlexis said she has no clue who those men were in the surveillance photos and suspects that they are Hispanic males, possibly who live in their apartment complex or walked from the state park.\n\n\"I want karma to hit them.

He reportedly told officials that he heard her speaking with the two men at the gas station before they hung up.\n\nAlexis said she needs to know what the boyfriend heard because her daughter has never run off with strangers and had to be fighting for her life before her death.\n\n\"She just said she was just walking around different stores,\" Jocelyn's mother said. \"I don't know why, what possessed her to walk around late at night in this area out of all places. I always told her to never leave the house, never leave unattended, always be safe -- there's people around here that are crazy. I don't think she ever thought it would face her.\"\n\nAlexis said she wouldn't wish this pain on her worse enemy and has been blown away with the amount of support they are getting.\n\n\"Somebody is going to catch them, someone's going to see them, I believe in faith, and I put it all in God, Jesus Christ that they are going to be found,\" she said.\n\nAs for why she thinks Jocelyn left home, Alexis responded, \"I believe we've all been there at some point.

'They took advantage of her.\n\n'She's so young, she's 12.\n\n'I want justice,' she continued. 'I want whoever has seen them to please call police. They took my baby away.'\n\nBillie Jackson said she noticed Jocelyn's body in the creek on her way home from dropping her husband off at work Monday morning\n\nAlexis also said that she does not know why Jocelyn snuck out of the house, though she noted that she has struggled in recent months with her mental health.\n\n'I don't know why, what possessed her to walk around late at night in this area out of all places,' Alexis said.\n\n'I always told her to never leave the house, never leave unattended, always be safe. There's people around here that are crazy.\n\n'I don't think she ever thought it would face her.'\n\nShe and other family members have described the preteen as a loving and caring child.\n\n'Jocy was a smart, loving, nurturing young lady,' her uncle Joamel told Click2Houston. 'She brightened up the room every time she came by and was loved by everyone around.\n\n'She had no reason to die that way.'\n\nAlexis also described her as the 'greatest friend' who was 'very goofy.\n\n'She had aspirations for life,' Alexis said. 'She loved everyone, was so kind.'\n\nA GoFundMe has now been set up to pay for Jocelyn's funeral.\n\n'Her family was not prepared for such a loss, and [need] help to give her daughter the memorial she deserves, to honor her memory and to say our last goodbyes,' it says.\n\nAs of Wednesday night, it had already raised more than $16,000.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strangling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Person of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Whitmire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Whitmire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPRC-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KPRC-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHOU", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KHOU"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jackson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billie Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTRK-TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KTRK-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannequin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mannequin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/20/01/86344121-0-image-m-14_1718843279161.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661706", "eventUri": "eng-9661706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

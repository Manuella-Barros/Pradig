{"id": 243342640, "title": "Robots take up dirtiest jobs in Malaysia\u2019s palm plantations crippled by labour shortage", "text": "A drone buzzes between trees on a humid Malaysian morning, monitoring the oil palm fruits as they ripen. Self-driving trucks rumble over the vast plantation\u2019s uneven ground, laying fertiliser and picking up the densely packed harvested bunches. These are just some of the robots the Southeast Asian nation\u2019s top palm growers hope will take over the sector\u2019s most difficult and dirty jobs, plugging chronic worker shortages that have disrupted supplies of the world\u2019s most-consumed edible oil. With global stockpiles set for the first back-to-back decline in more than 40 years, Malaysia has every reason to push for automation to boost production. Increased awareness of the industry\u2019s problematic reliance on migrant workers \u2013 clouded by restrictions and labour abuses \u2013 has also encouraged companies to find alternative solutions, said Mohamad Helmy Othman Basha, group managing director of SD Guthrie Bhd., a government-linked company previously known as Sime Darby Plantation. \u201cTo depend on foreign workers for all these key tasks is actually putting this industry at a very high risk,\u201d Helmy said. \u201cThis is why we have to take this plunge. We really have to place these bets.\u201d Perfecting the robots and deploying them at a commercially viable scale will take years, even as firms pour millions into developing such technology and retraining their staff to use it. But producers are pressing ahead. The plantation workforce in Malaysia \u2013 the world\u2019s No 2 palm oil producer \u2013 was hollowed out during the pandemic, when border restrictions meant companies could not bring in the foreign workers they so heavily rely on. It was the country\u2019s worst-ever worker shortage and palm oil production plummeted, pushing prices to record highs. The industry lost billions. SD Guthrie learned its lesson. Where possible, the firm has started using machines to take over non-harvesting jobs like spraying pesticide or monitoring fruit and yields. Where the industry average is currently for one worker to maintain 8-10 hectares of land, the company wants to boost that to about 17 hectares per worker with the aid of automation. The company\u2019s investment into robots is set to reach 100 million ringgit (US$21.2 million) \u2013 or about half its research and development budget \u2013 by year-end and it \u201cwill spend whatever is required to find a solution,\u201d according to Helmy. Nearly 30 per cent of its annual R&D budget will be spent on this initiative in the next three to four years. The robots aren\u2019t fully autonomous yet, meaning there is still a need for skilled workers to control and manoeuvre them. Plus, trickier tasks remain in the hands of humans \u2013 like safely cutting down ripe fruit bunches from trees that can be as tall as six-story buildings. But the technological advances have already opened up an avenue for women to join a traditionally male-dominated workforce. Sri Norhidayu Kussain, a 41-year-old woman, says the robots help with back-breaking tasks like lifting 30-kg (66-pound) fruit bunches and loading them into trucks. \u201cThe work is now easier because these machines have successfully reduced the need for physical labour. It\u2019s no longer like before when only men could do these type of jobs,\u201d said Norhidayu, who operates a pesticide-spraying vehicle that can do the job of six workers at SD Guthrie\u2019s Sungai Linau estate in Malaysia\u2019s central state of Selangor. Women make up 3 per cent of the company\u2019s roughly 700 machine operators and Helmy says the company is trying to attract more. Labour shortfalls have long been a headache for Malaysian businesses, partially because of strict immigration rules targeting low-skilled workers that in turn have encouraged trafficking and left thousands of undocumented workers without legal protection. International scrutiny of labour abuses has pushed the country to reduce its reliance across several industries including manufacturing, construction and plantations. SD Guthrie itself faced allegations of forced labour that resulted in a two-year US ban on imports of its products in 2020 \u2013 something that Helmy said urged the firm to explore automation. \u201cAutomation, if rolled out strategically will not hurt workers\u2019 livelihoods,\u201d said Adrian Pereira, executive director at the North South Initiative, a Malaysia-based non-governmental organisation focused on social justice. \u201cWe really hope government-linked companies will take the lead and demonstrate that this sector can be free of forced labour soon.\u201d SD Guthrie is the first plantation company in the country to set up a research facility dedicated to developing robots. Other palm giants like Golden Agri-Resources Ltd. and IOI Corp Bhd. have also invested in mechanisation and artificial intelligence to help harvest the oil used in everything from chocolate to soaps and fuel. A plantation run entirely by robots will not be a reality soon. Technical issues like getting the robots to self-navigate through hilly terrain or correctly identify ripe fruit bunches, have held back past automation initiatives. This is in stark contrast to crops like soybeans or rapeseed \u2013 waist-high row crops grown on flat fields \u2013 where farmers can tend to hundreds of hectares with tractors and giant harvesting machines. But speaking amid whirring and beeping prototypes at the company\u2019s robotics lab in Selangor, the firm\u2019s Chief Digital Officer Aditya Tuli said change was here to stay. \u201cOnce we start mechanising, we do imagine that there will be an increase or a positive impact to production numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are chasing that.\u201d", "summary": "Automation has also opened up an avenue for women to join a traditionally male-dominated workforce and reduced the need for physical labour.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3268559/robots-take-dirtiest-jobs-malaysias-palm-plantations-crippled-labour-shortage", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/29/0f0a6263-aa2e-4963-a42e-b6d5295f4fd9_b22c0925.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:32:07", "author": "Bloomberg", "authors": ["Bloomberg"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.138}

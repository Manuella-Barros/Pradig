Premier David Eby mused about an audit of the North Shore sewage treatment plant costs, Metro Vancouver's chair George Harvie has announced the problem-plagued project will be independently reviewed.\n\nHarvie made the announcement in a press release Tuesday afternoon, stating the review is in response to concerns being voiced about \"whether Metro Vancouver is managing costs effectively for the public.\"\n\nIn March, it was revealed that the cost estimates for construction of the North Shore Wastewater Treatment Plant, originally budgeted at $600,000, had ballooned to $3.86 billion.\n\n\"We at the Metro Vancouver Board are acutely aware of the concerns around how the updated costs to deliver the North Shore Wastewater Treatment Plant Program will impact residents of this region,\" said Harvie in the press statement.\n\nHarvie added that Metro Vancouver has had an internal task force investigate the issue, along with three separate cost estimates and an external expert panel that reviewed the process. But those reviews have all taken place behind closed doors and failed to satisfy many politicians or taxpayers - particularly those on the North Shore who are facing a sewage bill of an extra $590 a year for the next 30 years.\n\nMetro Vancouver CAO Jerry Dobrovolny, who has also come under fire for the runaway project costs, added in the statement that he \"welcomed\" the independent review.\n\nNeither Harvie nor Dobrovolny were available to answer questions on Tuesday.\n\nThe review comes just a day after B.C. Premier David Eby said it's time for Metro Vancouver \"to hire an auditor, independent of them, to dig into this and provide a report to everybody\" about how costs of the project got so out of control.\n\n\"I've expressed the province's concern a few times now about resolving what drove the cost overruns in the North Shore plant,\" Eby said, during a stop in North Vancouver, adding the buck stops with Metro Vancouver's elected officials. \"They're going to have to explain to the people who voted them in how this could be happening,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it will be very helpful for us to have an independent eye on what's driven the cost overruns on that particular project, to know what additional steps are required to ensure accountability ...\"\n\nThe decision to mount an independent review also comes amid growing call for an external audit. Last week a group of Lower Mainland councillors called on B.C.'s auditor general to investigate.\n\nDistrict of North Vancouver Coun. Catherine Pope was one of the first politicians to call for an audit of the project, saying she thinks taxpayers on the North Shore deserve to know what happened.\n\n\"I want to know why it took three years for Metro to determine there were serious problems with this project,\" she said shortly after the $2.86 billion cost escalation was revealed. \"We need to know as taxpayers what went wrong and why.\"\n\nPope said Tuesday she was encouraged by the announcement of a review.\n\n\"People deserve accountability,\" she said.\n\nPope said North Shore taxpayers are justifiably upset that they're being saddled with the lion's share of a $2.86 billion cost overrun they had nothing to do with - and which Pope said she understands includes significant legal costs.\n\n\"It's grossly unfair what the Metro board has done,\" she said.\n\nCity of North Vancouver Mayor Linda Buchanan said Monday many of the Metro board discussions around the sewage treatment plant costs have not been unanimous and have taken place behind closed doors, leading to a lack of transparency about the costs, which she has repeatedly advocated for.\n\nBuchanan told CBC Radio Tuesday that her own council has also asked for an independent review of the project.\n\n\"I share many, many of the frustrations,\" she said during the interview. \"People want to have answers.\"", "source": {"uri": "tricitynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tri-City News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Vancouver_Regional_District", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metro Vancouver Regional District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore,_New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Shore, New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Shore, New Zealand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_British_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier of British Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eby", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Eby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sewage treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harvie_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Harvie (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Mainland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lower Mainland"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Councillor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Councillor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_closed_doors_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Behind closed doors (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vancouver_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Vancouver (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Vancouver (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_overrun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cost overrun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vancouver_(district_municipality)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Vancouver (district municipality)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBC Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Reviews", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Project_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Project Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Estimating", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Estimating", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Cost_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Cost Management", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/nsnews/newsengin/2024/06/web1_sewage-plant-construction-north-van_6.jpg;w=855;h=676;mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663438", "eventUri": "eng-9663438", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

It's quite the swan song.\n\nJournalist Murray Kempton described editorial writers as the \"guys who come down from the hills after the battle to shoot the wounded.\" He meant that commentators wait until after main events have unfolded, rather than contribute during critical moments.\n\nFair enough. Point taken.\n\nWhile Harvie's overdue act might fit that description, the same might be said of the premier, who this week applied the pressure in calling for an auditor - maybe even the provincial auditor general - to examine the spending on the North Shore Wastewater Treatment Plant and provide a public report.\n\n\"If the elected officials at Metro Vancouver can't ensure taxpayer accountability for expenses being incurred there, obviously the province will have to step in,\" David Eby warned.\n\nSorry, premier, that's so three billion dollars ago.\n\nIf the plant fiasco is the kind of public spending that even a profligate spending government like this one abhors, it is worth asking: Where has it been all this time?\n\nIt could have leaned in nearly a year ago when Metro Vancouver administrators were telling North Shore officials that what was originally contracted at $550 million to construct could now cost $3.86 billion to complete.\n\nWe're pretty far down the road now, premier, with a three-decade-long funding formula that will make the North Shore even more unaffordable.\n\nNow that we're within four months of an election, there is suddenly palpable gravitas, stern warnings and promises to do something if Metro Vancouver does nothing? Too late in the game to make any difference in the score.\n\nNot that anyone in charge has been here to listen in the last week or so.\n\nHarvie, the mayor of Delta, is a lame duck on his way out at month's end. Meantime, four - count them, four - Metro Vancouver mayors were in The Netherlands last week to learn a thing or two when not attending the Sunday Ice-Breaker Event, the Tuesday Botanical Gardens Beer Tasting, the Wednesday afternoon Excursion or the Thursday Conference Dinner at the 16th Annual International Conference on Urban Drainage. North Shore property owners are going to learn a thing or two about a different kind of drainage when the treatment plant bills hit our bank accounts.\n\nThe mayors - Mike Hurley of Burnaby, Brad West of Port Coquitlam, Malcolm Brodie of Richmond and John McEwan of Anmore - were accompanied by three top Metro Vancouver officials, including chief administrative officer Jerry Dobrovolny. His 2023 pay package, disclosed last week, revealed he made more than the premier and prime minister combined, $711,000 in salary and taxable benefits.\n\nNot a good look - nor, for that matter, was a delegation comprising mayors and the people who report to them.\n\nThe posse went to Delft, a Dutch town known for its pottery that turns blue when it's heated. We can relate.\n\nA government source says there are no plans to take the role of Metro Vancouver back to the province, but no one is yet saying no - or, for that matter, yes - to the possibility of directly electing Metro Vancouver leadership instead of having it appointed by municipal councils.\n\nThe premier may want Metro Vancouver to be accountable, but unless we elect representatives, there's little likelihood that happens. As it stands, Metro Vancouver is a side hustle for 41 mayors and councillors who squeeze the regional work into their municipal schedules. The staff runs the show.\n\nImportant questions remain about the scope of the review and who conducts it. Harvie's announcement late Tuesday was designed, it seems, to just get the monkey off his back.\n\nThe more urgent question now is whether an election promise might prune the North Shore tax bill for the plant. Property owners will be absorbing an average increase of $590 a year for 30 long years if the province doesn't step in.\n\nIdeally, a government would have an audit in hand before deciding whether to commit funds to those affected, but Eby (or BC Conservative John Rustad or BC United's Kevin Falcon) would be unwise to employ that line to hold back help. The $3 billion-plus overrun won't disappear with any review that tells us the gory details.\n\nThe bill is real, as are the seats to be won, or lost, on the North Shore in October, with no local issue this tangibly upon us.\n\nKirk LaPointe is a West Vancouver columnist with an extensive background in journalism.

(Metro Vancouver Regional District)\n\nA day after BC Premier David Eby suggested an independent review should be carried out on the ballooning costs to complete the North Shore Wastewater Treatment Plant, the Metro Vancouver Regional District announced this afternoon that the analysis would be performed.\n\n\"I've expressed the provinces' concern a few times now about resolving what drove the cost overruns at the North Shore Plant, and I think that the time has really come for Metro Vancouver to hire an auditor, independent of them, to dig into this and provide a report to everybody,\" said Premier David Eby when asked during a press conference on Monday.\n\n\"But to ensure a full-scale review of that project, it's high time for Metro Vancouver to bring an auditor to have a look at that... For Metro Vancouver, I think it would be very helpful for us to have an independent eye on what's driven the cost overruns on that particular project to know what additional steps are required to ensure accountability of Metro Vancouver. If the officials at Metro Vancouver can't ensure taxpayer accountability of the expenses incurred there, obviously the province will have to step in.\"\n\nYou might also like:\n\nIn March 2024, the regional district revealed the latest cost for the partly built, much-delayed sewage treatment plant near North Vancouver's waterfront will carry an estimated cost of $3.86 billion to complete -- an increase of over five times from the original estimate.\n\nWhen major construction work first began in 2018, the project had a budget of $700 million and a completion date of 2020. However, the regional district charges that the project's previous main contractor, Acciona Infrastructure Canada, completed 80% of the plant's design and 30% of its construction, with only half of the 2.8 million cubic feet of concrete poured to date.\n\nThe regional district has so far placed much of the blame on Acciona for the cost overruns, delays, and poor quality of construction work. These claims have yet to be proven in court; both the regional district and the company are suing each other, with the regional seeking $500 million in damages and the company looking to recover $250 million in unpaid costs.\n\nThe issue over the beleaguered project resurfaced in more recent weeks, since late May, after the regional district's board of directors approved a controversial cost-sharing plan, which spurred suggestions of further audits and examination of the regional district's project management practices.\n\nUnder the cost-sharing plan, North Shore households will cover 37% of the cost overruns, and households in all other areas of Metro Vancouver will cover the remaining 63%. North Shore households will see $590 in additional annual costs for 30 years, while households in the region's three other sewage service catchment areas will pay between $80 and $150 more per year for 15 years. These fee hikes begin in 2025.\n\nIn a statement this afternoon, George Harvie, the chair of the regional district's board of directors and the Mayor of Delta, says he is initiating an independent review of the project's costs.\n\n\"Since announcing the cost estimate for the North Shore Wastewater Treatment Plant Program, we have heard concerns about whether Metro Vancouver is managing costs effectively for the public,\" said Harvie, who says this will add to the findings made by the regional district's task force, which was established under the board's direction.\n\nAfter it was made apparent the project had hit major obstacles, the task force looked at three separate updated cost estimates that gave the regional district a better idea of the final estimated project cost. An external expert panel also reviewed this previous process.\n\n\"The cost estimates considered market conditions, inflation, interest rates, hiring a new contractor, and cost of materials and labour. Task force meetings were held in closed [sessions] due to the nature of the subject matter discussed, which included commercial matters and litigation,\" continued Harvie.\n\nJerry Dobrovolny, the regional district's commissioner and chief administrative officer, says that shortly after he joined the organization in late 2019, he was asked to conduct a comprehensive review of its project management practices \"because they recognized the challenges that the organization would face while delivering the many large projects it needs to build.\"\n\nPrior to joining the regional district, Dobrovolny was the chief engineer and general manager of the City of Vancouver's Engineering Department. When he became the regional district's chief bureaucrat, the North Shore plant project was already well underway in the construction process.\n\n\"We immediately reviewed Metro Vancouver practices, which resulted in recommendations for improvements. As a result, we established a project delivery department as a centre of project delivery expertise for the organization, restructured our procurement and real estate services department, and implemented enhanced project management processes,\" said Dobrovolny.\n\n\"It is extremely important to me that the public trust the work that Metro Vancouver does... I am confident in the process improvements I have implemented and welcome an independent review of the North Shore Wastewater Treatment Plant Program costs as initiated by the Board Chair.\"\n\nIf the revised project direction keeps its course, the North Shore plant's new main contractors -- PCL Construction and AECOM -- will bring the facility to substantial completion in 2030. When operational, the plant will solely serve the long-term sewage treatment needs of the North Shore's growing population and businesses and provide superior tertiary treatment. The existing 1961-built Lions Gate Wastewater Treatment Plant, located under the north end of the Lions Gate Bridge, only provides a low standard of primary treatment and will be decommissioned after the new plant is operational, with the land restored and returned to the Squamish Nation.\n\nThe regional district is facing heat not only for the North Shore plant project but also for the $10 billion new Iona Island sewage treatment plant near Vancouver International Airport, with site preparation construction work now well underway.

The estimated cost has since ballooned to $3.86 billion, and the timeline for completion has been extended until 2030.\n\nGeorge Harvie, chair of the regional government's board of directors, announced an independent review in a statement issued Tuesday, saying the regional government has heard \"concerns about whether Metro Vancouver is managing costs effectively for the public\" and that they take them seriously.\n\nMetro Vancouver chief administrative officer Jerry Dobrovolny said in the same statement that he welcomes the review. He added that a \"realistic approach\" is important when estimating the costs of these types of projects.\n\n\"The current environment for delivering major infrastructure projects is very challenging,\" Dobrovolny said.\n\nThe announcement came after B.C. Premier David Eby called for a review of the project.\n\n\"I've expressed the province's concern a few times now about resolving what drove the cost overruns on the North Shore plant and I think that the time has really come for Metro Vancouver to hire an auditor, independent of them, to dig into this and provide a report,\" Eby said at an unrelated Monday press conference.\n\nLast week, a group of Lower Mainland politicians urged B.C.'s auditor general to investigate the cost overruns, saying he has the jurisdiction because the province put $200 million toward the project.\n\nThe provincial Opposition Party, B.C. United, has previously called for a \"full audit and core review\" of Metro Vancouver, in part because of the project.\n\nFirst announced in 2011, the project received little attention until 2021 when conflict between the regional government and the original contractor became public. The project has since faced design changes, rising costs and construction delays.\n\nIn March, a Metro Vancouver Board task force determined that the project's cost has grown to almost $4 billion by taking into account inflation of construction and labour costs, work that was needed to address design and construction deficiencies for the project and how other large infrastructure projects were competing for the same resources.\n\nWhen completed, the wastewater treatment plant will serve more than 300,000 residents and businesses in the Districts of North and West Vancouver, the City of North Vancouver along with the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh Nations.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Vancouver_Regional_District", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metro Vancouver Regional District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore_(Greater_Vancouver)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Shore (Greater Vancouver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_British_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier of British Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eby", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Eby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsleil-Waututh_First_Nation", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tsleil-Waututh First Nation"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vancouver_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Vancouver (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Vancouver (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Mainland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lower Mainland"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamish,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Squamish, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Squamish, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Project_and_Program_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Project and Program Management", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Project_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Project Management", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Consulting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Marketplaces", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Estimating", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Estimating", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.7236125.1718407139!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/north-shore-wastewater-treatment-plant-program.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663438", "eventUri": "eng-9663438", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Those benefits include a one-time retroactive pay bump following a review, as well as health and pension benefits.\n\nMetro Vancouver is responsible for regional-scale services like water and sewage, regional parks, and infrastructure projects. More than 20 municipalities form the Metro Vancouver governing body, and its board appoints the Commissioner/Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) to manage the day-to-day operations.\n\nFirst reported by Global News, the salary announcement has raised more than a few eyebrows.\n\n\"Under management of Mr. Mr. Dobrovolny, every project is delayed, every project costs us billions and billions more,\" one person wrote in part on social media.\n\n\"Absolutely ridiculous,\" someone said on X, adding, \"You only deserve this kind of salary if you're curing cancer or some other killer disease.\"\n\n\"Seems completely reasonable - said no Metro Vancouver taxpayer ever,\" another person wrote.\n\nSomeone else appeared to poke fun. \"Sorry, but that's what it takes to live in Vancouver nowadays. Have you seen rent or grocery prices recently?\" they said on Reddit.\n\nMetro Vancouver's spokesperson told Daily Hive that the salary is comparable to that of other organizations in terms of scope and experience.\n\n\"CAO compensation was determined by an independent assessment of the scope of CAO roles within local government, public sector, and crown corporations, across the region and across Canada. The assessment determined CAO compensation by averaging compensation of five organizations of similar scope and size to Metro Vancouver. These organizations are: BC Hydro, BC Ferries, TransLink, ICBC, and Toronto Transit Commission,\" Amanda McCuaig, Metro Vancouver spokesperson, said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe organization is \"responsible for managing a multibillion-dollar budget and employing about 2,000 highly skilled workers,\" the statement added.\n\nFor those who are concerned that taxpayer dollars are being snapped up through these increases, the spokesperson explained that the average rate equates to about $700 per household and about $58 a month for all the services it provides.\n\n\"Although Metro Vancouver is often thought of as local government, its services are primarily that of a utility organization. It is more comparable to other utilities and regional services.\"\n\nHis salary isn't too far above that of others within the province. However, it's well above what elected officials make.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, as a Member of Parliament and as the leader of the country, earns $400,000 in salary in 2024, not including expenses. Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim makes half of that, about $200,000 from 2023 numbers. However, Vancouver City Manager Paul Mochrie earned significantly more, with a salary of $365,000 last year.\n\nIn the comment section on Reddit, someone argued it's apples and oranges.\n\n\"Premiers and the prime minister are not exactly appropriate comparables. They're politicians and simply set policy direction rather than professionals leading an organization,\" one user explained.\n\nAnother person also argued it was fair.\n\n\"I hold the position that executives like CEOs make way too much money relative to what workers in the same companies make but this guy's compensation is pretty much in line with what those others in similar positions make. It'll be more productive to get angry at pay disparity in general and not at this in isolation,\" they said.\n\nIn the meantime, BC Hydro President Chris O'Riley makes a salary of $406,947 and a total income of $629,766, according to 2023 documents on the BC government's website.\n\nIf you're curious, the highest-paid executive in BC (from numbers made public) is Thomas Bechard, president and CEO of Powerex, who made $1,308,162.00 in 2023. Powerex is a subsidiary of BC Hydro and is based in Vancouver.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nMany called out Metro Vancouver and the members who are attending the two-week trip to the International Conference on Urban Drainage and study tour on green infrastructure in the Netherlands right now.\n\nBurnaby Mayor Mike Hurley, Port Coquitlam Mayor Brad West, Anmore Mayor John McEwen, and Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie are in attendance. Outgoing Metro Vancouver Board Chair George V. Harvie decided not to attend last minute because he said he didn't want to be a distraction.\n\nAccording to the website, the board chair makes $105,039 per annum, while board and committee members make $525 for meetings up to four hours.\n\nHowever, travel expenses for last year were in the hundreds of thousands, with West's alone totalling more than $33,000.

We take these concerns seriously and as such, as the Chair of the Board, I am initiating an independent review of the North Shore Wastewater Treatment Plant Program costs,\" Harvie added.\n\nThe massive increase in cost was in part due to a switch in contractors, increased construction costs, and inflation. North Shore residents were previously facing possible increases to their annual utility bills of $725 to cover the excess costs. Under the new cost-sharing agreement, agreed to earlier this month, residents will now see an increase of $590 annually.\n\nResidents living in areas serviced by the Vancouver sewerage area will see an increase of $150 annually, while those living in the Lulu Island and Fraser sewerage areas will see annual impacts of $80 and $90 respectively.\n\nEarlier this week, the district's spending caught the eye of B.C.'s premier. The latest talking point was focused on international trips, high salaries, and questions over sufficient oversight, and how much money the head bureaucrat makes.\n\nDocuments from the MVRD show Chief Administrative Officer Jerry Dobrovolny makes more than Premier David Eby and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, combined. Dobrovolny's annual remuneration plus benefits topped out at more than $700,000 in 2023.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Dobrovolny shared that after he was hired in 2019, he and his team \"immediately reviewed\" the district's practices, \"which resulted in improvements.\"\n\n\"The current environment for delivering major infrastructure projects is very challenging, and it's important that we take a realistic approach to estimating the cost of these projects so that we can provide the region with enough lead time to plan for how the costs will be managed,\" he explained.\n\n\"It is extremely important to me that the public trust the work that Metro Vancouver does -- we pride ourselves on being the foundation of what makes this region livable by delivering world-class drinking water and by applying innovation to our wastewater system to protect human health and the Salish Sea, as well as adapt to climate change impacts.\n\n\"I am confident in the process improvements I have implemented and welcome an independent review of the North Shore Wastewater Treatment Plant Program costs as initiated by the Board Chair.\"", "source": {"uri": "vancouver.citynews.ca", "dataType": "news",

Paul Minhas said the transition allowance, something his party's councillors tried to reform last year, is there to assist elected officials in other employment.\n\nMinhas said Cote was able to find new employment at Metro Vancouver in less than two months, pocketing more than $100,000 in the process.\n\nCote was hired as Metro Vancouver's deputy general manager with regional planning and housing development.\n\n\"We tried to reform this pricey transition allowance policy last year, but the Community First politicians at city hall voted it down,\" Minhas said.\n\n\"Our local taxpayers are dealing with inflation and a cumulative property tax increase of 14 per cent over the past two years, so this golden parachute is hard for taxpayers to have to stomach when you realize that our former mayor got a massive transition allowance as he was headed to the high-paying job at Metro Vancouver.\"\n\nNew West Progressive councillors Daniel Fontaine and Minhas looked to change the rules around the transition allowance to limit how much a former politician could receive in the event they are able to find employment.\n\n\"This is a common practice found in the private sector whereby the continuance of salary or severance pay is adjusted to reflect the employment status of an individual during the transition period,\" Minhas said.\n\n\"In voting against the motion, it was reported that Johnstone stated, in part, 'The separation allowance is a benefit that elected government officials receive' and it 'should be an important part of every compensation package.'\"\n\nAlso in the financial statement, it was revealed Cote was paid more than $209,407 in 2023. In total, Cote received more than $315,000 last year.\n\nOn Tuesday, Metro Vancouver said it is launching an independent review of the wastewater treatment plant, even though it said a day before that it had no plans to take such action. The announcement was made by George Harvie, Delta's mayor and chair of Metro Vancouver's board of directors.\n\n\"We take these concerns seriously and as such, as the Chair of the Board, I am initiating an independent review of the North Shore Wastewater Treatment Plant Program costs,\" outgoing Mero Vancouver board chair George Harvie wrote in a release Tuesday.\n\nHarvie was voted off the Metro Vancouver board by Delta city councillors.\n\nHis last day on the board will be June 30.\n\nHarvie's travel expenses while part of the board have come into question. His released expenses for the first few months of 2024 have prompted outrage and questions about accountability at Metro Vancouver.\n\nDespite his removal from the Metro Vancouver board, Harvie was permitted to stay on until July 1 so he could attend a conference in Amsterdam about diking systems. Harvie did not end up going on the trip to Amsterdam, but several other Metro Vancouver officials did.\n\nData from Metro Vancouver shows Harvie has already incurred more than $32,000 in expenses this year. He claimed more than $21,000 for a flight to Asia plus $2,700 for accommodation and per diems.\n\nThe announcement of an independent review also comes one day after B.C. Premier David Eby called for an independent audit of Metro Vancouver.\n\nEby even hinted that if the authority cannot ensure financial accountability, the province may step in.\n\nMetro Vancouver said the scope and details of the review still need to be determined.\n\nThe plant was initially expected to be finished by 2020, at a cost of $700 million. The budget has since swelled to nearly $4 billion and the completion date has been pushed to at least 2030.\n\nTo pay for the project, Metro Vancouver voted to divide the costs across the region, with North Shore homeowners bearing the brunt with an extra $590 per year on their utility bills for the next 30 years.\n\nLast week, seven city councillors from across Metro Vancouver called for auditor general Michael Pickup to investigate the cost overruns.\n\n\"Part of today is really, sadly ... damage control. This should have come weeks, if not months ago. They've gone into this kicking and screaming,\" Fontaine said.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, four Lower Mainland city councillors, including Fontaine, said Metro Vancouver's board members should be elected.\n\nIn its current model, Metro Vancouver's 41 board members are appointed, something councillors Linda Annis of Surrey, Fontaine of New Westminster, Kash Heed of Richmond and Ahmed Yousef of Maple Ridge said need to change.\n\nThe four said voters should decide who the board members are, and Metro Vancouver currently lacks transparency.\n\n\"The current governance model is clearly not working and the provincial government should undertake a full review that includes giving taxpayers the chance to elect board members and hold them accountable, the same way they hold mayors, councillors and MLAs accountable,\" Linda Annis said.\n\nMetro Vancouver is a federation of 21 municipalities, one electoral area and one treaty First Nation.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca",

Their salaries also increase in step with local mayors' salaries every four years and are in line for an adjustment this year.\n\nThis year, the average household is set to pay an extra 12 per cent for all regional government services, including water, sewers, garbage pickup and, to a lesser extent, regional parks.\n\nNext year, households will pay an additional 11 per cent, from the average $698 per household bill in 2024.\n\nThe tax hikes have been attributed to a need to renew infrastructure and a past failure to collect money from new developments.\n\nHowever, these increases do not include a new special levy for the mismanaged North Shore wastewater treatment plant, which was announced earlier this year to have a $3.9-billion price tag, up $2.8 billion from the prior $1.1-billion estimate.\n\nOn May 31, the board approved a plan that will see sewage costs for North Shore taxpayers go up by $590 a year for the next 30 years (that's on top of an average of $484 of current sewage costs). Costs to other Metro communities will rise by between $80 and $150 annually.\n\nOver the past two years, Metro Vancouver's board has sent members to Australia, Singapore and Netherlands for international conferences to purportedly learn best practices.\n\n[email protected]", "source": {"uri": "vancouverisawesome.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vancouver Is Awesome"}, "authors": [{"uri": "graeme_wood@vancouverisawesome.com", "name": "Graeme Wood", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Vancouver_Regional_District", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metro Vancouver Regional District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_administrative_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief administrative officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regional district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipal council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore,_New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Shore, New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Shore, New Zealand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regional park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_sewer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanitary sewer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewage treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Government Agencies", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/via/howe/metromoney.jpg;w=960;h=638;mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663438", "eventUri": "eng-9663438", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 916, "textEnd": 923}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 2306, "textEnd": 2312}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Projects of this magnitude that we know will have a serious economic impact on people should be discussed in public whenever possible.

Daniel Fontaine described Metro Vancouver as having \"almost an addiction to travel\" in a Global News interview.\n\n\"There seems to be a disconnect between the people who are making these decisions on these international flights, and the people who are paying the bills,\" Fontaine said.\n\nOut of Metro Vancouver's 41-member board, total expenditures amounted to $227,000, but the top five spenders - three of whom hail from the Tri-Cities - spent nearly $153,000, or 67 percent.\n\nBoard expenditures have spiked over 60 percent since in 2019.\n\nDelta Mayor George Harvie, who served as Metro Vancouver's board chair before being ousted by his council in May, cancelled his trip to five-day conference on diking systems in Amsterdam following scrutiny.\n\nHarvie racked up more than $31,938 in travel expenses in 2023, having the third highest on the board. He had already spent $32,000 in 2024, and his flight to Europe would have cost an additional $5,300 per Global News.\n\nBut two Tri-Cities mayors, Anmore's John McEwen and Port Coquitlam's Brad West, outspent Harvey in 2023, and both are currently attending that Amsterdam conference.\n\nMcEwen, who serves as Metro Vancouver's vice chair, spent more than any other member last year, with travel bills totaling $49,239.\n\nIn a statement to the Dispatch, McEwen said 2023 was the first year Metro Vancouver board members were able to start attending conferences regularly since COVID-19.\n\n\"The current level of travel is on par with pre-pandemic levels,\" he said. \"However, travel costs have increased overall as airline, hotel, and related expenses have risen due to inflation and other economic factors.\"\n\nMcEwen added his expenses also include trips to lobby provincial and federal governments to try to secure subsidies for major infrastructure and housing projects, including $250 million for the Iona Island Wastewater Treatment Plant Project in Richmond.\n\nPort Coquitlam Mayor Brad West, who chairs Metro Vancouver's finance committee and vice chairs the mayors committee, had the second highest spending on the board at $33,247.\n\nWest described 2023 as a \"unique, one-off year,\" as he was asked to attend a higher number of conferences by Metro Vancouver. \"My Metro expenses have always been very low,\" he said.\n\nThe most expensive trips taken by McEwen and West involved international conferences: the 2023 Asia Pacific Cities Summit in Brisbane, Australia; and the United Cities and Local Governments Culture Summit in Dublin, Ireland.\n\nAirfare and expenses for the trips amounted to over $51,000 between the two mayors.\n\nMcEwen, who was a speaker at the Australian conference, said local governments are facing challenges with housing, resilience, and climate action, and the conference felt \"particularly relevant,\" noting that almost 1,200 delegates from 171 cities attended.\n\n\"As chair of the regional parks committee, I have also been working to keep abreast of trends and learnings related to parks and how they can support the health and wellbeing of residents while being integrated with reconciliation with the local First Nations,\" he said.\n\nThe fifth biggest spender on Metro Vancouver's board was Coquitlam Coun. Craig Hodge, vice chair of the zero waste committee, who spent nearly $18,200 on trips to Finland and the U.S.\n\nHodge spent nearly $9,200 to attend the World Circular Economy Forum in Helsinki, and almost $5,000 attending the Wastecon 2023 in Boston.\n\nMcEwen and Port Coquitlam Coun. Darrell Penner also attended the Special Park Districts Forum in Chicago, spending over $9,000 between the two.\n\nWhile West's travel expenses prior to 2023 were not significant, only spending $3,200 to attend two other U.S. conferences since joining Metro Vancouver's board in 2019, Port Coquitlam's former mayor, Greg Moore, spent more than $24,000 in 2018.\n\nThe same cannot be said for McEwen, who spent nearly $20,000 on travel in 2019, including a trip to Germany at a cost of more than $8,500.\n\nHodge, meanwhile, spent more than $18,000 between 2018 and 2023, including conference trips to San Diego, Portland and Phoenix.\n\nFontaine and three other councillors, Linda Annis of Surrey, Kash Heed of Richmond, Ahmed Yousef of Maple Ridge have called on the Premier David Eby to carry out a governance review of Metro Vancouver, including for the board to be elected in the future.\n\nBoard members are currently appointed by local governments, and Fontaine said the structure leads to a lack of accountability to taxpayers.\n\nPatrick Penner, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter, Tri-Cities Dispatch", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

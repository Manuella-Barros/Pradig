Explore the potential for BTC price...\n\nBitcoin price continues to capture global attention, displaying remarkable resilience and growth potential. From the prediction of soaring prices to significant movements in ETFs and a resurgence of retail interest, Bitcoin price shows signs of a bullish future. This article delves into recent developments, including key valuation indicators, ETF inflows, and the growing interest among retail investors, to help you understand why Bitcoin price might be on the cusp of another major surge.\n\nBitcoin Price Rally and Key Valuation Indicators: A Buy Opportunity?\n\nBitcoin price has recently experienced an impressive rally, reaching as high as $62,729. This surge has been fueled by several factors, including strong institutional demand and a noteworthy prediction by Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of Bitmex, who believes that Bitcoin could reach $1 million. Supporting this optimism, the Mayer Multiple, a key Bitcoin valuation indicator, suggests that Bitcoin price remains undervalued, despite its recent price increases. Historically, when the Mayer Multiple falls below 2.4, it signals a buying opportunity, and as of August 5, it stands at 0.88, indicating that Bitcoin might still be a good buy even at current prices.\n\nBTC ETF Movements: A Signal of Growing Investor Confidence\n\nThe US Bitcoin ETFs have also played a crucial role in bolstering Bitcoin's price. On a single day, Bitcoin ETFs saw a massive inflow of $45.14 million, signaling growing investor confidence. This contrasts sharply with Ethereum ETFs, which saw significant outflows, highlighting the market's preference for Bitcoin. Additionally, the recent re-filing by CBOE for options trading on spot Bitcoin ETFs suggests that the crypto market could soon witness more sophisticated trading strategies, further boosting Bitcoin's appeal to both institutional and retail investors.\n\nThe Bitcoin Retail Interest Resurgence: A New Growth Phase?\n\nRetail investors are also making a comeback, as indicated by the upward trend in new Bitcoin addresses. After a period of declining new addresses, recent data shows a significant increase, which could point to renewed interest from retail investors. This resurgence could create a more balanced market and lay the groundwork for Bitcoin's next growth phase. As the market sentiment shifts, retail participation may drive the next wave of Bitcoin price surge, providing a strong foundation for its future growth.\n\nBitcoin Technical Analysis and Market Sentiment: A Bullish Outlook?\n\nBitcoin price recovery after a sharp decline to $49,557 has been remarkable, with the cryptocurrency now trading above $60,000. Analysts attribute this resilience to strong institutional support and the ability of Bitcoin to recover swiftly from market downturns. Technical indicators like the crossing of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) above the $59,300 level and the bullish engulfing candle pattern suggest that Bitcoin's upward momentum could continue.

On Friday morning during Asian trading hours, the Bitcoin price briefly exceeded $62,000 and then experienced a slight pullback. This rise caused many analysts to bring up the year-end $100,000 target for Bitcoin again.\n\nContentsBitcoin Rose Along with US MarketsReasons for Bitcoin's Rise Justified Bitcoin Rose Along with US Markets\n\nUS markets showed strong performance on Thursday, especially with the S&P 500 having its best day since November 2022 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 rising by 3.1%, creating a positive atmosphere in the cryptocurrency market as well. After the significant losses at the beginning of the week, this recovery movement restored confidence in both stocks and cryptocurrencies. Access NEWSLINKER to get the latest technology news.\n\nBitcoin recorded a 7.2% increase in the last 24 hours, achieving one of its biggest daily gains in recent months. This movement caused investors who took short positions in Bitcoin futures to incur losses exceeding $100 million. This was the fourth-largest short position liquidation seen in Bitcoin this year.\n\nReasons for Bitcoin's Rise Justified\n\nMarket observers attribute the rise to the positive atmosphere in the stock market and the expectation that Bitcoin will repeat its past market cycles. Transform Ventures founder Michael Terpin predicts that the price will not fall much below $50,000 due to the Bank of Japan's announcement that it will not raise interest rates and the depletion of Bitcoin held by large-selling investors. He also stated that the largest cryptocurrency would progress along its traditional four-year cycle lines and achieve strong gains in October and November.\n\nTerpin also warned that if Donald Trump wins the US elections, Bitcoin's price could exceed $100,000. He added that considering the pullbacks experienced in the six-month period after the block reward halving in the past, the current fifth Bitcoin cycle is no exception to this rule. He noted that October and November are historically strong months for Bitcoin, especially in the block reward halving year and the following year.\n\nThis rise in Bitcoin also gave momentum to other major cryptocurrencies. Ethereum (ETH) and Toncoin (TON) rose by 10%, while Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) rose by 5%. XRP slightly fell after profit-taking following its 17% rise on Thursday.\n\nYou can follow our news on Telegram, Facebook, Twitter & Coinmarketcap Disclaimer: The information contained in this article does not constitute investment advice.

True to its roots, the event was a vibrant hub of innovation, demonstrating how the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems continue to evolve. Amidst the political discourse and regulatory frameworks, the event spotlighted numerous advancements, setting new industry benchmarks. While the mainstream attention might have focused on high-profile speakers, these important developments are quietly paving the way for the future of Bitcoin and DeFi.\n\nOne of the most significant milestones at Bitcoin 2024 was the successful demonstration of SNARK proof verification on Bitcoin using BitVMX. This breakthrough was achieved without altering the Bitcoin protocol, marking a pivotal moment for cryptographic proofs on the Bitcoin network. The process involved compiling Citrea's SNARK verifier to the RISC-V architecture and executing it on a virtual CPU, with results published on-chain. This development enhances the capabilities of the BitVMX proving system and opens the door for broader applications of SNARK proofs within Bitcoin. The team behind BitVMX is now focused on refining the technology and preparing it for an open-source release, which could have far-reaching implications for Bitcoin's future.\n\nOobit made headlines by announcing a strategic partnership with Tether and the TON Foundation, aimed at streamlining transactions using USDT and Tether Gold (XAUt) on The Open Network. This collaboration allows users to pay merchants in fiat currency while spending cryptocurrencies, demonstrating Oobit's commitment to bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem. This partnership is particularly noteworthy given Oobit's recent $25 million Series A funding round, underscoring the company's growing influence in providing unbanked individuals with access to global payment solutions. Phillip Lord, President of Oobit, emphasized the potential of this partnership to transform digital payments, and his insights could offer a glimpse into the future of cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nThe Core Foundation has taken a bold step in Bitcoin finance by introducing a Dual Staking model, combining Bitcoin with CORE tokens. This model builds upon Core's successful launch of Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking, allowing Bitcoin holders to earn yield while maintaining custody of their coins. The Dual Staking mechanism is designed to offer higher rewards for those who stake both Bitcoin and CORE tokens, with even greater incentives for long-term stakers. This initiative not only strengthens the relationship between Bitcoin and Core but also positions the CORE token as a central element in the evolving landscape of Bitcoin finance. Industry analysts have hailed this development as a significant enhancement of Bitcoin's utility and security.\n\nCasa, a leader in Bitcoin self-custody services, has enhanced its security offerings by integrating YubiKeys into its platform. This new feature provides Casa users with increased flexibility and convenience in securing their Bitcoin vaults. YubiKeys, known for their compact size and easy tap-to-use authentication, add an extra layer of security to the already robust self-custody services provided by Casa. Nick Neumann, CEO of Casa, emphasized the importance of this integration in offering users a more secure and user-friendly experience, reinforcing Casa's position as a trusted provider in the Bitcoin security space.\n\nIn a groundbreaking move, Argentine entrepreneurs Borja Martel and Nick Damico have launched the world's first fully Bitcoin-native stock, commodities, and futures exchange. With $4.3 million in backing from prominent investors like Draper Associates, Roxom aims to bring Bitcoin to the forefront of global finance by allowing companies to issue dividends and debt in Bitcoin. The platform also enables investors to earn returns directly in the cryptocurrency, representing a significant step forward in the integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial markets. Roxom's launch at Bitcoin 2024 marks a new era for Bitcoin as it continues to establish itself as a global financial asset.\n\nBitcoin 2024 has once again proven that the real innovation in the cryptocurrency space often happens beyond the headlines. These developments showcase how Bitcoin is evolving from a mere store of value into a multifaceted financial asset with applications that extend far beyond its original use case. As the industry continues to grow, these advancements highlight the ongoing efforts to build the infrastructure and tools that will shape the future of Bitcoin and decentralized finance. From groundbreaking cryptographic proofs to the launch of a Bitcoin-native stock exchange, these innovations are setting the stage for the next chapter in the Bitcoin story.", "source": {"uri": "gritdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Grit Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Decentralized finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tether (cryptocurrency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RISC-V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Token coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiat money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Draper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Draper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John von Neumann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Store of value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_financial_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global financial system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Authentication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Futures exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://gritdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/113568-how-to-pay-your-employees-with-cryptocurrency.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803818", "eventUri": "eng-9803818", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

This surge in value comes on the heels of a broader rebound in Asian equities, providing a much-needed boost to the digital asset market after a period of volatility. The recent price movements in Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies like Ether, are emblematic of the intricate relationship between digital assets and global economic conditions. This article delves into the factors contributing to Bitcoin's resurgence, the broader market implications, and what the future may hold for the original cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin's recent rally has been notable not just for its magnitude but also for the context in which it occurred. After a bruising selloff that saw the cryptocurrency market post some of its steepest declines since the collapse of FTX in 2022, Bitcoin managed to reverse its downward trajectory, climbing as much as 5.3% to briefly top US$62,000. This marked a significant recovery from earlier in the week when Bitcoin and other digital assets were caught in a wave of selling pressure.\n\nThe turnaround began on Thursday, with Bitcoin posting its largest one-day gain in more than 16 months. This sharp recovery has been attributed to a combination of factors, including a rebound in Asian equities, which provided a positive backdrop for risk assets, and a reduction in selling pressure from over-leveraged crypto speculators. While Bitcoin's price remains below the levels seen just a week ago, the recent rally has reignited optimism among traders and investors.\n\nOne of the key drivers behind Bitcoin's recent price surge has been the rebound in Asian equities. As global markets have become increasingly interconnected, the performance of major stock indices, particularly in regions like Asia, has had a pronounced impact on the cryptocurrency market. The rally in Asian equities provided a much-needed boost to investor sentiment, encouraging a shift back into risk assets like Bitcoin.\n\nThe correlation between Bitcoin and traditional financial markets, including equities, has become more apparent in recent years. As institutional investors and traditional financial players have entered the cryptocurrency space, Bitcoin's price movements have increasingly mirrored those of broader financial markets. The recent rebound in Asian equities, therefore, provided a supportive environment for Bitcoin to recover from its earlier losses.\n\nBeyond the influence of equity markets, macroeconomic factors have also played a crucial role in Bitcoin's recent volatility. Traders have pointed to a range of macroeconomic developments, including central bank policies, currency movements, and global economic trends, as key drivers of the recent price swings in digital assets.\n\nOne of the most significant macroeconomic factors influencing Bitcoin's price has been the unwinding of the yen carry trade. The yen carry trade, a popular strategy among investors where they borrow in yen (due to its low-interest rates) and invest in higher-yielding assets, has seen a reversal as global economic conditions shift. This unwinding has led to a reassessment of risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, contributing to the recent selloff and subsequent rally in Bitcoin.\n\nJustin d'Anethan, head of business development in Asia-Pacific at Keyrock, a crypto market-maker, emphasized that the unwinding of the yen carry trade is not a short-term phenomenon. \"The unwinding of the yen carry trade isn't something that gets resolved in a couple of days,\" d'Anethan noted, highlighting the ongoing influence of macroeconomic trends on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAnother factor that has contributed to the recent volatility in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is forced selling by crypto speculators. In periods of heightened market stress, leveraged positions, where traders borrow funds to increase their exposure to the market, can lead to rapid liquidations as prices move against them. This forced selling can exacerbate price declines, as seen earlier in the week when Bitcoin and other digital assets experienced sharp losses.\n\nHowever, d'Anethan also pointed out a potential silver lining to the recent selloff. The steep declines on Monday led to what he described as the \"flushing out of massive leveraged positions.\" By clearing out these highly leveraged positions, the market may have set the stage for a more sustainable recovery, as the removal of excessive leverage can reduce the risk of further forced selling in the near term.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has garnered much of the attention during the recent rally, it's important to note that other cryptocurrencies have also experienced significant price movements. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, climbed as much as 6% during the recent rally, reflecting broader positive sentiment in the digital asset space.\n\nThe performance of Ether and other altcoins is often closely linked to Bitcoin, as Bitcoin's price movements tend to set the tone for the broader cryptocurrency market. However, each cryptocurrency also has its unique factors driving price action. For Ether, these include developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as the ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0 and the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nThe recent rally in Ether alongside Bitcoin underscores the interconnected nature of the cryptocurrency market, where positive sentiment in one major asset can spill over into others. This phenomenon is often referred to as \"rising tides lift all boats,\" where gains in one cryptocurrency lead to broader market increases.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to navigate a volatile market environment, traders and investors are closely watching for signals of what may come next. While the recent rally has provided a much-needed boost to sentiment, there are several factors that could influence Bitcoin's price in the near term.\n\nFirstly, macroeconomic conditions will continue to play a significant role in shaping the cryptocurrency market. Central bank policies, currency movements, and broader economic trends will be key determinants of risk appetite among investors. As d'Anethan highlighted, the unwinding of the yen carry trade and other macro factors are likely to continue weighing on risk assets, including Bitcoin.\n\nSecondly, the state of leveraged positions in the cryptocurrency market will be an important factor to monitor. The recent \"flushing out\" of massive leveraged positions may have reduced some of the downward pressure on prices, but any resurgence in leveraged trading could lead to renewed volatility.\n\nFinally, the broader adoption and development of the cryptocurrency ecosystem will remain a crucial driver of Bitcoin's long-term prospects. As institutional interest in digital assets grows and new use cases for blockchain technology emerge, Bitcoin's role as a leading cryptocurrency is likely to evolve.\n\nBitcoin's recent surge past US$60,000 is a testament to the resilience of the cryptocurrency market in the face of macroeconomic challenges and market volatility. The rally, driven by a combination of factors including a rebound in Asian equities, macroeconomic influences, and the unwinding of leveraged positions, has reignited optimism among traders and investors.\n\nHowever, as the market continues to navigate a complex and rapidly changing environment, it's clear that the path ahead for Bitcoin will be shaped by a range of factors, from global economic trends to developments within the cryptocurrency ecosystem itself.

This article is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice. You could lose all of your capital.\n\nBitcoin's price surged to $62,500, driven by whale accumulation and growing investor confidence. Positive regulatory developments and optimism around Bitcoin ETFs further fueled the rally.\n\nDespite the surge, the market remains volatile, with short-term holders facing unrealized losses.\n\nTraders are closely watching key levels as Bitcoin fluctuates, while the market cap has risen to $2.15 trillion.\n\nThe crypto market surged 11% overnight, reaching $2.105 trillion, with Bitcoin climbing back above $62,000. This rise is driven by renewed investor confidence, as U.S. Bitcoin ETFs acquired 3,376 BTC.\n\nAdditionally, the increase in new daily Bitcoin addresses signals growing interest from individual investors, reversing a recent decline.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, new addresses rose from 203,536 in early June to between 286,000 and 337,000 in August, suggesting potential market stabilization.\n\nAnalyst Benjamin Cowen warns of possible selling pressure if Bitcoin fails to maintain the $62,000 support level.\n\nMeanwhile, Timothy Peterson notes that a \"death cross\" in moving averages might not be entirely bearish. Investors should closely monitor these support levels and emerging trends for future market insights.\n\nBitcoin surged to a week-to-date high of around $62,500 on August 8th, following better-than-expected U.S. labor market data. Jobless claims fell to 233,000, easing recession fears and boosting investor confidence. This positive economic outlook further reduced concerns about a potential downturn.\n\nAdditionally, a significant short squeeze in the crypto futures market, with over $114 million in shorts liquidated, further propelled Bitcoin's price.\n\nThe U.S. report released on Thursday showed 233,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending August 3, beating the expected 240,000 and down from the previous week's 249,000.\n\nThis stronger-than-expected result alleviated concerns about a potential economic slowdown, contributing to the crypto market's rise.\n\nBinance also saw substantial buy orders, adding momentum to the rally. However, some traders predict that Bitcoin might dip to around $60,000 before potentially retracing.\n\nOverall, the combination of favorable job data and a significant short squeeze has driven a notable increase in Bitcoin's price, though future movements remain uncertain.\n\nBitcoin's 30-day volatility has reached its highest level since March 2024, signaling increased market uncertainty and potential price fluctuations.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin's hashprice -- a critical measure of miner revenue -- has hit a record low, sparking concerns about a profitability crisis for miners.\n\nOn August 8, Bitcoin's hashprice dropped to $40 per unit, down from $60 during the 2022 crypto winter. Daily miner revenue also declined from $40 million in late July to around $24 million by August 7.\n\nThe rising network difficulty, now at a record high of 90 trillion, adds further challenges for miners.\n\nSmaller miners may struggle to cover costs, potentially leading to sell-offs that could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin prices.\n\nThis combination of high volatility and declining hashprice highlights the market's current instability, presenting significant risks and opportunities for investors.\n\nBitcoin at $60,885 with Bullish Momentum; Key Levels to Watch\n\nBitcoin (BTC/USD) is currently priced at $60,885, marking a decrease of 0.48%. The 4-hour chart displays the cryptocurrency above its pivot point of $62,100, indicating potential bullish momentum.\n\nImmediate resistance is noted at $64,645, with subsequent levels at $67,010 and $70,110. On the downside, immediate support lies at $59,360, followed by $57,150 and $54,610.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 61, suggesting a somewhat overbought condition, but not excessively so.\n\nThe 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $59,370 provides additional support. A breach below $62,100 might trigger a sharp selling trend, altering the current positive outlook.", "source": {"uri": "cryptonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "cryptonews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arslan_butt@cryptonews.com", "name": "Arslan Butt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_classes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asset classes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_adviser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial adviser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_exchange", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moving average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_strength_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relative strength index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Strategic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Strategic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/09075046/1723189845-9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803818", "eventUri": "eng-9803818", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 1461, "textEnd": 1471, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 1950, "textEnd": 1958}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 3013, "textEnd": 3021}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

This bullish sentiment was again on display as this institutional investor sent $445 million USDT to exchanges to buy more crypto.\n\nThe on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that crypto trading firm Cumberland has deposited the $445 million it received from the Tether Treasury into different exchanges. Data from the on-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence shows that Cumberland used the USDT funds to buy more crypto, with Bitcoin accounting for most of the firm's purchases in the last 24 hours.\n\nDuring this period, Cumberland has withdrawn a significant amount of Bitcoin from various exchanges, including Coinbase, Robinhood, and OKX, among others. This development coincides with the flagship crypto's recent break above $60,000, highlighting the increased buying pressure that Bitcoin has witnessed thanks to institutional investors like Cumberland.\n\nThe Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers have also bought a significant amount of Bitcoin in the last 24 hours, thanks to the net inflows recorded on August 8. Data from Farside Investors shows that these funds witnessed net inflows of $194.6 million that day. This was the second consecutive day of net inflows for these funds, having witnessed inflows of $45.1 million on August 7.\n\nSome other investors, including retail investors, showed confidence in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market during this recent market crash. Lookonchain noted that Binance experienced a net inflow of $2.4 billion since the market drop on August 5. This includes a net inflow of $1.33 billion USDT and $519 million USDC, as these investors looked to buy more crypto and add to their positions.\n\nBitcoin is back above $60,000 following its drop below $50,000 on August 5. Considering there are still concerns on the macro side, there are fears that this Bitcoin rebound might be a relief bounce rather than a bullish reversal. However, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto is convinced that Bitcoin has found its bottom and is set to enjoy an uptrend from here on.\n\nIn a recent X post, he again alluded to the Volatility Index (VIX), which he noted gives all signs that the macro bottom is in. He remarked that the next markup phase will be \"violent.\" In the meantime, Bitcoin holding above $60,600 will be key to confirming this bullish reversal.

These new market entrants are taking profits, leading to increased volatility. However, this consolidation phase could stabilize the market and establish solid support for future gains. Investors should remain cautious and monitor developments closely.\n\nBitcoin's volatility will remain an exciting topic for investors and analysts in 2023. The recent price increase to $57,000 has attracted new players who are now exerting selling pressure. In this article, we will examine the role of new Bitcoin investors and analyze the possible consequences for the BTC price.\n\nThe crypto world is rarely predictable, and Bitcoin (BTC) is no exception. Since the beginning of the year, the price of Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable rally, catapulting it to a high of $57,000. But while some investors were euphoric about further price gains, new \"whales\" were creating selling pressure.\n\nWho or what is responsible for this phenomenon and what impact could it have on the Bitcoin price? In this article, we examine the current state of the Bitcoin market and analyze the role of the new players in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nNew market entrants, also known as \"whales,\" have started selling their Bitcoin holdings. Whales are typically large Bitcoin investors or institutions that hold significant amounts of Bitcoin and have the ability to move the market significantly. According to a recent report from Decrypt, the selling pressure from these new whales has increased in recent weeks, putting downward pressure on the Bitcoin price.\n\nA quote from Danny Scott, CEO of crypto exchange CoinCorner, underlines the current market movement: \"The new market participants appear to be taking profits, which leads to increased selling pressure in the short term. In the long term, however, this could initiate a consolidation phase and stabilize the price.\"\n\nCoupled with data from Glassnode showing a significant amount of Bitcoin being moved out of old wallets, selling pressure could intensify further. This is especially worrying for short-term investors hoping for a sustained uptrend.\n\nAlthough the selling pressure on the BTC price from large Bitcoin investors is a short-term obstacle, this period of consolidation could have positive effects in the long term. Such market stabilization could lead to the market gradually calming down and solid support levels being established, paving the way for future price gains.\n\nInstitutional Bitcoin investors and long-term holders could use this opportunity to strengthen their positions. Experience from previous market phases shows that such consolidation phases can often serve as a springboard for the next big rally. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic and recommend closely monitoring market developments.\n\nIn conclusion, the role of new whales in the Bitcoin market should not be underestimated. The current selling pressure could weigh on the price in the short term, but also offers opportunities for possible market stabilization and long-term price gains. Investors should remain vigilant and prepare for a volatile market phase.\n\nBy carefully monitoring the market and acting strategically, investors can profit from market fluctuations and prepare for possible future price movements. The next few weeks and months will show whether the Bitcoin price can break above the $57,000 mark again or whether a longer consolidation phase is imminent.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This article was written by a third party contributor and does not reflect the opinion of Born2Invest, its management, staff or its associates.

Apparently, the outflows reached alarming levels, surpassing $577 million. In this article, we will discuss the current price decline of Bitcoin and the spot ETFs and price outlook for August.\n\nImage from Coinmarketcap\n\nIn the first week of August alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed outflows amounting to $577 million. This substantial figure marks one of the largest monthly outflows recorded for these ETFs. To put this into perspective, the total outflows for the previous month of July were less than $600 million, indicating a sharp increase in investor withdrawals.\n\nImage from Coinmarketcap\n\nSeveral ETFs have been particularly affected. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) reported outflows of over $230 million, while the Fidelity ETFs received the saw the most outflows with over $200 million. Other notable ETFs, such as VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) and Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), also experienced significant outflows, contributing to the overall decline.\n\nImage from Coinmarketcap\n\nThe bearish sentiment in the market is not limited to ETFs alone. In fact, Bitcoin itself experienced a decline in value throughout August. Starting the month at approximately $64,000, Bitcoin's price has dipped to around $48,000, marking a decrease of over 14%. Moreover, this drop has erased gains made earlier in the summer and has led to increased anxiety among investors.\n\nImage from Coinmarketcap\n\nThe market valuation of the apex cryptocurrency also reflects this downturn. As of the 1st of August, Bitcoin had a market cap of around $1.26 trillion. At one point, Bitcoin's market cap decreased below $1 trillion, reducing to as low as $966 billion. At press time, Bitcoin's market cap is at $1.09 trillion.\n\nGiven the current trajectory, the outlook for spot Bitcoin ETFs for the remainder of August appears bleak. Analysts predict that if the outflow trend continues, total withdrawals could surpass $1 billion by the end of the month. Such a scenario would mark a significant setback for the market, further reducing investor confidence.\n\nSeveral factors are contributing to this negative outlook. Regulatory uncertainties, particularly in the United States, continue to weigh heavily on the market. Moreover, macroeconomic factors, including rising inflation and interest rate hikes, are also influencing investor behavior. As for Bitcoin, there are still chances of an increase in August, according to an analysis from Coincodex. They expect Bitcoin's price to increase by 41.51% and reach $\u202f79,290 by September 6, 2024.\n\nImage from Coincodex\n\nAugust has proven to be a challenging month for spot Bitcoin ETFs, with outflows surpassing $577 million and Bitcoin's value declining. The substantial outflows reflect growing investor uncertainty and a bearish shift in market sentiment. As the month progresses, the outlook remains uncertain, with potential for further outflows and continued market volatility. For now, caution remains the prevailing sentiment as the market navigates through these turbulent times. But in the future, many analysts still expect Bitcoin's price to increase.\n\nCover Image from Microsoft Designer\n\nThe information provided in this article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Bitcoin's decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive hedge against the unpredictability of fiat currencies. While short-term impacts might be volatile, in the long run, Bitcoin could see increased adoption as a store of value.\n\nDo you believe Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against inflation in this economic climate?\n\nYes, Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against inflation, especially in the current economic climate. Its fixed supply of 21 million coins means it is not subject to the same inflationary pressures as fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities. As more people recognize this attribute, Bitcoin's role as a hedge against inflation becomes increasingly relevant.\n\nWith the 2024 US presidential election approaching, how do you think the outcome might influence Bitcoin regulations and adoption?\n\nThe 2024 US presidential election will likely play a significant role in shaping Bitcoin regulations and adoption. Different administrations have varied approaches to cryptocurrency regulation, ranging from supportive to restrictive. A pro-crypto administration could accelerate the adoption and integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial systems, while a more conservative approach might slow down regulatory clarity but could also provide a framework that assures broader institutional adoption.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the presence of political figures like Donald Trump and RFK Jr. at this event? Do you see their involvement as a positive or negative influence on the cryptocurrency space?\n\nThe presence of political figures like Donald Trump and RFK Jr. at cryptocurrency events highlights the growing importance and recognition of the industry. Their involvement can be a double-edged sword; on one hand, it brings significant attention and legitimacy to the space, potentially fostering positive regulatory developments. On the other hand, their polarizing personas could introduce political biases that might affect the neutrality and global perception of cryptocurrencies.\n\nGiven the current focus on regulating cryptocurrencies, what kind of regulatory changes do you anticipate in the next year? How might these changes affect Bitcoin's global adoption?\n\nIn the next year, we can anticipate more comprehensive regulatory frameworks aimed at increasing transparency and consumer protection in the cryptocurrency space. Regulations may include clearer guidelines on cryptocurrency exchanges, enhanced Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, and more defined tax implications. These changes could boost Bitcoin's global adoption by reducing regulatory uncertainty and attracting more institutional investors.\n\nHow important do you think it is for the cryptocurrency\n\nindustry to have a clear regulatory framework? Do you believe it will stifle innovation or provide necessary stability?\n\nA clear regulatory framework is crucial for the cryptocurrency industry's long-term growth and stability. While there are concerns that stringent regulations might stifle innovation, well-designed policies can provide the necessary stability and security for investors and users. Clear regulations can also help prevent fraud and protect consumers, ultimately fostering a healthier and more sustainable ecosystem.\n\nWhat are your expectations for Bitcoin's price and market adoption in 2024?\n\nIn 2024, I expect Bitcoin to continue its upward trajectory in both price and market adoption. Increased institutional interest, clearer regulatory frameworks, and broader public awareness will likely drive more people to adopt Bitcoin. While short-term price fluctuations are inevitable, the long-term outlook remains positive, with Bitcoin solidifying its role as a global store of value and medium of exchange.\n\nBeyond Bitcoin, which other cryptocurrencies or blockchain projects are you keeping an eye on, and why?\n\nBeyond Bitcoin, I am keeping an eye on Ethereum due to its smart contract capabilities and its ongoing transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Additionally, projects like Polkadot and Cardano are interesting because of their focus on interoperability and scalability. These projects have the potential to address some of the current limitations in blockchain technology and pave the way for more innovative applications.\n\nHow did you first get involved in the cryptocurrency space, and what keeps you invested in it?\n\nI first got involved in the cryptocurrency space out of curiosity and a belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology. The decentralization, transparency, and security it offers were compelling reasons to dive deeper. What keeps me invested is the ongoing innovation and the vision of a more equitable and decentralized financial system that can empower individuals globally.\n\nWhat are your hopes for the future of Bitcoin and blockchain technology?\n\nMy hopes for the future of Bitcoin and blockchain technology are that they continue to evolve and become integral parts of the global financial system. I also hope that blockchain technology will drive greater transparency and efficiency across various industries, from supply chain management to healthcare.\n\n--\n\nIn conclusion, it seems that Bitcoin and blockchain technology continue to evolve, as Taha Abbasi has shared with us, by delving into the impact of the current economic volatility, the role of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, and the potential influence of the 2024 US presidential election on cryptocurrency regulations. He also highlights the importance of clear regulatory frameworks in fostering industry growth and stability while keeping an eye on promising blockchain projects like Ethereum, Polkadot, and Cardano. His optimism for the future of decentralized finance and the transformative power of blockchain technology underscores the potential for these innovations to shape a more equitable global financial system.", "source": {"uri": "gritdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Grit Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fiat money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hedge (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Know your customer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Store of value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://gritdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bitcoin-g8898658b7_640-825x500-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803818", "eventUri": "eng-9803818", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Earlier this morning it surged as high as $62,490.53. The world's oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market cap has also seen $91 billion traded in the past day, according to Coinglass -- which tracks derivatives as well as spot market activity.\n\nIt was only Monday when Bitcoin sank as low as $49,781.93, amid fears that financial markets could be headed for a global recession.\n\nThe rebound is largely thanks to U.S. initial jobless claims seeing their biggest drop in 11 months yesterday.

In particular, Bitcoin plummeted by 20% to the $49K level on Monday but has since recovered significantly.\n\nAccording to data from intelligence platform Santiment, this sharp rise caught many traders off guard.\n\nAs a result, the analysis urged market participants to anticipate heightened excitement that could drive Bitcoin to the price levels of $70,000 and $75,000 in the short term.

This decline was triggered due to the economic policy changes in Japan, which triggered the market sell-off, leading to significant losses across various assets.\n\nDespite this significant drop, Bitcoin's recovery sharply and has grabbed the attention of both crypto enthusiasts and analysts. Michael van de Poppe, a well-known analyst, hints at a \"V-Shape recovery for BTC,\" likening it to past major market disruptions.\n\nAs of now, Bitcoin price is trading positively at around $60,427, reflecting a surge of 5.27% with a market cap of $1.19 trillion.

This forecast indicates that Bitcoin's fundamental strength is still robust, suggesting potential growth opportunities for investors shortly.\n\nMeanwhile, on Friday, August 9, approximately 32,000 Bitcoin options contracts, valued at about $1.9 billion, will expire.

At its core, the Act proposes the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) and a structured Bitcoin Purchase Program, and comprehensive national custody policy. While the bill is quite brief, what follows is a breakdown of the Act's key provisions, their implications, and the innovative funding mechanisms employed.\n\nThe Strategic Bitcoin Reserve\n\nThe establishment of the SBR signifies a paradigm shift in how the United States government manages and custodies Bitcoin at the Federal level. Mirroring many of the best practices currently discussed in the field, such as geographically distributed keys, a cold storage mandate, and independent proof-of-reserves audits, the SBR creates a decentralized network of secure Bitcoin storage facilities across the United States. (Notably not mentioned, however, is a multi-signature system, however it is not explicitly prevented either.) The Act thereby aims to protect against breaches and vulnerabilities to a single catastrophic event.\n\nBitcoin Purchase Program\n\nThe Act lays out a plan to acquire up to 1,000,000 Bitcoins over a five-year period, capping purchases at 200,000 Bitcoins annually, and then holding such reserves for twenty years. Furthermore, the Act places limits on the use and sale of the reserve following the holding period. During the minimum holding period, no Bitcoin held by the Federal government in the SBR may be sold, swapped, auctioned, encumbered, or otherwise disposed of for any purpose other than retiring outstanding Federal debt instruments.\n\nFunding the Bitcoin Purchase Program\n\nIn order to minimize the impact on taxpayers, the Act employs several methods to finance the acquisition of Bitcoin, ensuring economic sustainability without increasing Federal debt.", "source": {"uri": "freedomsphoenix.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "freedomsphoenix.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "freedomsphoenix_readerfour@freedomsphoenix.com", "name": "Freedomsphoenix Readerfour", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Lummis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cynthia Lummis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Best practice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Uploads/Graphics/533-0809071442-hq720-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803818", "eventUri": "eng-9803818", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 30, "textEnd": 39}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

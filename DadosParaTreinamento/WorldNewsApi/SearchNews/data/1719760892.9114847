I bought the navy and the red polka dot too! \" Another satisfied buyer wrote: \"Perfect. Lovely little blouse. I bought a couple last year and am glad to see they haven't changed too much. \"Made of recycled polyester, they won't crease, are light to wear, easy to wash, and the v-neck is very flattering. This year nicer colours, too. I bought both the green and the mauve. I'm a size 22, although some blouses in size 22 can seem big on me. I would say this is slightly on the smaller side, so it fits me perfectly.\" Several people noted that they had to opt for a size bigger for the perfect fit, as one person pointed out: \"Size up. Lovely top and great quality however glad I read other reviews and sized up from my normal size 12 to 14 to allow for the lack of movement at the bust.\" And another said: \"It's a comfortable blouse although I would prefer a few more inches round the tummy. Green is so fashionable this year so I happily wear it with my white skirt and feel really up to date. Trousers would be good too. Yes, a good buy.

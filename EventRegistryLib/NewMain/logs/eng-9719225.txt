He needs to hear, plain and clear, that he is no longer an effective spokesman for his own priorities.\"\n\nThe editorial came a day after Biden forcefully pushed back at critics and insisted he isn't leaving the ticket. Biden argues he's the best Democrat to defeat Trump and has already amassed the delegates necessary during this year's primaries to be his party's standard-bearer.\n\nThe Times argued that Biden has failed to restore confidence in his ability to campaign and defeat Trump.

But Biden is not known as a master of the big rhetorical moment and his recent cleanup efforts have proved inadequate.\n\nThe news conference is expected to start at 6:30 p.m. EDT. Watch live in our player above.\n\nBiden, 81, will close out the NATO summit in Washington -- an event meant to showcase his leadership on the world stage -- with a rare solo press conference. His stamina and effectiveness are under the microscope like never before and he's struggling to quell the Democratic Party's panic about his chances this November.\n\nWATCH: More Democratic lawmakers and donors call on Biden to exit the 2024 race\n\nBy many metrics, from job growth and major legislation to the expanded transatlantic alliance, Biden can point to successes during his tenure in office. But where he has sometimes failed -- spectacularly, in the case of the debate -- is at a defining part of the role that isn't in the official job description: delivering inspiring oratory that commands the attention and respect of the nation.\n\nBiden has tried to step up his performance since the debate but his follow-up interview on ABC last week was disappointing. Nothing he's tried seems to be stopping the bleeding, with more lawmakers calling for him to bow out in the face of concerns that he could hand the White House back to Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\nAmericans tend to regard their leaders less for what they do than how they make them feel, and Biden's debate disaster has shaken his party to its core.\n\n\"The debate was a reminder that you can have as many policies as you want, but what the public sees and hears might matter more,\" said Julian Zelizer, the Princeton presidential historian.\n\nRhetoric is intertwined with the modern presidency, from Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" to Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\"\n\nREAD MORE: Biden borrows tactics from Trump as he rejects calls to step aside\n\nIt can inspire in the wake of tragedy, like George W. Bush's bullhorn speech on the smoky rubble at Ground Zero and help a war- and recession-weary country recover its sense of self, like Barack Obama's \"Yes we can!\" Even Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" cry echoed the temperament of the agitated nation.\n\n\"People saw Trump as a reflection of a more turbulent, chaotic and angry country,\" Zelizer said. \"Voters may see Biden's frailty as a symbol of weakness or its own kind of instability.\"\n\nBiden can give a good speech -- his State of the Union address earlier this year helped quiet doubters about his viability as a candidate. But his strength as a president and politician has been how his humanity in intimate settings resonated with voters, and the power of his personal narrative and down-to-earth roots.\n\nYet those moments, in private or before small crowds, even if amplified on social media as Biden's team hopes, are certain to reach fewer people than the tens of millions who watched his bout with Trump.\n\nDespite a drumbeat of calls from some in his party to step aside, Biden has dug in, insisting he's the best Democrat to defeat Trump, whose candidacy he's called an existential threat to democracy.\n\nHis press conference will be closely watched for his ability to think on his feet, to demonstrate dynamism and to articulate both that he is still capable of doing the job and of winning it once more.\n\nEven before the debate, Biden's victories as president have often come despite his inability to sell them to a skeptical public. Heading into his face-off with Trump he has historically low job approval ratings for an American leader. And he's been unable to overcome voters' pessimism over the direction of the country and a majority of voters in his own party had already believed him too old to effectively lead the country.\n\nWATCH: Biden delivers remarks celebrating the 75th anniversary of NATO\n\nThe debate, rather than helping Biden reset the race against Trump, confirmed voters' preestablished fears about him, said Allison Prasch, a professor of rhetoric who researches presidential communications at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\n\"The president is a symbol,\" she said, adding that Americans often look to the president as a mirror to reflect on their hopes and their fears.\n\n\"You could argue that when you see a president that appears infirm, has difficulty doing some basic tasks of the presidency, you have questions about the state of the nation,\" she said.\n\nShe contrasted his recent halting public comments with his message from the campaign four years ago.\n\n\"In 2020 he was promising to demonstrate confidence in the face of chaos. He was saying, 'I'm this steady force,'\" Prasch said. \"If that's how you branded yourself and you do the opposite thing in this debate, that's exactly why this was so jarring for the public.\"\n\nBiden aides and allies responded to the debate with a series of public pronouncements defending Biden's mental state and fitness for the job, notably focused on the big decisions of the Oval Office, rather than his ability to articulate them to the masses.\n\n\"I have not seen any reason whatsoever to question or doubt his lucidity, his grasp of context, his probing nature, and the degree to which he is completely in charge of facts and figures,\" White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said Monday.\n\nBrett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa and a veteran of four administrations, said he has never been concerned about Biden's decision-making.\n\nSpeaking of Biden, he told The Associated Press: \"I have never seen a president who is not prepared, who is not deliberate, who is not asking rigorous questions of those in the room or of a foreign leader,\" adding that Biden \"makes decisions sometimes which are often difficult decisions, and then actually follows up.\"\n\nWhile Biden and his team have made a concerted effort since the debate to increase his public visibility -- which had been limited by aides worried about Biden's penchant for gaffes or missteps -- he has proven to be uneven and at times underwhelming.\n\nCampaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden delivered remarks for less than 10 minutes at a Philadelphia church and a Harrisburg rally, but spent three times as long taking selfies and hugging kids -- the sort of feel-good content that has always bolstered his political fortunes.\n\nWATCH: New polls show Biden slipping further behind Trump in critical swing states\n\nA call-in interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" showcased Biden's defiance and distaste of party \"elites\" as he pledged to stay in the race.

Roosevelt's \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" to Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\"\n\nIt can inspire in the wake of tragedy, like George W. Bush's bullhorn speech on the smoky rubble at Ground Zero and help a war- and recession-weary country recover its sense of self, like Barack Obama's \"Yes we can!\" Even Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" cry echoed the temperament of the agitated nation.\n\n\"People saw Trump as a reflection of a more turbulent, chaotic and angry country,\" Zelizer said. \"Voters may see Biden's frailty as a symbol of weakness or its own kind of instability.\"\n\nBiden can give a good speech -- his State of the Union address earlier this year helped quiet doubters about his viability as a candidate. But his strength as a president and politician has been how his humanity in intimate settings resonated with voters, and the power of his personal narrative and down-to-earth roots.\n\nYet those moments, in private or before small crowds, even if amplified on social media as Biden's team hopes, are certain to reach fewer people than the tens of millions who watched his bout with Trump.\n\nDespite a drumbeat of calls from some in his party to step aside, Biden has dug in, insisting he's the best Democrat to defeat Trump, whose candidacy he's called an existential threat to democracy.\n\nHis press conference will be closely watched for his ability to think on his feet, to demonstrate dynamism and to articulate both that he is still capable of doing the job and of winning it once more.\n\nEven before the debate, Biden's victories as president have often come despite his inability to sell them to a skeptical public. Heading into his face-off with Trump he has historically low job approval ratings for an American leader. And he's been unable to overcome voters' pessimism over the direction of the country and a majority of voters in his own party had already believed him too old to effectively lead the country.\n\nThe debate, rather than helping Biden reset the race against Trump, confirmed voters' preestablished fears about him, said Allison Prasch, a professor of rhetoric who researches presidential communications at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\n\"The president is a symbol,\" she said, adding that Americans often look to the president as a mirror to reflect on their hopes and their fears.\n\n\"You could argue that when you see a president that appears infirm, has difficulty doing some basic tasks of the presidency, you have questions about the state of the nation,\" she said.\n\nShe contrasted his recent halting public comments with his message from the campaign four years ago.\n\n\"In 2020 he was promising to demonstrate confidence in the face of chaos. He was saying, 'I'm this steady force,'\" Prasch said. \"If that's how you branded yourself and you do the opposite thing in this debate, that's exactly why this was so jarring for the public.\"\n\nBiden aides and allies responded to the debate with a series of public pronouncements defending Biden's mental state and fitness for the job, notably focused on the big decisions of the Oval Office, rather than his ability to articulate them to the masses.\n\n\"I have not seen any reason whatsoever to question or doubt his lucidity, his grasp of context, his probing nature, and the degree to which he is completely in charge of facts and figures,\" White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said Monday.\n\nBrett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa and a veteran of four administrations, said he has never been concerned about Biden's decision-making.\n\nSpeaking of Biden, he told The Associated Press: \"I have never seen a president who is not prepared, who is not deliberate, who is not asking rigorous questions of those in the room or of a foreign leader,\" adding that Biden \"makes decisions sometimes which are often difficult decisions, and then actually follows up.\"\n\nWhile Biden and his team have made a concerted effort since the debate to increase his public visibility -- which had been limited by aides worried about Biden's penchant for gaffes or missteps -- he has proven to be uneven and at times underwhelming.\n\nCampaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden delivered remarks for less than 10 minutes at a Philadelphia church and a Harrisburg rally, but spent three times as long taking selfies and hugging kids -- the sort of feel-good content that has always bolstered his political fortunes.\n\nA call-in interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" showcased Biden's defiance and distaste of party \"elites\" as he pledged to stay in the race. In his opening remarks at the NATO summit, Biden was forceful in defense of the alliance.\n\n\"The more he gets out there to campaign with voters, the starker the contrast and easier the choice will be for these voters: between Joe Biden, a decent man fighting for the middle class and an unhinged billionaire like Trump who wants to terminate the ACA and turn our country into a dictatorship,\" said campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz, referring in part to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut asked in the ABC interview about how he would feel if his candidacy handed the White House back to Trump, he offered a mangled and less-than-inspiring response: \"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that's what this is about.\"\n\n___\n\nAP writer Colleen Long contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "weareiowa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local 5 - weareiowa.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transatlantic relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public speaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_site", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Trade Center site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikhail Gorbachev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princeton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

Again.", "body": "After calling for President Joe Biden to \"leave the race\" for the White House following his disastrous debate performance, The New York Times editorial board has again published a call for the commander-in-chief to \"step aside\" -- and for his Democrat partners to help force him out of contention in November.\n\nThe critical assessment from the Times' editorial board -- a body separate from the newsroom -- asserts that Biden \"seems to have lost track of his own role in this national drama\" and \"he has come to regard himself as indispensable. He does not seem to understand that he is now the problem -- and that the best hope for Democrats to retain the White House is for him to step aside,\" the editorial states.\n\nReflecting on Biden's actions since his botched showdown with former President Donald Trump, the editorial board says \"the intervening days have offered little comfort\" for \"voters who held out hope that President Biden's failure to communicate during last month's debate was an aberration.\"\n\nThe president, \"instead of campaigning vigorously to disprove doubts and demonstrate that he can beat Mr. Trump, has maintained a scripted and controlled schedule of public appearances,\" the editorial critiques. \"He has largely avoided taking questions from voters or journalists -- the kinds of interactions that reveal his limitations and caused him so much trouble on the debate stage. And when he has cast aside his teleprompter, most notably during a 22-minute interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Friday, he has continued to appear as a man in decline.\"\n\nDigging beyond the obvious issues with Biden's fitness and abilities to conversate without a script or specific notes, the Times' editorial board attacks the president's selfishness in his actions that show he has \"discarded the concerns\" of voters \"and put the country at significant risk by continuing to insist that he is the best Democrat to defeat Mr. Trump.\" The ridiculously hyperbolic hand-wringing about a second Trump term aside, this hit against Biden's character is sure to sting the president and his family-turned-handlers.\n\nFor all Biden's talk about \"democracy,\" the editorial emphasizes that Biden's refusal to step aside is an affront to the will of the American people. \"The latest Times/Siena poll showed that 74 percent of voters think that Mr. Biden is too old to serve, an increase of five percentage points since the debate and not a figure that can be attributed to some kind of error or bias.\"\n\nThe Times' editorial even picks apart the letter Biden sent to congressional Democrats this week:\n\nIt's not enough to blame the press, the donors, the pundits or the other elite groups for trying to push him out, as he did in the letter. In fact, to use his own words, \"the voters -- and the voters alone -- decide the nominee of the Democratic Party.\" But Democratic leaders shouldn't rely solely on the judgment of the few voters who turned out in this year's coronation primaries. They should listen instead to the much larger group of voters who have been telling every pollster in America their concerns for a long time. Mr. Biden has to pay attention to the will of the broader electorate that will determine the outcome in November.\n\nThe desperate call to action from the harried anti-Trump writers on the Times' editorial board betrays an absurd fear of another Trump administration. \"Democrats who want to defeat Mr. Trump in November should speak plainly to Mr. Biden,\" the editorial demands. \"They need to tell him that his defiance threatens to hand victory to Mr. Trump. They need to tell him that he is embarrassing himself and endangering his legacy. He needs to hear, plain and clear, that he is no longer an effective spokesman for his own priorities.\"\n\nIn the editorial board's view, \"a whisper campaign is inadequate to this moment, because the moment is urgent.\" The fearful screed warns that the \"longer Mr. Biden continues his grasp on the nomination, the harder it will be to replace him, as he certainly knows.\"\n\n\"...it is increasingly clear that the president is unwilling to accept the reality of his situation,\" the second anti-Biden-2024 editorial from the Times' editorial board laments. \"He is engaging in a staring contest with Democratic leaders, and he appears to be winning.\"\n\nIndeed, it seems as though many Democrats -- perhaps most notably even members of the House's progressive \"Squad\" -- are circling their wagons around the president, in public at least.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_brown@townhall.com", "name": "Spencer Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial_board", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Editorial board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprompter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teleprompter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Direct action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protests against Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/187/34345abb-ce54-4166-af4b-13868ffbc794.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719225", "eventUri": "eng-9719225", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

But he's no master of the big rhetorical moment.", "body": "The President will close out a NATO Summit with a solo press conference.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has a fresh opportunity Thursday to try to prove to the American public that he's capable of serving another four years after his shocking debate flop threw the future of his presidency into doubt. But Biden is not known as a master of the big rhetorical moment and his recent cleanup efforts have proved inadequate.\n\nBiden, 81, will close out the NATO summit in Washington -- an event meant to showcase his leadership on the world stage -- with a rare solo press conference. His stamina and effectiveness are under the microscope like never before and he's struggling to quell the Democratic Party's panic about his chances this November.\n\nBy many metrics, from job growth and major legislation to the expanded transatlantic alliance, Biden can point to successes during his tenure in office. But where he has sometimes failed -- spectacularly, in the case of the debate -- is at a defining part of the role that isn't in the official job description: delivering inspiring oratory that commands the attention and respect of the nation.\n\nBiden has tried to step up his performance since the debate but his follow-up interview on ABC last week was disappointing. Nothing he's tried seems to be stopping the bleeding, with more lawmakers calling for him to bow out in the face of concerns that he could hand the White House back to Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\nAmericans tend to regard their leaders less for what they do than how they make them feel, and Biden's debate disaster has shaken his party to its core.\n\n\"The debate was a reminder that you can have as many policies as you want, but what the public sees and hears might matter more,\" said Julian Zelizer, the Princeton presidential historian.\n\nRhetoric is intertwined with the modern presidency, from Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" to Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\"\n\nIt can inspire in the wake of tragedy, like George W. Bush's bullhorn speech on the smoky rubble at Ground Zero and help a war- and recession-weary country recover its sense of self, like Barack Obama's \"Yes we can!\" Even Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" cry echoed the temperament of the agitated nation.\n\n\"People saw Trump as a reflection of a more turbulent, chaotic and angry country,\" Zelizer said. \"Voters may see Biden's frailty as a symbol of weakness or its own kind of instability.\"\n\nBiden can give a good speech -- his State of the Union address earlier this year helped quiet doubters about his viability as a candidate. But his strength as a President and politician has been how his humanity in intimate settings resonated with voters, and the power of his personal narrative and down-to-earth roots.\n\nYet those moments, in private or before small crowds, even if amplified on social media as Biden's team hopes, are certain to reach fewer people than the tens of millions who watched his bout with Trump.\n\nDespite a drumbeat of calls from some in his party to step aside, Biden has dug in, insisting he's the best Democrat to defeat Trump, whose candidacy he's called an existential threat to democracy.\n\nHis press conference will be closely watched for his ability to think on his feet, to demonstrate dynamism and to articulate both that he is still capable of doing the job and of winning it once more.\n\nEven before the debate, Biden's victories as president have often come despite his inability to sell them to a skeptical public. Heading into his face-off with Trump he has historically low job approval ratings for an American leader. And he's been unable to overcome voters' pessimism over the direction of the country and a majority of voters in his own party had already believed him too old to effectively lead the country.\n\nThe debate, rather than helping Biden reset the race against Trump, confirmed voters' pre-established fears about him, said Allison Prasch, a professor of rhetoric who researches presidential communications at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\n\"The President is a symbol,\" she said, adding that Americans often look to the president as a mirror to reflect on their hopes and their fears.\n\n\"You could argue that when you see a president that appears infirm, has difficulty doing some basic tasks of the presidency, you have questions about the state of the nation,\" she said.\n\nShe contrasted his recent halting public comments with his message from the campaign four years ago.\n\n\"In 2020 he was promising to demonstrate confidence in the face of chaos.

In his opening remarks at the NATO summit, Biden was forceful in defense of the alliance.\n\n\"The more he gets out there to campaign with voters, the starker the contrast and easier the choice will be for these voters: between Joe Biden, a decent man fighting for the middle class and an unhinged billionaire like Trump who wants to terminate the ACA and turn our country into a dictatorship,\" said campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz, referring in part to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut asked in the ABC interview about how he would feel if his candidacy handed the White House back to Trump, he offered a mangled and less-than-inspiring response: \"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that's what this is about.\"\n\n___\n\nRepublished with permission of The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

Susan Walsh/Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Biden has a fresh opportunity Thursday to try to prove to the American public that he's capable of serving another four years after his shocking debate flop threw the future of his presidency into doubt.

Roosevelt's \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" to Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\"\n\nIt can inspire in the wake of tragedy, like George W. Bush's bullhorn speech on the smoky rubble at Ground Zero and help a war- and recession-weary country recover its sense of self, like Barack Obama's \"Yes we can!\" Even Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" cry echoed the temperament of the agitated nation.\n\n\"People saw Trump as a reflection of a more turbulent, chaotic and angry country,\" Zelizer said. \"Voters may see Biden's frailty as a symbol of weakness or its own kind of instability.\"\n\nBiden can give a good speech - his State of the Union address earlier this year helped quiet doubters about his viability as a candidate. But his strength as a president and politician has been how his humanity in intimate settings resonated with voters, and the power of his personal narrative and down-to-earth roots.\n\nYet those moments, in private or before small crowds, even if amplified on social media as Biden's team hopes, are certain to reach fewer people than the tens of millions who watched his bout with Trump.\n\nDespite a drumbeat of calls from some in his party to step aside, Biden has dug in, insisting he's the best Democrat to defeat Trump, whose candidacy he's called an existential threat to democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis press conference will be closely watched for his ability to think on his feet, to demonstrate dynamism and to articulate both that he is still capable of doing the job and of winning it once more.\n\nEven before the debate, Biden's victories as president have often come despite his inability to sell them to a skeptical public. Heading into his face-off with Trump he has historically low job approval ratings for an American leader. And he's been unable to overcome voters' pessimism over the direction of the country and a majority of voters in his own party had already believed him too old to effectively lead the country.\n\nThe debate, rather than helping Biden reset the race against Trump, confirmed voters' preestablished fears about him, said Allison Prasch, a professor of rhetoric who researches presidential communications at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\n\"The president is a symbol,\" she said, adding that Americans often look to the president as a mirror to reflect on their hopes and their fears.\n\n\"You could argue that when you see a president that appears infirm, has difficulty doing some basic tasks of the presidency, you have questions about the state of the nation,\" she said.\n\nShe contrasted his recent halting public comments with his message from the campaign four years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In 2020 he was promising to demonstrate confidence in the face of chaos. He was saying, 'I'm this steady force,'\" Prasch said. \"If that's how you branded yourself and you do the opposite thing in this debate, that's exactly why this was so jarring for the public.\"\n\nBiden aides and allies responded to the debate with a series of public pronouncements defending Biden's mental state and fitness for the job, notably focused on the big decisions of the Oval Office, rather than his ability to articulate them to the masses.\n\n\"I have not seen any reason whatsoever to question or doubt his lucidity, his grasp of context, his probing nature, and the degree to which he is completely in charge of facts and figures,\" White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said Monday.\n\nBrett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa and a veteran of four administrations, said he has never been concerned about Biden's decision-making.\n\nSpeaking of Biden, he told The Associated Press: \"I have never seen a president who is not prepared, who is not deliberate, who is not asking rigorous questions of those in the room or of a foreign leader,\" adding that Biden \"makes decisions sometimes which are often difficult decisions, and then actually follows up.\"\n\nWhile Biden and his team have made a concerted effort since the debate to increase his public visibility - which had been limited by aides worried about Biden's penchant for gaffes or missteps - he has proven to be uneven and at times underwhelming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCampaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden delivered remarks for less than 10 minutes at a Philadelphia church and a Harrisburg rally, but spent three times as long taking selfies and hugging kids - the sort of feel-good content that has always bolstered his political fortunes.\n\nA call-in interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" showcased Biden's defiance and distaste of party \"elites\" as he pledged to stay in the race. In his opening remarks at the NATO summit, Biden was forceful in defense of the alliance.\n\n\"The more he gets out there to campaign with voters, the starker the contrast and easier the choice will be for these voters: between Joe Biden, a decent man fighting for the middle class and an unhinged billionaire like Trump who wants to terminate the ACA and turn our country into a dictatorship,\" said campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz, referring in part to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut asked in the ABC interview about how he would feel if his candidacy handed the White House back to Trump, he offered a mangled and less-than-inspiring response: \"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that's what this is about.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nRepublicans jump-start 2024 election challenges with Trump-inspired lawsuits filed under: President Biden Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transatlantic relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public speaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_site", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Trade Center site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikhail Gorbachev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princeton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

He was saying, 'I'm this steady force,'\" Prasch said. \"If that's how you branded yourself and you do the opposite thing in this debate, that's exactly why this was so jarring for the public.\"\n\nBiden aides and allies responded to the debate with a series of public pronouncements defending Biden's mental state and fitness for the job, notably focused on the big decisions of the Oval Office, rather than his ability to articulate them to the masses.\n\n\"I have not seen any reason whatsoever to question or doubt his lucidity, his grasp of context, his probing nature, and the degree to which he is completely in charge of facts and figures,\" White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said Monday.\n\nBrett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa and a veteran of four administrations, said he has never been concerned about Biden's decision-making.\n\nSpeaking of Biden, he told The Associated Press: \"I have never seen a president who is not prepared, who is not deliberate, who is not asking rigorous questions of those in the room or of a foreign leader,\" adding that Biden \"makes decisions sometimes which are often difficult decisions, and then actually follows up.\"\n\nWhile Biden and his team have made a concerted effort since the debate to increase his public visibility -- which had been limited by aides worried about Biden's penchant for gaffes or missteps -- he has proven to be uneven and at times underwhelming.\n\nCampaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden delivered remarks for less than 10 minutes at a Philadelphia church and a Harrisburg rally, but spent three times as long taking selfies and hugging kids -- the sort of feel-good content that has always bolstered his political fortunes.\n\nA call-in interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" showcased Biden's defiance and distaste of party \"elites\" as he pledged to stay in the race.

But where he has sometimes failed -- spectacularly, in the case of the debate -- is at a defining part of the role that isn't in the official job description: delivering inspiring oratory that commands the attention and respect of the nation.\n\nBiden has tried to step up his performance since the debate but his follow-up interview on ABC last week was disappointing. Nothing he's tried seems to be stopping the bleeding, with more lawmakers calling for him to bow out in the face of concerns that he could hand the White House back to Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\nAmericans tend to regard their leaders less for what they do than how they make them feel, and Biden's debate disaster has shaken his party to its core.\n\n\"The debate was a reminder that you can have as many policies as you want, but what the public sees and hears might matter more,\" said Julian Zelizer, the Princeton presidential historian.\n\n\" READ MORE: Jill Biden, the president's closest adviser, is facing mounting criticism. She's not cracking.\n\nRhetoric is intertwined with the modern presidency, from Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" to Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\"\n\nIt can inspire in the wake of tragedy, like George W. Bush's bullhorn speech on the smoky rubble at Ground Zero and help a war- and recession-weary country recover its sense of self, like Barack Obama's \"Yes we can!\" Even Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" cry echoed the temperament of the agitated nation.\n\n\"People saw Trump as a reflection of a more turbulent, chaotic and angry country,\" Zelizer said. \"Voters may see Biden's frailty as a symbol of weakness or its own kind of instability.\"\n\nBiden can give a good speech -- his State of the Union address earlier this year helped quiet doubters about his viability as a candidate. But his strength as a president and politician has been how his humanity in intimate settings resonated with voters, and the power of his personal narrative and down-to-earth roots.\n\nYet those moments, in private or before small crowds, even if amplified on social media as Biden's team hopes, are certain to reach fewer people than the tens of millions who watched his bout with Trump.\n\n\" READ MORE: Joe Biden hopes these Pa. social media influencers can help him win in November\n\nDespite a drumbeat of calls from some in his party to step aside, Biden has dug in, insisting he's the best Democrat to defeat Trump, whose candidacy he's called an existential threat to democracy.\n\nHis press conference will be closely watched for his ability to think on his feet, to demonstrate dynamism and to articulate both that he is still capable of doing the job and of winning it once more.\n\nEven before the debate, Biden's victories as president have often come despite his inability to sell them to a skeptical public. Heading into his face-off with Trump he has historically low job approval ratings for an American leader.

Nothing he's tried seems to be stopping the bleeding, with more lawmakers calling for him to bow out in the face of concerns that he could hand the White House back to former President Donald Trump.\n\nAmericans tend to regard their leaders less for what they do than how they make them feel, and Biden's debate disaster has shaken his party to its core.\n\n\"The debate was a reminder that you can have as many policies as you want, but what the public sees and hears might matter more,\" said Julian Zelizer, the Princeton presidential historian.\n\nRhetoric is intertwined with the modern presidency, from Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" to Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\" It can inspire in the wake of tragedy, like George W. Bush's bullhorn speech on the smoky rubble at Ground Zero and help a war- and recession-weary country recover its sense of self, like Barack Obama's \"Yes we can!\" Even Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" cry echoed the temperament of the agitated nation.\n\n\"People saw Trump as a reflection of a more turbulent, chaotic and angry country,\" Zelizer said. \"Voters may see Biden's frailty as a symbol of weakness or its own kind of instability.\" Biden can give a good speech -- his State of the Union address earlier this year helped quiet doubters about his viability as a candidate. But his strength as a president and politician has been how his humanity in intimate settings resonated with voters, and the power of his personal narrative and down-to-earth roots.\n\nYet those moments, in private or before small crowds, even if amplified on social media as Biden's team hopes, are certain to reach fewer people than the tens of millions who watched his bout with Trump.\n\nDespite a drumbeat of calls from some in his party to step aside, Biden has dug in, insisting he's the best Democrat to defeat Trump, whose candidacy he's called an existential threat to democracy.\n\nHis press conference will be closely watched for his ability to think on his feet, to demonstrate dynamism and to articulate both that he is still capable of doing the job and of winning it once more.\n\nEven before the debate, Biden's victories as president have often come despite his inability to sell them to a skeptical public. Heading into his face-off with Trump he has historically low job approval ratings for an American leader. And he's been unable to overcome voters' pessimism over the direction of the country and a majority of voters in his own party had already believed him too old to effectively lead the country.\n\nThe debate, rather than helping Biden reset the race against Trump, confirmed voters' preestablished fears about him, said Allison Prasch, a professor of rhetoric who researches presidential communications at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\n\"The president is a symbol,\" she said, adding that Americans often look to the president as a mirror to reflect on their hopes and their fears.\n\n\"You could argue that when you see a president that appears infirm, has difficulty doing some basic tasks of the presidency, you have questions about the state of the nation,\" she said.\n\nShe contrasted his recent halting public comments with his message from the campaign four years ago.\n\n\"In 2020 he was promising to demonstrate confidence in the face of chaos. He was saying, I'm this steady force,'\" Prasch said. \"If that's how you branded yourself and you do the opposite thing in this debate, that's exactly why this was so jarring for the public.\" Biden aides and allies responded to the debate with a series of public pronouncements defending Biden's mental state and fitness for the job, notably focused on the big decisions of the Oval Office, rather than his ability to articulate them to the masses.\n\n\"I have not seen any reason whatsoever to question or doubt his lucidity, his grasp of context, his probing nature, and the degree to which he is completely in charge of facts and figures,\" White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said Monday.\n\nBrett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa and a veteran of four administrations, said he has never been concerned about Biden's decision-making.\n\nSpeaking of Biden, he told The Associated Press: \"I have never seen a president who is not prepared, who is not deliberate, who is not asking rigorous questions of those in the room or of a foreign leader,\" adding that Biden \"makes decisions sometimes which are often difficult decisions, and then actually follows up.\" While Biden and his team have made a concerted effort since the debate to increase his public visibility -- which had been limited by aides worried about Biden's penchant for gaffes or missteps -- he has proven to be uneven and at times underwhelming.\n\nCampaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden delivered remarks for less than 10 minutes at a Philadelphia church and a Harrisburg rally, but spent three times as long taking selfies and hugging kids -- the sort of feel-good content that has always bolstered his political fortunes.\n\nA call-in interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" showcased Biden's defiance and distaste of party \"elites\" as he pledged to stay in the race. In his opening remarks at the NATO summit, Biden was forceful in defense of the alliance.\n\n\"The more he gets out there to campaign with voters, the starker the contrast and easier the choice will be for these voters: between Joe Biden, a decent man fighting for the middle class and an unhinged billionaire like Trump who wants to terminate the ACA and turn our country into a dictatorship,\" said campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz, referring in part to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut asked in the ABC interview about how he would feel if his candidacy handed the White House back to Trump, he offered a mangled and less-than-inspiring response: \"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that's what this is about.\"", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@indianexpress.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transatlantic relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public speaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_site", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Trade Center site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikhail Gorbachev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princeton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

A strong performance Thursday could convince members of his party that he still has the ability both to win in November and to serve a second term.\n\nA weak effort -- or stumbles similar to his debate performances -- could make the calls for him to withdraw grow much louder.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the event and how to watch:\n\nBiden is scheduled to take questions at 6:30 p.m. Biden will be speaking from the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, a short distance from the White House, where many events of the ongoing NATO summit are being held.\n\nCNN reported that 51 million people watched the Atlanta debate, which was in primetime, while more than 8 million people tuned in to watch Biden's ABC News interview live. If networks break into their daily coverage or cable channels carry it live, that will guarantee a significant number of eyes on Biden.\n\nThat's not set in stone, and there's not a ton of precedent.\n\nBiden hasn't held very many news conferences that aren't tied to a foreign leader's visit or trips abroad. Typically, those are what's known in the business as a \"2+2,\" meaning two reporters from the U.S. and two foreign reporters ask questions.\n\nBiden returns to the campaign trail with a trip to Michigan Friday. He will also do an interview with NBC on Monday.\n\nBiden's stamina and effectiveness are under the microscope like never before and he's struggling to quell the Democratic Party's panic about his chances this November.\n\nBy many metrics, from job growth and major legislation to the expanded transatlantic alliance, Biden can point to successes during his tenure in office. But where he has sometimes failed -- spectacularly, in the case of the debate -- is at a defining part of the role that isn't in the official job description: delivering inspiring oratory that commands the attention and respect of the nation.\n\nBiden has tried to step up his performance since the debate but his follow-up interview on ABC News last week did not do much to quell the panic. Nothing he's tried seems to be stopping the bleeding, with more lawmakers calling for him to bow out in the face of concerns that he could hand the White House back to Trump.\n\nAmericans tend to regard their leaders less for what they do than how they make them feel, and Biden's debate disaster has shaken his party to its core.\n\n\"The debate was a reminder that you can have as many policies as you want, but what the public sees and hears might matter more,\" said Julian Zelizer, the Princeton presidential historian.\n\nRhetoric is intertwined with the modern presidency, from Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" to Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\"\n\nIt can inspire in the wake of tragedy, like George W. Bush's bullhorn speech on the smoky rubble at Ground Zero and help a war- and recession-weary country recover its sense of self, like Barack Obama's \"Yes we can!\" Even Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" cry echoed the temperament of the agitated nation.\n\n\"People saw Trump as a reflection of a more turbulent, chaotic and angry country,\" Zelizer said. \"Voters may see Biden's frailty as a symbol of weakness or its own kind of instability.\"\n\nBiden can give a good speech -- his State of the Union address earlier this year helped quiet doubters about his viability as a candidate. But his strength as a president and politician has been how his humanity in intimate settings resonated with voters, and the power of his personal narrative and down-to-earth roots.\n\nYet those moments, in private or before small crowds, even if amplified on social media as Biden's team hopes, are certain to reach fewer people than the tens of millions who watched his bout with Trump.\n\nDespite a drumbeat of calls from some in his party to step aside, Biden has dug in, insisting he's the best Democrat to defeat Trump, whose candidacy he's called an existential threat to democracy.\n\nHis press conference will be closely watched for his ability to think on his feet, to demonstrate dynamism and to articulate both that he is still capable of doing the job and of winning it once more.\n\nEven before the debate, Biden's victories as president have often come despite his inability to sell them to a skeptical public. Heading into his face-off with Trump he has historically low job approval ratings for an American leader. And he's been unable to overcome voters' pessimism over the direction of the country and a majority of voters in his own party had already believed him too old to effectively lead the country.\n\nThe debate, rather than helping Biden reset the race against Trump, confirmed voters' preestablished fears about him, said Allison Prasch, a professor of rhetoric who researches presidential communications at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\n\"The president is a symbol,\" she said, adding that Americans often look to the president as a mirror to reflect on their hopes and their fears.\n\nBiden aides and allies responded to the debate with a series of public pronouncements defending Biden's mental state and fitness for the job, notably focused on the big decisions of the Oval Office, rather than his ability to articulate them to the masses.\n\n\"I have not seen any reason whatsoever to question or doubt his lucidity, his grasp of context, his probing nature, and the degree to which he is completely in charge of facts and figures,\" White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said Monday.\n\nBrett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa and a veteran of four administrations, said he has never been concerned about Biden's decision-making.\n\nSpeaking of Biden, he told The Associated Press: \"I have never seen a president who is not prepared, who is not deliberate, who is not asking rigorous questions of those in the room or of a foreign leader,\" adding that Biden \"makes decisions sometimes which are often difficult decisions, and then actually follows up.\"\n\nIn an interview with Spectrum News earlier this month, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a a former primary rival of Joe Biden's in 2020-turned-ally and Cabinet official, called the Democratic president a \"focused and disciplined leader.\"\n\nWhen asked about his message to people who are worried about Biden's age -- he would be 86 at the end of a second term -- and fitness to govern, Buttigieg hailed the results the incumbent Democrat has been able to achieve in his first term.\n\n\"The president, the boss that I work for, is a focused and disciplined leader, and you can tell from the results that we've gotten,\" Buttigieg told Spectrum News' Taylor Popielarz in an exclusive interview in North Carolina. \"No modern president has been able to deliver as many achievements as he did really in his first two years alone, including, of course, this historic [$1.2T bipartisan] infrastructure package, but also the legislation bringing manufacturing jobs back to places like where I grew up in northern Indiana, the benefits for veterans, the reduction in the cost of insulin, you name it.\"\n\nWhen asked about Biden's demeanor behind closed doors, Buttigieg said that \"it's a lot like what America saw on the night of the State of the Union address,\" a speech which garnered the incumbent a lot of praise for his energy and willingness to joust with Republican hecklers.\n\n\"You've got a leader who's very focused, knows what he cares about, holds everybody who works for him, all of us, to a very high standard and is focused on getting things done, not the noise, the chaos, the divisiveness, but bringing people together,\" Buttigieg said.\n\nWhile Biden and his team have made a concerted effort since the debate to increase his public visibility -- which had been limited by aides worried about Biden's penchant for gaffes or missteps -- he has proven to be uneven and at times underwhelming.\n\nCampaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden delivered remarks for less than 10 minutes at a Philadelphia church and a Harrisburg rally, but spent three times as long taking selfies and hugging kids -- the sort of feel-good content that has always bolstered his political fortunes.\n\nA call-in interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" showcased Biden's defiance and distaste of party \"elites\" as he pledged to stay in the race.

Mr. Biden, though, is not known as a master of the big rhetorical moment and his recent cleanup efforts have proved inadequate.\n\nMr. Biden, 81, will close out the NATO summit at Washington -- an event meant to showcase his leadership on the world stage -- with a rare solo press conference. His stamina and effectiveness are under the microscope like never before and he's struggling to quell the Democratic Party's panic about his chances this November.\n\nBy many metrics, from job growth and major legislation to the expanded transatlantic alliance, Mr. Biden can point to successes during his tenure in office. Where he has sometimes failed -- spectacularly, in the case of the debate -- is at a defining part of the role that isn't in the official job description: Delivering inspiring oratory that commands the attention and respect of the nation.\n\nMr. Biden has tried to step up his performance since the debate but his follow-up interview on ABC last week was disappointing. Nothing he's tried seems to be stopping the bleeding, with more lawmakers calling for him to bow out in the face of concerns that he could hand the White House back to President Trump.\n\nAmericans tend to regard their leaders less for what they do than how they make them feel, and Mr. Biden's debate disaster has shaken his party to its core.\n\n\"The debate was a reminder that you can have as many policies as you want, but what the public sees and hears might matter more,\" said a Princeton presidential historian, Julian Zelizer.\n\nRhetoric is intertwined with the modern presidency, from Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" to Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\"\n\nIt can inspire in the wake of tragedy, like George W. Bush's bullhorn speech on the smoky rubble at Ground Zero and help a war- and recession-weary country recover its sense of self, like Barack Obama's \"Yes we can!\" Even Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" cry echoed the temperament of the agitated nation.\n\n\"People saw Trump as a reflection of a more turbulent, chaotic and angry country,\" Mr. Zelizer said. \"Voters may see Biden's frailty as a symbol of weakness or its own kind of instability.\"\n\nMr. Biden can give a good speech -- his State of the Union address earlier this year helped quiet doubters about his viability as a candidate. His strength as a president and politician has been how his humanity in intimate settings resonated with voters, and the power of his personal narrative and down-to-earth roots.\n\nYet those moments, in private or before small crowds, even if amplified on social media as Mr. Biden's team hopes, are certain to reach fewer people than the tens of millions who watched his bout with Trump.\n\nDespite a drumbeat of calls from some in his party to step aside, Mr. Biden has dug in, insisting he's the best Democrat to defeat Trump, whose candidacy he's called an existential threat to democracy.\n\nHis press conference will be closely watched for his ability to think on his feet, to demonstrate dynamism and to articulate both that he is still capable of doing the job and of winning it once more.\n\nEven before the debate, Mr. Biden's victories as president have often come despite his inability to sell them to a skeptical public. Heading into his face-off with Trump he has historically low job approval ratings for an American leader.\n\nAnd he's been unable to overcome voters' pessimism over the direction of the country and a majority of voters in his own party had already believed him too old to effectively lead the country.\n\nThe debate, rather than helping Mr. Biden reset the race against Trump, confirmed voters' preestablished fears about him, said a professor of rhetoric, Allison Prasch, who researches presidential communications at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\n\"The president is a symbol,\" she said, adding that Americans often look to the president as a mirror to reflect on their hopes and their fears.\n\n\"You could argue that when you see a president that appears infirm, has difficulty doing some basic tasks of the presidency, you have questions about the state of the nation,\" she said.\n\nThe president's aides and allies responded to the debate with a series of public pronouncements defending Mr. Biden's mental state and fitness for the job, notably focused on the big decisions of the Oval Office, rather than his ability to articulate them to the masses.\n\n\"I have not seen any reason whatsoever to question or doubt his lucidity, his grasp of context, his probing nature, and the degree to which he is completely in charge of facts and figures,\" the White House national security spokesman, John Kirby, said Monday.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden and his team have made a concerted effort since the debate to increase his public visibility -- which had been limited by aides worried about the president's penchant for gaffes or missteps -- he has proven to be uneven and at times underwhelming.\n\nCampaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, Mr. Biden delivered remarks for less than 10 minutes at a Philadelphia church and a Harrisburg rally, but spent three times as long taking selfies and hugging kids -- the sort of feel-good content that has always bolstered his political fortunes.\n\nA call-in interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" showcased Mr. Biden's defiance and distaste of party \"elites\" as he pledged to stay in the race. In his opening remarks at the NATO summit, Mr. Biden was forceful in defense of the alliance.\n\n\"The more he gets out there to campaign with voters, the starker the contrast and easier the choice will be for these voters: between Joe Biden, a decent man fighting for the middle class and an unhinged billionaire like Trump who wants to terminate the ACA and turn our country into a dictatorship,\" said campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz, referring in part to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAsked in the ABC interview about how he would feel if his candidacy handed the White House back to Trump, though, Mr. Biden offered a mangled and less-than-inspiring response: \"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that's what this is about.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transatlantic relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public speaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_site", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Trade Center site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikhail Gorbachev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Existentialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princeton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

He has largely avoided taking questions from voters or journalists -- the kinds of interactions that reveal his limitations and caused him so much trouble on the debate stage,\" the Times' editorial board wrote.\n\n\"And when he has cast aside his teleprompter, most notably during a 22-minute interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Friday, he has continued to appear as a man in decline.\"\n\nThe concern about his mental acuity is so great that Democrats \"from the grass roots to the highest levels of the party\" need to \"speak plainly\" to Biden and tell he's \"embarrassing himself and endangering his legacy,\" the Times said.\n\n\"He needs to hear, plain and clear, that he is no longer an effective spokesman for his own priorities.\n\n\"President Biden clearly understands the stakes. But he seems to have lost track of his own role in this national drama. As the situation has become more dire, he has come to regard himself as indispensable,\" the editorial board said.\n\n\"He does not seem to understand that he is now the problem -- and that the best hope for Democrats to retain the White House is for him to step aside.\"\n\nSeveral Congressional Democrats have come out with public concern about Biden in the last week and called on him to step aside.\n\nBut the Times said the number of Democrats willing to speak publicly is just not enough and that the \"whisper campaign\" of Democrats patiently waiting for Biden to come to the decision on his own is \"inadequate\" for this \"urgent\" moment.\n\nThe president has been protected by his aides for years with the frequent use of teleprompters, pre-screened questions, infrequent spontaneous press conferences and hand-picked journalists.

But he's no master of the big rhetorical moment", "body": "President Joe Biden's press conference on Thursday offers him a fresh opportunity to try to prove to the American public that he's capable of serving another four years after his big debate flop threw the future of his presidency into doubt\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden has a fresh opportunity Thursday to try to prove to the American public that he's capable of serving another four years after his shocking debate flop threw the future of his presidency into doubt. But Biden is not known as a master of the big rhetorical moment and his recent cleanup efforts have proved inadequate.\n\nBiden, 81, will close out the NATO summit in Washington -- an event meant to showcase his leadership on the world stage -- with a rare solo press conference. His stamina and effectiveness are under the microscope like never before and he's struggling to quell the Democratic Party's panic about his chances this November.\n\nBy many metrics, from job growth and major legislation to the expanded transatlantic alliance, Biden can point to successes during his tenure in office. But where he has sometimes failed -- spectacularly, in the case of the debate -- is at a defining part of the role that isn't in the official job description: Delivering inspiring oratory that commands the attention and respect of the nation.\n\nBiden has tried to step up his performance since the debate but his follow-up interview on ABC last week was disappointing. Nothing he's tried seems to be stopping the bleeding, with more lawmakers calling for him to bow out in the face of concerns that he could hand the White House back to former President Donald Trump.\n\nAmericans tend to regard their leaders less for what they do than how they make them feel, and Biden's debate disaster has shaken his party to its core.\n\n\"The debate was a reminder that you can have as many policies as you want, but what the public sees and hears might matter more,\" said Julian Zelizer, the Princeton presidential historian.\n\nRhetoric is intertwined with the modern presidency, from Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" to Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\"\n\nIt can inspire in the wake of tragedy, like George W. Bush's bullhorn speech on the smoky rubble at Ground Zero and help a war- and recession-weary country recover its sense of self, like Barack Obama's \"Yes we can!\" Even Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" cry echoed the temperament of the agitated nation.\n\n\"People saw Trump as a reflection of a more turbulent, chaotic and angry country,\" Zelizer said. \"Voters may see Biden's frailty as a symbol of weakness or its own kind of instability.\"\n\nBiden can give a good speech -- his State of the Union address earlier this year helped quiet doubters about his viability as a candidate. But his strength as a president and politician has been how his humanity in intimate settings resonated with voters, and the power of his personal narrative and down-to-earth roots.\n\nYet those moments, in private or before small crowds, even if amplified on social media as Biden's team hopes, are certain to reach fewer people than the tens of millions who watched his bout with Trump.\n\nDespite a drumbeat of calls from some in his party to step aside, Biden has dug in, insisting he's the best Democrat to defeat Trump, whose candidacy he's called an existential threat to democracy.\n\nHis press conference will be closely watched for his ability to think on his feet, to demonstrate dynamism and to articulate both that he is still capable of doing the job and of winning it once more.\n\nEven before the debate, Biden's victories as president have often come despite his inability to sell them to a skeptical public. Heading into his face-off with Trump he has historically low job approval ratings for an American leader. And he's been unable to overcome voters' pessimism over the direction of the country and a majority of voters in his own party had already believed him too old to effectively lead the country.\n\nThe debate, rather than helping Biden reset the race against Trump, confirmed voters' preestablished fears about him, said Allison Prasch, a professor of rhetoric who researches presidential communications at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\n\"The president is a symbol,\" she said, adding that Americans often look to the president as a mirror to reflect on their hopes and their fears.\n\n\"You could argue that when you see a president that appears infirm, has difficulty doing some basic tasks of the presidency, you have questions about the state of the nation,\" she said.\n\nShe contrasted his recent halting public comments with his message from the campaign four years ago.\n\n\"In 2020 he was promising to demonstrate confidence in the face of chaos. He was saying, 'I'm this steady force,'\" Prasch said. \"If that's how you branded yourself and you do the opposite thing in this debate, that's exactly why this was so jarring for the public.\"\n\nBiden aides and allies responded to the debate with a series of public pronouncements defending Biden's mental state and fitness for the job, notably focused on the big decisions of the Oval Office, rather than his ability to articulate them to the masses.\n\n\"I have not seen any reason whatsoever to question or doubt his lucidity, his grasp of context, his probing nature, and the degree to which he is completely in charge of facts and figures,\" White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said Monday.\n\nBrett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa and a veteran of four administrations, said he has never been concerned about Biden's decision-making.\n\nSpeaking of Biden, he told The Associated Press: \"I have never seen a president who is not prepared, who is not deliberate, who is not asking rigorous questions of those in the room or of a foreign leader,\" adding that Biden \"makes decisions sometimes which are often difficult decisions, and then actually follows up.\"\n\nWhile Biden and his team have made a concerted effort since the debate to increase his public visibility -- which had been limited by aides worried about Biden's penchant for gaffes or missteps -- he has proven to be uneven and at times underwhelming.\n\nCampaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden delivered remarks for less than 10 minutes at a Philadelphia church and a Harrisburg rally, but spent three times as long taking selfies and hugging kids -- the sort of feel-good content that has always bolstered his political fortunes.\n\nA call-in interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" showcased Biden's defiance and distaste of party \"elites\" as he pledged to stay in the race. In his opening remarks at the NATO summit, Biden was forceful in defense of the alliance.\n\n\"The more he gets out there to campaign with voters, the starker the contrast and easier the choice will be for these voters: between Joe Biden, a decent man fighting for the middle class and an unhinged billionaire like Trump who wants to terminate the ACA and turn our country into a dictatorship,\" said campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz, referring in part to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut asked in the ABC interview about how he would feel if his candidacy handed the White House back to Trump, he offered a mangled and less-than-inspiring response: \"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that's what this is about.\"\n\nAP writer Colleen Long contributed to this report.\n\nMore from this section\n\nEighteen homebuyer assistance programs offering up to $117,000 are available to help people with disabilities and family caregivers purchase or modify a home\n\nDr. Anju Mathur Supports Chronic Disease Day with Functional Medicine for a Blue Zone Lifestyle\n\nDirect Mail Benchmark Report 2024 reveals 61% of marketers have increased direct mail investments in the last year", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zeke_miller@kulr8.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transatlantic relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public speaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_site", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Trade Center site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikhail Gorbachev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin\u2013Madison", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princeton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

But Biden is not known as a master of the big rhetorical moment and his recent cleanup efforts have proved inadequate.\n\nBiden, 81, will close out the NATO summit in Washington -- an event meant to showcase his leadership on the world stage -- with a rare solo press conference. His stamina and effectiveness are under the microscope like never before and he's struggling to quell the Democratic Party's panic about his chances this November.\n\nBy many metrics, from job growth and major legislation to the expanded transatlantic alliance, Biden can point to successes during his tenure in office. But where he has sometimes failed -- spectacularly, in the case of the debate -- is at a defining part of the role that isn't in the official job description: Delivering inspiring oratory that commands the attention and respect of the nation.\n\nBiden has tried to step up his performance since the debate but his follow-up interview on ABC last week was disappointing. Nothing he's tried seems to be stopping the bleeding, with more lawmakers calling for him to bow out in the face of concerns that he could hand the White House back to former President Donald Trump.\n\nAmericans tend to regard their leaders less for what they do than how they make them feel, and Biden's debate disaster has shaken his party to its core.\n\n\"The debate was a reminder that you can have as many policies as you want, but what the public sees and hears might matter more,\" said Julian Zelizer, the Princeton presidential historian.\n\nRhetoric is intertwined with the modern presidency, from Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" to Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\"\n\nIt can inspire in the wake of tragedy, like George W. Bush's bullhorn speech on the smoky rubble at Ground Zero and help a war- and recession-weary country recover its sense of self, like Barack Obama's \"Yes we can!\" Even Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" cry echoed the temperament of the agitated nation.\n\n\"People saw Trump as a reflection of a more turbulent, chaotic and angry country,\" Zelizer said. \"Voters may see Biden's frailty as a symbol of weakness or its own kind of instability.\"\n\nBiden can give a good speech -- his State of the Union address earlier this year helped quiet doubters about his viability as a candidate. But his strength as a president and politician has been how his humanity in intimate settings resonated with voters, and the power of his personal narrative and down-to-earth roots.\n\nYet those moments, in private or before small crowds, even if amplified on social media as Biden's team hopes, are certain to reach fewer people than the tens of millions who watched his bout with Trump.\n\nDespite a drumbeat of calls from some in his party to step aside, Biden has dug in, insisting he's the best Democrat to defeat Trump, whose candidacy he's called an existential threat to democracy.\n\nHis press conference will be closely watched for his ability to think on his feet, to demonstrate dynamism and to articulate both that he is still capable of doing the job and of winning it once more.\n\nEven before the debate, Biden's victories as president have often come despite his inability to sell them to a skeptical public. Heading into his face-off with Trump he has historically low job approval ratings for an American leader. And he's been unable to overcome voters' pessimism over the direction of the country and a majority of voters in his own party had already believed him too old to effectively lead the country.\n\nThe debate, rather than helping Biden reset the race against Trump, confirmed voters' preestablished fears about him, said Allison Prasch, a professor of rhetoric who researches presidential communications at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\n\"The president is a symbol,\" she said, adding that Americans often look to the president as a mirror to reflect on their hopes and their fears.\n\n\"You could argue that when you see a president that appears infirm, has difficulty doing some basic tasks of the presidency, you have questions about the state of the nation,\" she said.\n\nShe contrasted his recent halting public comments with his message from the campaign four years ago.\n\n\"In 2020 he was promising to demonstrate confidence in the face of chaos. He was saying, 'I'm this steady force,'\" Prasch said. \"If that's how you branded yourself and you do the opposite thing in this debate, that's exactly why this was so jarring for the public.\"\n\nBiden aides and allies responded to the debate with a series of public pronouncements defending Biden's mental state and fitness for the job, notably focused on the big decisions of the Oval Office, rather than his ability to articulate them to the masses.\n\n\"I have not seen any reason whatsoever to question or doubt his lucidity, his grasp of context, his probing nature, and the degree to which he is completely in charge of facts and figures,\" White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said Monday.\n\nBrett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa and a veteran of four administrations, said he has never been concerned about Biden's decision-making.\n\nSpeaking of Biden, he told The Associated Press: \"I have never seen a president who is not prepared, who is not deliberate, who is not asking rigorous questions of those in the room or of a foreign leader,\" adding that Biden \"makes decisions sometimes which are often difficult decisions, and then actually follows up.\"\n\nWhile Biden and his team have made a concerted effort since the debate to increase his public visibility -- which had been limited by aides worried about Biden's penchant for gaffes or missteps -- he has proven to be uneven and at times underwhelming.\n\nCampaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden delivered remarks for less than 10 minutes at a Philadelphia church and a Harrisburg rally, but spent three times as long taking selfies and hugging kids -- the sort of feel-good content that has always bolstered his political fortunes.\n\nA call-in interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" showcased Biden's defiance and distaste of party \"elites\" as he pledged to stay in the race. In his opening remarks at the NATO summit, Biden was forceful in defense of the alliance.\n\n\"The more he gets out there to campaign with voters, the starker the contrast and easier the choice will be for these voters: between Joe Biden, a decent man fighting for the middle class and an unhinged billionaire like Trump who wants to terminate the ACA and turn our country into a dictatorship,\" said campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz, referring in part to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut asked in the ABC interview about how he would feel if his candidacy handed the White House back to Trump, he offered a mangled and less-than-inspiring response: \"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that's what this is about.\"\n\n___\n\nAP writer Colleen Long contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "zeke_miller@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lawn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Lawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary General of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transatlantic relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public speaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_site", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Trade Center site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikhail Gorbachev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princeton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

And with Trump being no better than the failed Austrian painter, well, the Times again ordered Democrats to push him aside.\n\nAdding to Biden's trouble: Actor George Clooney wants his buddy Joe to drop out. He said so in the Times.\n\nThe long knives are out for Joe Biden.\n\n\"Donald Trump's candidacy for a second term poses a grave threat to American democracy,\" the Times began. But \"instead of campaigning vigorously to disprove doubts and demonstrate that he can beat Mr. Trump,\" Biden's appearances have been \"scripted\" and \"controlled.\"\n\nIndeed, the Times continued, \"he has largely avoided taking questions from voters or journalists -- the kinds of interactions that reveal his limitations and caused him so much trouble on the debate stage. And when he has cast aside his teleprompter, most notably during a 22-minute interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Friday, he has continued to appear as a man in decline.\"\n\nThe Times segued into polls that show Americans know Biden can't handle the office. Biden has ignored them. Because of that, and his insistence that only he can beat Donald Trump, the country is in danger.\n\nCentral to his position that he is the best Democrat to run against the Evil Orange Man Bad, Biden has repeatedly \"denied that age is diminishing his abilities.\" He didn't even mention \"the subject in a lengthy letter to congressional Democrats issued on Monday,\" the Times opined:\n\nIn that letter, he insisted that he is the candidate best equipped to defeat Mr. Trump in November -- thereby dismissing the potential candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris or any other younger, more vigorous Democrat, and in effect asking the American people to trust him instead of their own lying eyes.\n\nIt's not enough to blame the press, the donors, the pundits or the other elite groups for trying to push him out, as he did in the letter. In fact, to use his own words, \"the voters -- and the voters alone -- decide the nominee of the Democratic Party.\" But Democratic leaders shouldn't rely solely on the judgment of the few voters who turned out in this year's coronation primaries. They should listen instead to the much larger group of voters who have been telling every pollster in America their concerns for a long time. Mr. Biden has to pay attention to the will of the broader electorate that will determine the outcome in November.\n\nThus did the Times argue against \"democracy,\" which raises the observation that maybe Trump isn't the biggest threat to the nation.\n\nNoting that Biden has admitted he must \"clock out at 8,\" the Times advised everyone from the \"grass roots\" to top Democrats to tell Biden \"that his defiance threatens to hand victory to Mr. Trump. They need to tell him that he is embarrassing himself and endangering his legacy. He needs to hear, plain and clear, that he is no longer an effective spokesman for his own priorities.\"\n\nThe Times averred that Biden can't \"stand up to Trump\" and does not provide a \"compelling alternative.\"\n\nBut other than Virginia's Representative Don Beyer, \"most elected Democrats have resisted taking a public stand.\"\n\nThus, party leaders must tell Biden the very fate of America is at stake. The next Hitler is in the wings, just waiting for election day:\n\nMr. Trump was the worst president in modern American history. He is a felon convicted of breaking the law as part of his campaign to win the 2016 election. Four years later, after his multiple attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election failed, he incited an attack on Congress aimed to keep himself in power. During the current campaign, he has promised an even more unrestrained version of himself if re-elected, even refusing to disavow violence on his behalf.\n\nIf elected, he has promised to turn the federal bureaucracy and even the Justice Department into weapons of his will to hurt his perceived political enemies. (With the aid of the three justices he appointed, the Supreme Court just made it possible for him to break the law in doing so with no fear of criminal prosecution.) And he has made clear that he will surround himself with people who support his plans. He will work to further restrict the reproductive rights of women. He will roll back environmental rules, allowing companies to pollute the water and the air. His belligerent, erratic, go-it-alone approach to foreign policy will undermine the nation's interests and its security, encouraging Vladimir Putin and other authoritarians around the globe. ...\n\nMr. Trump is manifestly unfit to serve as president, and there is reason to believe a majority of the American people still can be rallied against his candidacy. But Democrats will struggle to press that case with voters so long as their own standard-bearer is a man who also appears unfit to serve as president for the next four years, albeit for very different reasons.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election is not a contest between two men, or even between two political parties. It is a battle for who we are as a nation.\n\nOf course, every president makes \"clear that he will surround himself with people who support his plans.\"\n\nThat's what Biden did when he appointed a mentally-ill pediatrician to the nation's No. 2 health post. \"Rachel\" Levine, the assistant secretary of health and human services, is a man who thinks he is a woman. He wants to chemically castrate and surgically mutilate children who are confused about their \"gender.\" Biden also appointed a bald \"non-binary\" sadist to help run the nation's nuclear waste program. Sam Brinton enjoys \"pup play\" and supports underage prostitution.\n\nThat aside, last week's editorial said the very \"soul of the nation\" was at stake and that Biden must step aside to make way for another Democrat to continue his war against decency and normalcy.\n\nThe panic among Democrats and the Left is palpable. It is even more so since a neurologist appeared on NBC to say that Biden had Parkinson's disease.\n\nActor George Clooney's appearance in the Times followed news that Hollywood big shots also want Biden to quit.\n\nNoting that Biden is his friend, Clooney wrote that the issue is Biden's age and \"nothing more.\" He reiterated the Times' earlier plea for Biden to drop out for the sake of \"democracy.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020,\" Clooney concluded. \"We need him to do it again in 2024.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenewamerican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New American"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_cort_kirkwood@thenewamerican.com", "name": "R.

The board first made the plea after Biden's widely panned debate performance last month. In a new piece, the board said Biden \"is no longer an effective spokesman for his own priorities.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden has emphatically said in recent days that he's not abandoning his reelection bid, a decision that continues to divide Democrats eager to stave off former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden's poor debate performance against Trump has set off major alarm bells with many Democratic voters, lawmakers, and donors -- a scenario that they didn't envision in the lead-up to the party's August convention in Chicago.\n\nFor more than a year, The New York Times has extensively covered issues tied to voter concerns about Biden's age, often pointing to polling showing that a majority of the 81-year-old president's 2020 supporters felt as though he was too old to seek reelection.\n\nAfter last month's debate, The Times' editorial board, which operates separately from the newsroom, called on Biden to step aside as the Democratic nominee.\n\nAnd this week, the board once again urged Biden to leave the race, arguing that the president was seeking to \"defy reality\" by remaining the Democratic Party's standard-bearer.\n\n\"For more than a year, voters have made it unquestionably clear in surveys and interviews that they harbor significant doubts about Mr. Biden's physical and mental fitness for office,\" the board wrote. \"Mr. Biden has disregarded the concerns of those voters -- his fellow citizens -- and put the country at significant risk by continuing to insist that he is the best Democrat to defeat Mr. Trump.\"\n\nThe board criticized Biden's dismissal of poll numbers showing him trailing Trump in most national surveys and holding no major advantage in critical swing states, writing that the president has \"adopted a favorite theme of the floundering politician\" by doing so.\n\nAnd the board also pleaded with Democrats -- from grassroots organizers and top leaders within the party -- to have heart-to-heart conversations with Biden about his candidacy.\n\n\"They need to tell him that he is embarrassing himself and endangering his legacy,\" the board wrote. \"He needs to hear, plain and clear, that he is no longer an effective spokesman for his own priorities.\"\n\nWhen Biden won in 2020, many Democrats assumed he would only serve for one term and would be a \"bridge\" to younger leaders within the party. But as Biden defended his reelection bid, he leaned into his age as an important part of his life experience.\n\nThe president in recent days has sought to squelch any idea that he'll forgo his reelection bid. However, several House Democrats have asked him to step aside, and if there's a noticeable slide in his swing-state numbers in the coming days, there will likely be more vocal pressure on the White House as lawmakers eye their political futures.\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to the Biden campaign for comment.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_l_dorman@businessinsider.nl", "name": "John L.

Now, the prestigious newspaper 'The New York Times' said that Biden is embarrassing himself. In a blistering editorial, the news outlet has asked him to withdraw from the 2024 White House race and protect his legacy. It wrote in the editorial that from the grassroots to the highest levels of the party, Democrats who want to defeat Donald Trump in November should speak plainly to Biden. It also said that democrats should tell him that his defiance threatens to hand victory to Donald Trump.\n\nImmediately after the June 27 presidential debate, Biden responded to the media criticism that he could not perform well because he had a \"bad night\" and he was \"screwed up.\" Biden also said that he knew how to fulfill his responsibilities and he would do that though he was not as young and energetic as in his earlier days. He at the same time categorically rejected calls to step down.

There's a simple answer.\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, my newsletter has been dominated by one burning topic:\n\nPresident Joe Biden and his political future.\n\nHis frail performance in the June 27 presidential debate against Donald Trump and a few instances since then have led to an incredible moment. And it has sparked one of the most astonishing questions in the history of presidential politics.\n\nShould the current president of the United States drop out of the race just four months away from the election?\n\nAs this story has gained steam, I've had plenty of reaction from readers of The Poynter Report, spanning across the political spectrum. Two types of responses, however, have stood out.\n\nOne is, who is driving this conversation about Biden stepping away?\n\nAnd, two, why aren't more people -- i.e. those in the media -- asking that Donald Trump, and not Joe Biden, withdraw from the race for the good of the country?\n\nLet's tackle the second question first. The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote an editorial on June 29 headlined \"To serve his country, Donald Trump should leave the race.\" Other than that, and perhaps a few comments made by some cable and network news commentators, that's been about it for the most part.\n\nIn her latest column for Guardian US, longtime media journalist Margaret Sullivan wrote that, of course, coverage of Biden is important. However, Sullivan adds, \"The media coverage is overkill -- not only too much in quantity and too breathless in tone, but also taking up so much oxygen that a story even more important is shoved to the back burner. That bigger story, of course, is the former president's appalling unfitness for office, not only because he tried to overturn a legitimate election and is a felon, out on bail and awaiting sentencing, but because of things he has said and done in very recent weeks.\"\n\nThat includes throwing more lies on a pile of lies that Trump has been stacking for years.\n\nNo argument here. Trump's record and the ramifications for his return to the White House are the bigger story. It should be discussed and analyzed in detail.\n\nHowever, to get to the question of why aren't more media outlets asking that Trump leave the race, there's a simple answer.\n\nIt isn't going to happen. It's an unrealistic proposal. Trump is not going to leave the race, and his party doesn't want him to. Barring something unforeseen and despite whatever threat he might pose, Trump will be the Republican nominee come November.\n\nIt might feel right and honorable for a news outlet or commentator to point out the danger of Trump and opine about why he shouldn't be a candidate for president. But because there should be no serious expectation that he actually would step down, such calls often come off as grandstanding -- particularly if there were no such calls before the debate. To seriously ask him to do so is a waste of time. It's really just another way of saying Trump isn't fit for office, and you don't have to ask him to walk away to make that point.\n\nIn addition, asking Trump to step aside does something even more potentially dangerous: It puts Trump on the same plain as Biden. Simply asking the same question of Trump that many are asking of Biden creates a false equivalency. It suggests that Trump's threats and menace are in the same ballpark as Biden's vitality and acumen. It suggests that Trump and Biden pose similar hazards, and even those who desperately want Biden to walk away wouldn't and shouldn't mean to suggest that.\n\nMaybe that's why more haven't done so.\n\nAgain, one can, and should, make their points about Trump without getting tangled up in asking him to do something he would never do -- leave the race.\n\nWhen it comes to who is asking and urging and begging Biden to not run for president, there's no question that it starts where most political stories start: inside the Washington Beltway and spreading up to New York City.\n\nBiden had barely walked off the debate stage when The New York Times editorial board said he should leave the race. Only certain CNN commentators, immediately after the debate, beat the Times to the punch.\n\nThat opened the floodgates. Other news outlets, as well as plenty of Democratic lawmakers, followed.\n\nOn Monday, the Times editorial board published another piece, this one stronger than the first. In its second editorial (which was rather lengthy for an editorial), the Times again wrote that Biden should not run and that Democratic leaders need to step up and convince him of that.\n\nThe latest editorial, to its credit, did talk at length about the dangers of a Trump presidency, writing, \"Mr. Trump is manifestly unfit to serve as president, and there is reason to believe a majority of the American people still can be rallied against his candidacy.\"\n\nBut it focused on forcing Biden out, saying, \"President Biden clearly understands the stakes. But he seems to have lost track of his own role in this national drama. As the situation has become more dire, he has come to regard himself as indispensable. He does not seem to understand that he is now the problem -- and that the best hope for Democrats to retain the White House is for him to step aside.\"\n\nIn one particularly damning remark, the Times editorial board wrote that Democratic leaders \"need to tell him that he is embarrassing himself and endangering his legacy.\"\n\nThis follows news stories in the Times about Biden and his health, including one about an expert in Parkinson's disease visiting the White House eight times in eight months.\n\nThat led to a contentious press conference with White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre battling the media -- from many outlets -- over Biden's health.\n\nIn her column, Sullivan wrote, \"Of course, the problem certainly is not just the New York Times, despite its agenda-setting influence. It's also TV news, both network and cable. And, to a lesser extent, it's other major US publications.\"\n\nSullivan is correct. It's not just the Times. Pick any national and/or political website and you don't have to scroll too far to get to a Biden headline. Turn on just about any news broadcast and you won't have to wait too long to hear a story about Biden and his future.\n\nRegardless of who is driving the story, Biden's candidacy for November is still being questioned -- by the media, by those in his own party and, polling shows, by American voters.\n\nBiden blames it on the \"elites\" in Washington.\n\nHouse Democrats met Tuesday to talk about Biden, but that resulted in lukewarm support for Biden to stay in the race.\n\nRegardless, it will continue to be a story until either Biden drops out or Democrats reach a point of no return when it will be too late to replace him.\n\nDerek Thompson of The Atlantic tweeted out Tuesday one of the smartest things I've read the past few days on all of this:\n\nWhere I am:\n\nSo the campaign (which I feel some real sympathy for) is left with a strategic Catch-22. All efforts to reduce the salience of Biden's age ironically do the opposite: keeping him away from reporters raises questions, and putting him on camera creates moments.\n\nReplacing Biden with Kamala is incredibly risky. Holding a mini primary is ludicrously risky. There's no point in downplaying the risks here. But high-risk high-reward strategies become more rational as you become more confident in your disadvantage.\n\nI think the main difference between where I am vs. where Biden defenders are is that I've become really, really, really confident that Biden's age -- not Trump, not Project 2025, not January 6, Biden's age -- is the durable centerpiece of this election. It is a profoundly losing issue. And it's not a solvable problem.\n\nPart-time \"The Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart is, first and foremost, an entertainer. But that doesn't mean his political commentary lacks merit. His mini-rant Monday night about whether or not Democrats have time to at least consider replacing Biden as the Democratic nominee had humor and validity.\n\nStewart first took on those who think the election is too soon to make such a drastic change.\n\n\"Four months is for-(expletive) ever!\" Stewart said.\n\nStewart went on to say, \"Can't we stress test this candidacy? Can't we open up the conversation? Do you understand the opportunity here? Do you have any idea how thirsty Americans are for any hint of inspiration or leadership, and a release from this choice between a megalomaniac and a suffocating gerontocracy?\"\n\nStewart joked that he was just spitballing, but maybe the Democrats could get together in a place like, say, Chicago and talk it out for four days to see if it should be Biden or another candidate to run for president. (In case you missed that joke, Stewart was talking about the Democratic National Convention later this summer.)\n\nStewart closed with, \"So, feel free to ignore any obvious weaknesses in your team's existential fight for freedom and democracy, and then just white-knuckle this thing till November. Or take the advice of your own candidate ...\"\n\nHe then showed a 2023 clip of Biden telling reporters \"probably 50 of them\" when asked if any Democrat could beat Trump in an election.\n\nThe one person you would think would be banging the drum the loudest about Biden's uncertain political future has been uncharacteristically reserved in his comments: Donald Trump. (Although, with Trump being Trump, that might have changed between when I wrote this and when you're reading it. He was scheduled to hold a rally Tuesday in Florida.)\n\nTrump appeared on Sean Hannity's Fox News show Monday night. Hannity asked about Biden, and Trump answered. But Trump hasn't gone out of his way to talk much about Biden's debate performance and what it might mean for Biden's future.\n\nHannity asked Trump if he wanted Biden to drop out of the race.\n\nTrump said, \"Well, we prepared for him, but I don't think it's going to matter. We had a great four years, our border was the strongest ever, our economy pre-COVID was incredible, the best ever. But then when we got hit with the gift from China, the China virus, that came and we did a fantastic job.\"\n\nTrump has said that if Biden does drop out, he would expect Vice President Kamala Harris to be the nominee. But he also said he doesn't expect Biden to drop out.\n\n\"It looks to me like he may very well stay in,\" Trump told Hannity. \"He's got an ego, and he doesn't want to quit. He doesn't want to do that.\"\n\nTrump also gently criticized Biden's debate performance before going back to his usual \"Biden is the worst president ever\" talking points.\n\nAppearing on CNN, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman said Trump \"doesn't like being out of the news cycle.\"\n\nHaberman added that Trump has been very active on his Truth Social, it's just that he doesn't want to spend time talking about Biden.\n\nHaberman added, \"I think that he just wants the narrative to be back on him. And I think that he's feeling better about the idea that the race is going to be him versus Biden.\"\n\nIf Trump is seeking more media attention, he is likely to get it if he soon announces his running mate, which could happen at any time now.\n\nESPN's Joe Tessitore, who calls college football and boxing for ESPN, is joining the WWE this summer as a play-by-play announcer. However, according to the New York Post's Ryan Glasspiegel, Tessitore will continue to work at ESPN, too. Glasspiegel reports ESPN has signed Tessitore to an extension.\n\nTessitore is the former play-by-play announcer for \"Monday Night Football,\" and usually gets one of the marquee games of the week for ESPN's college football package. So this is a good get for WWE to land a known announcer.\n\nTessitore will work with commentators Corey Graves and Wade Barrett. The other WWE team is Michael Cole and Pat McAfee, another announcer with ESPN ties.\n\nAwful Announcing's Ben Axelrod wrote, \"Tessitore is the latest figure from the sports world to move to WWE, which has leaned into a more sports-like presentation under the company's president and former sports media power agent Nick Khan. In addition to McAfee being a full-time commentator (and occasional wrestler), former ESPN executive Lee Fitting oversees the company's production. At the same time, TNT Sports NHL reporter Jackie Redmond is a backstage interviewer on the Raw brand.\"\n\nIn Tuesday's newsletter, I wrote about media comments made by former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson. She was executive editor of the Times from 2011 to 2014. I listed different dates for her tenure.\n\nJust one story today because it's powerful and an important read. No one writes with more expertise and a better tone about the topic of guns and young people than The Washington Post's John Woodrow Cox. You might recall that earlier this year, the parents of a school shooter in Wisconsin were convicted of charges related to the actions of their son, who murdered four students. They were the first U.S. parents to be criminally charged in a mass shooting committed by their child.\n\nCox embedded with Michigan prosecutors as they pursued the controversial cases against the parents. The result was Cox's must-read story: \"Guilty: Inside the high-risk, historic prosecution of a school shooter's parents.\"\n\nIn a note, the Post explained, \"For the past two years, Post reporter John Woodrow Cox has had behind-the-scenes access to an unprecedented effort by a Michigan prosecutor to charge the parents of a 15-year-old school shooter with involuntary manslaughter.

But He's No Master of the Big Rhetorical Moment | LatestLY", "body": "Washington, Jul 11 (AP) President Joe Biden has a fresh opportunity Thursday to try to prove to the American public that he's capable of serving another four years after his shocking debate flop threw the future of his presidency into doubt. But Biden is not known as a master of the big rhetorical moment and his recent cleanup efforts have proved inadequate.\n\nBiden, 81, will close out the NATO summit in Washington -- an event meant to showcase his leadership on the world stage -- with a rare solo press conference. His stamina and effectiveness are under the microscope like never before and he's struggling to quell the Democratic Party's panic about his chances this November.\n\nAlso Read | World Population Day 2024: From India to Mexico; Here's a List of Top 10 Populated Countries in the World.\n\nBy many metrics, from job growth and major legislation to the expanded transatlantic alliance, Biden can point to successes during his tenure in office. But where he has sometimes failed -- spectacularly, in the case of the debate -- is at a defining part of the role that isn't in the official job description: Delivering inspiring oratory that commands the attention and respect of the nation.\n\nBiden has tried to step up his performance since the debate but his follow-up interview on ABC last week was disappointing. Nothing he's tried seems to be stopping the bleeding, with more lawmakers calling for him to bow out in the face of concerns that he could hand the White House back to former President Donald Trump.\n\nAlso Read | US Presidential Elections 2024: Sharp 19% Decline in Indian-American Support for Joe Biden, Says Survey.\n\nAmericans tend to regard their leaders less for what they do than how they make them feel, and Biden's debate disaster has shaken his party to its core.\n\n\"The debate was a reminder that you can have as many policies as you want, but what the public sees and hears might matter more,\" said Julian Zelizer, the Princeton presidential historian.\n\nRhetoric is intertwined with the modern presidency, from Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" to Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\"\n\nIt can inspire in the wake of tragedy, like George W. Bush's bullhorn speech on the smoky rubble at Ground Zero and help a war- and recession-weary country recover its sense of self, like Barack Obama's \"Yes we can!\" Even Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" cry echoed the temperament of the agitated nation.\n\n\"People saw Trump as a reflection of a more turbulent, chaotic and angry country,\" Zelizer said. \"Voters may see Biden's frailty as a symbol of weakness or its own kind of instability.\"\n\nBiden can give a good speech -- his State of the Union address earlier this year helped quiet doubters about his viability as a candidate. But his strength as a president and politician has been how his humanity in intimate settings resonated with voters, and the power of his personal narrative and down-to-earth roots.\n\nYet those moments, in private or before small crowds, even if amplified on social media as Biden's team hopes, are certain to reach fewer people than the tens of millions who watched his bout with Trump.\n\nDespite a drumbeat of calls from some in his party to step aside, Biden has dug in, insisting he's the best Democrat to defeat Trump, whose candidacy he's called an existential threat to democracy.\n\nHis press conference will be closely watched for his ability to think on his feet, to demonstrate dynamism and to articulate both that he is still capable of doing the job and of winning it once more.\n\nEven before the debate, Biden's victories as president have often come despite his inability to sell them to a skeptical public. Heading into his face-off with Trump he has historically low job approval ratings for an American leader. And he's been unable to overcome voters' pessimism over the direction of the country and a majority of voters in his own party had already believed him too old to effectively lead the country.\n\nThe debate, rather than helping Biden reset the race against Trump, confirmed voters' preestablished fears about him, said Allison Prasch, a professor of rhetoric who researches presidential communications at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\n\"The president is a symbol,\" she said, adding that Americans often look to the president as a mirror to reflect on their hopes and their fears.\n\n\"You could argue that when you see a president that appears infirm, has difficulty doing some basic tasks of the presidency, you have questions about the state of the nation,\" she said.\n\nShe contrasted his recent halting public comments with his message from the campaign four years ago.\n\n\"In 2020 he was promising to demonstrate confidence in the face of chaos. He was saying, I'm this steady force,'\" Prasch said. \"If that's how you branded yourself and you do the opposite thing in this debate, that's exactly why this was so jarring for the public.\"\n\nBiden aides and allies responded to the debate with a series of public pronouncements defending Biden's mental state and fitness for the job, notably focused on the big decisions of the Oval Office, rather than his ability to articulate them to the masses.\n\n\"I have not seen any reason whatsoever to question or doubt his lucidity, his grasp of context, his probing nature, and the degree to which he is completely in charge of facts and figures,\" White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said Monday.\n\nBrett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa and a veteran of four administrations, said he has never been concerned about Biden's decision-making.\n\nSpeaking of Biden, he told The Associated Press: \"I have never seen a president who is not prepared, who is not deliberate, who is not asking rigorous questions of those in the room or of a foreign leader,\" adding that Biden \"makes decisions sometimes which are often difficult decisions, and then actually follows up.\"\n\nWhile Biden and his team have made a concerted effort since the debate to increase his public visibility -- which had been limited by aides worried about Biden's penchant for gaffes or missteps -- he has proven to be uneven and at times underwhelming.\n\nCampaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden delivered remarks for less than 10 minutes at a Philadelphia church and a Harrisburg rally, but spent three times as long taking selfies and hugging kids -- the sort of feel-good content that has always bolstered his political fortunes.\n\nA call-in interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" showcased Biden's defiance and distaste of party \"elites\" as he pledged to stay in the race. In his opening remarks at the NATO summit, Biden was forceful in defense of the alliance.\n\n\"The more he gets out there to campaign with voters, the starker the contrast and easier the choice will be for these voters: between Joe Biden, a decent man fighting for the middle class and an unhinged billionaire like Trump who wants to terminate the ACA and turn our country into a dictatorship,\" said campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz, referring in part to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut asked in the ABC interview about how he would feel if his candidacy handed the White House back to Trump, he offered a mangled and less-than-inspiring response: \"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that's what this is about.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Americans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transatlantic relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public speaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_site", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Trade Center site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikhail Gorbachev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princeton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

And he's been unable to overcome voters' pessimism over the direction of the country and a majority of voters in his own party had already believed him too old to effectively lead the country.\n\nThe debate, rather than helping Biden reset the race against Trump, confirmed voters' preestablished fears about him, said Allison Prasch, a professor of rhetoric who researches presidential communications at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\n\"The president is a symbol,\" she said, adding that Americans often look to the president as a mirror to reflect on their hopes and their fears.\n\n\"You could argue that when you see a president that appears infirm, has difficulty doing some basic tasks of the presidency, you have questions about the state of the nation,\" she said.\n\nShe contrasted his recent halting public comments with his message from the campaign four years ago.\n\n\"In 2020 he was promising to demonstrate confidence in the face of chaos. He was saying, 'I'm this steady force,'\" Prasch said. \"If that's how you branded yourself and you do the opposite thing in this debate, that's exactly why this was so jarring for the public.\"\n\nBiden aides and allies responded to the debate with a series of public pronouncements defending Biden's mental state and fitness for the job, notably focused on the big decisions of the Oval Office, rather than his ability to articulate them to the masses.\n\n\"I have not seen any reason whatsoever to question or doubt his lucidity, his grasp of context, his probing nature, and the degree to which he is completely in charge of facts and figures,\" White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said Monday.\n\nBrett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa and a veteran of four administrations, said he has never been concerned about Biden's decision-making.\n\nSpeaking of Biden, he told The Associated Press: \"I have never seen a president who is not prepared, who is not deliberate, who is not asking rigorous questions of those in the room or of a foreign leader,\" adding that Biden \"makes decisions sometimes which are often difficult decisions, and then actually follows up.\"\n\nWhile Biden and his team have made a concerted effort since the debate to increase his public visibility -- which had been limited by aides worried about Biden's penchant for gaffes or missteps -- he has proven to be uneven and at times underwhelming.\n\nCampaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden delivered remarks for less than 10 minutes at a Philadelphia church and a Harrisburg rally, but spent three times as long taking selfies and hugging kids -- the sort of feel-good content that has always bolstered his political fortunes.\n\nA call-in interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" showcased Biden's defiance and distaste of party \"elites\" as he pledged to stay in the race. In his opening remarks at the NATO summit, Biden was forceful in defense of the alliance.\n\n\"The more he gets out there to campaign with voters, the starker the contrast and easier the choice will be for these voters: between Joe Biden, a decent man fighting for the middle class and an unhinged billionaire like Trump who wants to terminate the ACA and turn our country into a dictatorship,\" said campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz, referring in part to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut asked in the ABC interview about how he would feel if his candidacy handed the White House back to Trump, he offered a mangled and less-than-inspiring response: \"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that's what this is about.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transatlantic relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_site", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Trade Center site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikhail Gorbachev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public speaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Historian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princeton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

Donald Trump's bid for a second term is a serious threat to American democracy. Instead of actively campaigning to prove his capabilities and show that he can defeat Trump, Biden has been sticking to a controlled schedule of public appearances. He has been avoiding interactions with voters or journalists, which could expose his weaknesses and led to his debate struggles. Even during a recent interview, Biden appeared to be struggling, further fueling concerns about his mental and physical fitness for office.\n\nDespite clear indications from surveys and interviews over the past year that voters have doubts about Biden's ability to lead, he has chosen to ignore these concerns. His refusal to address these doubts has put the country at risk, as his approval ratings and chances of beating Trump have dropped significantly since the debate. Biden has dismissed these polls, claiming they are inaccurate, but the overwhelming skepticism about his fitness for office remains. A recent poll showed that 74% of voters believe Biden is too old to serve, a sentiment that has only increased since the debate.\n\nIn a letter to congressional Democrats, Biden failed to acknowledge the concerns about his age and instead focused on portraying himself as the best candidate to defeat Trump. By doing so, he disregarded the potential candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris or other younger, more energetic Democrats, asking voters to trust him despite their doubts. However, it is essential for Democratic leaders to listen to the broader electorate, not just a select group of primary voters, in order to make an informed decision for the November election.\n\nIt is not enough for Biden to blame the media, donors, or pundits for questioning his abilities. Ultimately, it is the voters who will decide the Democratic nominee, and their concerns cannot be ignored. Democratic leaders must pay attention to the voices of all voters, especially those who have been expressing doubts about Biden's fitness for office. The outcome of the November election will be determined by the will of the broader electorate, and it is crucial for Biden to address their concerns in order to secure their trust and support.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://usanews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/news-10072024-182701.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719225", "eventUri": "eng-9719225", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

A lot and very little.\n\nWe are mostly where we were two years ago. An old president, past his prime, who supports democracy and the rule of law, is running against an old criminal, sexual abuser and serial fraudster who leads an authoritarian movement with fascist accents. The only difference is the old president is two years further past his prime, and the fascist accents are increasingly pronounced.\n\nMost people understand there is no ready solution to President Joe Biden's recent debate debacle. If we haven't heard Democrats clamoring for Biden to be replaced by his vice president, it is because not enough Democrats want Biden to be replaced by his vice president. And if the vice president is not the obvious successor to the president, then no one is.\n\nJoe Battenfeld: Democrats' only play is for Joe Biden to resign, citing medical reasons\n\nWith no obvious consensus among a diverse group of party elites and voters, decision-making remains firmly in the hands of Biden, who ran for the Democratic nomination against minimal competition and won easily. The Democratic bench is unusually robust. But the recent history of challenges to incumbent presidents bred caution among ambitious men and women.\n\nLyndon Johnson faced a challenge. Democrats lost. Jimmy Carter faced a challenge. Democrats lost. George H.W. Bush faced a challenge. Republicans lost.\n\nUnless another geriatric shoe drops, Biden will likely be the Democratic nominee at the party convention in August. But the dynamics of the contest, which weren't great for Biden to begin with, have now shifted further against him -- though the electorate needs time to digest the debate fallout.\n\nGiven the nation's extreme polarization, the effect may be less than many anticipate.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBut democracy is a team sport. The Supreme Court's recent 6-3 ruling effectively afforded Donald Trump immunity from prosecution for crimes, including his attempted coup, as long as he committed them while displaying a presidential seal. This underscored that democracy will remain imperiled throughout this campaign and beyond.\n\nFortunately, Biden has an unusually strong team. It's time to deploy it by campaigning with his cabinet members and running as the chief executive of a complex democratic enterprise where expertise and execution are broadly diffused. In effect, Biden should assume the role of player-coach rather than superstar.\n\nHighlighting his cabinet takes some pressure off the president, but it also conveys a powerful contrast with Trump. Veterans of Trump's cabinet and senior White House staff have called him \"unfit,\" a \"threat to democracy,\" a man constantly seeking to commit illegal acts and \"off the rails.\" A former White House chief of staff said Trump has \"nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution and the rule of law.\"\n\nThese are fundamental contrasts that should be highlighted daily.\n\nThe team approach must respect federal law restricting federal employees' political activities. But it lends itself to important contrasts on issues.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is a dynamic spokesman for the Biden administration's investments in infrastructure -- and all the jobs and productivity gains. From lower insulin costs to progress on climate policies, cabinet members and high-profile members of Congress can reinforce the president's message more aggressively and creatively than reelection campaigns focused on one leader typically achieve.\n\nWhat's more, the Democratic team drawn from Congress and the cabinet is extremely diverse -- another powerful contrast with MAGA. Seeing that diversity on the main public stage with the president, instead of relegated to smaller regional events headlined by select cabinet officials, would be a powerful reminder to a range of voters -- women, Black, Asian, Hispanic, LGBTQ -- that the Democratic Party is not the exclusive province of old white men. It is representative of the diverse America of the 21st century.\n\nIt's not hard to make a compelling case that the federal government, with a budget of $6.5 trillion and a civilian workforce of more than 2 million, is not the work of one lonely soul in the Oval Office. Here again, the typically smooth-running Biden administration, featuring a stable and competent cabinet, offers a sharp contrast with the chaos, incompetence and corruption of Trump's administration.\n\nNone of this alters the singular nature of the American presidency. The president is the ultimate decider, and the Biden campaign will have to show that Biden retains sufficient wisdom and acuity to reproduce his successful first term.\n\nThe president's faltering debate performance can't be undone, and it would be a mistake for Biden partisans to pretend we didn't see what we saw.

But Biden is not known as a master of the big rhetorical moment and his recent cleanup efforts have proved inadequate.\n\nBiden, 81, will close out the NATO summit in Washington -- an event meant to showcase his leadership on the world stage -- with a rare solo press conference. His stamina and effectiveness are under the microscope like never before and he's struggling to quell the Democratic Party's panic about his chances this November.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nBy many metrics, from job growth and major legislation to the expanded transatlantic alliance, Biden can point to successes during his tenure in office. But where he has sometimes failed -- spectacularly, in the case of the debate -- is at a defining part of the role that isn't in the official job description: Delivering inspiring oratory that commands the attention and respect of the nation.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden has tried to step up his performance since the debate but his follow-up interview on ABC last week was disappointing. Nothing he's tried seems to be stopping the bleeding, with more lawmakers calling for him to bow out in the face of concerns that he could hand the White House back to former President Donald Trump.\n\nAmericans tend to regard their leaders less for what they do than how they make them feel, and Biden's debate disaster has shaken his party to its core.\n\n\"The debate was a reminder that you can have as many policies as you want, but what the public sees and hears might matter more,\" said Julian Zelizer, the Princeton presidential historian.\n\nRhetoric is intertwined with the modern presidency, from Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" to Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\"\n\nIt can inspire in the wake of tragedy, like George W. Bush's bullhorn speech on the smoky rubble at Ground Zero and help a war- and recession-weary country recover its sense of self, like Barack Obama's \"Yes we can!\" Even Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" cry echoed the temperament of the agitated nation.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"People saw Trump as a reflection of a more turbulent, chaotic and angry country,\" Zelizer said. \"Voters may see Biden's frailty as a symbol of weakness or its own kind of instability.\"\n\nBiden can give a good speech -- his State of the Union address earlier this year helped quiet doubters about his viability as a candidate. But his strength as a president and politician has been how his humanity in intimate settings resonated with voters, and the power of his personal narrative and down-to-earth roots.\n\nYet those moments, in private or before small crowds, even if amplified on social media as Biden's team hopes, are certain to reach fewer people than the tens of millions who watched his bout with Trump.\n\nDespite a drumbeat of calls from some in his party to step aside, Biden has dug in, insisting he's the best Democrat to defeat Trump, whose candidacy he's called an existential threat to democracy.\n\nHis press conference will be closely watched for his ability to think on his feet, to demonstrate dynamism and to articulate both that he is still capable of doing the job and of winning it once more.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nEven before the debate, Biden's victories as president have often come despite his inability to sell them to a skeptical public. Heading into his face-off with Trump he has historically low job approval ratings for an American leader. And he's been unable to overcome voters' pessimism over the direction of the country and a majority of voters in his own party had already believed him too old to effectively lead the country.\n\nThe debate, rather than helping Biden reset the race against Trump, confirmed voters' preestablished fears about him, said Allison Prasch, a professor of rhetoric who researches presidential communications at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\n\"The president is a symbol,\" she said, adding that Americans often look to the president as a mirror to reflect on their hopes and their fears.\n\n\"You could argue that when you see a president that appears infirm, has difficulty doing some basic tasks of the presidency, you have questions about the state of the nation,\" she said.\n\nShe contrasted his recent halting public comments with his message from the campaign four years ago.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"In 2020 he was promising to demonstrate confidence in the face of chaos. He was saying, 'I'm this steady force,'\" Prasch said. \"If that's how you branded yourself and you do the opposite thing in this debate, that's exactly why this was so jarring for the public.\"\n\nBiden aides and allies responded to the debate with a series of public pronouncements defending Biden's mental state and fitness for the job, notably focused on the big decisions of the Oval Office, rather than his ability to articulate them to the masses.\n\n\"I have not seen any reason whatsoever to question or doubt his lucidity, his grasp of context, his probing nature, and the degree to which he is completely in charge of facts and figures,\" White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said Monday.\n\nBrett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa and a veteran of four administrations, said he has never been concerned about Biden's decision-making.\n\nSpeaking of Biden, he told The Associated Press: \"I have never seen a president who is not prepared, who is not deliberate, who is not asking rigorous questions of those in the room or of a foreign leader,\" adding that Biden \"makes decisions sometimes which are often difficult decisions, and then actually follows up.\"\n\nWhile Biden and his team have made a concerted effort since the debate to increase his public visibility -- which had been limited by aides worried about Biden's penchant for gaffes or missteps -- he has proven to be uneven and at times underwhelming.\n\nCampaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden delivered remarks for less than 10 minutes at a Philadelphia church and a Harrisburg rally, but spent three times as long taking selfies and hugging kids -- the sort of feel-good content that has always bolstered his political fortunes.\n\nA call-in interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" showcased Biden's defiance and distaste of party \"elites\" as he pledged to stay in the race. In his opening remarks at the NATO summit, Biden was forceful in defense of the alliance.\n\n\"The more he gets out there to campaign with voters, the starker the contrast and easier the choice will be for these voters: between Joe Biden, a decent man fighting for the middle class and an unhinged billionaire like Trump who wants to terminate the ACA and turn our country into a dictatorship,\" said campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz, referring in part to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut asked in the ABC interview about how he would feel if his candidacy handed the White House back to Trump, he offered a mangled and less-than-inspiring response: \"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that's what this is about.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nAP writer Colleen Long contributed to this report.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at thestar.com", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transatlantic relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public speaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Historian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princeton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

But Biden was behind before his debate against former President Donald Trump, for reasons that Democrats would rather ignore.\n\nTrump didn't need Biden's debate debacle to have the inside track going into the homestretch. After all, this is why Biden's campaign agreed to debate. Trump's lead and Biden's inability to cut into it, the election's dominant issues, the presumed boost Trump will get from his vice presidential pick, and Trump's strength on the campaign trail, all work to Trump's advantage -- irrespective of who Democrats nominate.\n\nBiden's debate implosion makes it easy to forget the gap Democrats already had to close. According to the RealClearPolitics average of national polling on the day of the debate, Trump led Biden across the board by 1.5 percentage points in a two-way race, 2.6 percentage points in a five-way race, 3.2 percentage points in the top battleground states, and 3.7 percentage points in favorability rating.\n\nSo Biden already faced an arduous four months of public campaigning -- the weakest element of his game, at least until his latest debate.\n\nIn contrast, Trump is strong on the campaign trail and closes well. In 2016, Hillary Clinton had a 7.7-point lead as late as Aug. 10. She won the popular vote by just 2.09 points. In 2020, Biden had a 10.2-point lead as late as Oct. 12. He won the popular vote by 4.4 points.\n\nCompounding Biden's 2024 problem before the debate was his inability to significantly close on Trump, despite massive campaign spending in the months preceding the debate. His additional planned $50 million ad buy targeting Trump's New York felony conviction looks even more like an uphill effort now.\n\nMost importantly, Biden's campaign has flailed on the issues. According to RCP's average of national polls in early July, Biden's approval rating was just 39.7%. Bad as this is, Biden was rated even lower on his handling of the economy, inflation, crime, immigration, and foreign policy. Nor do any of these issues promise to get markedly, if any, better for Biden over the next four months -- certainly not enough to provide any positive political impact.\n\nFinally, Trump's vice presidential selection has always offered a good chance of giving him a further boost. This could be particularly useful in swinging one of 2020's six battleground states to him.\n\nBut doesn't all this go away if Biden is replaced? Nope. A new nominee would inherit Biden's old issues.\n\nEven if Biden decides to withdraw, far from a certainty and something he, his family, and his campaign deny, a new nominee brings new problems. Vice President Kamala Harris, the most logical and logistically the easiest replacement, is viewed even less favorably than Biden. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) is presiding over a basket case of a state -- the Left's failures on steroids. And the process to make either of them the nominee -- convincing Biden to step aside, reaching agreement, executing it, and not creating party fissures in the process -- is far from smooth.\n\nAnd once there, the new nominee would be stuck in the same hole Biden has dug for himself. If you don't believe so, then ask yourself: Is a new nominee going to disavow any Biden stances of the last four years?\n\nAre they going to admit that Biden's overspending helped fuel inflation and that she or he is prepared to control spending? If so, which of Biden's profligate spending programs will be cut -- green energy, student loan forgiveness?\n\nIs the new candidate going to admit that the southern border is a catastrophe and will be closed using the same authority that Trump used four years earlier before Biden and his administration undid them?\n\nIs she or he going to say that Biden's foreign policy has been a fiasco and that his signs of weakness from Day One helped ignite crises across the globe by emboldening Russia, Iran, China, and North Korea, and their surrogates?\n\nThe answer to all of these questions is emphatically \"no.\" It is \"no,\" because anything less will ignite a firestorm within the Democratic base, thereby rendering the party even more divided than it is now. Remember how Democrats got here: Biden was the party's only consensus candidate. Abandoning him means threatening that consensus too.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RESTORING AMERICA\n\nDemocrats' real problem is their collective inability to respond to Trump. It's a problem they have had for eight years.

Biden's most aggressive and vocal advocate is Jill Biden, his wife of 47 years, who argues that her husband has overcome many reverses in his life and can succeed once again. Her support has made a stubborn Biden even more stubborn in his refusal to retire.\n\nNevertheless, fellow Democrats are calling for Biden to step down and enable the party to choose a new candidate to stand against Republican Trump. If Biden carries on, he could doom the US and the world to another four years of the disastrous and dangerous Trump.\n\nDemocrat party strategist David Axelrod told CNN on Sunday that Biden is in denial. He refuses to believe time is a factor, that he still has the ability to function both as credible candidate and president. His poll numbers are low. Nevertheless, he thinks he could win the election by a \"narrow margin\" while, Axelrod said, he could lose by a \"landslide.\"\n\nThis is because in the US system Trump has momentum in swing, or battleground, states which decide the outcome in the Electoral College. Axelrod pointed out that Biden has a fine legacy as vice president during the Obama Administration and president but this would be jeopardised if he should lose this election to Trump. Biden's attitude is that if he gives the campaign his \"all\" and does \"as good a job as [he knows he] can do, that's what this is about.\"\n\nNo, the contest is about stopping Trump which the aging Biden cannot be trusted to do. Furthermore, if Bide continues his bid, he could take down fellow Democrat party senators and members of the House of Representatives. This could give Trump sweeping victories in the presidency and the legislature and enable him to carry out his regressive and repressive policies. While he was in office the first time (2017-21), Trump added three conservative judges to the Supreme Court, making the line up six conservatives to three liberals. This enabled him to engineer the adoption of his agenda on abortion, guns, and immunity from prosecution for sitting presidents.\n\nTrump seeks to expand the powers of the presidency at the expense of Congress and the judiciary which are meant to check an overreaching executive. He has adopted an anti-immigrant policy and plans to deport hundreds of thousands. He is determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act which provides health care to the elderly and poor, abolish the Department of Education, raise tariffs, pursue an \"America First\" foreign policy, and cancel regulations cutting down greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming. In this region, he would resume the \"Israel First\" policy which he championed during his first term in office (2017-21).\n\nTrump relishes the chaos in the Democrat party caused by Biden's refusal to even consider stepping aside. Trump takes the view that he can defeat Biden but might not win if the Democrats adopt a new candidate to top their ticket.\n\nWho could replace Biden? Vice-President Kamala Harris is the most obvious choice. As a member of the Biden administration, she is well versed in its policies. She would also inherit millions of dollars in campaign funds donated for Biden. However, it is not clear that US voters are mature enough to elect a woman to the presidency, even a woman as high profile as Harris.\n\nMichigan's two-term progressive governor Gretchen Whitmer could be another possibility. She has already indicated she could run for president in 2028. Michigan is a key swing state which she would be expected to win. But being a woman is a drawback in the politically backward, male dominated US.\n\nCalifornia governor Gavin Newsom is also said to be eager to stand for the presidency in 2028, but could be drafted to take over from Biden.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg ran for president in 2020 and could be a potential replacement for Biden. Highly regarded Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro could be another.\n\nWhatever happens, Biden will not be missed in this part of the world and Trump will not be welcome. Since taking office in January 2021, Biden has generally followed Trump's negative policies. During his presidential campaign, Biden promised to return the US to the 2015 agreement to limit Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. Although he was vice-president to Barack Obama when the deal was signed, Biden did not revive the deal which Trump abandoned in 2018.\n\nThis has had negative consequences for the region. Iran abided by the deal for a year before breaching its limits by enriching uranium to 20 and then 60 per cent purity and amassing a large stockpile of enriched uranium nearing 90 per cent needed for bombs. Instead of choosing a reformist president to succeed moderate Hassan Rouhani in 2021, the Iranian clerics engineered the election of hardliner Ebrahim Raisi who was killed in May this year in a helicopter crash. While he was in office, Tehran strengthened ties with the UAE and reconciled with Saudi Arabia but remained hostile towards the US and the West. Sanctions which have crippled Iran's economy have multiplied.\n\nBiden largely followed Trump's example when dealing with the Palestinians. Biden resumed funding UNRWA, the agency caring for Palestinian refugees which Trump cancelled but Biden did not reopen the Trump-closed US consulate in occupied East Jerusalem or the Palestinian mission in Washington. Biden did nothing to press for negotiations on the two-state solution for the emergence of a Palestinian state which is opposed by Trump.\n\nSince Oct.7 last year, Biden has armed and funded Israel in its deadly and devastating war on Gaza which has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, wounded 87,000, buried 8,000 beneath the rubble of their homes, and turned Gaza into a wasteland. His support for Israel's war on Gaza has transformed Arab relations with the US and encouraged Arab leaders to turn to Russia, China, and the Global South for political support and trade. The re-election of either Biden or Trump can only accelerate this pivot away from the US. If Biden is replaced, there is a slim chance he or she could adopt respectable regional policies.", "source": {"uri": "gulftoday.ae", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Gulf Today"}, "authors": [],

His refusal to accept that he's down in the polls and that he is, indeed, frail and only getting older shows a complete lack of judgment. When he broke into a goofy grin several times, it appeared he wasn't taking Stephanopoulos's questions and comments seriously. Shame on those Democrats (and that includes Gov. Walz) who continue to support Biden (Biden's debate \"performance\" was not just a bad night).\n\nDean Phillips has been one of the few who has the guts to say it's time for Biden to move on, yet Phillips received great pushback and criticism for speaking the truth and trying to do something to encourage Biden to drop out months ago. We need more courageous politicians and donors to continue pushing until Biden hands over the keys. This is one decision that should not be left up to Joe Biden.\n\nThese days I am Alice, plunging down the rabbit hole where everything is upside down. The latest example is the horde of Democratic lawmakers begging Biden to step aside for the crime of becoming an octogenarian.\n\nBut not a single Republican has the moral courage to confront their nominee and urge him to step down. Their felon has been convicted of 34 counts, with more serious charges to come. If Donald was Pinocchio Trump his nose would be as long as a broom handle. His morals are reprehensible and he has fractured those Ten Commandments his followers are so eager to post in our public schools. This party, that I used to respect, has used gerrymandering, the Supreme Court, and an actual insurrection to grasp power instead of designing thoughtful policies to solve the many challenges we face. They have set the bar so low for their candidate that you need to dig to find it.\n\nIf you really listen to him and his cronies, it is obvious that he means to tear the fabric of our institutions to shreds and destroy this magnificent country. I ask you, Republican citizens, is this really the best you can do?\n\nDuring the interview of President Biden by George Stephanopoulos on July, 5, President Biden was asked about taking a cognitive test. He responded, I take a cognitive test every day ... \"I am not only campaigning, I'm running the world.\" This man may have cognitive issues, but one would also wonder if he has advanced delusional issues. I can only wonder what thoughts went through the minds of Netanyahu, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un or Putin, et al.\n\nWhen Donald Trump takes part in a debate he will always have the advantage. Trump has no need to recall facts or policies even if he could. He does not even attempt to answer questions but merely falls back on one of his favorite rants. Nothing he says needs to be factual or even make sense. He is essentially a combination standup comedian and shock-jock.\n\nOne traditional dance style is named the waltz. Waltz is a German word meaning to roll or to revolve.\n\nOur Gov. Tim Walz has implied that President Biden's debate debacle was influenced by his having taken time, the day before the debate, \"calling out here to see how the flood recovery was going.\"\n\nWalz now contends that our country's Democratic governors continue to support President Joe Biden, and that he is 'fit for office\" ... even as concerns are growing among Democrats as to whether the president can continue his campaign for a second term or for his current term in office.\n\nWhen accompanied by his Feeding our Future \"waltz,\" Tim Walz has well established his rolling and revolving style of governing.\n\nIt has been reported, \"The bottom line is, we're not going anywhere. I am not going anywhere!\" Biden boomed through the phone. \"I wouldn't be running if I didn't absolutely believe that I am the best candidate to beat Donald Trump in 2024.\"\n\nPresident Biden argued that bowing out of the race, as some Democratic lawmakers have urged him to do, would go against the wishes of Democratic voters.\n\nHe possibly is correct that many Democratic voters may not want him to drop out. But he is running for the American presidency and needs more votes than just Democrats to win.

However, this isn't true because Biden hasn't announced any such thing. Trump sent an email to his followers claiming this. The subject line read \"President Kamala Harris?\" In it, he asked, \"Did you hear that Crooked Joe Biden is dropping out of the race?\" Trump also said the \"fake news media\" had turned on Biden. He wrote that Biden was \"getting KILLED in the polls!\" using big red letters for \"killed.\"\n\nTrump has made false claims before. His campaign often uses strong language in fundraising messages to grab attention and raise money. For example, one email said, \"1 MONTH UNTIL ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE!\" Another claimed, \"JUSTICE IS DEAD IN AMERICA!\" Some Republican fundraisers aren't happy about this approach. They worry it might tire out donors. One GOP consultant said, \"When you're already talking about the death penalty in June, what are you going to say in October?\" as per The Raw Story.\n\nBiden is not showing any indications of quitting. He recently informed Democrats in Congress, \"I wouldn't be running again if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024. We had a Democratic nomination process and the voters have spoken clearly and decisively.\" However, Brian Gardner a Policy Strategist, who analyzes political impacts on U.S. capital markets, believes there is a 40% possibility Biden will not seek for reelection. Nonetheless, Gardner believes Biden is likely to remain in the campaign. Gardner remarked, \"Biden loves to prove the smart kids in the Democratic Party wrong. So, the more he hears voices from the elites that he needs to get out, the more he digs in his heels,\" according to CNBC.\n\nAlthough, Trump believes Biden will not withdraw from the 2024 presidential campaign. This was stated in his recent Fox News interview. \"It looks to me like he very well may stay in,\" the president said. \"Nobody wants to give that up that way,\" according to him. He thinks Biden's ego will keep him going. Biden has received some criticism recently. A few Democrats are concerned about his performance in the latest debate with Trump, claiming he appeared confused at moments. Some even propose that he move aside for a younger candidate.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that presidential races can turn fast. What appears true one day may not be the next. As voters, we must carefully verify the facts and not believe everything we hear, particularly from politicians themselves. While all this is going on with Biden, Trump is about to announce his running mate. He is anticipated to do this soon, perhaps just before or during the Republican National Convention next week.", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_Story", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raw Story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2024_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/704094/uploads/7e0332a0-3dd2-11ef-864c-d712357af750_1200_630.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719225", "eventUri": "eng-9719225", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

On Thursday, he'll hold a news conference, and Monday he is to be interviewed by NBC News' Lester Holt.\n\nYet his grip on his party's nomination remains precarious, even as the tide of lawmakers calling for him to step aside seems to have slackened for now. Many Democratic lawmakers, donors and strategists say he still hasn't displayed the vigor Americans expect of a president. They'd like him to quit the race, an invitation Biden has refused.\n\n\"The campaign needs to accept that it [the debate] wasn't just a blip, this is a real problem,\" Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., said in an interview. \"They also need to understand that we have to get him out and do more public-facing events that are unscripted. If he's able to do that, that's great, let him do it. If he's not able to do that, then we really have to think about whether he's the right person to move forward to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.\"\n\nBiden's events in the two weeks since the debate underscore why doubts persist. Aides have drawn a cordon around him with the point of minimizing potential embarrassment. A controlling communications operation limits the more free-wheeling exchanges with the media that other presidents were more willing to accept.\n\nAt a surface level, Biden's schedule seems to meet the test Democratic lawmakers have set for him.\n\n\"The president is out there,\" Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of Biden's campaign, said Tuesday in an interview with MSNBC. \"He is addressing those concerns. He's showing his vigor; he's showing his determination. And we should support that and keep going forward.\"\n\nA closer look suggests that he's still being protected in ways that could make his halting debate performance tougher to un-see. By trying to shield an aging president, his team may be reinforcing perceptions that he can't function without intensive stage management.\n\nLast week, Biden called in to two radio stations to take questions -- the sort of step Democratic leaders thought would be important to show he can think on his feet.\n\nUnbeknownst to listeners, Biden's campaign had supplied the hosts with questions in advance.\n\n\"I've been doing this for decades, and I have never once fed a reporter questions to ask the principal,\" said a veteran of Barack Obama's administration.\n\nBiden was at times incoherent, despite the built-in advantage of being able to anticipate the questions. Speaking to WURD radio in Philadelphia on July 3, he said: \"By the way, I'm proud to be, as I said, the first vice president -- first Black woman -- to serve with a Black president ...\"\n\nAmid the blowback over pre-approved questions, Biden's campaign team said it won't do that again.\n\nLast Friday, Biden sat down for an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. When it was over, Biden's campaign team scrambled to render one answer at least somewhat more intelligible than it sounded at the time.\n\nHow, Stephanopoulos asked, would Biden feel if he were to lose to Trump? It sounded as though Biden said he wanted to do the \"goodest\" job he could. That non-word produced a torrent of social media mockery.\n\nInitially, ABC News used the word \"goodest\" in the transcript it posted. The Biden campaign then contacted the network to object, saying Biden had actually said something else. ABC News excised the word and quoted Biden saying: \"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that's what this is about.\"\n\nCiting the updated transcript, Biden campaign aides contacted other news outlets, including NBC News, to ask that the word \"goodest\" be removed from coverage.\n\n(A Biden campaign spokesperson said in response to a question about efforts to strike the word: \"ABC made an error in their transcript and corrected it. We then flagged it for reporters.\")\n\nA town hall-style event is another way presidents have typically sought to escape the insularity of the West Wing and hear from real voters, with the news media able to watch the exchanges. The last two Democratic presidents, Obama and Bill Clinton, held a slew of town hall events during their time in office.\n\nAfter the debate, some lawmakers called upon Biden to hold a town hall so the nation could see him fielding unvetted questions in real time.\n\n\"He needs to do town halls and small roundtables with voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia and be as visible with voters as possible,\" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told NBC News.\n\nSince he squared off with Trump, Biden has yet to do a town hall event. The campaign spokesperson said: \"Our events in Wisconsin and across Pennsylvania in the last week alone have allowed the president to speak directly, one on one, with dozens of voters.\"\n\nA town hall is a high-risk proposition, with the president unable to rely on a teleprompter or written notes.\n\nBiden has availed himself of both those aids since the debate. He called into MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Monday and insisted he was in the race to stay. He didn't appear on camera, so people couldn't see him. But at one point, as he said he was \"reading from a list of lies\" from Trump, listeners could hear papers rustling in the background.\n\n\"They're so afraid that his shortcomings will become manifest,\" Mike McCurry, a White House press secretary under Bill Clinton, said of Biden's team.\n\nIn their zeal to present Biden in the most favorable public light, his campaign has used aggressive measures that run counter to his avowed respect for the free press.\n\nA New York Times reporter wrote on social media last month that, at a Las Vegas rally for Vice President Kamala Harris, a Biden campaign staffer interrupted interviews he was doing with voters once the comments turned critical of Biden.\n\nBiden campaign staff members have at times insisted that at events, a staff member be present for reporter interviews with voters who are part of the crowd. Biden campaign staff members shadowed an NBC News reporter in Philadelphia in April as he interviewed volunteers attending the opening of a new office.\n\nAt a Biden campaign event this year in a battleground state, another NBC News reporter asked staff members whether the reporter could interview voters. The campaign offered up a Democratic consultant without disclosing that was the person's role.\n\nAsked about the incident, the Biden campaign said: \"If that was someone's experience it should not have been, and we've taken steps to ensure all staff understands our policy.\"\n\nMcCurry said he doesn't fault Biden's advisers. With the caveat that he said he has no inside knowledge of what Biden aides have been telling the boss, McCurry added: \"I feel so sorry for the folks around him, most of whom I know pretty well. I believe they have tried carefully to explain reality to him. ... They've tried to present the truth to him, but in the end it's up to Biden. He's the guy who has to decide whether he's up to this or not.\"\n\nBiden's next big test comes Thursday, at the end of a three-day NATO summit meeting in Washington. He'll take part in a news conference with reporters who've been probing whether he has a more serious physical condition than the White House has let on.\n\nA news conference is even more of a high-wire act than a town hall, giving Biden a fresh chance to allay concerns about his sharpness. Some wonder whether it's coming too late or whether impressions of Biden's frailties have already hardened.\n\nCarol Moseley Braun of Illinois, the first Black woman elected to the U.S. Senate and a delegate at the coming Democratic National Convention, said the White House has waited too long to counter the fallout from the debate. Biden has been too insulated from the public, she said, a dynamic that has worked to his disadvantage.\n\n\"They should have gotten on it right away, and they didn't. I guess they thought it would go away and were surprised, I think, as I am, that it had legs,\" she said of the debate.\n\n\"But it really did, and people are still talking about it two weeks later, and that's unfortunate for a good president.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But he's no master of big rhetorical moment", "body": "WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden has a fresh opportunity Thursday to try to prove to the American public that he's capable of serving another four years after his shocking debate flop threw the future of his presidency into doubt. But Biden is not known as a master of the big rhetorical moment and his recent cleanup efforts have proved inadequate.\n\nBiden, 81, will close out the NATO summit in Washington -- an event meant to showcase his leadership on the world stage -- with a rare solo press conference. His stamina and effectiveness are under the microscope like never before and he's struggling to quell the Democratic Party's panic about his chances this November.\n\nBy many metrics, from job growth and major legislation to the expanded transatlantic alliance, Biden can point to successes during his tenure in office. But where he has sometimes failed -- spectacularly, in the case of the debate -- is at a defining part of the role that isn't in the official job description: Delivering inspiring oratory that commands the attention and respect of the nation.\n\nBiden has tried to step up his performance since the debate but his follow-up interview on ABC last week was disappointing. Nothing he's tried seems to be stopping the bleeding, with more lawmakers calling for him to bow out in the face of concerns that he could hand the White House back to former President Donald Trump.\n\nAmericans tend to regard their leaders less for what they do than how they make them feel, and Biden's debate disaster has shaken his party to its core.\n\n\"The debate was a reminder that you can have as many policies as you want, but what the public sees and hears might matter more,\" said Julian Zelizer, the Princeton presidential historian.\n\nRhetoric is intertwined with the modern presidency, from Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" to Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\"\n\nIt can inspire in the wake of tragedy, like George W. Bush's bullhorn speech on the smoky rubble at Ground Zero and help a war- and recession-weary country recover its sense of self, like Barack Obama's \"Yes we can!\" Even Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" cry echoed the temperament of the agitated nation.\n\n\"People saw Trump as a reflection of a more turbulent, chaotic and angry country,\" Zelizer said. \"Voters may see Biden's frailty as a symbol of weakness or its own kind of instability.\"", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@newindianexpress.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transatlantic relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public speaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_site", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Trade Center site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikhail Gorbachev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princeton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

A lot and very little.\n\nWe are mostly where we were two years ago. An old president, past his prime, who supports democracy and the rule of law, is running against an old criminal, sexual abuser and serial fraudster who leads an authoritarian movement with fascist accents. The only difference is the old president is two years further past his prime, and the fascist accents are increasingly pronounced.\n\nMost people understand there is no ready solution to President Joe Biden's recent debate debacle. If we haven't heard Democrats clamoring for Biden to be replaced by his vice president, it is because not enough Democrats want Biden to be replaced by his vice president. And if the vice president is not the obvious successor to the president, then no one is.\n\nJoe Battenfeld: Democrats' only play is for Joe Biden to resign, citing medical reasons\n\nWith no obvious consensus among a diverse group of party elites and voters, decision-making remains firmly in the hands of Biden, who ran for the Democratic nomination against minimal competition and won easily. The Democratic bench is unusually robust. But the recent history of challenges to incumbent presidents bred caution among ambitious men and women.\n\nLyndon Johnson faced a challenge. Democrats lost. Jimmy Carter faced a challenge. Democrats lost. George H.W. Bush faced a challenge. Republicans lost.\n\nUnless another geriatric shoe drops, Biden will likely be the Democratic nominee at the party convention in August. But the dynamics of the contest, which weren't great for Biden to begin with, have now shifted further against him -- though the electorate needs time to digest the debate fallout.\n\nGiven the nation's extreme polarization, the effect may be less than many anticipate.\n\nBut democracy is a team sport. The Supreme Court's recent 6-3 ruling effectively afforded Donald Trump immunity from prosecution for crimes, including his attempted coup, as long as he committed them while displaying a presidential seal. This underscored that democracy will remain imperiled throughout this campaign and beyond.\n\nFortunately, Biden has an unusually strong team. It's time to deploy it by campaigning with his cabinet members and running as the chief executive of a complex democratic enterprise where expertise and execution are broadly diffused. In effect, Biden should assume the role of player-coach rather than superstar.\n\nHighlighting his cabinet takes some pressure off the president, but it also conveys a powerful contrast with Trump. Veterans of Trump's cabinet and senior White House staff have called him \"unfit,\" a \"threat to democracy,\" a man constantly seeking to commit illegal acts and \"off the rails.\" A former White House chief of staff said Trump has \"nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution and the rule of law.\"\n\nThese are fundamental contrasts that should be highlighted daily.\n\nThe team approach must respect federal law restricting federal employees' political activities. But it lends itself to important contrasts on issues.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is a dynamic spokesman for the Biden administration's investments in infrastructure -- and all the jobs and productivity gains. From lower insulin costs to progress on climate policies, cabinet members and high-profile members of Congress can reinforce the president's message more aggressively and creatively than reelection campaigns focused on one leader typically achieve.\n\nWhat's more, the Democratic team drawn from Congress and the cabinet is extremely diverse -- another powerful contrast with MAGA. Seeing that diversity on the main public stage with the president, instead of relegated to smaller regional events headlined by select cabinet officials, would be a powerful reminder to a range of voters -- women, Black, Asian, Hispanic, LGBTQ -- that the Democratic Party is not the exclusive province of old white men. It is representative of the diverse America of the 21st century.\n\nIt's not hard to make a compelling case that the federal government, with a budget of $6.5 trillion and a civilian workforce of more than 2 million, is not the work of one lonely soul in the Oval Office. Here again, the typically smooth-running Biden administration, featuring a stable and competent cabinet, offers a sharp contrast with the chaos, incompetence and corruption of Trump's administration.\n\nNone of this alters the singular nature of the American presidency. The president is the ultimate decider, and the Biden campaign will have to show that Biden retains sufficient wisdom and acuity to reproduce his successful first term.\n\nThe president's faltering debate performance can't be undone, and it would be a mistake for Biden partisans to pretend we didn't see what we saw. Honesty is one of the most important contrasts with Trump, whose relentless lying at the debate, like his criminality, would be disqualifying in any remotely healthy political party.\n\nDemocracy and the rule of law are on the ropes in the U.S., and the MAGA Supreme Court just delivered more body blows. It's going to take collective action to save them. Biden should model that collective action in his campaign. He alone cannot fix it.\n\nCatch the latest in Opinion\n\nGet opinion pieces, letters and editorials sent directly to your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "dothaneagle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dothan Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "susan_walsh@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Susan Walsh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Meanwhile, the commander-in-chief's approval ratings are cratering and the party splintering as calls grow louder for the president to exit the race.\n\nWith less than 120 days until voters head to the polls, Biden has fallen into the political sunken place; the same place Trump has found himself in so many times before. Now, for the first time, both candidates are on equal political footing as they each confront a crisis in confidence from the voters.\n\nIf a day in presidential politics is considered a lifetime, that demoralizing 90-minute performance Biden turned in on the debate stage in Atlanta has become a death knell. Biden's horrible showing sent panic through democratic circles and has completely changed the trajectory of this race.\n\nNow, for the first time this election cycle, Trump is no longer the star of the show, replaced in top billing by Biden's diminished cognitive capacity. Concerns about the president's age and health are seeing Democrats openly call for his immediate removal as the nominee for the party. Though only a small cadre of congressional lawmakers and candidates have publicly pressed for change, the minuscule yet booming voices have shook the tone and tenor of the race sending the Biden campaign and the entire Democratic infrastructure into a frenzy.\n\nDown ballot candidates are now fearful a listless and frail President Biden could doom their chances to maintain control of the Senate and retake the House in November. Once averse to public presentations and media outreach, the president is now engaging the press and even participating in off-the-cuff outreach efforts to calm a weary public and panic-stricken party. After watching Trump manage a cavalcade of firestorms impacting his candidacy, it is now Joe Biden on the hot seat.\n\nTo be clear, Biden's advanced age has been his Achilles heel the moment he was announced the winner in November of 2020. Moreover, consistently eschewing the stagecraft of the presidency and invoking an uncanny disdain for engaging in the the optics of doing the job, Biden erected barriers that walled him off from the voters.\n\nThese same barriers also created distance between the voters and the president's many hard-fought legislative victories. More daunting and debilitating by long absences from the public eye, it made it impossible for the Biden White House to effectively convey a message of success to the American people.\n\nAs a result, Biden's approval ratings fell to alarmingly low levels. Still, the White House stayed the course, focusing on accruing one victory after another, even as millions of Americans remained clueless and even worse, ambivalent about these achievements.\n\nNow, a crisis that could level the president's hopes for a second term and threaten Biden's chances at electoral immortality is a very real possibility. Like his political opponent, Biden is now fighting battles on multiple fronts and it is unclear if, at 81 years of age, he has the stamina, clarity, and cognition to muster a viable defence.\n\nA once-powerful donor base now questioning their investment in the campaign; congressional lawmakers and candidates actively pushing for change; and an unforgiving press corps setting the narrative rather than reporting it. These are the many challenges fast closing in on the life-long politician's re-election ambitions.\n\nSupporters wait for Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at Trump National Doral Miami on July 9, 2024, in Doral, Fla. (Rebecca Blackwell / AP Photo)\n\nHowever, unlike Trump, who relishes the fights and even at 78 still shows a penchant for parrying and blocking a multitude of attacks, Biden, ensconced inside the presidential bubble, has yet to show a nimbleness and agility to successfully navigate the unceasing blows that have pierced his tight inner-circle, post-debate.\n\nSince the start of the campaign season, these two geriatric pols have only shared in common the overwhelming disregard by a dejected electorate completely disinterested in the rematch they are now witnessing.\n\nHowever, as the president is faced with a multi-front war to his legacy, re-election chances, and even his character, he now is on equal footing with his chief antagonist who, until recently, incoming fire was the norm.\n\nThe hot seat is so intense that even a stellar record over three years is not enough to shield President Biden from the raging political fire engulfing him. The confidence in Biden's ability to lead both short-term and long-term is so low, his once reviled and perennially dismissed vice-president is now seen as a potential saviour of the party and mythical Trump-slayer.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris join hands after they watched the Fourth of July fireworks from the White House balcony in Washington on July 4, 2024 (Susan Walsh / AP Photo)\n\nYet, barring any of that happening, President Biden will need to first slay the lingering doubts dogging him before he can effectively muster an effort to pull himself out of the sunken place he is in right now. Just ask Trump, he knows best. And now, so does Biden.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conviction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conviction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Optics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letter case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_National_Doral_Miami", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump National Doral Miami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/7/10/combo-photo-of-biden-and-trump-1-6958523-1720633545129.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719225", "eventUri": "eng-9719225", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Here's what to know before he speaks.", "body": "President Biden is holding a solo press conference today -- his first since November -- to conclude the NATO summit in Washington, D.C., Thursday night, in one of his biggest public tests since last month's unsteady debate performance caused alarm among Democrats on Capitol Hill and has raised questions about whether he should be the party's 2024 presidential nominee.\n\nThe president has acknowledged he had what he says was a \"bad night\" at the debate and he has been trying to prove he can be the nominee and defeat former President Donald Trump.\n\nDuring the debate, Mr. Biden, 81, stumbled early on, flubbing lines as his voice appeared ready to give out. His campaign later said he was suffering from a cold. His voice never recovered throughout the 90-minute debate, he failed to effectively respond to a number of false statements made by Trump during the debate, and at times he lost his train of thought. At one point, he struggled to name Medicare when answering a question about the tax rate for wealthy Americans, and then said that \"we finally beat Medicare.\"\n\nIn addition, the president lost his train of thought and struggled to name Medicare when he was answering a question about the tax rate for wealthy Americans.\n\nMr. Biden's campaign had hoped to allay concerns about his age with the early debate, but instead, that performance is now threatening his political future.\n\nRecently, Mr. Biden said the NATO summit could be a test of his fitness for office, and Democrats on Capitol Hill, Democratic governors and world leaders will be watching, too.\n\n\"Who's going to be able to hold NATO together like me,\" the president challenged ABC's George Stephanopoulos in an interview last week. He added, \"I guess a good way to judge me is you're going to have now the NATO conference here in the United States next week. Come listen. See what they say.\"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland told the Washington Post the NATO summit \"gives [Mr. Biden] an opportunity to showcase his leadership and foreign policy credentials, and the press conference gives him an opportunity to address concerns.\"\n\nThe president has declined to agree to take a in-depth neurocognitive test, telling Stephanopoulos on Friday that every day in office is a cognitive test.\n\n\"I'm running the world,\" the president said.\n\nAside from the ABC News interview, the president has largely relied on teleprompters to deliver speeches. Some Democrats say they want to see the president unscripted on the campaign trail and to meet with him in person, while reporters have called on the president to hold a press conference as soon as possible.\n\nThe president's press conference is scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m. ET, though the timing may slide. Mr. Biden's day is filled with working sessions with world leaders who have gathered for the summit.\n\nRussia's war on Ukraine continues to be a key theme for NATO, as Mr. Biden and other world leaders make the case that Russia will not stop at Ukraine. The president announced air defense equipment will be given to Ukraine by the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Italy. In the coming months, the U.S. and its partners will provide Ukraine with dozens of additional tactical air defense systems, he said.\n\n\"We know Putin won't stop at Ukraine. But make no mistake -- Ukraine can and will stop Putin,\" the president said of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this week that the president has not been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease or any other serious neurological disorder.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jean-Pierre said Walter Reed neurologist Dr. Kevin Cannard's January visit to the White House was not for the purpose of treating the president. But on Tuesday night, the Associated Press reported that Cannard visited Mr. Biden at the White House in January. Jean-Pierre then released a statement saying that Cannard had in fact met with the president at the White House in January, but only as a part of his annual physical, the rest of which was completed in February.\n\nThe White House and the president say he's up for another four years on the job, despite concerns from voters and some Democrats.\n\nCBS News polling shows Mr. Biden has slipped slightly in head-to-head polling against Trump, although within the margin of error. Trump now has a 3-point edge over Mr. Biden across the battleground states collectively, and a 2-point edge nationally. That's due in part to Democrats saying they're less likely than Republicans to \"definitely\" vote.\n\nMr. Biden has cast doubt on polling and his low approval numbers. When Stephanopoulos said he's never seen a president reelected with a 36% approval rating, the president retorted that he doesn't believe the number.\n\n\"Well, I don't believe that's my approval rating,\" the president told Stephanopoulos. \"That's not what our polls show,\" though he declined to provide any specific numbers.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He resisted, but only briefly. It was an example of the kind of man my father was.\n\nAnd it is an example for us today when we consider the peril our republic faces with President Biden clinging to his reelection bid.\n\nWe all know the liberating feeling we had when we got our first driver's license. The opposite feeling comes when it is time to turn it in. In my dad's case, the problem was diminished eyesight. A resilient man, he had learned to live with many handicaps, including loss of a leg and use of an arm. He told me of a trick he successfully used at stop lights to compensate for his difficulty discerning red lights from green: He waited for other cars to move.\n\nOkay, I said, how will you feel if you end up hurting someone? That was all it took. He sold his car.\n\nSuch a moment has come now to Joseph Biden. The chances of him winning in November are virtually non-existent. Yet, he continues to make statements that defy reason in order to keep the keys to the White House.\n\nThe president's performance in his recent debate with Donald Trump was a shock to anyone with eyes and ears. His handlers have limited his unscripted interactions with journalists for precisely this reason. Yet he and his staff insist he is as intellectually vigorous as ever and trot out ludicrous excuses for why he stumbled. One of the excuses, jetlag from recent trips abroad, showed the opposite of what was intended - that is, that it takes the president 11 days to recover from travel.\n\nHe, and they, argue that he is the best person to beat Donald Trump in November. After all, they say, he is the only one who has bested Trump at the ballot box. On close inspection, however, the statement is nearly meaningless. Trump has only been in two election races, and the one he won was fluky, to say the least. His opponent, Hillary Clinton, ran a poor campaign - and still won the popular vote. Several Democrats have a better chance than Biden of beating Trump this time round.\n\nIt is sad to hear Biden claim he is intellectually up to the job at the same time he says the polls are not all that bad. As the RealClearPolitics Poll Average shows, Trump is decidedly ahead of Biden. Moreover, Biden probably needs around 52% of the popular vote to win, given how the Electoral College functions.\n\nIt might be comforting to think that there is still time to turn things around. But anyone can see that Biden is losing voters, not gaining them. The best that can be said is that the battle lines have been fixed in Trump's favor. Biden has been lagging for months and that shows no signs of changing.\n\nIt is understandable that the president seeks supportive advice from staff as well as his wife, Jill, and his son, Hunter Biden. We all want reassurance. But we also need to seek out those who will give us a point of view that we do not want to hear.\n\nContrary to what Biden is claiming, the elites are not out to get him. Taking on the mantle of victimhood only makes Biden seem unhinged - and more like Trump. Polls show that nearly three-quarters of Americans think Biden is not fit to serve, mainly as a result of the impacts of aging.\n\nThe issue is not Biden's age, per se. Donald Trump, 78, is not much younger than the president. The issue is that in recent years Biden's acuity and physical presence have shown noticeable decline. Whatever one wants to say about Trump, he is vigorous.\n\nOne of the great strengths of the Democrats in recent years is that they have a much better record of dealing with reality than Republicans, who have blindly followed a leader whose attachment to the truth is tenuous.\n\nParty leaders now face a test of their credibility.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers have begun to speak out, urging the president to end his campaign. But more - many more - must step up. They must do what they have said the opposition has failed to do: speak truth to power. Otherwise, an important distinction between the parties disappears along with the possibility of winning the November election.\n\nLike my father, Biden has faced personal hardship and prevailed. That courage is a sign of greatness. I stand with those who believe Biden has many accomplishments and should be proud of his presidency.\n\nBut this moment may be his greatest test.

He hasn't simply lost a step; he's become a hollow man.\n\nIn a remarkable turn of events, Donald J. Trump is heading into the Republican convention in Milwaukee as the clear frontrunner against President Joe Biden. A new Cook poll indicates that Trump has solidified his lead over Biden with six states moving toward him, not to mention support in New York slipping for his candidacy. Faced with political peril, Biden has adopted a truculent tone, decrying elites and the press for seeking to stymie his run for a second term. His media appearance on Thursday to close the NATO conference in Washington, which his aides are calling his \"big boy\" news conference, will pose another stern test of his ability to speak spontaneously and coherently when answering questions about domestic and international affairs.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that signs of unrest inside and outside the Democratic party about Biden are continuing to mount. Take George Stephanopoulos. \"I don't think he can serve four more years,\" the ABC News anchor said on Tuesday after he was asked by on a Manhattan street whether President Joe Biden should step down. He's since issued a hasty apology -- \"Earlier today I responded to a passerby. I shouldn't have\" -- but he was stating the obvious. Then there is George Clooney. Clooney, who recently headlined a fundraiser for Biden, has now called upon him to exit the race.\n\nTrump, in turn, has largely held back from attacking Biden, reckoning that there is no need to pile on when he is headed toward what Colorado Sen. Michael Bennett has suggested could be a landslide victory, encompassing both the House and Senate. Such a victory has eluded presidents since Ronald Reagan, as the electorate has become increasingly polarized and candidates seek to slice and dice the shrinking number of uncommitted voters. Might Trump be able to pull off this feat, winning a mandate for leadership? Might he be able to enact his legislative aspirations, including abolishing Obamacare in a second term?\n\nPerhaps the most immediate signal of Trump's immediate ambitions will be his choice for vice-president. If Trump picks a more establishment candidate such as Sen. Marco Rubio or North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, it will indicate that he's going for the grand slam. Selecting someone like Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, by contrast, would amount to doubling down on the MAGA base. The implications for the GOP's future, particularly if Trump were unable to serve out a full second term, are not insignificant, particularly for foreign affairs.\n\nFor now, however, it is Biden who commands the spotlight. Even his most stalwart defenders such as former White House chief of staff Ron Klain are finding it difficult to advance a persuasive case for his continued candidacy. In a revealing interview with the New Republic's Greg Sargent, Klain was unable to spell out a specific path that Biden could adopt to stage a political comeback. Instead, he relied on feel-good messaging: \"I don't think this is something about like, I'm going to show you a bunch of numbers and the numbers are going to tell you I'm right. It's like, look, what wins in a state like Pennsylvania? It's someone who is authentic, who has the -- I'll say the piece of data that is on the President's side is, he cares about people like me, shares my values, all those things. He's doing very well in those metrics...I think his attributes in the end are the winning attributes as they were in 2020.\"\n\nThe problem, of course, is that 2024 is not 2020. Trump is not an incumbent president dealing ineptly with a national health crisis. Instead, he's posturing as an outsider battling the elites. Trump is not presiding over a faltering economy. Instead, he's dinging Biden over inflation. However, the greatest impediment to Biden's reelection is that he is not the Biden of 2020. He hasn't simply lost a step; he's become a hollow man.\n\nAs Tim Alberta reports in the Atlantic, Trump has been planning for a landslide win all along, predicated on the contrast between his hyped-up masculinity and Biden's physical debility. Remove Biden from the picture, however, and you scramble the Trump camp's plans. Whether Vice-President Kamala Harris or another Democratic candidate could successfully win the presidency is an open question. But it seems increasingly unlikely that Biden can perform that feat. It's time for him to bow to the inevitable and exit the race.", "source": {"uri": "nationalinterest.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Interest"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affordable Care Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

President Biden is doing a better job than Donald Trump of holding on to his supporters.\n\nThe dumbest thing that Democrats could do would be to remove the candidate that their voters want.\n\nIndications are growing that Democrats are not in trouble but that the polls and the media are getting this election wrong.\n\nSource and data here: https://www.politicususa.com/2024/07/10/debate-crissi-report-bogus.html", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719225", "eventUri": "eng-9719225", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

A lot and very little.\n\nWe are mostly where we were two years ago. An old president, past his prime, who supports democracy and the rule of law, is running against an old criminal, sexual abuser and serial fraudster who leads an authoritarian movement with fascist accents. The only difference is the old president is two years further past his prime, and the fascist accents are increasingly pronounced.\n\nMost people understand there is no ready solution to President Joe Biden's recent debate debacle. If we haven't heard Democrats clamoring for Biden to be replaced by his vice president, it is because not enough Democrats want Biden to be replaced by his vice president. And if the vice president is not the obvious successor to the president, then no one is.\n\nJoe Battenfeld: Democrats' only play is for Joe Biden to resign, citing medical reasons\n\nWith no obvious consensus among a diverse group of party elites and voters, decision-making remains firmly in the hands of Biden, who ran for the Democratic nomination against minimal competition and won easily. The Democratic bench is unusually robust. But the recent history of challenges to incumbent presidents bred caution among ambitious men and women.\n\nLyndon Johnson faced a challenge. Democrats lost. Jimmy Carter faced a challenge. Democrats lost. George H.W. Bush faced a challenge. Republicans lost.\n\nUnless another geriatric shoe drops, Biden will likely be the Democratic nominee at the party convention in August. But the dynamics of the contest, which weren't great for Biden to begin with, have now shifted further against him -- though the electorate needs time to digest the debate fallout.\n\nGiven the nation's extreme polarization, the effect may be less than many anticipate.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBut democracy is a team sport. The Supreme Court's recent 6-3 ruling effectively afforded Donald Trump immunity from prosecution for crimes, including his attempted coup, as long as he committed them while displaying a presidential seal. This underscored that democracy will remain imperiled throughout this campaign and beyond.\n\nFortunately, Biden has an unusually strong team. It's time to deploy it by campaigning with his cabinet members and running as the chief executive of a complex democratic enterprise where expertise and execution are broadly diffused. In effect, Biden should assume the role of player-coach rather than superstar.\n\nHighlighting his cabinet takes some pressure off the president, but it also conveys a powerful contrast with Trump. Veterans of Trump's cabinet and senior White House staff have called him \"unfit,\" a \"threat to democracy,\" a man constantly seeking to commit illegal acts and \"off the rails.\" A former White House chief of staff said Trump has \"nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution and the rule of law.\"\n\nThese are fundamental contrasts that should be highlighted daily.\n\nThe team approach must respect federal law restricting federal employees' political activities. But it lends itself to important contrasts on issues.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is a dynamic spokesman for the Biden administration's investments in infrastructure -- and all the jobs and productivity gains. From lower insulin costs to progress on climate policies, cabinet members and high-profile members of Congress can reinforce the president's message more aggressively and creatively than reelection campaigns focused on one leader typically achieve.\n\nWhat's more, the Democratic team drawn from Congress and the cabinet is extremely diverse -- another powerful contrast with MAGA. Seeing that diversity on the main public stage with the president, instead of relegated to smaller regional events headlined by select cabinet officials, would be a powerful reminder to a range of voters -- women, Black, Asian, Hispanic, LGBTQ -- that the Democratic Party is not the exclusive province of old white men. It is representative of the diverse America of the 21st century.\n\nIt's not hard to make a compelling case that the federal government, with a budget of $6.5 trillion and a civilian workforce of more than 2 million, is not the work of one lonely soul in the Oval Office. Here again, the typically smooth-running Biden administration, featuring a stable and competent cabinet, offers a sharp contrast with the chaos, incompetence and corruption of Trump's administration.\n\nNone of this alters the singular nature of the American presidency. The president is the ultimate decider, and the Biden campaign will have to show that Biden retains sufficient wisdom and acuity to reproduce his successful first term.\n\nThe president's faltering debate performance can't be undone, and it would be a mistake for Biden partisans to pretend we didn't see what we saw. Honesty is one of the most important contrasts with Trump, whose relentless lying at the debate, like his criminality, would be disqualifying in any remotely healthy political party.\n\nDemocracy and the rule of law are on the ropes in the U.S., and the MAGA Supreme Court just delivered more body blows. It's going to take collective action to save them. Biden should model that collective action in his campaign. He alone cannot fix it.\n\nWilkinson is a Bloomberg columnist and former executive editor for the Week and a writer for Rolling Stone.\n\nCatch the latest in Opinion\n\nGet opinion pieces, letters and editorials sent directly to your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "newsadvance.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsAdvance.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@newsadvance.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "susan_walsh@newsadvance.com", "name": "Susan Walsh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Will the incumbent president, Joe Biden, with visibly compromised mental acuity, will trudge to the finish line of the presidential election in November to face his formidable rival, the former Republican president, Donald Trump? And which of the two would make a better president for the Baltics? BNN asked several Lithuanian analysts to opine on that.\n\nVytautas Dumbliauskas, associate professor of political sciences at Mykolas Romeris University in Vilnius, emphasised to BNN that comparing\n\nthe two candidates in the American presidential race are like comparing apples and oranges.\n\n\"Like many others, I'm concerned about Biden's health which is visibly deteriorating. I guess many in America are pondering now this: what if he pops out before the election? I understand this is not an insight you'd expect from a political analyst, but the question is on many lips,\" V. Dumbliauskas said.\n\n\"And if at some point in the race, the Democrats need to swiftly replace Biden, again, like many others I doubt very much if Kamala Harris, the Vice President, who, some analysts joke, has been picked not by Biden himself, but his wife Jill to appease black voters, would be efficient for the role,\" the analyst continued.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, Dumbliauskas says, can be described as an \"unmounted cannon\",\n\nwhich can shoot in all directions and trajectories sporadically, erroneously and sometimes aimlessly.\n\n\"First of all, Trump is a businessman, and his record as the president is contentious. Besides, his stance on Russia has variated from being lenient to very belligerent. No one can rule out that Russian intelligence has got some Trump compromising evidence, which is rumoured, so that would make him vulnerable. Considering his temper, Trump would likely push Ukraine to make some (territorial) concessions to Russia to end the war as quickly as possible,\" V. Dumbliauskas said.\n\nAs a BNN reminder, Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted he could settle the war in one day if he's elected president again. At a CNN town hall in May 2023, Trump bragged: \"They're dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I'll have that done -- I'll have that done in 24 hours.\"\n\nDuring the recent debate with Biden, Trump claimed: \"If we had a real president, a president that knew -- that was respected by Putin ... he would have never invaded Ukraine.\"\n\nVytautas Bruveris, director of ELTA, a Lithuanian newswire, opined to BNN that\n\na new Biden-led administration would be better for the Baltic States.\n\n\"I can just reiterate myself what many others say: Trump is unpredictable and notorious for his jaundiced view at all international alliances, including NATO. And his most recent remark that Nato member states should be allotting a whopping 10% of their GDP to defence is just outlandish, a kind of trolling,\" V. Bruveris accentuated.\n\nWith Trump in the White House, he says, a much-diminished role of the US in NATO - or even withdrawing from it - cannot be 100 percent ruled out.\n\nWhen it comes to helping with Ukraine, Trump could significantly curtail the US financing to it, the analyst says.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the Biden administration has long been too fearful of any escalation with Russia. It seems that Biden's White House does not have a clear vision and strategy in the war. The decision on the 61 billion US dollar Ukraine aid package was very belated for the war-ravaged country,\" the analyst said.\n\nAs a BNN reminder, after months of intense congressional squabbling, US Congress in late April passed and President Biden signed into law a 61 billion US dollar aid package for Ukraine.\n\nAsked if he is concerned about Biden's cognitive abilities, V. Bruveris answered affirmingly: \"His physical and mental condition certainly raises questions - for all.\"\n\n\"That it is worsening is evident, but if I think that Biden will stay in the campaign just because the Democrats do not have many options. Swapping him with other candidate would not be enough to get ready for the November election. Things cannot be done with a finger flicking. Alarmingly, we are seeing the Democrats sink in a chaos and unpredictability. Even with any other candidate on the ballot, damage for the party has been done for years. They have not thought of a plan B and, likely, it is still off their table,\" V. Bruveris reasoned, adding: \"Many already joke that Trump, who, now, seems to be the most probable winner of the election, in his inaugural speech will thank Biden for his victory.\"\n\nK\u0119stutis Girnius, associate professor at Vilnius University's Institute of International Relations and Political Science, says that there has been no US presidential election in the last century in which\n\nboth candidates are \"flawed, vain and self-centered old men, facing the challenge of leading the US when its global dominance is being challenged.\"\n\nAccording to him, Trump's many failings are an \"open book, endlessly discussed and parsed.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, Biden's age and decreasing mental acuity are the daily fare of Fox News and other right of center media...Like Trump, Biden is a peddler of untruths, mostly about himself, done with a smile, in contrast to Trump's scowl, so more tolerable,\" the analyst said.\n\nYet, Girnius infers, Biden is a more predictable and conventionally responsible politician than Trump, thus a less threatening candidate.\n\nNaglis Puteikis, former MP, told BNN that\n\nDonald Trump would make a better president - not only for the US, but the entire world and the Baltics, too.\n\n\"Despite his flary and fierce character, he is much tougher, importantly, also much more agile and spry,\" he said.\n\nPuteikis also agrees that Biden' health issues are overshadowing the incumbent's presidential race.\n\nSpeaking to BNN, Jose Antonio Navarro, a Miami-based public life commentator, contributing to a local news outlet, firmly backed up Joe Biden and downplayed concerns about his physical and mental health.\n\n\"Biden has about 50 years of legislative experience, even in physically diminished role it outweighs what most other people have to offer. He's had a robust economy, most of the world is currently having their own recessions. Inflation is largely under control. I see Biden as a Roosevelt president that he is frail and more or less handicapped, but he can still sit in a chair and make decisions,\" J. A. Navarro said, adding:\n\n\"We don't need the president to run marathons or go on world tours or make inspiring speeches. He just needs to sit in a chair and analyze data.\n\nAnd, of course, unlike Trump, he has the moral character to make the right choices. In the past century, executive roles have been turned into a theatre performance.\"\n\nAnd even if Biden must drop out from the presidential campaign, many Americans will vote for any Democratic candidate - and Vice President Harris would be a good choice - but not for Trump, J. A. Navarro, who calls himself a \"raging moderate\", accentuated.", "source": {"uri": "bnn-news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baltic News Network - News from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia"},

Donald Trump's strategy is built around around portraying him as strong and virile, in counterpose to President Biden's image as old and weak. This strategy importantly concedes most of Trump's flaws, while subsuming them into a rubric of strength. \"Trump, whatever his countless liabilities as a candidate, would be cast as the dauntless and forceful alpha, while Biden would be painted as the pitiable old heel,\" reports Tim Alberta.\n\nNaturally, having to face a different candidate, one who is consistently able to speak contemporaneously in complete sentences, rankles the Trumpists. And in keeping with the general MAGA precept that any political action that impedes Trump's objectives is an elite coup, they are complaining that replacing Biden would be undemocratic.\n\nSome of this backlash manifests as a resentment of the news media for jumping on the Biden health story now, after failing to treat Biden as a near-invalid since 2020, as conservatives prefer to do. Jason Willick, a conservative columnist at the Washington Post, claims the media's \"reversal\" has been \"so sudden, so violent, so herd-like in its uniformity\" that \"part of me wants to see Biden overpower the noisy hysterics who closed ranks around him out of fear and are now fleeing for the same reason.\"\n\nIn truth, as Cathy Young documents, the mainstream media has covered Biden's age closely all along, frequently infuriating Biden in the process. It's true that both the tone and the frequency of this coverage intensified dramatically after the debate. But the obvious cause is public confirmation of what could only be imputed before. Media coverage of Biden's health got harsher after he experienced a health emergency in public for the same reason media coverage of Al Qaeda got harsher after 9/11. When major public events take place, the news media often responds with saturation coverage.\n\nAnd now that conservatives believe Biden is the victim of an unfair cabal, they are trying to formulate arguments for why fairness demands he retain the nomination. The argument formulation process is very much in its embryonic stages -- at the moment, they have irritable mental gestures rather than any proper reasons.\n\n\"To replace Biden on the November ballot would require the DNC to disregard its primary voters who selected the president as their candidate of choice, and that is after the party purposefully kept Robert F. Kennedy Jr. off the primary ballot,\" writes Margot Cleveland in the Federalist, \"It would be one thing to put aside the outcome of the primary because the party concluded Biden can't serve as commander-in-chief. But no Democrats seem to be taking that position. All they care about is beating Trump.\"\n\nLikewise, Trump defender Batya Unger-Sargon complains in Compact:\n\nThe same Democratic elites who, in the name of \"defending democracy,\" have tried to bar Trump from the ballot, from the presidency, from walking the streets as a free man, are now engaged in a coup attempt against Biden, a duly elected president who won 3,896 delegates in a primary contest, albeit an artificially truncated one. ...\n\nYou don't have to love Biden to demand he stay on the ticket as a matter of democratic principle. The elites are doing nothing short of trying to stage a coup against a duly elected president and major-party nominee.\n\nObviously the registered preference of voters in primaries (albeit with no effective competition) carries a lot of weight. But the explicit rationale for replacing Biden is that his health has deteriorated significantly since the primaries, and certainly since last summer, which was the effective deadline for organizing a legitimate primary challenge.\n\nNobody would complain about replacing Biden if he died, and presumably few would complain if he fell into a coma. A party has to have some latitude to reconsider its nomination in the event of a health crisis. Parties are necessarily open, but democracy occurs between the parties, not within them.\n\nNow Republicans may deny Biden's health has deteriorated since 2020, despite clear evidence it has:\n\nAnd if you accept the Republican belief that Biden has been a vegetable all along, including in 2020, then why can't Democrats do something about it now? Once they nominate a totally incapacitated person as president (as Republicans claim), they cannot change course? Is \"no backsies\" a principle of political competition?\n\nSo the principle we are left with, as always, is that Trump is entitled to win, and anything that prevents that is cheating.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_chait@nymag.com", "name": "Jonathan Chait", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "News media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trumpism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Young", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cathy Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_and_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advice and consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Joe, it's time to go", "body": "Our columnist says it's possible that Joe Biden will leave the US presidential race in the coming days, but it's also possible he will bed in for a tough run.\n\nTWO WEEKS ON from the unmitigated disaster that was his performance in the 27 June presidential debate with Donald Trump in Atlanta, President Joe Biden says that he is staying in the race and will not give up on his bid for re-election.\n\nIt seems that he, and his inner circle, will not be deterred by the growing number of Democratic Party politicians and prominent backers who have urged him to step aside. That is the state of play at the time of writing, prior to the conclusion of the NATO Summit in Washington, DC and a crucial press conference for the President.\n\nIn traditional, new and social media there is a wide range of takes as to what will happen next. My own view is that the pressure will mount to such an extent that it will become untenable to keep going and that the 81-year-old Irish American will reluctantly throw in the towel - perhaps this weekend, prior to the Republican National Convention that commences Monday in Milwaukee and the eagerly anticipated announcement by Donald Trump of the identity of his running mate.\n\nYet it needs to be reiterated: this remains President Biden's decision and his alone. Although the 99% of Democratic delegates pledged to the incumbent by virtue of his winning all of the primaries and caucuses could technically throw their support to another individual at the party's convention in August in Chicago even if he refuses to bow out, that is extremely improbable.\n\nThe president has won the nomination, fair and square, and it would be extraordinary for a few thousand activists to overturn the will of those who voted for him, regardless of subsequent developments, if he is still in the ring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the American polity finds itself in, to put it euphemistically, an awkward position, as literally billions of citizens of the world - who are stakeholders in the outcome of presidential elections in the United States, whether they like it or not - look on in disbelief. In sum, Joe Biden really has to go, but actually he doesn't.\n\nNeither is an ideal choice. The truth is that this appalling vista could have been avoided. The finger pointing as to who in the Democratic Party bears responsibility for acquiescing to Team Biden's demand that he have a largely unfettered path to again being anointed the standard bearer for the top job and thereby assuming a massive risk has no doubt begun in earnest and will continue. They are where they are, however.\n\nWhat are the choices?\n\nThere are two possible scenarios: Biden fights on or Biden exits. Following is my best guess as to how each would unfold.\n\nIn the first, the buzz over the Republican National Convention and Trump's pick for the number two spot dominates headlines and attention. Albeit briefly, questions about Biden's age and fitness are relegated. Depending to a huge extent on popular surrogates who are willing to go to bat for the President, Democrats push back on what they claim is a radical right-wing blueprint for the country's future.\n\nSoon, their own convention will loom and the dominant story will be how it is to be managed and choreographed to make Biden appear vibrant and vivacious. He delivers a decent speech, but his physical and mental decline are obvious; every single misstep or slip of the tongue is perceived through the prism engendered by the first debate. It doesn't move the needle and Trump retains solid polling advantages in all of the battleground states, of which there are more than there were in 2020.\n\nBiden is a little better in the second debate in September, yet cannot land a punishing blow on Trump, who is clearly more vigorous and with it. While he carries on until 5 November and is competitive in terms of the popular vote, Trump ultimately wins comfortably in the Electoral College. Republicans regain control of the US Senate and increase their majority in the US House of Representatives. Democrats fare poorly at the state and local levels. It is a terrible day for their party.\n\nRead Next Related Reads Biden: 'I don't debate as well as I used to, but I know how to tell the truth' Larry Donnelly: Biden should not be seeking a second term 'Suckers and losers': Trump and 'slow' Biden battle it out in 'painful' debate Joe's dilemma\n\nWhat if Biden, prodded by family and closest associates, is honest with himself, recognises that the foregoing sequence of events, if not guaranteed, is eminently plausible and thus ends his quest? The narrative of the campaign would change instantaneously.\n\nAll of a sudden, the focus would be on whether Democrats will quickly settle on the most expedient option, Vice President Kamala Harris, or if there would be a more drawn out battle involving the figure out of central casting for a President, California Gavin Newsom, or the most electable candidate, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer - and maybe others.\n\nMight it be messy and ugly? Yes. Would it be wholly unprecedented in modern American politics? Yes. Could the uncertainty and potential chaos flowing from it benefit Donald Trump? Yes. But is it preferable for Democrats to have the global media focus daily on the contours of a fascinating contest featuring a new generation of political leaders or on Joe Biden's age and capacity? The former is infinitely superior.\n\nWith tremendous respect for a lifetime of overcoming adversity and for a half a century of admirable public service, it's time to go, Joe. It is only a shame that things got this far.\n\nLarry Donnelly is a Boston lawyer, a Law Lecturer at the University of Galway and a political columnist with TheJournal.ie.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

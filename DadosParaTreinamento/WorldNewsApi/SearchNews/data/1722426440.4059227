The warm conditions will be welcomed by many after months of mild and wet weather. Undoubtedly, many will be looking for a new pair of sunglasses, especially if they have a holiday coming up. But buying the right pair is important, as it can help you avoid serious health conditions. New information released by the Met Office has revealed almost half of Brits (41%) are aware of harmful UV rays and their potential to cause skin cancer. However, just one in five (22%) are conscious of the effect these rays have on our eye health \u2013 which is why a quality pair of sunglasses is crucial. As tempting as it may be to save a few quid and buy a cheap pair of sunglasses, experts say you may want to think twice. Morgan Sayes, Optometrist at contact lens retailer, Lenstore, has warned of the dangers of buying fake designer brand sunglasses. The risks associated with counterfeit sunglasses are worth much more than the cheap price tag that comes with most knock-off brands, he says. \"Fake sunglasses may carry a more favourable price tag for the consumer, but they are heavily flawed for the amount of genuine protection they offer from a number of health perspectives. \"As they do not meet British Standard requirements, prolonged use of counterfeit sunglasses can cause serious damage to the eyes and even result in longer term issues to your eyesight and to your overall health. Always buy sunglasses from a reputable source. \"This is especially important if you are a prescription lens wearer as buying counterfeit options are not only illegal, but they will provide no additional benefits and may affect your eyesight, causing discomfort, headaches and loss of focus. \"For certainty, make sure your sunglasses carry a \u2018CE\u2019 certification to prove they will adequately protect your eyesight from harmful UV rays emitted by the sun and can combat glare sufficiently.\" Little or no UV protection Whilst authentic sunglasses will carry a \u2018CE\u2019 or \u2018UV400\u2019 mark to prove the product is legitimate, dupes and fakes will not carry an authentic mark as they do not carry the legal amount of protection required by UK law. Some could have a counterfeit mark though \u2013 be sure to look out for strange fonts, poor quality markings and irregularities with the placement. As a product without these certification marks offers next to no protection from the harmful UV rays of the sun, your eyes will be exposed to dangerous amounts of UV radiation. Long term exposure to UV radiation has been linked to cataracts, macular degeneration and eyelid cancer. According to the National Eye Institute: \"Cancers of the eyelid, including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, are linked to UV exposure. No link has been made between UV exposure and other types of ocular cancers.\" Poor quality lenses Unsurprisingly, the lenses used in counterfeit brands of sunglasses are often cheap and poor, meaning the quality of the lenses can become difficult to see through, impairing your vision and even putting you at risk of harm, especially if using them whilst driving. By law, authentic sunglasses must conform to British Standard BS ISO 12312- 1:2022. Insufficient glare protection Similarly to fake sunglasses offering little or no UV protection from the harmful UV rays radiated by the sun, the poor quality of the lenses will not protect your eyes from glare in the same way an authentic pair of sunglasses like a renowned Ray Ban pair can. These sunglasses are offered with polarised lenses that guarantee glare from light reflecting surfaces such as roads and water is kept out of your eyes. The dangers with little to no glare protection can result in you straining your eyes through over-squinting\u2013 this may seem harmless, but it can result in decreased vision and increases the risk of headaches. Cheap materials Whilst counterfeit sunglasses have a price advantage over their \u2018real\u2019 counterparts, this is down to the quality of materials used in the final product. Genuine sunglasses are designed to last as they are constructed with quality materials giving more durability, whereas the cheaper materials used in counterfeits will break much easier. This in turn could even cause injury to you; for example if a cheap plastic lens or frame snaps and scratches your face or eye. Improper fit Authentic sunglasses should fit comfortably on your head, resting on the bridge of your nose and behind your ears, whereas counterfeit options are typically less likely to fit well. This can result in discomfort and even mark your face if the fittings are either too loose or too tight.", "summary": "Millions of Brits risking their eye health as optometrist urges warning to anyone who wears 'cheap' sunglasses", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/wearing-cheap-sunglasses-could-give-33123195", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33123199.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1556595244.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:18:25", "author": "Charlotte Smith", "authors": ["Charlotte Smith"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.021}

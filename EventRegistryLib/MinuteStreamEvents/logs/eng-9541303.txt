The infection began in the right eye, before spreading to the left\n\nThe WHO said today: 'At the present time, based on available information, WHO assesses the overall public health risk posed by H5N1 to be low.\n\n'[But] for those with exposure to infected birds or animals or contaminated environments, the risk of infection is considered low-to-moderate.\n\n'This risk requires close monitoring and WHO and partners will continue to regularly assess and publish public health risk assessments for avian influenza.'\n\nThe agency held a webinar today, which was attended by its own infectious disease experts as well as officials from the CDC.\n\nThe meeting came after USDA researchers warned about H5N1's new mutations.\n\nThey wrote: 'Some [mutations] in virus population were detected at low frequency that may lead to changes in transmission [in other species]... after evolution in dairy cattle.\n\n'Continued transmission of H5N1 within dairy cattle increases the risk for infection and subsequent spread of the virus to human populations.'\n\nCattle herds on at least 36 farms across nine states have tested positive (stock photo)\n\nIn the paper, published as a pre-print on BioRxiv that has not been reviewed by other scientists, researchers analyzed nasal and milk samples from dozens of infected cows with infections confirmed from March to April this year.\n\nAt least 491 mutations were detected in the sample, of which 309 were associated with 'functional changes' in the virus.\n\nBird flu causes blindness in cats that drank milk from infected cows\n\nAbout two dozen farm cats were stricken with H5N1 bird flu after drinking milk from infected cows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis included mutations that may make the virus more pathogenic, or more likely to cause an infection, better adapted to mammals and better able to infect new species.\n\nTesting also suggested that the outbreak in cattle actually began in late 2023, about four months before it was first reported.\n\nResearchers suggested the virus had first jumped from birds to cows in the Texas Panhandle, and then spread between herds in the state as well as to herds in Kansas, Michigan and New Mexico among others.\n\nOutbreaks in several herds could not be linked back to others, suggesting some infected herds have not yet had the virus detected.\n\nThere were also cases reported where the virus had spilled back from cows into wild birds, poultry, domestic cats and a raccoon.\n\nAt least 36 herds across nine states have been infected with bird flu, data shows, although experts are warning it is likely more widespread.\n\nThere are also fears over the virus spilling to farm workers, with veterinarians saying they are hearing of many people who are sick on farms but are unwilling to be tested.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Then came word that barn cats -- half of them on one farm -- had died suddenly.\n\nWithin days, the Amarillo veterinarian was hearing about sick cows with unusual symptoms: high fevers, reluctance to eat and much less milk. Tests for typical illnesses came back negative.\n\nPetersen, who monitors more than 40,000 cattle on a dozen farms in the Texas Panhandle, collected samples from cats and cows and sent them to Dr. Drew Magstadt, a friend from college who now works at the veterinary diagnostic laboratory at Iowa State University.\n\nThe samples tested positive for a bird flu virus never before seen in cattle. It was the first proof that the bird flu, known as Type A H5N1, could infect cows. As of Wednesday, 36 U.S. herds had confirmed infections, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\n\"It was just a surprise,\" recalled Petersen. \"It was just a little bit of disbelief.\"\n\nAt the same time, on almost every farm with sick animals, Petersen said she saw sick people, too.\n\n\"We were actively checking on humans,\" Petersen said. \"I had people who never missed work, miss work.\"\n\nNation & World The USDA is testing ground beef for bird flu. Experts are confident the meat supply is safe By DEVI SHASTRI - AP Health Writer\n\nSo far, two people in the U.S. have been confirmed to be infected with H5N1, most recently a Texas dairy worker linked to the cattle outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two dozen people have been tested and about 100 people have been monitored since the virus appeared in cows, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a CDC respiratory diseases official, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nDaskalakis said CDC has seen no unusual flu trends in areas with infected cows, but some experts wonder if anecdotal reports of sick workers mean more than one person caught the virus from the animals.\n\nPetersen said some workers had symptoms consistent with flu: fever and body aches, stuffy nose or congestion. Some had conjunctivitis, the eye inflammation detected in the Texas dairy worker diagnosed with bird flu.\n\nDr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, has been taking samples from livestock and people on two Texas farms. On farms with confirmed cattle infections, there have also been reports of mild illnesses among the workers, he said.\n\nHis research has been difficult. Many workers are reluctant to be tested. That may be because they have limited access to health care or fear divulging private health information.\n\nWithout confirmation, no one knows if the sick workers were infected with the bird flu virus or something unrelated, Gray said.\n\n\"They seem to be linked in time and space, so one would say it's biologically plausible,\" said Gray.\n\nSome of the workers who fell ill sought treatment and were offered oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu, Petersen said.\n\nSome farm workers who were exposed to infected animals or people were offered the medication, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said. State health officials are responsible for evaluating and providing treatment, according to federal guidelines.\n\nHealth officials in Texas provided Tamiflu to the person known to be infected with H5N1 and family members, plus two people on a second dairy farm who were exposed to infected animals, said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said he wasn't sure if others had been offered the antiviral.\n\nFarmers have been hesitant to allow health officials onto their land, said Dr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who consulted about the outbreak with Petersen.\n\n\"This particular disease is looked at as a scarlet letter,\" Russo said. \"It has this stigma associated with it right now.\"\n\nRusso called for wider testing of cattle, people and milk.\n\n\"We do not know what we do not measure,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the horse left the barn and took off a lot faster than we were able to mobilize.\"\n\nGray worries that a recent federal order requiring testing of all lactating dairy cows moving between states could hinder cooperation even further. All labs that conduct tests must report positive results to the Agriculture Department. But many farmers may simply decide against testing, hoping to outlast the outbreak, he said.\n\nThe reluctance of workers and farmers to allow testing is \"greatly hampering\" understanding of how the virus spreads, how large the outbreak is now and how quickly it may grow, Gray said.\n\n\"It's a negative, very negative, effect,\" he said.\n\nPetersen said she understands workers' and farmers' fears. She praised the farmers who had been willing to let her gather the first samples that confirmed the outbreak and reflected on what the results could mean.\n\n\"You immediately think about the cows, the people that care for them and the families that have these farms,\" she said. \"You're thinking about the big picture, long term. Your mind starts to go down that entire path of concern.\"\n\nGetting dairy from farm to table is a complex process -- and farmers are adapting to get it there A different way to farm: Using agritourism to bolster dairy operations Getting dairy from farm cow to your fridge is more complex than you think Technology is reinventing dairy production -- and it's helping farmers keep pace",

Then came word that barn cats -- half of them on one farm -- had died suddenly.\n\nWithin days, the Amarillo veterinarian was hearing about sick cows with unusual symptoms: high fevers, reluctance to eat and much less milk. Tests for typical illnesses came back negative.\n\nPetersen, who monitors more than 40,000 cattle on a dozen farms in the Texas Panhandle, collected samples from cats and cows and sent them to Dr. Drew Magstadt, a friend from college who now works at the veterinary diagnostic laboratory at Iowa State University.\n\nThe samples tested positive for a bird flu virus never before seen in cattle. It was the first proof that the bird flu, known as Type A H5N1, could infect cows. As of Wednesday, 36 U.S. herds had confirmed infections, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\n\"It was just a surprise,\" recalled Petersen. \"It was just a little bit of disbelief.\"\n\nAt the same time, on almost every farm with sick animals, Petersen said she saw sick people, too.\n\n\"We were actively checking on humans,\" Petersen said. \"I had people who never missed work, miss work.\"\n\nNation & World The USDA is testing ground beef for bird flu. Experts are confident the meat supply is safe By DEVI SHASTRI - AP Health Writer\n\nSo far, two people in the U.S. have been confirmed to be infected with H5N1, most recently a Texas dairy worker linked to the cattle outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two dozen people have been tested and about 100 people have been monitored since the virus appeared in cows, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a CDC respiratory diseases official, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nDaskalakis said CDC has seen no unusual flu trends in areas with infected cows, but some experts wonder if anecdotal reports of sick workers mean more than one person caught the virus from the animals.\n\nPetersen said some workers had symptoms consistent with flu: fever and body aches, stuffy nose or congestion. Some had conjunctivitis, the eye inflammation detected in the Texas dairy worker diagnosed with bird flu.\n\nDr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, has been taking samples from livestock and people on two Texas farms. On farms with confirmed cattle infections, there have also been reports of mild illnesses among the workers, he said.\n\nHis research has been difficult. Many workers are reluctant to be tested. That may be because they have limited access to health care or fear divulging private health information.\n\nWithout confirmation, no one knows if the sick workers were infected with the bird flu virus or something unrelated, Gray said.\n\n\"They seem to be linked in time and space, so one would say it's biologically plausible,\" said Gray.\n\nSome of the workers who fell ill sought treatment and were offered oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu, Petersen said.\n\nSome farm workers who were exposed to infected animals or people were offered the medication, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said. State health officials are responsible for evaluating and providing treatment, according to federal guidelines.\n\nHealth officials in Texas provided Tamiflu to the person known to be infected with H5N1 and family members, plus two people on a second dairy farm who were exposed to infected animals, said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said he wasn't sure if others had been offered the antiviral.\n\nFarmers have been hesitant to allow health officials onto their land, said Dr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who consulted about the outbreak with Petersen.\n\n\"This particular disease is looked at as a scarlet letter,\" Russo said. \"It has this stigma associated with it right now.\"\n\nRusso called for wider testing of cattle, people and milk.\n\n\"We do not know what we do not measure,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the horse left the barn and took off a lot faster than we were able to mobilize.\"\n\nGray worries that a recent federal order requiring testing of all lactating dairy cows moving between states could hinder cooperation even further. All labs that conduct tests must report positive results to the Agriculture Department. But many farmers may simply decide against testing, hoping to outlast the outbreak, he said.\n\nThe reluctance of workers and farmers to allow testing is \"greatly hampering\" understanding of how the virus spreads, how large the outbreak is now and how quickly it may grow, Gray said.\n\n\"It's a negative, very negative, effect,\" he said.\n\nPetersen said she understands workers' and farmers' fears. She praised the farmers who had been willing to let her gather the first samples that confirmed the outbreak and reflected on what the results could mean.\n\n\"You immediately think about the cows, the people that care for them and the families that have these farms,\" she said. \"You're thinking about the big picture, long term.

However, if you are paying attention, it's also an attack on our food supply, as well as we can probably point right back to outlets like the CDC and others that have messed around with what God created to patent it and make billions of the people while making them sick in the process. Just keep that in mind when you read the following article.\n\nHave you noticed that the mainstream media is suddenly full of very alarming stories about H5N1? When hundreds of millions of birds were dying because of the bird flu, the mainstream media didn't seem to care very much, and so most people in the general population didn't seem to care very much. Then the bird flu started infecting lots of mammals all over the globe, and the mainstream media still didn't seem to care very much. But now here we are in the middle of 2024, and the mainstream media has suddenly decided to ramp up the fear level. Even though there has only been one confirmed human case in the U.S. so far this year, the mainstream media is pumping out article after article about the threat that H5N1 could potentially pose to humanity. Do they know something that the rest of us do not?\n\nIt is quite true that if a version of H5N1 comes along that can spread easily from human to human, the death toll could be catastrophic.\n\nAre we on the verge of seeing that happen?\n\nThe New York Times is reporting that H5N1 \"has acquired dozens of new mutations\", and apparently some of them \"may make it more adept at spreading between species\"...\n\nThe bird flu virus sweeping across dairy farms in multiple states has acquired dozens of new mutations, including some that may make it more adept at spreading between species and less susceptible to antiviral drugs, according to a new study.\n\nI don't like the sound of that at all.\n\nResearchers are telling us that the bird flu \"acquired mutations in late 2023 that allowed it to jump from wild birds to cattle in the Texas Panhandle\"...\n\nIn the new study, the researchers collected samples containing virus from 26 dairy farms in eight states. Cows are not typically susceptible to this type of influenza, but H5N1 appears to have acquired mutations in late 2023 that allowed it to jump from wild birds to cattle in the Texas Panhandle, the researchers said.\n\nThe virus then appears to have spread on dairy farms from Texas to Kansas, Michigan and New Mexico. In at least a dozen instances since then, H5N1 has also spilled from cows back into wild birds, and into poultry, domestic cats and a raccoon.\n\nThis is a very chilling development.\n\nIn the past, the bird flu would appear for a while and then go away.\n\nBut for the past couple of years it has been wiping out millions upon millions of birds all over the planet with no end in sight.\n\nFrom this point forward, will H5N1 also be a permanent threat to our cattle population?\n\nNeedless to say, that could represent a very serious threat to our food supply.\n\nEven more alarming is the fact that the strain of H5N1 that a dairy worker in Texas caught reportedly had \"a mutation that allowed it to infect people more efficiently\"...\n\nThe only person to have been diagnosed with bird flu during the current outbreak carried a virus with a mutation that allowed it to infect people more efficiently. One cow in the study also carried H5N1 with that mutation. More than 200 others were infected with versions of the virus bearing a different mutation that offers the same advantage.\n\nWhy are we only learning about this now?\n\nAnd what is going to happen if this mutation which enables H5N1 to \"infect people more efficiently\" starts spreading among wild animals all over the nation?\n\nThe New York Times is making it sound like we really could be on the brink of a major outbreak among humans.\n\nThankfully, the dairy worker in Texas that caught this version of the bird flu did not die, but he did experience \"bleeding in his eyeballs\"...\n\nThe first image of a Texas farm worker infected with bird flu from a cow shows he suffered bleeding in his eyeballs.\n\nIt is thought to be the first known case of mammal-to-human transmission and comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned bird flu (H5N1) viruses \"pose pandemic potential.\"\n\nThe dairy worker attended a hospital in March after experiencing painful red, weeping eyes with burst blood vessels.\n\nEven more disturbing, some of the cats that consumed raw milk from infected dairy cows in Texas experienced \"brain hemorrhaging\" and \"blindness\".\n\nIs this new version of H5N1 also able to cause \"brain hemorrhaging\" and \"blindness\" in humans?\n\nHopefully authorities will have some answers for us soon.\n\nWhat we do know is that viral fragments are getting into our milk supply.\n\nIn fact, the FDA discovered that viral fragments were in approximately one out of every five samples of grocery store milk that they tested...\n\nTests by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of retail milk samples might give some indication of how widespread the virus is. The agency found viral fragments in one in five samples of commercial milk, although this virus had been deactivated by pasteurization so was not infectious.\n\nThe good news is that it appears that the pasteurization process appears to kill the bird flu.\n\nBut authorities are warning that raw milk could contain the virus...\n\nAt the moment, scientists are focusing on raw milk as a risk factor for transmission to humans. While H5N1 infections in poultry usually result in respiratory illnesses, in cattle the virus seems to mainly target mammary glands, which might explain the high amount of virus found in raw milk from infected cows.\n\nUntil we know more, I think that it would be very wise to avoid drinking any raw milk for the foreseeable future.\n\nYou do not want to get this disease.\n\nAccording to the WHO, since 2003 there have been 888 confirmed human cases.\n\nOf those, 463 have died.\n\nBut as long as humans are only catching this virus from other mammals, we probably will not see a major global outbreak.\n\nHowever, if a strain comes along that can spread easily from human to human, we are going to have a massive problem on our hands and the level of fear that we will witness will be off the charts.\n\nI do not know how this particular story will end, but I am entirely convinced that we have entered an era when great pestilences will be very common.\n\nSo let us hope for the best, but let us also get prepared for the worst.\n\nThe past several years have demonstrated what fear of a disease can do, and H5N1 has the potential to absolutely dwarf anything that we have experienced up to this point.", "source": {"uri": "sonsoflibertymedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sons of Liberty Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_snyder@sonsoflibertymedia.com", "name": "Michael Snyder",

Then came word that barn cats -- half of them on one farm -- had died suddenly.\n\nWithin days, the Amarillo veterinarian was hearing about sick cows with unusual symptoms: high fevers, reluctance to eat and much less milk. Tests for typical illnesses came back negative.\n\nPetersen, who monitors more than 40,000 cattle on a dozen farms in the Texas Panhandle, collected samples from cats and cows and sent them to Dr. Drew Magstadt, a friend from college who now works at the veterinary diagnostic laboratory at Iowa State University.\n\nThe samples tested positive for a bird flu virus never before seen in cattle. It was the first proof that the bird flu, known as Type A H5N1, could infect cows. As of Wednesday, 36 U.S. herds had confirmed infections, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\n\"It was just a surprise,\" recalled Petersen. \"It was just a little bit of disbelief.\"\n\nAt the same time, on almost every farm with sick animals, Petersen said she saw sick people, too.\n\n\"We were actively checking on humans,\" Petersen said. \"I had people who never missed work, miss work.\"\n\nSo far, two people in the U.S. have been confirmed to be infected with H5N1, most recently a Texas dairy worker linked to the cattle outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two dozen people have been tested and about 100 people have been monitored since the virus appeared in cows, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a CDC respiratory diseases official, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nDaskalakis said CDC has seen no unusual flu trends in areas with infected cows, but some experts wonder if anecdotal reports of sick workers mean more than one person caught the virus from the animals.\n\nPetersen said some workers had symptoms consistent with flu: fever and body aches, stuffy nose or congestion. Some had conjunctivitis, the eye inflammation detected in the Texas dairy worker diagnosed with bird flu.\n\nDr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, has been taking samples from livestock and people on two Texas farms. On farms with confirmed cattle infections, there have also been reports of mild illnesses among the workers, he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHis research has been difficult. Many workers are reluctant to be tested. That may be because they have limited access to health care or fear divulging private health information.\n\nWithout confirmation, no one knows if the sick workers were infected with the bird flu virus or something unrelated, Gray said.\n\n\"They seem to be linked in time and space, so one would say it's biologically plausible,\" said Gray.\n\nSome of the workers who fell ill sought treatment and were offered oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu, Petersen said.\n\nSome farm workers who were exposed to infected animals or people were offered the medication, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said. State health officials are responsible for evaluating and providing treatment, according to federal guidelines.\n\nHealth officials in Texas provided Tamiflu to the person known to be infected with H5N1 and family members, plus two people on a second dairy farm who were exposed to infected animals, said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said he wasn't sure if others had been offered the antiviral.\n\nFarmers have been hesitant to allow health officials onto their land, said Dr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who consulted about the outbreak with Petersen.\n\n\"This particular disease is looked at as a scarlet letter,\" Russo said. \"It has this stigma associated with it right now.\"\n\nRusso called for wider testing of cattle, people and milk.\n\n\"We do not know what we do not measure,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the horse left the barn and took off a lot faster than we were able to mobilize.\"\n\nGray worries that a recent federal order requiring testing of all lactating dairy cows moving between states could hinder cooperation even further. All labs that conduct tests must report positive results to the Agriculture Department. But many farmers may simply decide against testing, hoping to outlast the outbreak, he said.\n\nThe reluctance of workers and farmers to allow testing is \"greatly hampering\" understanding of how the virus spreads, how large the outbreak is now and how quickly it may grow, Gray said.\n\n\"It's a negative, very negative, effect,\" he said.\n\nPetersen said she understands workers' and farmers' fears. She praised the farmers who had been willing to let her gather the first samples that confirmed the outbreak and reflected on what the results could mean.\n\n\"You immediately think about the cows, the people that care for them and the families that have these farms,\" she said. \"You're thinking about the big picture, long term. Your mind starts to go down that entire path of concern.\"\n\nTags Dcc Wire' Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

It's not a dire threat for most of us  --  yet", "body": "A cow grazes in a field at a dairy farm on April 26, 2024, in Petaluma, California. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is ordering dairy producers to test cows that produce milk for infections from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) before the animals are transported to a different state following the discovery of the virus in samples of pasteurized milk taken by the Food and Drug Administration. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images/TNS)\n\nHeadlines are flying after the Department of Agriculture confirmed that the H5N1 bird flu virus has infected dairy cows around the country. Tests have detected the virus among cattle in nine states, mainly in Texas and New Mexico, and most recently in Colorado, said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a May 1 event held by the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nA menagerie of other animals have been infected by H5N1, and at least one person in Texas. But what scientists fear most is if the virus were to spread efficiently from person to person. That hasn't happened and might not. Shah said the CDC considers the H5N1 outbreak \"a low risk to the general public at this time.\"\n\nViruses evolve and outbreaks can shift quickly. \"As with any major outbreak, this is moving at the speed of a bullet train,\" Shah said. \"What we'll be talking about is a snapshot of that fast-moving train.\" What he means is that what's known about the H5N1 bird flu today will undoubtedly change.\n\nWith that in mind, KFF Health News explains what you need to know now.\n\nQ: Who gets the bird flu?\n\nMainly birds. Over the past few years, however, the H5N1 bird flu virus has increasingly jumped from birds into mammals around the world. The growing list of more than 50 species includes seals, goats, skunks, cats, and wild bush dogs at a zoo in the United Kingdom. At least 24,000 sea lions died in outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in South America last year.\n\nWhat makes the current outbreak in cattle unusual is that it's spreading rapidly from cow to cow, whereas the other cases -- except for the sea lion infections -- appear limited. Researchers know this because genetic sequences of the H5N1 viruses drawn from cattle this year were nearly identical to one another.\n\nThe cattle outbreak is also concerning because the country has been caught off guard. Researchers examining the virus's genomes suggest it originally spilled over from birds into cows late last year in Texas, and has since spread among many more cows than have been tested. \"Our analyses show this has been circulating in cows for four months or so, under our noses,\" said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\nQ: Is this the start of the next pandemic?\n\nNot yet. But it's a thought worth considering because a bird flu pandemic would be a nightmare. More than half of people infected by older strains of H5N1 bird flu viruses from 2003 to 2016 died. Even if death rates turn out to be less severe for the H5N1 strain currently circulating in cattle, repercussions could involve loads of sick people and hospitals too overwhelmed to handle other medical emergencies.\n\nAlthough at least one person has been infected with H5N1 this year, the virus can't lead to a pandemic in its current state. To achieve that horrible status, a pathogen needs to sicken many people on multiple continents. And to do that, the H5N1 virus would need to infect a ton of people. That won't happen through occasional spillovers of the virus from farm animals into people. Rather, the virus must acquire mutations for it to spread from person to person, like the seasonal flu, as a respiratory infection transmitted largely through the air as people cough, sneeze, and breathe. As we learned in the depths of COVID-19, airborne viruses are hard to stop.\n\nThat hasn't happened yet. However, H5N1 viruses now have plenty of chances to evolve as they replicate within thousands of cows. Like all viruses, they mutate as they replicate, and mutations that improve the virus's survival are passed to the next generation. And because cows are mammals, the viruses could be getting better at thriving within cells that are closer to ours than birds'.\n\nThe evolution of a pandemic-ready bird flu virus could be aided by a sort of superpower possessed by many viruses. Namely, they sometimes swap their genes with other strains in a process called reassortment. In a study published in 2009, Worobey and other researchers traced the origin of the H1N1 \"swine flu\" pandemic to events in which different viruses causing the swine flu, bird flu, and human flu mixed and matched their genes within pigs that they were simultaneously infecting. Pigs need not be involved this time around, Worobey warned.\n\nQ: Will a pandemic start if a person drinks virus-contaminated milk?\n\nNot yet. Cow's milk, as well as powdered milk and infant formula, sold in stores is considered safe because the law requires all milk sold commercially to be pasteurized. That process of heating milk at high temperatures kills bacteria, viruses, and other teeny organisms. Tests have identified fragments of H5N1 viruses in milk from grocery stores but confirm that the virus bits are dead and, therefore, harmless.\n\nUnpasteurized \"raw\" milk, however, has been shown to contain living H5N1 viruses, which is why the FDA and other health authorities strongly advise people not to drink it. Doing so could cause a person to become seriously ill or worse. But even then, a pandemic is unlikely to be sparked because the virus -- in its current form -- does not spread efficiently from person to person, as the seasonal flu does.\n\nQ: What should be done?\n\nA lot! Because of a lack of surveillance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies have allowed the H5N1 bird flu to spread under the radar in cattle. To get a handle on the situation, the USDA recently ordered all lactating dairy cattle to be tested before farmers move them to other states, and the outcomes of the tests to be reported.\n\nBut just as restricting covid tests to international travelers in early 2020 allowed the coronavirus to spread undetected, testing only cows that move across state lines would miss plenty of cases.\n\nSuch limited testing won't reveal how the virus is spreading among cattle -- information desperately needed so farmers can stop it. A leading hypothesis is that viruses are being transferred from one cow to the next through the machines used to milk them.\n\nTo boost testing, Fred Gingrich, executive director of a nonprofit organization for farm veterinarians, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, said the government should offer funds to cattle farmers who report cases so that they have an incentive to test. Barring that, he said, reporting just adds reputational damage atop financial loss.\n\n\"These outbreaks have a significant economic impact,\" Gingrich said. \"Farmers lose about 20% of their milk production in an outbreak because animals quit eating, produce less milk, and some of that milk is abnormal and then can't be sold.\"\n\nThe government has made the H5N1 tests free for farmers, Gingrich added, but they haven't budgeted money for veterinarians who must sample the cows, transport samples, and file paperwork. \"Tests are the least expensive part,\" he said.\n\nIf testing on farms remains elusive, evolutionary virologists can still learn a lot by analyzing genomic sequences from H5N1 viruses sampled from cattle. The differences between sequences tell a story about where and when the current outbreak began, the path it travels, and whether the viruses are acquiring mutations that pose a threat to people. Yet this vital research has been hampered by the USDA's slow and incomplete posting of genetic data, Worobey said.\n\nThe government should also help poultry farmers prevent H5N1 outbreaks since those kill many birds and pose a constant threat of spillover, said Maurice Pitesky, an avian disease specialist at the University of California-Davis.\n\nWaterfowl like ducks and geese are the usual sources of outbreaks on poultry farms, and researchers can detect their proximity using remote sensing and other technologies. By zeroing in on zones of potential spillover, farmers can target their attention. That can mean routine surveillance to detect early signs of infections in poultry, using water cannons to shoo away migrating flocks, relocating farm animals, or temporarily ushering them into barns. \"We should be spending on prevention,\" Pitesky said.\n\nQ: OK it's not a pandemic, but what could happen to people who get this year's H5N1 bird flu?\n\nNo one really knows. Only one person in Texas has been diagnosed with the disease this year, in April. This person worked closely with dairy cows, and had a mild case with an eye infection. The CDC found out about them because of its surveillance process. Clinics are supposed to alert state health departments when they diagnose farmworkers with the flu, using tests that detect influenza viruses, broadly. State health departments then confirm the test, and if it's positive, they send a person's sample to a CDC laboratory, where it is checked for the H5N1 virus, specifically. \"Thus far we have received 23,\" Shah said. \"All but one of those was negative.\"\n\nState health department officials are also monitoring around 150 people, he said, who have spent time around cattle. They're checking in with these farmworkers via phone calls, text messages, or in-person visits to see if they develop symptoms. And if that happens, they'll be tested.\n\nAnother way to assess farmworkers would be to check their blood for antibodies against the H5N1 bird flu virus; a positive result would indicate they might have been unknowingly infected. But Shah said health officials are not yet doing this work.\n\n\"The fact that we're four months in and haven't done this isn't a good sign,\" Worobey said. \"I'm not super worried about a pandemic at the moment, but we should start acting like we don't want it to happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "americanmilitarynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Military News"}, "authors": [],

When hundreds of millions of birds were dying because of the bird flu, the mainstream media didn't seem to care very much, and so most people in the general population didn't seem to care very much. Then the bird flu started infecting lots of mammals all over the globe, and the mainstream media still didn't seem to care very much. But now here we are in the middle of 2024, and the mainstream media has suddenly decided to ramp up the fear level. Even though there has only been one confirmed human case in the U.S. so far this year, the mainstream media is pumping out article after article about the threat that H5N1 could potentially pose to humanity. Do they know something that the rest of us do not?\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nIt is quite true that if a version of H5N1 comes along that can spread easily from human to human, the death toll could be catastrophic.\n\nAre we on the verge of seeing that happen?\n\nThe New York Times is reporting that H5N1 \"has acquired dozens of new mutations\", and apparently some of them \"may make it more adept at spreading between species\"...\n\nThe bird flu virus sweeping across dairy farms in multiple states has acquired dozens of new mutations, including some that may make it more adept at spreading between species and less susceptible to antiviral drugs, according to a new study.\n\nI don't like the sound of that at all.\n\nResearchers are telling us that the bird flu \"acquired mutations in late 2023 that allowed it to jump from wild birds to cattle in the Texas Panhandle\"...\n\nIn the new study, the researchers collected samples containing virus from 26 dairy farms in eight states. Cows are not typically susceptible to this type of influenza, but H5N1 appears to have acquired mutations in late 2023 that allowed it to jump from wild birds to cattle in the Texas Panhandle, the researchers said.\n\nThe virus then appears to have spread on dairy farms from Texas to Kansas, Michigan and New Mexico. In at least a dozen instances since then, H5N1 has also spilled from cows back into wild birds, and into poultry, domestic cats and a raccoon.\n\nThis is a very chilling development.\n\nIn the past, the bird flu would appear for a while and then go away.\n\nBut for the past couple of years it has been wiping out millions upon millions of birds all over the planet with no end in sight.\n\nFrom this point forward, will H5N1 also be a permanent threat to our cattle population?\n\nNeedless to say, that could represent a very serious threat to our food supply.\n\nEven more alarming is the fact that the strain of H5N1 that a dairy worker in Texas caught reportedly had \"a mutation that allowed it to infect people more efficiently\"...\n\nThe only person to have been diagnosed with bird flu during the current outbreak carried a virus with a mutation that allowed it to infect people more efficiently. One cow in the study also carried H5N1 with that mutation. More than 200 others were infected with versions of the virus bearing a different mutation that offers the same advantage.\n\nWhy are we only learning about this now?\n\nAnd what is going to happen if this mutation which enables H5N1 to \"infect people more efficiently\" starts spreading among wild animals all over the nation?\n\nThe New York Times is making it sound like we really could be on the brink of a major outbreak among humans.\n\nThankfully, the dairy worker in Texas that caught this version of the bird flu did not die, but he did experience \"bleeding in his eyeballs\"...\n\nThe first image of a Texas farm worker infected with bird flu from a cow shows he suffered bleeding in his eyeballs.\n\nIt is thought to be the first known case of mammal-to-human transmission and comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned bird flu (H5N1) viruses \"pose pandemic potential.\"\n\nThe dairy worker attended a hospital in March after experiencing painful red, weeping eyes with burst blood vessels.\n\nEven more disturbing, some of the cats that consumed raw milk from infected dairy cows in Texas experienced \"brain hemorrhaging\" and \"blindness\".\n\nIs this new version of H5N1 also able to cause \"brain hemorrhaging\" and \"blindness\" in humans?\n\nHopefully authorities will have some answers for us soon.\n\nWhat we do know is that viral fragments are getting into our milk supply.\n\nIn fact, the FDA discovered that viral fragments were in approximately one out of every five samples of grocery store milk that they tested...\n\nTests by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of retail milk samples might give some indication of how widespread the virus is. The agency found viral fragments in one in five samples of commercial milk, although this virus had been deactivated by pasteurization so was not infectious.\n\nThe good news is that it appears that the pasteurization process appears to kill the bird flu.\n\nBut authorities are warning that raw milk could contain the virus...\n\nAt the moment, scientists are focusing on raw milk as a risk factor for transmission to humans. While H5N1 infections in poultry usually result in respiratory illnesses, in cattle the virus seems to mainly target mammary glands, which might explain the high amount of virus found in raw milk from infected cows.\n\nUntil we know more, I think that it would be very wise to avoid drinking any raw milk for the foreseeable future.\n\nYou do not want to get this disease.\n\nAccording to the WHO, since 2003 there have been 888 confirmed human cases.\n\nOf those, 463 have died.\n\nBut as long as humans are only catching this virus from other mammals, we probably will not see a major global outbreak.\n\nHowever, if a strain comes along that can spread easily from human to human, we are going to have a massive problem on our hands and the level of fear that we will witness will be off the charts.", "source": {"uri": "sgtreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SGT Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Panhandle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas Panhandle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raccoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammary gland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 90}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541303", "eventUri": "eng-9541303", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

monitoring and WHO and partners will continue to regularly assess and publish public health risk assessments for avian influenza.'\n\nThe agency held a webinar today, which was attended by its own infectious disease experts as well as officials from the CDC.\n\nThe meeting came after USDA researchers warned about H5N1's new mutations.\n\nThey wrote: 'Some [mutations] in virus population were

491 mutations were detected in the sample, of which 309 were associated with 'functional changes' in the virus.\n\nThis included mutations that may make the virus more pathogenic, or more likely to cause an infection, better adapted to mammals and better able to infect new species.\n\nTesting also suggested that the outbreak in cattle actually began in late 2023, about four months before it was first reported.\n\nResearchers suggested the virus had first jumped from birds to cows in the Texas Panhandle, and then spread between herds in the state as well as to herds in Kansas, Michigan and New Mexico among others.\n\nOutbreaks in several herds could not be linked back to others, suggesting some infected herds have not yet had the virus detected.\n\nThere were also cases reported where the virus had spilled back from cows into wild birds, poultry, domestic cats and a raccoon.\n\nAt least 36 herds across nine states have been infected with bird flu, data shows, although experts are

Experts are confident the meat supply is safe By DEVI SHASTRI - AP Health Writer\n\nSo far, two people in the U.S. have been confirmed to be infected with H5N1, most recently a Texas dairy worker linked to the cattle outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two dozen people have been tested and about 100 people have been monitored since the virus appeared in cows, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a CDC respiratory diseases official, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nDaskalakis said CDC has seen no unusual flu trends in areas with infected cows, but some experts wonder if anecdotal reports of sick workers mean more than one person caught the virus from the animals.\n\nPetersen said some workers had symptoms consistent with flu: fever and body aches, stuffy nose or congestion. Some had conjunctivitis, the eye inflammation detected in the Texas dairy worker diagnosed with bird flu.\n\nDr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, has been taking samples from livestock and people on two Texas farms. On farms with confirmed cattle infections, there have also been reports of mild illnesses among the workers, he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHis research has been difficult. Many workers are reluctant to be tested. That may be because they have limited access to health care or fear divulging private health information.\n\nWithout confirmation, no one knows if the sick workers were infected with the bird flu virus or something unrelated, Gray said.\n\n\"They seem to be linked in time and space, so one would say it's biologically plausible,\" said Gray.\n\nSome of the workers who fell ill sought treatment and were offered oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu, Petersen said.\n\nSome farm workers who were exposed to infected animals or people were offered the medication, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said. State health officials are responsible for evaluating and providing treatment, according to federal guidelines.\n\nHealth officials in Texas provided Tamiflu to the person known to be infected with H5N1 and family members, plus two people on a second dairy farm who were exposed to infected animals, said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said he wasn't sure if others had been offered the antiviral.\n\nFarmers have been hesitant to allow health officials onto their land, said Dr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who consulted about the outbreak with Petersen.\n\n\"This particular disease is looked at as a scarlet letter,\" Russo said. \"It has this stigma associated with it right now.\"\n\nRusso called for wider testing of cattle, people and milk.\n\n\"We do not know what we do not measure,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the horse left the barn and took off a lot faster than we were able to mobilize.\"\n\nGray worries that a recent federal order requiring testing of all lactating dairy cows moving between states could hinder cooperation even further.

She praised the farmers who had been willing to let her gather the first samples that confirmed the outbreak and reflected on what the results could mean.\n\n\"You immediately think about the cows, the people that care for them and the families that have these farms,\" she said. \"You're thinking about the big picture, long term.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture also tested ground beef for bird flu, and all the samples came back negative. But raw, unpasteurized milk -- which health officials warn against in general -- may not be safe, since it hasn't gone through the germ-killing process.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has asked states to prepare for more bird flu cases. On May 6, the agency requested that states provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to dairy farm workers who might be at risk, according to an emailed statement. Previously, the CDC asked states to gear up to test at-risk people for the virus, Reuters reported, but the agency has consistently assured Americans that the risk to the general public remains low.\n\nThe one infected person is a dairy worker who contracted bird flu in Texas, where the virus has been spreading among cattle. The worker tested positive after developing pink eye, which was their only symptom, according to a New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) report published on May 3. Dairy cattle herds have also been infected in Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio and South Dakota. Bird flu hasn't spread to any other people so far, but it has been detected in wild birds, including several geese, in New York City parks and green spaces, according to a new study, and there are renewed fears about other mammals being infected.\n\nHow concerned should you be about bird flu, and what might this mean for the food supply? Here's what you need to know.\n\nBird flu -- clinically known as influenza A (H5N1) -- is a variation of flu virus that spreads primarily among birds and poultry and can be highly contagious and even fatal among birds, according to the CDC. Occasionally, the virus will jump to other animals if they eat infected birds or drink water contaminated by the feces of infected birds, the CDC says. That has become more common in recent years. Viruses are constantly mutating, and the more they spread, the more they mutate. A recent family of variants may be particularly adept at infecting other animals, including cattle, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIt's rare for the virus to infect humans, and when it does happen, it's usually confined to one person who was in close contact with an infected animal and doesn't spread to others. Bird flu may cause mild to severe sickness in humans, and it has the potential to cause pneumonia and severe, sometimes fatal lung inflammation. Since 2020, there have been 26 cases in humans confirmed by the WHO, seven of which have been fatal.\n\nThe CDC continues to call for calm and considers the risk to the general public low, but, on April 5, the agency requested that state health departments begin gearing up in case additional people are infected.\n\nSo far the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed that there are 12 infected dairy cattle herds in Texas, four in Kansas, eight in New Mexico, six in Michigan, two in Idaho and one each in Colorado, North Carolina, Ohio and South Dakota. Cases in birds in New York City parks and green spaces have also been confirmed by Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai researchers.\n\nThe infected person in Texas was diagnosed after developing conjunctivitis, or pink eye. It's only the second-ever human case of bird flu in the U.S.; the first was a poultry farmworker who was infected in 2022 while culling infected birds and recovered after experiencing only mild fatigue. Eye inflammation was the only symptom the Texas dairy worker experienced; they never developed any respiratory symptoms that health officials might have expected with bird flu, according to the NEJM report.\n\nOther dairy and poultry farmworkers are the CDC's main concern now. On May 6, the agency asked state health and agriculture departments to provide PPE to dairy farm workers at risk of contracting bird flu in an effort to prevent any additional cases, the agency said in an emailed statement. So far, the CDC has tested at least 30 people for bird flu and monitored at least 220 for symptoms. The agency has also asked state health officials to take other steps like making sure they have bird flu tests available to confirm possible infections. It also said health officials should stay in close contact with veterinarians and agriculture department officials and asked to be notified of any \"challenges\" states encounter.\n\nWhile farmworkers are at the greatest risk because of their close and frequent proximity to potentially infected animals, the Icahn School of Medicine study authors warned that it's not impossible for city dwellers to be exposed. \"Our work highlights that the interface between animals and humans that may give rise to zoonotic infections\" -- germs that spread between animals and people -- \"or even pandemics is not limited to rural environments and commercial poultry operations but extends into the heart of our urban centers,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nFor the general public, the risk remains low, the CDC says. Bird flu has never been very good at spreading from person to person, so it's unlikely to become widespread. The virus would have to mutate in some specific, key ways to make that possible. The good news is that it hasn't, according to preliminary testing of a sample of virus from the infected person, who has only mild symptoms.\n\nTesting of commercial milk -- the kind sold in grocery stores -- detected genetic remnants of the bird flu virus, which has infected both egg-laying chickens and dairy cows in the U.S., in about 20% of samples, according to the FDA. Separate research found virus particles in 58 out of 150 samples of milk purchased in Midwestern states, including ones without confirmed cattle infections, suggesting bird flu may be even more widespread among dairy cows than the FDA's study showed. That doesn't necessarily mean the milk can make you sick, but regulators are now performing additional tests to determine \"if infectious virus is present,\" the FDA said on April 26.\n\nAccording to the FDA's statement, while pasteurization -- a sterilization process that kills bacteria and viruses -- likely inactivates the virus -- meaning that it should not be able to infect someone who drinks milk -- it \"is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles.\" So far, the agency has \"seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" officials said in the statement. The USDA echoed that sentiment, maintaining that \"that there is \"no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply because products are pasteurized before entering the market.\"\n\nStill, the USDA has stepped up efforts to stop bird flu from spreading. On April 24, the agency issued a federal order telling dairy farms to test any cattle being moved across state lines for bird flu. The agency had previously told farmers to test any cattle with symptoms and throw out milk from infected cows. The USDA is also introducing the testing of ground beef from states with infected herds, since some dairy cattle are slaughtered and used to make beef, the agency said in an April 29 statement. USDA officials are also conducting tests of the effects of cooking ground beef on a \"virus surrogate,\" though the statement noted that cooking meat to a safe temperature is generally sufficient to kill bacteria and viruses.\n\nOther countries are also concerned: On April 15, Colombia became the first country to restrict the importation of beef and beef products from U.S. states with infected herds, Reuters reported.\n\nBird flu has also been found in unpasteurized milk, but you shouldn't consume unpasteurized milk or cheese regardless, the CDC warns, because they carry risk of infections like listeria. The CDC also says that the risk of being infected from eating eggs is low, and properly cooking them would kill any virus anyway.\n\nFarms are prohibited from selling products -- including milk and eggs -- from sick animals, so it's unlikely that contaminated food would wind up on grocery store shelves. The most likely impact of the bird flu outbreak in animals on the food supply is rising prices. Egg prices have shot up as chickens have been culled or died, limiting the supply of eggs. Milk prices could see increases but are stable so far.\n\nTwo candidate vaccines -- drafts of what would become the shots -- seem to be good matches for the current strain of bird flu, the Washington Post reports. The federal government has a stockpile of enough doses to vaccinate a fifth of the American population, officials told Barron's. However, the vaccines are undergoing clinical testing, so it's unclear how effective they will be. Antiviral drugs can also be used to treat bird flu, although the CDC says that some variations of bird flu first found in Asia aren't as responsive to these treatments.\n\nDr. Arnold Monto, a professor emeritus of epidemiology at the University of Michigan and member of the FDA's vaccine committee, tells Yahoo Life that the U.S.'s bird flu vaccines require adjuvants, ingredients that improve human's immune responses. An official with the Department of Health and Human Services also told the Washington Post that components for the vaccines are being tested, and it would likely take weeks to months for them to be ready for widespread distribution. Monto adds that the vaccine would also likely be given to only those at high risk -- poultry and dairy farmworkers -- since there's no evidence that bird flu spreads among humans.\n\nAvoid close or prolonged contact with wild birds, cattle or any other animal suspected of being infected. The CDC also recommends steering clear of surfaces that may be contaminated with raw milk, animal feces, litter or anything else that might have crossed paths with an infected animal.\n\nCooking poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165\u02daF will kill off any virus. It's also recommended for milk drinkers to consume only pasteurized milk to prevent contracting bird flu or other viruses or bacteria from raw foods, and to avoid raw or undercooked foods sourced from animals that may be infected with bird flu.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis",

Bill Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, doesn't think that a bird flu pandemic is imminent -- at least not yet.\n\nQ: Some experts are saying that the spread of bird flu in cows may be much broader than it appears. Why would that be? Why wouldn't we have a handle on the spread?\n\nA: Outbreaks at the interface of animal and human health are hard to study in the U.S. because they're covered by different jurisdictions. The USDA [U.S. Department of Agriculture] oversees farm issues and its focus is on agriculture. While the USDA does have an emergency response team dedicated to influenza, farmers may have concerns about people coming onto their property to collect samples from livestock or workers, and some of those workers may not have documented immigration status. But those workers are at risk of infection, as shown by a case of human infection that occurred in early April. Samples from animals at the relevant farm were reportedly 'not available' for testing.\n\nIf we can't collect samples directly from cattle, we have to look at something like milk, and we have indeed found that a lot of tested milk samples contain genetic traces of the bird flu. But that does not tell us how many cows might be infected. It's not at all clear because the milk we are testing is not from just one cow but many, and so we have no idea how many of them were contributing to the signal. All we can say is that it is certainly not a small number given how many samples are coming back positive, but beyond that we just don't know exactly how many infected cows there are, where they are, or how many may have been very mildly infected and not detected.\n\nOne of the problems is the way public health has been politicized following the COVID pandemic. But the virus doesn't care what side you're on -- it only cares if you have the appropriate receptors so that it can get into your cells, and from there into somebody else.\n\nQ: What sort of information would help scientists figure out the extent of bird flu spread among cows?\n\nA: Much more sampling, from cattle with and without symptoms, as well as from workers who have contact with them. Ideally this would include antibody tests to determine whether they have been infected and recovered in the past. Transparency is really important when it comes to public health.\n\nWhile genomes from the outbreak have been made available by the USDA -- although they did not do so with alacrity -- they were initially criticized for lacking essential content such as when and where the samples were collected, which is really important to start making sense of the spread. It now looks like there was a single introduction from birds into dairy cattle in Texas, which was then disseminated to other states via movement of asymptomatic cattle. We can also see that the genetic variation is consistent with rapid exponential growth. The USDA has recently required dairy cattle to test negative for the virus before being transported across state lines, which is a welcome step. Although at present testing is only required for dairy cows that are lactating, so it is easy to see how the virus could slip through the net. In any case, this may be a case of shutting the barn door after the cow has bolted.\n\nQ: As of now, there's just one known instance in which a cow appears to have infected a human with bird flu -- a case of conjunctivitis in a dairy farm worker from Texas. How could the virus start spreading more in humans?\n\nA: It could adapt to bind to the receptors that are found in our upper airways, which would help respiratory spread. Right now it sticks to receptors deeper in the lung, which is one reason why infections there, when they occur, are so nasty. Cows don't typically get respiratory infections with the sort of flu viruses that transmit among humans because they don't have the right receptors in the right place. Instead, milk production seems to be key for transmission in the current outbreak. But pigs can be infected by all sorts of different flu viruses that are also capable of respiratory spread among humans. Previously we've seen pandemics arise from what's called reassortment, in which a pig gets infected with two different viruses, and the genetic material gets mixed up in the pig, and what comes out is a new virus with new properties. That's one way that the virus might make an evolutionary leap and start to transmit among humans, so we should keep a close eye on pigs to see whether the cattle outbreak is seeding infections into them.\n\nQ: If the virus does start spreading in humans, could that cause another pandemic?\n\nA: It certainly could but it would depend on the state of our immunity to whichever virus gets lucky and exactly how transmissible it is. As it happens, the infections that have been occurring in Texas seem to be a type that is a good match for some existing components of a vaccine that we would be able to start making.\n\nOn the other hand, vaccines don't appear from thin air; they take time to produce. One of the major ways that we make them involves hen's eggs. Don't forget, we're dealing with an avian flu that has affected chickens -- outbreaks in poultry farms in two states have recently been detected. As a result of bird flu outbreaks, eggs have been in short supply at some points in the last few years, and that could make ramping up production of a vaccine a more difficult task. We won't be able to do it overnight. It would take months at the very least.\n\nAnother tool we have is the antiviral drug Tamiflu. But to be effective, it needs to be given quite early on in the infection. So we also need to have tests ready.\n\nQ: So if the virus did start to spread quickly, how prepared are we?\n\nA: What disturbs me most about this is that there's no serious discussion about what we would do if the you-know-what hits the fan. If we were to see any evidence of human-to-human transmission without links to livestock, that would be immensely concerning. If we see larger numbers of such infections in clusters, or even more than one cluster, it would be time to start making vaccine -- time to pull out all the stops. The reason is that, in the early stages of infectious disease outbreaks, you're always playing catchup. You're racing behind the virus, seeing where it has been, not where it is. You can bet that if we are seeing cases, there are others that we're not seeing.\n\nQ: Genetic material from H5N1 has been found in pasteurized milk, and the FDA has been testing ground beef. Should we be concerned about risk to humans?\n\nA: Pasteurization inactivates the virus, so pasteurized milk is safe. And right now tests on ground beef have come back negative. We should remember that these tests are exquisitely sensitive, and do not reflect live virus. However, I would avoid unpasteurized or 'raw' milk products. There have been several infections in cats that almost certainly were exposed by drinking milk on the farms in question.\n\nQ: What's the bottom line? How worried should we be about an outbreak?\n\nA: If it was easy for this virus to spread among humans, it would have likely done it already. Having said that, this strain is far better than most bird flu at infecting all sorts of different mammals -- there have been outbreaks in seals, farmed mink, and now cattle. We have seen sporadic spillover infections in skunk and racoons among others, as well as the single human case identified so far.

Then came word that barn cats -- half of them on one farm -- had died suddenly.\n\nWithin days, the Amarillo veterinarian was hearing about sick cows with unusual symptoms: high fevers, reluctance to eat and much less milk. Tests for typical illnesses came back negative.\n\nPetersen, who monitors more than 40,000 cattle on a dozen farms in the Texas Panhandle, collected samples from cats and cows and sent them to Dr. Drew Magstadt, a friend from college who now works at the veterinary diagnostic laboratory at Iowa State University.\n\nThe samples tested positive for a bird flu virus never before seen in cattle. It was the first proof that the bird flu, known as Type A H5N1, could infect cows.

Experts are confident the meat supply is safe By DEVI SHASTRI - AP Health Writer\n\nSo far, two people in the U.S. have been confirmed to be infected with H5N1, most recently a Texas dairy worker linked to the cattle outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two dozen people have been tested and about 100 people have been monitored since the virus appeared in cows, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a CDC respiratory diseases official, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nDaskalakis said CDC has seen no unusual flu trends in areas with infected cows, but some experts wonder if anecdotal reports of sick workers mean more than one person caught the virus from the animals.\n\nPetersen said some workers had symptoms consistent with flu: fever and body aches, stuffy nose or congestion. Some had conjunctivitis, the eye inflammation detected in the Texas dairy worker diagnosed with bird flu.\n\nDr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, has been taking samples from livestock and people on two Texas farms. On farms with confirmed cattle infections, there have also been reports of mild illnesses among the workers, he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHis research has been difficult. Many workers are reluctant to be tested. That may be because they have limited access to health care or fear divulging private health information.\n\nWithout confirmation, no one knows if the sick workers were infected with the bird flu virus or something unrelated, Gray said.\n\n\"They seem to be linked in time and space, so one would say it's biologically plausible,\" said Gray.\n\nSome of the workers who fell ill sought treatment and were offered oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu, Petersen said.\n\nSome farm workers who were exposed to infected animals or people were offered the medication, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said. State health officials are responsible for evaluating and providing treatment, according to federal guidelines.\n\nHealth officials in Texas provided Tamiflu to the person known to be infected with H5N1 and family members, plus two people on a second dairy farm who were exposed to infected animals, said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said he wasn't sure if others had been offered the antiviral.\n\nFarmers have been hesitant to allow health officials onto their land, said Dr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who consulted about the outbreak with Petersen.\n\n\"This particular disease is looked at as a scarlet letter,\" Russo said. \"It has this stigma associated with it right now.\"\n\nRusso called for wider testing of cattle, people and milk.\n\n\"We do not know what we do not measure,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the horse left the barn and took off a lot faster than we were able to mobilize.\"\n\nGray worries that a recent federal order requiring testing of all lactating dairy cows moving between states could hinder cooperation even further. All labs that conduct tests must report positive results to the Agriculture Department. But many farmers may simply decide against testing, hoping to outlast the outbreak, he said.\n\nThe reluctance of workers and farmers to allow testing is \"greatly hampering\" understanding of how the virus spreads, how large the outbreak is now and how quickly it may grow, Gray said.\n\n\"It's a negative, very negative, effect,\" he said.\n\nPetersen said she understands workers' and farmers' fears. She praised the farmers who had been willing to let her gather the first samples that confirmed the outbreak and reflected on what the results could mean.\n\n\"You immediately think about the cows, the people that care for them and the families that have these farms,\" she said. \"You're thinking about the big picture, long term.

How long it's taking cows to show symptoms once they become infected, how exactly the virus is spreading among herds, how long it's taking cows to rid the virus from their bodies, or what the risks are to exposed calves or other livestock species.\n\nBut despite these unknowns, Baldwin said guidance for stakeholders involved in county fairs and shows - events that are a couple of months away - have not yet been drafted.\n\n\"We don't have guidance yet,\" Baldwin said during a Q&A portion of the town hall, adding that \"the USDA is looking to issue some guidance for shows and fairs, and we will follow their lead.\"\n\nIt's not clear how much a federal order put in place on April 24 and adopted by the state not long after will be able to mitigate transmission among dairy herds, as the virus appears to be spreading among cows who aren't showing any symptoms and testing remains voluntary and encouraged only for visibly sick animals, according to STAT News.\n\nSigns of HPAI in dairy cows include decreased feed intake, a significant drop in milk production and abnormal milk which appears thicker in consistency and discolored, Baldwin said. Other signs producers should watch out for in their herds are slight fevers and tacky stools, she added.\n\nThough HPAI leads to severe disease and death in bird populations (hence the name \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\"), H5N1 isn't proving to be severe or deadly in dairy cattle, Baldwin said.\n\n\"We are not seeing significant illness or mortality like in birds. Cattle appears to recover after supportive care,\" she said.\n\nHow can I protect myself from catching bird flu?\n\nFederal and state officials maintain that the risk to the general public for getting infected with bird flu is low, though risk depends on exposure, according to Dr. Rachel Herlihy, the state epidemiologist at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE).\n\n\"People who are exposed to sick birds and cattle are more likely to get infected,\" she said during Wednesday's town hall.\n\nOnly two cases of H5N1 among humans have been confirmed since the current outbreak started in the U.S two years ago: A Colorado poultry worker in April 2022 and a Texas dairy worker who was exposed to sick cattle in early March. In both cases, the workers experienced mild illness and recovered after a few days.\n\nNo human-to-human transmission of bird flu has been detected so far, and Herlihy said additional genetic changes in the virus would need to occur for that to happen.\n\nShe did warn, however, that \"as the virus continues to spread among different species and spreads more widely, the virus has more opportunities to evolve and encounter humans more often.\"\n\nState News\n\nBird flu confirmed in Colorado dairy cows, joining 8 other states with outbreaks \u00d3scar Contreras 7:30 PM, Apr 26, 2024\n\nHerlihy said the state is working on educating workers who are frequently exposed to sick poultry or cattle about the measures they should take to protect themselves and reduce their risk of catching bird flu, such as wearing proper personal protective equipment (PPE), like N95 masks, goggles and gloves; monitoring for flu-like symptoms if feeling ill; getting tested for influenza viruses and mentioning recent exposure to sick birds or cattle, and getting antiviral treatment, if exposed.\n\nDuring the town hall, Herlihy revealed that state health officials were monitoring 70 dairy farm workers who may have been exposed to H5N1, though no detailed information about those cases was immediately released.\n\n\"To date, none of them have reported symptoms of avian flu, so they have not met criteria to be tested for avian flu per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\" a CDPHE spokesperson said in an email late Wednesday afternoon.\n\nTesting would be available for anyone exposed to bird flu, and antivirals would be provided to those experiencing symptoms while awaiting test results, the CDPHE spokesperson added.\n\nThe general public should avoid contact with sick birds or other animals to reduce their chances of becoming infected with bird flu, Herlihy said. If you must handle sick or dead birds or animals, be sure to wear gloves, a high-quality mask such as a KN95 or N95 respirator, and eye protection. After handling the animal, double bag it and throw it away in your municipal trash can before thoroughly washing your hands.\n\nHow safe is the commercial food supply?\n\nWhile early research lead by the FDA has detected remnants of bird flu in retail milk, follow-up studies in which scientists tried to grow live virus from those grocery store samples did not yield any positive results, which suggests that pasteurization is killing H5N1 in milk.\n\nOther milk-related products that undergo pasteurization, such as cheeses, sour creams, yogurts, butters, etc., are also safe to eat, health officials said.\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials have said the likelihood that eggs will contain H5N1 is low \"due to the safeguards in place, which include testing of flocks and federal inspection programs,\" that call for the disposal of eggs and meat from infected poultry. Proper egg storage and preparation \"further reduce the risk,\" they said.\n\nPeople should avoid raw milk and dairy products made from raw milk at the moment, scientists recently told STAT News, as raw milk does not go through the process of pasteurization, which kills harmful viruses and bacteria. In Texas, a large number of cats who were fed raw milk developed neurological symptoms and later died, though scientists said they could not completely rule out if eating dead birds caused the deadly infection.\n\nRaw milk can't be sold in Colorado and a bill aimed at legalizing it for sale across the state died in the legislature this year, though Coloradans could still get it if they enter what's called a herd-share agreement.\n\nWhile Colorado has \"not yet tested for this particular virus in swine and beef cattle,\" according to Baldwin, ground beef appears to be safe for consumption after USDA officials found no virus in retail meat from states with bird flu outbreaks, though they said more testing will be done to determine if the virus can live in beef muscle tissue to \"reaffirm consumer confidence\" in the commercial food supply.\n\nThe state veterinarian also said the FDA was looking at expanding testing to other cattle species, though a timeline of when that would happen was not immediately known.\n\nAs the spread of H5N1 among dairy cows continues to evolve, Baldwin said the state is working to get answers as quickly as possible, \"because the goal is to stop additional spread of this virus.\"\n\nNo plans yet to modify Colorado livestock fairs, shows despite presence of bird flu in dairy cows\n\nNews Tips What should KOAA5 cover?

The true number of infected cows is thought to be much higher - but it is difficult to detect the virus in cattle, while surveillance is low.\n\nCrucially, bird flu appears to be passing between cattle relatively easily compared to other non-bird animals that have contracted the virus which have nearly always got it from birds and only very rarely, if ever, from other animals of the same species.\n\nScientists say this means the virus can spread much more quickly through cow populations, from which it is more likely to evolve into a strain that can be passed easily between humans - creating the risk of a new pandemic.\n\nUK scientists and government officials are already monitoring the outbreak in America, in case it infects herds in Britain, revealed in April.\n\nDefra said there was no evidence that the virus was currently spreading in cattle in the UK, and that the risk to humans from the virus more generally remains low. But scientists are understood to remain \"vigilant\" to any changes in risk to Britain.\n\n\"The risk is very low but it's real enough to make me nervous,\" Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia, told .\n\n\"If it is spreading between cattle then presumably it is already halfway to being transmissible between humans. Cows are closer to humans evolutionary than birds are,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick University, said cattle could become \"a permanent reservoir for the virus\" where it could evolve to become more infectious to humans.\n\n\"There is evidence that a single cow can harbour several different types of the flu virus, further increasing the chances of generating new strains that could be more infectious to humans,\" he added.\n\nNirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US said: \"As with any major outbreak, this is moving at the speed of a bullet train,\" adding that it poses \"a low risk to the general public at this time\".\n\nSo far, the cow bird flu is known to have infected one dairy worker in Texas - and although the symptoms were only mild this is the first time a human has caught bird flu of an animal other than a bird.\n\nThere are expected to be other cases of cows infecting humans but they have not been confirmed. At the moment, however, bird flu infections in cattle don't appear to pose a significant risk to people, scientists say.\n\nBut they do pose a risk in the longer term if they enable a strain that can infect humans.\n\nThe threat of cows generating such a strain is further increased given the huge number of cattle there are, the fact they don't generally get sick with the virus - meaning it can often go undetected - and the prohibitive cost and logistical difficulties of culling large numbers of cows as a precautionary measure.\n\nWhile they could pave the way for a pandemic further down the line, as things stand, the US dairy cow cases pose little threat to the UK, according to the Government - other than through unpasteurised milk.\n\nAlthough there is no risk to humans from drinking pasteurised milk, consumers in the US have been advised not to eat or drink raw dairy products.\n\n\"There could be a route of entry to Great Britain of virus through unpasteurised dairy products imported from affected farms in the USA, although the vast majority of dairy products from the USA are pasteurised, such as cheese and whey, along with smaller amounts of yogurt, condensed milk and dairy spreads,\" Defra has said.\n\nThere is no trade in live cattle between the US and the UK and no wild birds that migrate to North Western Europe directly from North America that might potential carry the strain, which scientists have found is passing backwards and forwards between cows and birds.\n\nBut there is a chance that cows in the UK may become infected with bird flu independently of what is happening in the US, according to Professor Young.\n\n\"The finding that the H5N1 virus jumped from wild birds to cattle in the US means that something similar could happen in the UK,\" he said.\n\nCattle in the UK are not routinely tested for avian influenza, but if a farmer suspects a respiratory disease the animals are tested for other viruses such as Influenza D, which is commonly found in cows.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_bawden@inews.co.uk", "name": "Tom Bawden", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Is avian influenza threat? We answer your questions.", "body": "The bird flu has arrived in Colorado, and while it doesn't represent anywhere near the threat that COVID-19 did at the beginning of the pandemic, people should take some precautions with animals that could carry it, experts say.\n\nThe Denver Post compiled the latest information on H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza, the bird flu virus that has jumped to cows in at least nine states -- including Colorado -- and has infected a small number of people.\n\nWhile the virus at this point is only a threat to people who work with animals, scientists are concerned that it could mutate enough to spread between people, possibly sparking another pandemic.\n\nIf you want more in-depth information, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Colorado Department of Agriculture will hold a virtual town hall on avian flu at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday at tiny.cc/birdfluwebinar.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza had reached a dairy cow herd in northeast Colorado as of late April. The state also is investigating a second herd, but hasn't released any information while waiting for testing results.\n\nCows typically don't get influenza A viruses, the family that includes H5N1, so it was a shock to find they were infected, said Jenna Guthmiller, an assistant professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus\n\nAt least 36 herds across nine states have tested positive, but without routine testing, the virus could be spreading undetected in others.\n\nOver the last two years, some Colorado poultry operations have had to cull their birds (killing and properly disposing of all members of an infected flock to avoid spreading the virus to other farms), and the state health department has found infected wild birds or mammals in more than half of Colorado's counties. You can reasonably assume that birds in your county also are carrying the virus, even if testing hasn't found it.\n\nRight now, the country doesn't have a clear picture of how widely the virus has spread, particularly among cattle and people who work with them, Guthmiller said. Cows often have mild symptoms and may be able to spread the virus even if they're asymptomatic, she said.\n\n\"The major concern right now is still in dairy farm workers,\" she said.\n\nThe name refers to the high mortality rate among poultry. It doesn't appear to make cows severely ill, however, and we don't know how bad it could be for people.\n\nA separate subgroup of H5 avian influenza, found in Asia in the 1990s, had an official human mortality rate of about 50%. The subgroup that's spreading now has caused 13 confirmed human cases worldwide and one death, though given the lack of testing, other cases may have flown under the radar, Guthmiller said. (Flu viruses are named based on two types of proteins on their surfaces. The current subgroup and the high-mortality one in Asia share one major protein -- H5 -- but have different forms of the second protein.)\n\nSo far, we only know of two human cases in the current U.S. outbreak: a poultry worker in Colorado in 2022 and a dairy worker in Texas this year. Both had mild symptoms and recovered.\n\nSo far, the current avian flu hasn't picked up mutations that would allow it to spread efficiently between humans in the way that the seasonal flu does. As it infects more mammals, however, it gets additional chances to adapt to bodies that are closer to our own. Scientists are watching for infections in pigs, in particular, because they can carry multiple types of flu viruses, which could swap genes and grant each other new abilities.\n\n\"The concern is that if H5N1 spilled over to humans, it could cause a pandemic and stay with us\" as another seasonal flu virus, Guthmiller said.\n\nFarmers are required to dispose of eggs and meat from infected birds. Since the virus is so severe in poultry, the odds of products slipping through because no one realized the birds were sick are extremely low.\n\nScientists found fragments of the bird flu virus in milk from grocery stores, but couldn't grow any live viruses, meaning the process of heating the milk to kill bacteria also killed the virus. Other products made with pasteurized milk also are safe to eat.\n\nRaw milk might not be safe, however, because it hasn't undergone pasteurization to kill viruses and bacteria. (This made drinking it a risky decision even before the avian flu started to infect cows.) Cats in Texas died of neurological symptoms related to bird-flu infection after drinking raw milk, though researchers couldn't rule out that they could have caught the virus by eating wild birds.\n\nColorado doesn't allow sales of raw milk, though people in \"cowshare\" programs can receive it from the cow they partially own.\n\nA sampling of ground beef from animals in states with avian influenza dairy outbreaks didn't find the virus in meat, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, though other studies are ongoing to find out if the virus could get into muscle tissue in cattle.\n\nVeterinarians in Colorado have to report flu-like illnesses in cattle, and can request testing of herds.\n\nThe federal government also requires testing a sample of cows when moving a herd of lactating animals between states. It exempts calves and adult cows not involved in milk production. (The current leading theory is that the virus is spreading between cows during the milking process.)\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked state health departments to work on distributing personal protective equipment to dairy and poultry farms, as well as slaughterhouses. Workers aren't required to wear masks and other protection, however.\n\nStates and the federal government could do a better job working with people whom farmers trust, such as local veterinarians, to increase testing, Guthmiller said. Right now, farmers don't see a reason to invite attention, because H5N1 isn't causing significant harm to their herds, she said.\n\n\"There's the presumption it's controlled,\" she said.\n\nThe Colorado Department of Agriculture advises people who own domestic birds to keep them away from wild birds, and report any unusual illnesses or deaths.\n\nThe agency also said people and pets should avoid contact with sick or dead birds.

Experts are confident the meat supply is safe By DEVI SHASTRI - AP Health Writer\n\nSo far, two people in the U.S. have been confirmed to be infected with H5N1, most recently a Texas dairy worker linked to the cattle outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two dozen people have been tested and about 100 people have been monitored since the virus appeared in cows, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a CDC respiratory diseases official, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nDaskalakis said CDC has seen no unusual flu trends in areas with infected cows, but some experts wonder if anecdotal reports of sick workers mean more than one person caught the virus from the animals.\n\nPetersen said some workers had symptoms consistent with flu: fever and body aches, stuffy nose or congestion. Some had conjunctivitis, the eye inflammation detected in the Texas dairy worker diagnosed with bird flu.\n\nDr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, has been taking samples from livestock and people on two Texas farms. On farms with confirmed cattle infections, there have also been reports of mild illnesses among the workers, he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHis research has been difficult. Many workers are reluctant to be tested. That may be because they have limited access to health care or fear divulging private health information.\n\nWithout confirmation, no one knows if the sick workers were infected with the bird flu virus or something unrelated, Gray said.\n\n\"They seem to be linked in time and space, so one would say it's biologically plausible,\" said Gray.\n\nSome of the workers who fell ill sought treatment and were offered oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu, Petersen said.\n\nSome farm workers who were exposed to infected animals or people were offered the medication, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said. State health officials are responsible for evaluating and providing treatment, according to federal guidelines.\n\nHealth officials in Texas provided Tamiflu to the person known to be infected with H5N1 and family members, plus two people on a second dairy farm who were exposed to infected animals, said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said he wasn't sure if others had been offered the antiviral.\n\nFarmers have been hesitant to allow health officials onto their land, said Dr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who consulted about the outbreak with Petersen.\n\n\"This particular disease is looked at as a scarlet letter,\" Russo said. \"It has this stigma associated with it right now.\"\n\nRusso called for wider testing of cattle, people and milk.\n\n\"We do not know what we do not measure,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the horse left the barn and took off a lot faster than we were able to mobilize.\"\n\nGray worries that a recent federal order requiring testing of all lactating dairy cows moving between states could hinder cooperation even further. All labs that conduct tests must report positive results to the Agriculture Department. But many farmers may simply decide against testing, hoping to outlast the outbreak, he said.\n\nThe reluctance of workers and farmers to allow testing is \"greatly hampering\" understanding of how the virus spreads, how large the outbreak is now and how quickly it may grow, Gray said.\n\n\"It's a negative, very negative, effect,\" he said.\n\nPetersen said she understands workers' and farmers' fears. She praised the farmers who had been willing to let her gather the first samples that confirmed the outbreak and reflected on what the results could mean.\n\n\"You immediately think about the cows, the people that care for them and the families that have these farms,\" she said. \"You're thinking about the big picture, long term.

It's not a dire threat for most of us - yet", "body": "Headlines are flying after the Department of Agriculture confirmed that the H5N1 bird flu virus has infected dairy cows around the country. Tests have detected the virus among cattle in nine states, mainly in Texas and New Mexico, and most recently in Colorado, said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a May 1 event held by the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nA menagerie of other animals have been infected by H5N1, and at least one person in Texas. But what scientists fear most is if the virus were to spread efficiently from person to person. That hasn't happened and might not. Shah said the CDC considers the H5N1 outbreak \"a low risk to the general public at this time.\"\n\nViruses evolve and outbreaks can shift quickly. \"As with any major outbreak, this is moving at the speed of a bullet train,\" Shah said. \"What we'll be talking about is a snapshot of that fast-moving train.\" What he means is that what's known about the H5N1 bird flu today will undoubtedly change.\n\nWith that in mind, KFF Health News explains what you need to know now.\n\nQ: Who gets the bird flu?\n\nMainly birds. Over the past few years, however, the H5N1 bird flu virus has increasingly jumped from birds into mammals around the world. The growing list of more than 50 species includes seals, goats, skunks, cats, and wild bush dogs at a zoo in the United Kingdom. At least 24,000 sea lions died in outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in South America last year.\n\nWhat makes the current outbreak in cattle unusual is that it's spreading rapidly from cow to cow, whereas the other cases - except for the sea lion infections - appear limited. Researchers know this because genetic sequences of the H5N1 viruses drawn from cattle this year were nearly identical to one another.\n\nThe cattle outbreak is also concerning because the country has been caught off guard. Researchers examining the virus's genomes suggest it originally spilled over from birds into cows late last year in Texas, and has since spread among many more cows than have been tested. \"Our analyses show this has been circulating in cows for four months or so, under our noses,\" said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\nQ: Is this the start of the next pandemic?\n\nNot yet. But it's a thought worth considering because a bird flu pandemic would be a nightmare. More than half of people infected by older strains of H5N1 bird flu viruses from 2003 to 2016 died. Even if death rates turn out to be less severe for the H5N1 strain currently circulating in cattle, repercussions could involve loads of sick people and hospitals too overwhelmed to handle other medical emergencies.\n\nAlthough at least one person has been infected with H5N1 this year, the virus can't lead to a pandemic in its current state. To achieve that horrible status, a pathogen needs to sicken many people on multiple continents. And to do that, the H5N1 virus would need to infect a ton of people. That won't happen through occasional spillovers of the virus from farm animals into people. Rather, the virus must acquire mutations for it to spread from person to person, like the seasonal flu, as a respiratory infection transmitted largely through the air as people cough, sneeze, and breathe. As we learned in the depths of COVID-19, airborne viruses are hard to stop.\n\nThat hasn't happened yet. However, H5N1 viruses now have plenty of chances to evolve as they replicate within thousands of cows. Like all viruses, they mutate as they replicate, and mutations that improve the virus's survival are passed to the next generation. And because cows are mammals, the viruses could be getting better at thriving within cells that are closer to ours than birds'.\n\nThe evolution of a pandemic-ready bird flu virus could be aided by a sort of superpower possessed by many viruses. Namely, they sometimes swap their genes with other strains in a process called reassortment. In a study published in 2009, Worobey and other researchers traced the origin of the H1N1 \"swine flu\" pandemic to events in which different viruses causing the swine flu, bird flu, and human flu mixed and matched their genes within pigs that they were simultaneously infecting. Pigs need not be involved this time around, Worobey warned.\n\nQ: Will a pandemic start if a person drinks virus-contaminated milk?\n\nNot yet. Cow's milk, as well as powdered milk and infant formula, sold in stores is considered safe because the law requires all milk sold commercially to be pasteurized. That process of heating milk at high temperatures kills bacteria, viruses, and other teeny organisms. Tests have identified fragments of H5N1 viruses in milk from grocery stores but confirm that the virus bits are dead and, therefore, harmless.\n\nUnpasteurized \"raw\" milk, however, has been shown to contain living H5N1 viruses, which is why the FDA and other health authorities strongly advise people not to drink it. Doing so could cause a person to become seriously ill or worse. But even then, a pandemic is unlikely to be sparked because the virus - in its current form - does not spread efficiently from person to person, as the seasonal flu does.\n\nQ: What should be done?\n\nA lot! Because of a lack of surveillance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies have allowed the H5N1 bird flu to spread under the radar in cattle. To get a handle on the situation, the USDA recently ordered all lactating dairy cattle to be tested before farmers move them to other states, and the outcomes of the tests to be reported.\n\nBut just as restricting covid tests to international travelers in early 2020 allowed the coronavirus to spread undetected, testing only cows that move across state lines would miss plenty of cases.\n\nSuch limited testing won't reveal how the virus is spreading among cattle - information desperately needed so farmers can stop it. A leading hypothesis is that viruses are being transferred from one cow to the next through the machines used to milk them.\n\nTo boost testing, Fred Gingrich, executive director of a nonprofit organization for farm veterinarians, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, said the government should offer funds to cattle farmers who report cases so that they have an incentive to test. Barring that, he said, reporting just adds reputational damage atop financial loss.\n\n\"These outbreaks have a significant economic impact,\" Gingrich said. \"Farmers lose about 20% of their milk production in an outbreak because animals quit eating, produce less milk, and some of that milk is abnormal and then can't be sold.\"\n\nThe government has made the H5N1 tests free for farmers, Gingrich added, but they haven't budgeted money for veterinarians who must sample the cows, transport samples, and file paperwork. \"Tests are the least expensive part,\" he said.\n\nIf testing on farms remains elusive, evolutionary virologists can still learn a lot by analyzing genomic sequences from H5N1 viruses sampled from cattle. The differences between sequences tell a story about where and when the current outbreak began, the path it travels, and whether the viruses are acquiring mutations that pose a threat to people. Yet this vital research has been hampered by the USDA's slow and incomplete posting of genetic data, Worobey said.\n\nThe government should also help poultry farmers prevent H5N1 outbreaks since those kill many birds and pose a constant threat of spillover, said Maurice Pitesky, an avian disease specialist at the University of California-Davis.\n\nWaterfowl like ducks and geese are the usual sources of outbreaks on poultry farms, and researchers can detect their proximity using remote sensing and other technologies. By zeroing in on zones of potential spillover, farmers can target their attention. That can mean routine surveillance to detect early signs of infections in poultry, using water cannons to shoo away migrating flocks, relocating farm animals, or temporarily ushering them into barns. \"We should be spending on prevention,\" Pitesky said.\n\nQ: OK it's not a pandemic, but what could happen to people who get this year's H5N1 bird flu?\n\nNo one really knows. Only one person in Texas has been diagnosed with the disease this year, in April. This person worked closely with dairy cows, and had a mild case with an eye infection. The CDC found out about them because of its surveillance process. Clinics are supposed to alert state health departments when they diagnose farmworkers with the flu, using tests that detect influenza viruses, broadly. State health departments then confirm the test, and if it's positive, they send a person's sample to a CDC laboratory, where it is checked for the H5N1 virus, specifically. \"Thus far we have received 23,\" Shah said. \"All but one of those was negative.\"\n\nState health department officials are also monitoring around 150 people, he said, who have spent time around cattle. They're checking in with these farmworkers via phone calls, text messages, or in-person visits to see if they develop symptoms. And if that happens, they'll be tested.\n\nAnother way to assess farmworkers would be to check their blood for antibodies against the H5N1 bird flu virus; a positive result would indicate they might have been unknowingly infected. But Shah said health officials are not yet doing this work.\n\n\"The fact that we're four months in and haven't done this isn't a good sign,\" Worobey said. \"I'm not super worried about a pandemic at

Then came word that barn cats -- half of them on one farm -- had died suddenly.\n\nWithin days, the Amarillo veterinarian was hearing about sick cows with unusual symptoms: high fevers, reluctance to eat and much less milk. Tests for typical illnesses came back negative.\n\nPetersen, who monitors more than 40,000 cattle on a dozen farms in the Texas Panhandle, collected samples from cats and cows and sent them to Dr. Drew Magstadt, a friend from college who now works at the veterinary diagnostic laboratory at Iowa State University.\n\nThe samples tested positive for a bird flu virus never before seen in cattle. It was the first proof that the bird flu, known as Type A H5N1, could infect cows. As of Wednesday, 36 U.S. herds had confirmed infections, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Experts are confident the meat supply is safe By DEVI SHASTRI - AP Health Writer\n\nSo far, two people in the U.S. have been confirmed to be infected with H5N1, most recently a Texas dairy worker linked to the cattle outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two dozen people have been tested and about 100 people have been monitored since the virus appeared in cows, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a CDC respiratory diseases official, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nDaskalakis said CDC has seen no unusual flu trends in areas with infected cows, but some experts wonder if anecdotal reports of sick workers mean more than one person caught the virus from the animals.\n\nPetersen said some workers had symptoms consistent with flu: fever and body aches, stuffy nose or congestion. Some had conjunctivitis, the eye inflammation detected in the Texas dairy worker diagnosed with bird flu.\n\nDr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, has been taking samples from livestock and people on two Texas farms. On farms with confirmed cattle infections, there have also been reports of mild illnesses among the workers, he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHis research has been difficult. Many workers are reluctant to be tested. That may be because they have limited access to health care or fear divulging private health information.\n\nWithout confirmation, no one knows if the sick workers were infected with the bird flu virus or something unrelated, Gray said.\n\n\"They seem to be linked in time and space, so one would say it's biologically plausible,\" said Gray.\n\nSome of the workers who fell ill sought treatment and were offered oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu, Petersen said.\n\nSome farm workers who were exposed to infected animals or people were offered the medication, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said. State health officials are responsible for evaluating and providing treatment, according to federal guidelines.\n\nHealth officials in Texas provided Tamiflu to the person known to be infected with H5N1 and family members, plus two people on a second dairy farm who were exposed to infected animals, said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said he wasn't sure if others had been offered the antiviral.\n\nFarmers have been hesitant to allow health officials onto their land, said Dr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who consulted about the outbreak with Petersen.\n\n\"This particular disease is looked at as a scarlet letter,\" Russo said. \"It has this stigma associated with it right now.\"\n\nRusso called for wider testing of cattle, people and milk.\n\n\"We do not know what we do not measure,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the horse left the barn and took off a lot faster than we were able to mobilize.\"\n\nGray worries that a recent federal order requiring testing of all lactating dairy cows moving between states could hinder cooperation even further. All labs that conduct tests must report positive results to the Agriculture Department. But many farmers may simply decide against testing, hoping to outlast the outbreak, he said.\n\nThe reluctance of workers and farmers to allow testing is \"greatly hampering\" understanding of how the virus spreads, how large the outbreak is now and how quickly it may grow, Gray said.\n\n\"It's a negative, very negative, effect,\" he said.\n\nPetersen said she understands workers' and farmers' fears. She praised the farmers who had been willing to let her gather the first samples that confirmed the outbreak and reflected on what the results could mean.\n\n\"You immediately think about the cows, the people that care for them and the families that have these farms,\" she said. \"You're thinking about the big picture, long term. Your mind starts to go down that entire path of concern.\"\n\nGetting dairy from farm to table is a complex process -- and farmers are adapting to get it there A different way to farm: Using

Before the one in Texas, the first and previous case of H5N1 in the United States happened in Colorado in 2022. Both people had mild symptoms and recovered. But of the 26 human cases of H5N1 reported around the world since January 2022, seven resulted in death.\n\nBreaking News\n\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBird flu is part of a family of influenza viruses, which come in four types (A, B, C, and D) that typically cause respiratory infections. Bird flu is a type A influenza virus -- one of the most common types responsible for seasonal epidemics during the colder months -- and comes in two forms: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) causing mild or no illness at all, as seen in chickens; and a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which is highly contagious and deadly to poultry. The variant at the heart of the current outbreak -- H5N1 -- particularly affects wild birds, is highly pathogenic, and responsible for previous outbreaks among domestic birds.\n\nThe letters H and N refer to proteins on the surface of the virus -- called hemagglutinin and neuraminidase -- that mutate constantly, resulting in new strains and periodic outbreaks and epidemics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the United States, avian influenzas have been known to infect and kill domestic poultry. A poultry facility in Farwell was required to \"depopulate\" 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets in April after reporting a positive test for bird flu.\n\nH5N1 was first detected in domestic waterfowl in southern China in 1996 and spread to migratory wild birds around 2005. It's mostly remained among wild birds, but in recent years there have been reports of cases and outbreaks among other species. These include sea lions, grizzly bears, and more recently, dairy cows. The spread has raised concerns among scientists and public health institutions about the virus adapting to infect other mammals, including humans.\n\nCan humans can get infected?\n\nThe confirmed human case of bird flu in Texas may cause concern, but Shetty and Trivedi said the risk of bird flu spreading among people is very low. Research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the virus does not appear to be mutating in a way that would make it more likely to infect humans or resist antiviral medications, Shetty said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause bird flu spreads through the air or through contact with contaminated surfaces, Shetty recommends Texans who work or interact with farm animals wear protective equipment. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a press conference last week that the agency would provide farm workers guidance on precautions and proper protective equipment, including a graphic in both English and Spanish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome scientists have voiced concern that human cases of bird flu may be going unreported. Shetty said the Texas Department of State Health Services and the CDC are monitoring for any unusual influenza activity; so far, there hasn't been an increase in cases or in the number of people coming into clinics or emergency rooms with flu-like symptoms in Texas, he said. Nationally, more than 100 farm workers who were exposed to infected animals were monitored for 10 days for any sign of infection and then tested again, Daskalakis said.\n\nTrivedi of UT Southwestern said there will be certain populations, such as farm or livestock workers, who will be at a higher risk of exposure and potentially getting infected with bird flu. \"I don't think this is something that, let's say the general population in the city of Dallas, needs to go and get themselves tested for,\" Trivedi said. However, she recommends that if someone is experiencing flu-like symptoms or eye redness (also known as conjunctivitis), they should consult a health care provider.\n\nThere is no specific diagnostic test for the bird flu. If a nasal or throat swab comes back positive for influenza A, hospitals or health departments often do further genetic testing, if indicated, to determine the exact variant, whether H5N1 or another, said Trivedi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe seasonal flu vaccine won't prevent infection, but it can reduce your chances of getting both the bird and seasonal flu at the same time, according to the CDC.\n\nHow did cattle get infected?\n\nDuring last week's press conference, health officials said a spillover event -- when a virus hops from one species to another -- occurred in a number of Texas cattle herds. This highly infectious variant of H5N1 spread as those infected cows were transported to other states; one dairy operation in Ohio received cows from an infected Texas herd, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\nThirty-six herds with confirmed infections are spread out across nine states, including Texas, the USDA reported. Farmers with affected herds are reporting that 10% of their cattle are showing bird-flu symptoms, but the infected cows are recovering within about two weeks with \"little or no associated mortality,\" said Rosemary Sifford, the USDA's chief veterinary officer, during the press conference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo prevent the virus from spreading across the nation, the Department of Agriculture issued mandatory guidelines last week for farmers transporting dairy cows across state lines. Lactating cows must test negative for influenza A viruses before transport, and any animals that test positive must be reported. But these new federal guidelines only require testing 30 animals in a group, and there is no clear guidance on which animals a farmer should include or select, several publications reported.\n\nAre dairy and meat products safe for human consumption?\n\nViral fragments of bird flu have been detected in cow's milk from infected animals and commercial sources. Because of pasteurization, which kills H5N1, preliminary tests suggest dairy milk is safe to drink. But raw milk, which is available for sale in Texas by licensed dairy retailers, may be unsafe.\n\n\"We do not recommend people consume raw milk products,\" Shetty said. \"If you're consuming products that have a potentially high load of virus in it, it's possible that it could make you sick.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services requires licensed raw-for-retail dairies to have their milk tested, at least on a quarterly basis, according to the agency's website. In an email to The Dallas Morning News, spokesperson Lara Anton said the agency's requirements for raw milk sellers remain the same.\n\nGround beef has tested negative for bird flu based on 30 samples collected from retail outlets in the states with infected dairy cows, USDA officials said Wednesday. As long as meat is handled and cooked properly, it's considered safe to eat.\n\nMiriam Fauzia is a science reporting fellow at The Dallas Morning News.

In a report quietly published late last week, the agency said avian flu viruses 'have pandemic potential' in a section about rolling out vaccines if there is a human spillover.\n\nAlso last week, a separate study by the US Department of Agriculture released genetic data showing the H5N1 strain tearing through dairy farms had acquired dozens of new mutations. These changes could make the strain more likely to spread from cows to other animals, including people, and make the virus resistant to antivirals.\n\nDespite this, the CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) insist the risk to the US public is low. The WHO said today: 'At the present time, based on available information, WHO assesses the overall public health risk posed by H5N1 to be low. '[But] for those with exposure to infected birds or animals or contaminated environments, the risk of infection is considered low-to-moderate.\n\n'This risk requires close monitoring and WHO and partners will continue to regularly assess and publish public health risk assessments for avian influenza.' The agency held a webinar today, which was attended by its own infectious disease experts as well as officials from the CDC. The meeting came after USDA researchers warned about H5N1's new mutations.\n\nThey wrote: 'Some [mutations] in virus population were detected at low frequency that may lead to changes in transmission [in other species]... after evolution in dairy cattle. 'Continued transmission of H5N1 within dairy cattle increases the risk for infection and subsequent spread of the virus to human populations.'\n\nIn the paper, published as a pre-print on BioRxiv that has not been reviewed by other scientists, researchers analyzed nasal and milk samples from dozens of infected cows with infections confirmed from March to April this year. At least 491 mutations were detected in the sample, of which 309 were associated with 'functional changes' in the virus.\n\nThis included mutations that may make the virus more pathogenic, or more likely to cause an infection, better adapted to mammals and better able to infect new species. Testing also suggested that the outbreak in cattle actually began in late 2023, about four months before it was first reported. Researchers suggested the virus had first jumped from birds to cows in the Texas Panhandle, and then spread between herds in the state as well as to herds in Kansas, Michigan and New Mexico among others.\n\nOutbreaks in several herds could not be linked back to others, suggesting some infected herds have not yet had the virus detected. There were also cases reported where the virus had spilled back from cows into wild birds, poultry, domestic cats and a raccoon.\n\nAt least 36 herds across nine states have been infected with bird flu, data shows, although experts are warning it is likely more widespread. There are also fears over the virus spilling to farm workers, with veterinarians saying they are hearing of many people who are sick on farms but are unwilling to be tested.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

How long it's taking cows to show symptoms once they become infected, how exactly the virus is spreading among herds, how long it's taking cows to rid the virus from their bodies, or what the risk is to exposed calves or other livestock species.\n\nBut despite these unknowns, Baldwin said guidance for stakeholders involved in county fairs and shows - events that are a couple of months away - have not yet been drafted.\n\n\"We don't have guidance yet,\" Baldwin said during a Q&A portion of the town hall, adding that \"the USDA is looking to issue some guidance for shows and fairs and we will for their lead.\"\n\nIt's not clear how much a federal order put in place on April 24 and adopted by the state not long after will be able to mitigate spread among dairy herds, as the virus appears to be spreading among cows who don't show symptoms and testing remains voluntary and encouraged only for visibly sick animals, according to STAT News.\n\nSigns of HPAI in dairy cows include decreased feed intake, a significant drop in milk production, and abnormal milk which appears thicker in consistency and discolored, Baldwin said. Other signs producers should watch out for in their herds is slight fever and tacky stools, she added.\n\nThough HPAI leads to severe disease and death in bird populations (hence the name \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\"), H5N1 isn't proving to be severe or deadly in dairy cattle, Baldwin said.\n\n\"We are not seeing significant illness or mortality like in birds. Cattle appears to recover after supportive care,\" she said.\n\nHow can I protect myself from catching bird flu?\n\nFederal and state officials maintain that the risk to the general public for getting infected with bird flu is low, though risk depends on exposure, according to Dr. Rachel Herlihy, the state epidemiologist at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE).\n\n\"People who are exposed to sick birds and cattle are more likely to get infected,\" she said during Wednesday's town hall.\n\nOnly two cases of H5N1 among humans have been confirmed since the outbreak started in the U.S two years ago: A Colorado poultry worker in April 2022 and a Texas dairy worker who was exposed to sick cattle in early March. Both cases resulted in the workers experiencing mild illness and recovered after a few days.\n\nNo human-to-human transmission of bird flu has been detected so far, and Herlihy said additional genetic changes in the virus would need to occur for that to happen.\n\nShe warned, however, that \"as the virus continues to spread among different species and spreads more widely, the virus has more opportunities to evolve and encounter humans more often.\"\n\nState News\n\nBird flu confirmed in Colorado dairy cows, joining 8 other states with outbreaks \u00d3scar Contreras 7:30 PM, Apr 26, 2024\n\nHerlihy said the state is working on educating workers who are frequently exposed to sick poultry or cattle about the measures they should take to protect themselves and reduce their risk of catching bird flu, such as wearing proper personal protective equipment (PPE), like N95 masks, googles and gloves; monitoring for symptoms; getting tested for influenza viruses and mentioning recent exposure with sick birds or cattle, and getting antiviral treatment, if needed.\n\nDuring the town hall, Herlihy revealed that the state was monitoring 70 dairy farm workers who may have been exposed to H5N1, though no detailed information about those cases was shared during Wednesday.\n\n\"To date, none of them have reported symptoms of avian flu, so they have not met criteria to be tested for avian flu per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\" a CDPHE spokesperson said in an email late Wednesday afternoon.\n\nTesting would be available for anyone exposed to bird flu, and antivirals would be provided to those experiencing symptoms while awaiting test results, the CDPHE spokesperson added.\n\nThe general public should avoid contact with sick birds or other animals to reduce their chances of becoming infected with bird flu, Herlihy said. If you must handle sick or dead birds or animals, be sure to wear gloves, a high-quality mask such as a KN95 or N95 respirator, and eye protection. After handling the animal, double bag and it throw it away in your municipal trash can before thoroughly washing your hands.\n\nHow safe is the commercial food supply?\n\nWhile early research lead by the FDA detected remnants of bird flu in retail milk, follow-up studies in which scientists tried to grow live virus from those grocery store samples did not yield any positive results, which suggests that pasteurization is killing H5N1 in milk.\n\nOther milk-related products that undergo pasteurization, such as cheeses, sour creams, yogurts, butters, etc., are also safe to eat, health officials said.\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials have said the likelihood that eggs will contain H5N1 is low \"due to the safeguards in place, which include testing of flocks and federal inspection programs,\" that call for the disposal of eggs and meat from infected poultry. Proper storage and preparation \"further reduce the risk,\" they said.\n\nPeople should avoid raw milk and dairy products made from raw milk at the moment, scientists recently told STAT News, as raw milk does not go through the process of pasteurization, which kills harmful viruses and bacteria. In Texas, a large number of cats who were fed raw milk developed neurological symptoms and later died, though scientists said they could not completely rule out if eating dead birds caused the deadly infection.\n\nRaw milk can't be sold in Colorado and a bill aimed at legalizing it for sale across the state died in the legislature this year, though Coloradans could still get it if they enter what's called a herd-share agreement.\n\nWhile the state veterinarian said Wednesday that testing for bird flu isn't being done on other livestock species at the moment, like swine or beef cattle, USDA officials recently said ground beef appears to be safe for consumption, after testing done on ground beef samples in states where bird flu outbreaks are occurring came back negative. Baldwin said the FDA is looking at expanding testing to other cattle species, though a timeline of when that would happen was not shared during the town hall.\n\nDespite negative results for bird flu on beef samples, USDA officials said they will conduct more testing to determine whether the virus can live in beef muscle tissue in order to \"reaffirm consumer confidence.\"\n\nAs the spread of H5N1 among dairy cows continues to evolve, Baldwin said they're working to get answers as quickly as possible, \"because the goal is to stop additional spread of this virus.\"\n\nNo plans yet to modify Colorado livestock fairs, shows despite presence of bird flu in dairy cows\n\nThe Follow Up What do you want Denver7 to follow up on?

(Tami Chappell/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday advised state health officials to make personal protective equipment (PPE) available for farm workers in efforts to stem the spread of bird flu.\n\n\"CDC asked that jurisdictions make PPE available to workers on dairy farms, poultry farms, and in slaughterhouses,\" it stated following CDC Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah's meeting with health officials.\n\n\"Specifically, CDC asked state health departments to work with their state agriculture department counterparts and partners in communities, such as farmworker organizations, that can help coordinate and facilitate PPE distributions,\" the agency added.\n\nAccording to the CDC's readout, Mr. Shah has recommended that states prioritize the distribution of PPE from their stockpile to workers on farms where dairy herds have been confirmed to be infected with bird flu.\n\nMr. Shah said that while CDC's assessment indicates a low immediate risk of avian influenza to the public, safeguarding livestock workers remains important as they may be at higher risk of infection.\n\n\"CDC offers real-time support for state and local public health officials, as well as staff who are ready to deploy within 24 hours, if requested,\" the agency stated.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported last month that a bird flu outbreak in U.S. dairy cows affected over two dozen herds in eight states, but it said that the risk to the public was low.\n\n\"At this time, there continues to be no concern that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health, or that it affects the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,\" the FDA stated.\n\nThe strain of bird flu has been found in at least 26 dairy herds in eight U.S. states: Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and South Dakota.\n\nThe virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in a range of mammals over the last few years, but this is the first time it has been found in cattle, according to federal health and animal agencies.\n\nAccording to the CDC, most human infections with the H5N1 virus result from \"unprotected exposures to sick or dead infected poultry.\"\n\n\"There is no evidence of sustained human-to-human H5N1 virus transmission, and limited, non-sustained human-to-human H5N1 virus transmission has not been reported worldwide since 2007,\" it stated.\n\nThe CDC stated that people with \"close or prolonged unprotected contact with infected birds or animals or their contaminated environments are at greater risk of infection.\"\n\n\"Human infections with avian influenza A viruses can happen when enough virus gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth or is inhaled,\" the agency stated.\n\nLast month, the Texas Department of State Health Services detected avian influenza in a person who became ill after coming into contact with cows that are likely sick with the bird flu.\n\nOn May 1, Michigan issued an emergency order prohibiting the exhibition of all lactating dairy cattle until there are no new cases of the influenza among cattle in the state for at least 60 days.\n\n\"No dairy cattle of any age from an infected premises may be exhibited until further notice,\" the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development stated in its order.\n\nThe order also bars the exhibition of poultry until at least 30 days pass without new cases of bird flu in domestic poultry.\n\nIt also imposes other requirements on Michigan dairy and poultry farms, including mandating the designation of a person to act as biosecurity manager, the establishment of cleaning and disinfection practices, and the keeping of records of all vehicles and people who enter farms.", "source":

Is avian influenza threat? We answer your questions.", "body": "DENVER - The bird flu has arrived in Colorado, and while it doesn't represent anywhere near the threat that COVID-19 did at the beginning of the pandemic, people should take some precautions with animals that could carry it, experts say.\n\nThe Denver Post compiled the latest information on H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza, the bird flu virus that has jumped to cows in at least nine states - including Colorado - and has infected a small number of people.\n\nWhile the virus at this point is only a threat to people who work with animals, scientists are concerned that it could mutate enough to spread between people, possibly sparking another pandemic.\n\nIf you want more in-depth information, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Colorado Department of Agriculture will hold a virtual town hall on avian flu at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday at tiny.cc/birdfluwebinar.\n\nHow widespread is the virus in Colorado?\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza had reached a dairy cow herd in northeast Colorado as of late April. The state also is investigating a second herd, but hasn't released any information while waiting for testing results.\n\nCows typically don't get influenza A viruses, the family that includes H5N1, so it was a shock to find they were infected, said Jenna Guthmiller, an assistant professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus\n\nAt least 36 herds across nine states have tested positive, but without routine testing, the virus could be spreading undetected in others.\n\nOver the last two years, some Colorado poultry operations have had to cull their birds (killing and properly disposing of all members of an infected flock to avoid spreading the virus to other farms), and the state health department has found infected wild birds or mammals in more than half of Colorado's counties. You can reasonably assume that birds in your county also are carrying the virus, even if testing hasn't found it.\n\nRight now, the country doesn't have a clear picture of how widely the virus has spread, particularly among cattle and people who work with them, Guthmiller said. Cows often have mild symptoms and may be able to spread the virus even if they're asymptomatic, she said.\n\n\"The major concern right now is still in dairy farm workers,\" she said.\n\n\"Highly pathogenic\" sounds worrisome. How concerning is this virus?\n\nThe name refers to the high mortality rate among poultry. It doesn't appear to make cows severely ill, however, and we don't know how bad it could be for people.\n\nA separate subgroup of H5 avian influenza, found in Asia in the 1990s, had an official human mortality rate of about 50%. The subgroup that's spreading now has caused 13 confirmed human cases worldwide and one death, though given the lack of testing, other cases may have flown under the radar, Guthmiller said. (Flu viruses are named based on two types of proteins on their surfaces. The current subgroup and the high-mortality one in Asia share one major protein - H5 - but have different forms of the second protein.)\n\nSo far, we only know of two human cases in the current U.S. outbreak: a poultry worker in Colorado in 2022 and a dairy worker in Texas this year. Both had mild symptoms and recovered.\n\nSo far, the current avian flu hasn't picked up mutations that would allow it to spread efficiently between humans in the way that the seasonal flu does. As it infects more mammals, however, it gets additional chances to adapt to bodies that are closer to our own. Scientists are watching for infections in pigs, in particular, because they can carry multiple types of flu viruses, which could swap genes and grant each other new abilities.\n\n\"The concern is that if H5N1 spilled over to humans, it could cause a pandemic and stay with us\" as another seasonal flu virus, Guthmiller said.\n\nIs the food supply safe?\n\nFarmers are required to dispose of eggs and meat from infected birds. Since the virus is so severe in poultry, the odds of products slipping through because no one realized the birds were sick are extremely low.\n\nScientists found fragments of the bird flu virus in milk from grocery stores, but couldn't grow any live viruses, meaning the process of heating the milk to kill bacteria also killed the virus. Other products made with pasteurized milk also are safe to eat.\n\nRaw milk might not be safe, however, because it hasn't undergone pasteurization to kill viruses and bacteria. (This made drinking it a risky decision even before the avian flu started to infect cows.) Cats in Texas died of neurological symptoms related to bird-flu infection after drinking raw milk, though researchers couldn't rule out that they could have caught the virus by eating wild birds.\n\nColorado doesn't allow sales of raw milk, though people in \"cowshare\" programs can receive it from the cow they partially own.\n\nA sampling of ground beef from animals in states with avian influenza dairy outbreaks didn't find the virus in meat, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, though other studies are ongoing to find out if the virus could get into muscle tissue in cattle.\n\nWhat are the state and federal governments doing?\n\nVeterinarians in Colorado have to report flu-like illnesses in cattle, and can request testing of herds.\n\nThe federal government also requires testing a sample of cows when moving a herd of lactating animals between states. It exempts calves and adult cows not involved in milk production. (The current leading theory is that the virus is spreading between cows during the milking process.)\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked state health departments to work on distributing personal protective equipment to dairy and poultry farms, as well as slaughterhouses. Workers aren't required to wear masks and other protection, however.\n\nStates and the federal government could do a better job working with people whom farmers trust, such as local veterinarians, to increase testing, Guthmiller said. Right now, farmers don't see a reason to invite attention, because H5N1 isn't causing significant harm to their herds, she said.\n\nThe Colorado Department of Agriculture advises people who own domestic birds to keep them away from wild birds, and report any unusual illnesses or deaths.\n\nThe agency also said people and pets should avoid contact with sick or dead birds. If you have to remove a dead bird from your property, wear gloves and a mask, and place the bird in two bags. Then immediately throw out the bird, mask and gloves, and thoroughly wash your hands.\n\nPeople who spend time around cattle or raw milk should monitor themselves for flu-like symptoms or eye inflammation, Guthmiller said.

It's not a dire threat for most of us -- yet", "body": "Headlines are flying after the Department of Agriculture confirmed that the H5N1 bird flu virus has infected dairy cows around the country. Tests have detected the virus among cattle in nine states, mainly in Texas and New Mexico, and most recently in Colorado, said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a May 1 event held by the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nA menagerie of other animals have been infected by H5N1, and at least one person in Texas. But what scientists fear most is if the virus were to spread efficiently from person to person. That hasn't happened and might not. Shah said the CDC considers the H5N1 outbreak \"a low risk to the general public at this time.\"\n\nViruses evolve and outbreaks can shift quickly. \"As with any major outbreak, this is moving at the speed of a bullet train,\" Shah said. \"What we'll be talking about is a snapshot of that fast-moving train.\" What he means is that what's known about the H5N1 bird flu today will undoubtedly change.\n\nWith that in mind, KFF Health News explains what you need to know now.\n\nQ: Who gets the bird flu?\n\nMainly birds. Over the past few years, however, the H5N1 bird flu virus has increasingly jumped from birds into mammals around the world. The growing list of more than 50 species includes seals, goats, skunks, cats, and wild bush dogs at a zoo in the United Kingdom. At least 24,000 sea lions died in outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in South America last year.\n\nWhat makes the current outbreak in cattle unusual is that it's spreading rapidly from cow to cow, whereas the other cases -- except for the sea lion infections -- appear limited. Researchers know this because genetic sequences of the H5N1 viruses drawn from cattle this year were nearly identical to one another.\n\nThe cattle outbreak is also concerning because the country has been caught off guard. Researchers examining the virus's genomes suggest it originally spilled over from birds into cows late last year in Texas, and has since spread among many more cows than have been tested. \"Our analyses show this has been circulating in cows for four months or so, under our noses,\" said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\nQ: Is this the start of the next pandemic?\n\nNot yet. But it's a thought worth considering because a bird flu pandemic would be a nightmare. More than half of people infected by older strains of H5N1 bird flu viruses from 2003 to 2016 died. Even if death rates turn out to be less severe for the H5N1 strain currently circulating in cattle, repercussions could involve loads of sick people and hospitals too overwhelmed to handle other medical emergencies.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menagerie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Menagerie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council on Foreign Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bush dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sea lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinniped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid sequence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arizona", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Arizona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evolutionary biology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28842/2884299.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541303", "eventUri": "eng-9541303", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 361, "textEnd": 366}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Michael Snyder 2024-05-08 Michael Snyder / May 8, 2024 0 Shares Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp\n\nEditor's Note: This push with all the CONvid, flus, and the rest of the 'virus' narrative to mass vaccinate, commit genocide, and cull entire herds or flocks of animals is only presented as a health issue. However, if you are paying attention, it's also an attack on our food supply, as well as we can probably point right back to outlets like the CDC and others that have messed around with what God created to patent it and make billions of the people while making them sick in the process. Just keep that in mind when you read the following article.\n\nHave you noticed that the mainstream media is suddenly full of very alarming stories about H5N1? When hundreds of millions of birds were dying because of the bird flu, the mainstream media didn't seem to care very much, and so most people in the general population didn't seem to care very much. Then the bird flu started infecting lots of mammals all over the globe, and the mainstream media still didn't seem to care very much. But now here we are in the middle of 2024, and the mainstream media has suddenly decided to ramp up the fear level. Even though there has only been one confirmed human case in the U.S. so far this year, the mainstream media is pumping out article after article about the threat that H5N1 could potentially pose to humanity. Do they know something that the rest of us do not?\n\nIt is quite true that if a version of H5N1 comes along that can spread easily from human to human, the death toll could be catastrophic.\n\nActivate Your Own Stem Cells & Reverse The Aging Process - Choose \"Select & Save\" OR Join, Brand Partner & Select Silver To Get Wholesale Prices Get your Vitamin B17 & Get 10% Off With Promo Code TIM How To Protect Yourself From 5G, EMF & RF Radiation Protect Your Income & Retirement Assets With Gold & Silver Grab This Bucket Of Heirloom Seeds & Get Free Shipping With Promo Code TIM Here's A Way You Can Stockpile Food For The Future Stockpile Your Ammo & Save $15 On Your First Order Preparing Also Means Detoxifying - Here's One Simple Way To Detoxify\n\nAre we on the verge of seeing that happen?\n\nThe New York Times is reporting that H5N1 \"has acquired dozens of new mutations\", and apparently some of them \"may make it more adept at spreading between species\"...\n\nThe bird flu virus sweeping across dairy farms in multiple states has acquired dozens of new mutations, including some that may make it more adept at spreading between species and less susceptible to antiviral drugs, according to a new study.\n\nI don't like the sound of that at all.\n\nResearchers are telling us that the bird flu \"acquired mutations in late 2023 that allowed it to jump from wild birds to cattle in the Texas Panhandle\"...\n\nIn the new study, the researchers collected samples containing virus from 26 dairy farms in eight states. Cows are not typically susceptible to this type of influenza, but H5N1 appears to have acquired mutations in late 2023 that allowed it to jump from wild birds to cattle in the Texas Panhandle, the researchers said.\n\nThe virus then appears to have spread on dairy farms from Texas to Kansas, Michigan and New Mexico. In at least a dozen instances since then, H5N1 has also spilled from cows back into wild birds, and into poultry, domestic cats and a raccoon.\n\nThis is a very chilling development.\n\nIn the past, the bird flu would appear for a while and then go away.\n\nBut for the past couple of years it has been wiping out millions upon millions of birds all over the planet with no end in sight.\n\nFrom this point forward, will H5N1 also be a permanent threat to our cattle population?\n\nNeedless to say, that could represent a very serious threat to our food supply.\n\nEven more alarming is the fact that the strain of H5N1 that a dairy worker in Texas caught reportedly had \"a mutation that allowed it to infect people more efficiently\"...\n\nThe only person to have been diagnosed with bird flu during the current outbreak carried a virus with a mutation that allowed it to infect people more efficiently. One cow in the study also carried H5N1 with that mutation. More than 200 others were infected with versions of the virus bearing a different mutation that offers the same advantage.\n\nWhy are we only learning about this now?\n\nAnd what is going to happen if this mutation which enables H5N1 to \"infect people more efficiently\" starts spreading among wild animals all over the nation?\n\nThe New York Times is making it sound like we really could be on the brink of a major outbreak among humans.\n\nThankfully, the dairy worker in Texas that caught this version of the bird flu did not die, but he did experience \"bleeding in his eyeballs\"...\n\nThe first image of a Texas farm worker infected with bird flu from a cow shows he suffered bleeding in his eyeballs.\n\nIt is thought to be the first known case of mammal-to-human transmission and comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned bird flu (H5N1) viruses \"pose pandemic potential.\"\n\nThe dairy worker attended a hospital in March after experiencing painful red, weeping eyes with burst blood vessels.\n\nEven more disturbing, some of the cats that consumed raw milk from infected dairy cows in Texas experienced \"brain hemorrhaging\" and \"blindness\".\n\nIs this new version of H5N1 also able to cause \"brain hemorrhaging\" and \"blindness\" in humans?\n\nHopefully authorities will have some answers for us soon.\n\nWhat we do know is that viral fragments are getting into our milk supply.\n\nIn fact, the FDA discovered that viral fragments were in approximately one out of every five samples of grocery store milk that they tested...\n\nTests by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of retail milk samples might give some indication of how widespread the virus is. The agency found viral fragments in one in five samples of commercial milk, although this virus had been deactivated by pasteurization so was not infectious.\n\nThe good news is that it appears that the pasteurization process appears to kill the bird flu.\n\nBut authorities are warning that raw milk could contain the virus...\n\nAt the moment, scientists are focusing on raw milk as a risk factor for transmission to humans. While H5N1 infections in poultry usually result in respiratory illnesses, in cattle the virus seems to mainly target mammary glands, which might explain the high amount of virus found in raw milk from infected cows.\n\nUntil we know more, I think that it would be very wise to avoid drinking any raw milk for the foreseeable future.\n\nYou do not want to get this disease.\n\nAccording to the WHO, since 2003 there have been 888 confirmed human cases.\n\nOf those, 463 have died.\n\nBut as long as humans are only catching this virus from other mammals, we probably will not see a major global outbreak.\n\nHowever, if a strain comes along that can spread easily from human to human, we are going to have a massive problem on our hands and the level of fear that we will witness will be off the charts.\n\nI do not know how this particular story will end, but I am entirely convinced that we have entered an era when great pestilences will be very common.\n\nSo let us hope for the best, but let us also get prepared for the worst.\n\nThe past several years have demonstrated what fear of a disease can do, and H5N1 has the potential to absolutely dwarf anything that we have experienced up to this point.\n\nArticle posted with permission from Michael Snyder\n\nMichael Snyder Michael T.

Then we received word that half of the barn cats on a farm had suddenly died.\n\nWithin days, veterinarians in Amarillo heard about sick cows exhibiting unusual symptoms, including high fevers, loss of appetite, and decreased milk production. Tests for typical illnesses were negative.\n\nPetersen, who monitors more than 40,000 cows on more than a dozen farms in the Texas Panhandle, collects samples from cats and cows and works with a college friend and current veterinary diagnostic laboratory at Iowa State University. I sent it to Dr. Drew Magstadt, who works at .\n\nThe samples tested positive for the avian influenza virus, which has never been detected in cattle. This is the first demonstration that avian influenza, known as H5N1 type A, can infect cattle. As of Wednesday, infections were confirmed in 36 herds in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\n\"It was just amazing,\" Petersen recalled. \"It was a little bit of disbelief.\"\n\nAt the same time, Petersen said, nearly every farm with sick animals also saw sick people.\n\n\"We were actively checking on humans,\" Petersen said. \"There were people who took time off from work, even if they had never taken time off from work.\"\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, two people have been confirmed to be infected with H5N1 in the United States, most recently in a Texas dairy farm worker involved in an outbreak of cattle. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of respiratory diseases at the CDC, told reporters Wednesday that about 24 people have been tested and about 100 people are being monitored since the virus appeared in cattle.\n\nDaskalakis said the CDC has not seen any unusual trends in influenza in areas with infected cattle, but some experts believe that anecdotal reports of sick workers indicate multiple people contracted the virus from the animals. He said he had doubts about what he meant by that.\n\nPetersen said some workers had symptoms consistent with the flu, including fever, body aches and stuffy or stuffy noses. Some had conjunctivitis, an eye inflammation detected in a Texas dairy worker who was diagnosed with bird flu.\n\nDr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, is collecting samples from livestock and people at two farms in Texas. There have also been reports of workers at farms where cattle were confirmed to have been infected with the virus showing mild symptoms.\n\nHis research was extremely difficult. Many workers are reluctant to get tested. This may be due to limited access to medical care or fear of revealing personal medical information.\n\nWithout confirmation, no one knows whether the sick worker was infected with the bird flu virus or something unrelated, Gray said.\n\n\"They seem to be connected in time and space, so it's biologically plausible,\" Gray said.\n\nPetersen said some sick workers sought treatment and were offered the antiviral drug oseltamivir, sold under the brand name Tamiflu.\n\nSome farm workers who had contact with infected animals or people have been provided with medication, CDC spokesman Jason MacDonald said. According to federal guidelines, state health officials will be responsible for providing evaluation and treatment.\n\nIn addition to the H5N1 case and its household members, Texas health officials have identified two people at Dairy 2 who tested negative but had contact with infected animals, Texas Department of State spokesman Chris Van Dusen said. He said that he provided Tamiflu to health services. He said he did not know if anyone else was provided with antiviral drugs.\n\nDr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who consulted with Dr. Petersen about the outbreak, said farmers are hesitant to let health officials access their land.\n\n\"This particular disease is seen as a scarlet letter,\" Russo said. \"It now has this stigma associated with it.\"\n\nRusso called for widespread testing of cows, people and milk.\n\n\"You don't know what you don't measure,\" she says. \"Unfortunately, the horse left the barn much faster than we could mobilize.\"\n\nGray worries that a recent federal order mandating testing of all lactating dairy cows traveling between states could further impede cooperation. All laboratories conducting tests must report positive results to the Department of Agriculture. However, he said many farmers may simply decide not to test in hopes of prolonging the spread of the disease.\n\nMr Gray said workers' and farmers' reluctance to allow testing was \"significantly hindering\" our understanding of how the virus spreads, the current scale of the outbreak and how fast it is spreading. .\n\n\"It's a negative, very negative impact,\" he said.\n\nPetersen said he understands the fears of workers and farmers. She praised the farmers who were willing to allow the first samples to be collected to confirm the outbreak and reflected on what the results meant.\n\n\"I immediately think of the cows, the people who take care of them, and the families who run the farms,\" she says. \"You're thinking about the long-term big picture. Your mind starts going to that whole set of concerns.\"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Panhandle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Panhandle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oseltamivir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anorexia (symptom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarillo,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amarillo, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amarillo, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_Medical_Branch", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas Medical Branch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/AFE8010C-B7FD-44A0-9592-A59BA1CE4BA7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541303", "eventUri": "eng-9541303", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Then came word that barn cats -- half of them on one farm -- had died suddenly.\n\nWithin days, the Amarillo veterinarian was hearing about sick cows with unusual symptoms: high fevers, reluctance to eat and much less milk. Tests for typical illnesses came back negative.\n\nPetersen, who monitors more than 40,000 cattle on a dozen farms in the Texas Panhandle, collected samples from cats and cows and sent them to Dr. Drew Magstadt, a friend from college who now works at the veterinary diagnostic laboratory at Iowa State University.\n\nThe samples tested positive for a bird flu virus never before seen in cattle. It was the first proof that the bird flu, known as Type A H5N1, could infect cows. As of Wednesday, 36 U.S. herds had confirmed infections, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Experts are confident the meat supply is safe By DEVI SHASTRI - AP Health Writer\n\nSo far, two people in the U.S. have been confirmed to be infected with H5N1, most recently a Texas dairy worker linked to the cattle outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two dozen people have been tested and about 100 people have been monitored since the virus appeared in cows, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a CDC respiratory diseases official, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nDaskalakis said CDC has seen no unusual flu trends in areas with infected cows, but some experts wonder if anecdotal reports of sick workers mean more than one person caught the virus from the animals.\n\nPetersen said some workers had symptoms consistent with flu: fever and body aches, stuffy nose or congestion. Some had conjunctivitis, the eye inflammation detected in the Texas dairy worker diagnosed with bird flu.\n\nDr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, has been taking samples from livestock and people on two Texas farms. On farms with confirmed cattle infections, there have also been reports of mild illnesses among the workers, he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHis research has been difficult. Many workers are reluctant to be tested. That may be because they have limited access to health care or fear divulging private health information.\n\nWithout confirmation, no one knows if the sick workers were infected with the bird flu virus or something unrelated, Gray said.\n\n\"They seem to be linked in time and space, so one would say it's biologically plausible,\" said Gray.\n\nSome of the workers who fell ill sought treatment and were offered oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu, Petersen said.\n\nSome farm workers who were exposed to infected animals or people were offered the medication, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said. State health officials are responsible for evaluating and providing treatment, according to federal guidelines.\n\nHealth officials in Texas provided Tamiflu to the person known to be infected with H5N1 and family members, plus two people on a second dairy farm who were exposed to infected animals, said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said he wasn't sure if others had been offered the antiviral.\n\nFarmers have been hesitant to allow health officials onto their land, said Dr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who consulted about the outbreak with Petersen.\n\n\"This particular disease is looked at as a scarlet letter,\" Russo said. \"It has this stigma associated with it right now.\"\n\nRusso called for wider testing of cattle, people and milk.\n\n\"We do not know what we do not measure,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the horse left the barn and took off a lot faster than we were able to mobilize.\"\n\nGray worries that a recent federal order requiring testing of all lactating dairy cows moving between states could hinder cooperation even further. All labs that conduct tests must report positive results to the Agriculture Department. But many farmers may simply decide against testing, hoping to outlast the outbreak, he said.\n\nThe reluctance of workers and farmers to allow testing is \"greatly hampering\" understanding of how the virus spreads, how large the outbreak is now and how quickly it may grow, Gray said.\n\n\"It's a negative, very negative, effect,\" he said.\n\nPetersen said she understands workers' and farmers' fears. She praised the farmers who had been willing to let her gather the first samples that confirmed the outbreak and reflected on what the results could mean.\n\n\"You immediately think about the cows, the people that care for them and the families that have these farms,\" she said. \"You're thinking about the big picture, long term. Your mind starts to go down that entire path of concern.\"\n\nGetting dairy from farm to table is a complex process -- and farmers are adapting to get it there A different way to farm: Using

These include polar bears in the Arctic, European red foxes and penguins in Antarctica. Recently, a farm worker in the U.S. was infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus in the first recorded case of mammal-to-human transmission.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration announced that samples of pasteurized milk taken from grocery stores had tested positive for bird flu, also known as H5N1. The FDA reported that one in five milk samples in the U.S. showed traces of the virus. Samples from regions with infected herds were more likely to have traces of the virus.\n\nThe FDA says that pasteurized milk is still safe to drink as pathogens would be killed in the process.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, avian influenza or bird flu, is a disease found in wild aquatic birds. The disease can infect domestic animals, such as cattle and other poultry. It is rarely seen in humans, but there have been cases like the recent dairy cattle farmer.\n\nData from the U.S. Department of Agriculture show that a concentration of bird flu cases comes from red foxes on the East Coast and Canadian border, though the disease is still spread nationwide.\n\nBird flu outbreaks increased globally in 2020, leading to the deaths of mammals in Chile, Russia, Peru and other countries. Though one person was infected, the CDC says the general public is at a low risk of infection. However, certain stains of H5N1 have been noted for a 52% mortality rate in humans.\n\nResearchers have found bird flu spreading through farm cows within the same herd, though how is still a question. Generally, wild animals are believed to contract the disease by eating infected birds.\n\nResearchers and scientists are tracking the outbreaks to better understand how the disease spreads and to take preventative measures.

This is the first report of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus likely transmitting from a mammal to a human.\n\nA new report on the dairy worker's case by Tim Uyeki, MD, MPH, MPP, chief medical officer of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) influenza division, and colleagues says it's not clear how the person acquired the infection -- whether it was by touching the eye with contaminated hands or via respiratory exposure. The person was prescribed oral oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and recovered within days without developing respiratory symptoms, according to the report.\n\nGenome sequencing of the patient's specimen found it had no markers associated with reduced response to available influenza antivirals. Its hemagglutinin gene did not have changes that would promote its binding to receptors in the human respiratory tract or its risk of transmission in people, and it was closely related to 2 existing candidate vaccine viruses that could be used to manufacture vaccines. However, the virus did have a genetic change that has previously been associated with adaptation to mammals, the report noted.\n\nA preprint report coauthored by researchers at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) indicates that the virus has been circulating in cows since early December of last year, when it passed from wild birds to a single herd of cattle in Texas. As of May 2, 36 herds had been affected in 9 states, and testing found that 1 in 5 retail milk samples analyzed were positive for the virus. The virus also transmitted from cattle to other mammals -- several barnyard cats and a raccoon -- as well as to poultry and wild birds, according to the USDA report, which has not yet been peer reviewed.\n\nThe outbreak in dairy cows has surprised scientists. There have been possible contacts between cattle and HPAI H5 subtype viruses for many years, notes Martin Beer, DVM, who heads the Institute of Diagnostic Virology within the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, the Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, in Germany. \"But there has never been a situation like this,\" he said in email.\n\nBeer and colleagues previously found that cattle are not highly susceptible to the H5N1 virus.\n\n\"[T]herefore something special has to happen to allow virus circulation in cattle,\" he said in an email. \"In the current situation, this appears to have been achieved by infection of the mammary gland. This organ system seems to act as a bioreactor and therefore further spread is possible through untreated milk and milking equipment.\"\n\nA new study found that both duck and human influenza A virus receptors are widely expressed in the mammary glands of cows. Not only could this explain the high levels of H5N1 virus found in infected cows' milk, but it suggests that \"cattle have the potential to act as a mixing vessel\" for new influenza A viruses, the authors wrote in their preprint article, which also hasn't been peer reviewed.\n\nFor now, US and international health officials say the risk to the general public remains low but that the situation requires close surveillance and increased preparedness.\n\n\"This continued expansion in mammalian species, plus closer to our food source, means that this is the time for action,\" said Nahid Bhadelia, MD, MALD, director of the Boston University Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases.\n\nInfluenza A virus was detected in milk and nasal swabs from cattle in Texas earlier this year, when veterinarians noticed that lactating cows were producing less milk and feeding less. After receiving confirmation that the animals were infected with H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, the same type circulating locally in birds, the USDA reported a multistate outbreak in dairy cattle on March 25 and said that it, the CDC, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and state officials were investigating illness in dairy cows in Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico.\n\nInfected herds have now been identified in those states as well as in Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, and South Dakota. (Kid goats on a farm in Minnesota also tested positive in March in an outbreak unrelated to dairy cows.)\n\nAmong the key findings in the new USDA preprint report, the virus apparently transmitted in a single spillover event from wild birds to a herd of dairy cattle and then spread to different herds over 4 months before the outbreak was confirmed. Infected cows may shed the virus for 2 to 3 weeks, and cattle that were asymptomatically infected likely played a role in transmitting the virus to different herds. Worryingly, the same strain of the virus has been found in dairy cows with no connection to herds known to be infected, a finding that suggests \"there are affected herds that have not yet been identified,\" the authors wrote.\n\nThe illness in cows is relatively mild, according to the USDA, and tends to resolve in about a week. Unlike some infected mammals identified over the past 2 years, cows with H5N1 infection don't appear to have neurological symptoms, said Jonathan Runstadler, DVM, PhD, a professor and chair of the Department of Infectious Disease and Global Health at Tufts University's Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nThe USDA has confirmed that cow-to-cow transmission occurred but says that it's still not known how the virus is spreading between the animals. The agency says high levels of the virus have not been found in respiratory samples from cows, which suggests that respiratory transmission is not a major mode.\n\n\"This is the moment where we have to figure out how transmission is happening on the farms,\" Bhadelia said, \"and for that we need a lot more samples.\"\n\nInfected cows' milk contains high titers of H5N1 virus and could be involved in transmission.\n\n\"One thing the virus does appear to be doing well is replicating in the mammary gland,\" said Runstadler. Mildly symptomatic infection coupled with high concentration in milk could have allowed the virus to spread undetected in dairy cows for some time, he noted.\n\nIn an effort to stop the spread in livestock, the USDA is now requiring cattle that are producing milk to be tested for influenza A virus at an approved laboratory before being moved across state lines. Positive results must be reported to the USDA. The agency is also recommending that all dairy cattle that are moved should be isolated and observed for 30 days after reaching their destination.\n\nPreventing the virus from becoming endemic in cattle is paramount. Beer warns that the virus' high replication rates in the mammary gland and its very high titers in milk provide opportunities for further adaptation to cattle and for continued spread to other species, including mammals and humans.\n\nThe virus's establishment in cattle \"must be prevented,\" Beer said.\n\nOn April 25, the FDA announced that its ongoing analysis involving a set of nationally representative retail cow's milk samples found that 1 in 5 were positive for H5N1 virus based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.\n\nThen, on April 26 and May 1, the agency released preliminary results of \"gold-standard\" egg inoculation tests to confirm that pasteurization effectively deactivates the H5N1 virus in bovine milk, which has never before been directly examined. No live, infectious virus was detected in the 297 retail samples -- including milk, cottage cheese, and sour cream -- that were PCR-positive for H5N1. Samples of powdered infant formula and powdered milk products sold as \"toddler formula\" were all PCR-negative for H5N1, the agency said.\n\nBased on the current evidence, the FDA says the US milk supply is safe. The agency is also testing pooled raw milk to detect how much virus is present that would need to be killed by pasteurization.\n\nThe FDA, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations are reiterating their recommendations against consuming raw milk, which hasn't undergone pasteurization. Runstadler said he would be particularly concerned about drinking raw milk or eating raw milk products during the current outbreak in dairy cows. \"People who consume those are potentially consuming infectious doses of the virus,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the USDA is also testing beef. Thirty retail ground beef samples from states with infected dairy cattle herds were negative for H5N1 on PCR testing, according to a May 1 update.\n\nIt's important to note that the term highly pathogenic avian influenza refers to sickness in birds, not necessarily humans. The current global bird flu outbreak has caused sporadic infections in people, some of them serious. Since 2022, 26 H5N1 cases have been reported in people in 8 countries, nearly all after exposure to sick or dead poultry. Fourteen of those cases were severe or critical, and 7 people died.\n\nTwo of the milder cases were in the US. Before the Texas dairy farm worker, a case was confirmed in 2022 in a poultry worker in Colorado, who also quickly recovered.\n\nAccording to the CDC, people who have been exposed to infected cattle are being monitored for 10 days. Since this March, at least 220 people have been monitored and at least 30 have been tested. Only 1 known positive case, in the dairy farm worker, has been associated with the cattle outbreak so far.\n\nFor now, both the CDC and the WHO alongside other international groups say the current risk to the general public is still low. The CDC is conducting ongoing surveillance for signals of unusual flu activity in emergency departments and public health and clinical laboratory test results. Wastewater surveillance is also under way, but results haven't been fully reported yet.\n\nNo uptick in flu activity was detected for the week that ended April 27, according to the CDC. Bhadelia cautioned, however, that some workers who are sick may not come forward for testing for fear of losing employment and that this could obscure additional cases. Occupational health records from the last few months might provide some insight, she said.\n\n\"If one person on a farm got this infection and these infections are a lot more widespread than we thought among cows, then my gut tells me there's probably a lot more human infections we have not detected,\" said Bhadelia, who was formerly the White House's senior policy advisor for Global COVID Response.\n\nPeople who may come into contact with infected mammals or birds, either recreationally or at work, are at greater risk of infection. The CDC is providing interim safety recommendations for poultry and livestock farmers and workers, slaughterhouse workers who handle lactating dairy cattle, owners of backyard bird flocks, veterinarians and their staff, and public health or animal health responders. A new 1-sheet resource available in English and Spanish describes the recommended personal protective equipment -- including gloves, an approved respirator, and safety goggles or a face shield -- and donning and doffing procedures for people working \"with sick or dead animals, animal feces, litter, raw milk, and other materials that might have the virus.\"\n\nThe CDC and international agencies have said they expect that people will be sporadically infected as long as the virus is circulating widely. According to the CDC website, \"[c]linicians should consider the possibility of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection in persons showing signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness who have relevant exposure history.\"\n\n\"If you take care of someone who works in the dairy industry you need to be alert,\" Carlos del Rio, MD, a professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine and immediate past president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in an email.\n\nBeyond the immediate risk, Bhadelia and other experts say the virus' ongoing spread in mammals could have public health implications.\n\n\"Once considered primarily a threat to poultry,\" the World Organisation for Animal Health warned in a March 13 statement, now the virus \"is moving from wild birds to wild mammals with impacts beyond anything previously seen.\"\n\nSince 2021, H5N1 viruses have been detected in 37 new mammal species worldwide, the organization says. This includes nearly 20 species of wild mammals in 28 US states since 2022, according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Globally, as of this past December, bird flu has reached mammals on both the north and south poles -- a polar bear in the Arctic and seals in the Antarctic. And in some cases, as with farmed mink in 2022 and now dairy cows, mammal-to-mammal transmission has occurred.\n\nExperts say all this passing around of the virus presents more chances for it to become better suited to replicate and transmit in mammals, with potentially grave consequences.\n\n\"Vigilance is needed because if HPAI A(H5N1) virus adapts and becomes established among cows or other mammals, the risk to public health may increase,\" the authors of the dairy farm worker's case report wrote in a supplementary appendix.\n\nBecause the virus has already jumped into cows and then to other animals, one concern is that it could make its way into other livestock, namely pigs. Unlike cows, pigs harbor other influenza A viruses, some of which are already adapted to humans, Beer explained. If these viruses exchanged genes with H5N1, a more zoonotic strain or even a pandemic strain could potentially emerge. \"Therefore, to prevent further adaptation or reassortment in pigs, transmission to pigs should also be prevented,\" Beer said. According to Bhadelia, the USDA says it is conducting surveillance in pigs and hasn't found anything yet.\n\nCould proactive surveillance have caught the cattle outbreak earlier? \"You can't do anything surveillance-wise that's completely covering everything,\" Runstadler. \"But I think it's worth considering, given what this virus has been doing in the last couple of years in particular, and its spread globally and its spill into different species, whether a good plan would be to do more proactive surveillance in both agricultural and wild animal species...\"\n\nRunstadler, who has investigated H5N1 avian influenza infections in marine mammals, noted the virus is continuing to circulate in wild birds, causing waves of infection and death. He pointed to a minor outbreak that has killed birds in the northeast US over the past several weeks after a lull in activity. \"There's every indication that that's continuing to happen, and we should expect that to continue to happen until the virus does something new.\"\n\nPublished Online: May 8, 2024. doi:10.1001/jama.2024.8886\n\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Beer reported receiving funding through his institution from the Horizon Europe program within the HPAIV H5 research projects Kappa-Flu and DURABLE, from the German Research Council (DFG) for the development of novel influenza virus vaccines for animals, and from CEVA for the development of novel vaccines for swine influenza.

But scientists say the virus was actually spreading undetected as early as November, according to a preliminary analysis of the virus's genome.\n\nThis strain of avian influenza, or the H5N1 virus, has been circulating in birds -- both wild and poultry -- for years. Globally, it has infected more than 100 million birds since 2022. Its spread to cattle last year began in the Texas panhandle, in a spillover event likely from a waterfowl, experts say.\n\nIt has now been confirmed in at least 36 herds across nine states -- though the fact that it's been circulating for months has some experts concerned that the outbreak could be more widespread. How H5N1 in dairy herds was missed speaks to the changing nature of viruses and how they present, and the constraints of the dairy industry to react to disease outbreaks.\n\nEven though remnants of the bird flu virus have been found in milk on store shelves, experts are certain that pasteurized milk is safe. The pasteurization process is effective at making that virus inactive. The concern now lies in how this virus might mutate as it spreads, and its possibility to infect humans. So far, only one human case has been detected, involving a Texas dairy farm worker whose only symptom was pink eye -- but experts think the U.S. may be missing other cases.

But there's no sign that the outbreak in cows is over, and scientists are increasingly concerned that cattle will become a permanent reservoir for this adaptable virus -- giving it more chances to mutate and jump to humans.\n\nNew data show that the virus can hop back and forth between cows and birds, a trait that could allow it to spread across wide geographical regions. Although the virus kills many types of mammal, most infected cows don't develop severe symptoms or die, meaning that no one knows whether an animal is infected without testing it. Moreover, a single cow can host several types of flu virus, which could, over time, swap genetic material to generate a strain that can more readily infect humans.\n\n\"Eventually the wrong combination of gene segments and mutations inevitably comes along,\" says Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. \"Whatever opportunity we may have had to nip it in the bud we lost by a really slow detection.\"\n\nH5N1 isn't a new virus -- various forms of it have been circulating since the 1990s. A particularly deadly variant that was first detected in 1996 has killed millions of birds and has been found in numerous mammalian species, including seals and mink. But until now, cows were not among the virus's known hosts.\n\nUS officials first announced on 25 March that H5N1 had been found in cattle, and cows from 36 herds in 9 states have tested positive as of 7 May. Tests of pasteurized milk have found no living virus. But the virus's increasing ubiquity has made scientists uneasy.\n\n\"Every time it gets a new mammalian host species like cows, there's more risk of human transmission and reduced human immunity,\" says Jessica Leibler, an environmental epidemiologist at Boston University in Massachusetts.\n\nGenomic data are starting to shed light on the origins of the cattle outbreak. In a 1 May preprint posted on bioRxiv, scientists at the US Department of Agriculture analysed more than 200 viral genomes taken from cows and found that the virus jumped from wild birds to cattle in late 2023. That result corroborates findings by Worobey and others in an analysis posted on the discussion forum virological.org on 3 May. (Neither article has yet been peer reviewed.)\n\nBecause cows infected with H5N1 generally don't die of the flu, they are \"effective mixing vessels\" in which viruses can swap genetic material with other viruses, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada. Even worse, the current strain seems to infect several species equally well. \"If you have a virus that's hopscotching back and forth between cows, humans and birds, that virus is going to have selective pressures to grow efficiently in all those species,\" she says.\n\nThe larger the number of infected animals, Rasmussen says, the more chances the virus has to acquire helpful mutations, such as the ability to grow in the upper respiratory tract, which could make it more transmissible between people.\n\nFrom a human perspective, Worobey says, cows might be one of the worst possible animal reservoirs for influenza because of their sheer number and the degree to which humans interact with them. Culling poultry has curbed previous bird flu outbreaks, but Rasmussen says that isn't a viable option for cattle. The animals are too valuable and, unlike birds, don't seem to die from the infection.\n\nH5N1 could even become endemic in cows, says Gregory Gray, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Other strains related to H5N1 are already endemic in chickens and pigs in some parts of the world.\n\nResearchers aren't sure how the virus is spreading between herds. Wild birds, which congregate around cattle feed and defecate in the cows' water supply, are one probable source. \"Cattle are just one big birdfeeder,\" Gray says, adding that birds can spread infections much further than cows can and are much less controllable.\n\nSome evidence has suggested that farm equipment, such as milking machines, could be to blame, but several scientists worry that it could be airborne. \"I'm really thinking that's occurring and we've not been able to study it,\" Gray says, mainly because farmers have been reluctant to allow inspectors to test their cattle. Some related variants that infect horses have been found to spread through the air for kilometres, which could explain how the current strain has moved between dairy farms.\n\nUntil more is known about the virus's transmission route, Worobey says, it's hard to determine the best way to contain it. Since late April, the US Department of Agriculture has required that cows are tested before being transported across state lines. That won't necessarily stop the virus's spread, but it could at least help researchers to understand where it's going.\n\nIf the virus is airborne, Gray says, vaccinating cows might be an option. H5N1 vaccines have not yet been used in US cattle. But influenza vaccines have proved effective in pigs and poultry, and researchers are beginning to test them against the H5N1 strain infecting dairy herds.\n\nData on how well the virus spreads between people are scarce. A study published on 3 May in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed that one dairy worker in Texas had been infected and that the worker experienced mild symptoms. But the people who worked and live with the infected person have not been tested.\n\nStill, US officials have not reported a large number of deaths or severe cases in humans, suggesting that the virus hasn't become highly transmissible or deadly, Worobey says.\n\nBut Gray says that there have been anecdotal reports of many more human cases. Leibler suspects that exposure of farm workers is widespread. \"When you see symptomatic patients, that's the tip of the iceberg,\" she says. In the worst-case scenario, she says, the virus would spread undetected in several species for a long time, accumulating mutations that prime it for causing a pandemic in the future. \"We have an awareness now from the COVID pandemic of how devastating that could be,\" she says.\n\nLeibler hopes that public-health efforts will begin testing workers and their families so that any transmission in humans will quickly be detected. \"H5N1 is with us,\" she says. \"It's not a virus that's going to disappear by any means.\"", "source": {"uri": "nature.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Then came word that barn cats -- half of them on one farm -- had died suddenly.\n\nWithin days, the Amarillo veterinarian was hearing about sick cows with unusual symptoms: high fevers, reluctance to eat and much less milk. Tests for typical illnesses came back negative.\n\nPetersen, who monitors more than 40,000 cattle on a dozen farms in the Texas Panhandle, collected samples from cats and cows and sent them to Dr. Drew Magstadt, a friend from college who now works at the veterinary diagnostic laboratory at Iowa State University.\n\nThe samples tested positive for a bird flu virus never before seen in cattle. It was the first proof that the bird flu, known as Type A H5N1, could infect cows. As of Wednesday, 36 U.S. herds had confirmed infections, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Experts are confident the meat supply is safe By DEVI SHASTRI - AP Health Writer\n\nSo far, two people in the U.S. have been confirmed to be infected with H5N1, most recently a Texas dairy worker linked to the cattle outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two dozen people have been tested and about 100 people have been monitored since the virus appeared in cows, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a CDC respiratory diseases official, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nDaskalakis said CDC has seen no unusual flu trends in areas with infected cows, but some experts wonder if anecdotal reports of sick workers mean more than one person caught the virus from the animals.\n\nPetersen said some workers had symptoms consistent with flu: fever and body aches, stuffy nose or congestion. Some had conjunctivitis, the eye inflammation detected in the Texas dairy worker diagnosed with bird flu.\n\nDr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, has been taking samples from livestock and people on two Texas farms. On farms with confirmed cattle infections, there have also been reports of mild illnesses among the workers, he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHis research has been difficult. Many workers are reluctant to be tested. That may be because they have limited access to health care or fear divulging private health information.\n\nWithout confirmation, no one knows if the sick workers were infected with the bird flu virus or something unrelated, Gray said.\n\n\"They seem to be linked in time and space, so one would say it's biologically plausible,\" said Gray.\n\nSome of the workers who fell ill sought treatment and were offered oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu, Petersen said.\n\nSome farm workers who were exposed to infected animals or people were offered the medication, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said. State health officials are responsible for evaluating and providing treatment, according to federal guidelines.\n\nHealth officials in Texas provided Tamiflu to the person known to be infected with H5N1 and family members, plus two people on a second dairy farm who were exposed to infected animals, said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said he wasn't sure if others had been offered the antiviral.\n\nFarmers have been hesitant to allow health officials onto their land, said Dr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who consulted about the outbreak with Petersen.\n\n\"This particular disease is looked at as a scarlet letter,\" Russo said. \"It has this stigma associated with it right now.\"\n\nRusso called for wider testing of cattle, people and milk.\n\n\"We do not know what we do not measure,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the horse left the barn and took off a lot faster than we were able to mobilize.\"\n\nGray worries that a recent federal order requiring testing of all lactating dairy cows moving between states could hinder cooperation even further. All labs that conduct tests must report positive results to the Agriculture Department. But many farmers may simply decide against testing, hoping to outlast the outbreak, he said.\n\nThe reluctance of workers and farmers to allow testing is \"greatly hampering\" understanding of how the virus spreads, how large the outbreak is now and how quickly it may grow, Gray said.\n\n\"It's a negative, very negative, effect,\" he said.\n\nPetersen said she understands workers' and farmers' fears. She praised the farmers who had been willing to let her gather the first samples that confirmed the outbreak and reflected on what the results could mean.\n\n\"You immediately think about the cows, the people that care for them and the families that have these farms,\" she said. \"You're thinking about the big picture, long term.

There are many subtypes, but the strain involved in the most recent outbreak is the highly pathogenic H5N1.\n\nBird flu spreads naturally among wild birds, such as ducks and geese, but can also affect domestic birds and other animals. In the United States, the strain has infected over 90 million chickens. It has also spread to 36 dairy herds in nine states.\n\nFortunately, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it hasn't found any live, infectious virus in commercial foods. However, it has detected virus fragments in pasteurized milk, sour cream, and cottage cheese.\n\nWhile federal authorities stress that the chance of someone contracting bird flu via food products is low, specific choices, such as opting for unpasteurized milk, may raise that risk.\n\nHere's what infectious disease and food safety experts had to say about whether it's possible to get bird flu from consuming poultry, beef, eggs, milk, and other dairy products.\n\nHumans can contract the bird flu, but it's rare, according to S. Wesley Long, MD, PhD, the medical director of diagnostic microbiology at Houston Methodist.\n\n\"It does not transmit well between people and typically requires close contact with infected animals,\" he told Health.\n\nAccording to experts, people can contract the disease by breathing in viral particles or when the virus gets into their eyes, nose, or mouth after touching an infected animal or surface.\n\nWorldwide, fewer than a thousand known cases of H5N1 flu have been recorded since 1997, when the disease was first discovered in humans. In the U.S. only a handful of people have contracted bird flu.\n\nMost recently, a farmworker became infected with H5N1 in April after exposure to dairy cattle in Texas. In 2022, another person contracted H5N1 in Colorado after working on a poultry farm. Other U.S. cases involved less virulent strains.\n\nSymptoms could range from mild, such as an eye infection, to more severe, like fatal pneumonia.\n\nExperts say it's highly unlikely that someone would contract bird flu by eating contaminated food.\n\nThe current position is that H5N1 \"is not a food safety concern, and the risk of its transmission to humans remains low,\" Elaine Vanier, DVM, the animal welfare and animal feed program lead at NSF International, told Health.\n\nLong said the food industry has safeguards to ensure that poultry infected with the bird flu are not sold on the market.\n\n\"Because it is so contagious and commercially devastating for commercial poultry when an infected bird is detected, entire flocks have to be destroyed,\" Long said. \"This poultry is not sold.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has also mandated that dairy cows test negative for Influenza A at an accredited laboratory before being shipped across state lines.\n\nEven if the virus did make its way into your eggs or beef, Long said that \"normal cooking temperature,\" or heating the foods to at least 165 degrees, \"would destroy the virus as well as disease-causing bacteria that are far more common, like Salmonella.\"\n\nDespite finding dead particles of noninfectious influenza virus fragments in commercial pasteurized milk, sour cream, and cottage cheese, the FDA has reassured the public that the milk supply is safe.\n\nWebby said there's no reason to believe that there's any live virus in milk that's been pasteurized, which means it's undergone a heating process to kill potential pathogens.\n\n\"The data that has been generated to date shows that the virus, luckily, does not survive pasteurization,\" Webby said. \"We have tested pasteurized milk and have not found any live virus. So pasteurized milk is safe.\"\n\nHowever, experts advise against drinking unpasteurized milk, also called raw milk, as well as products containing it.\n\n\"Consuming raw unpasteurized milk in the U.S. right now is definitely risky,\" Webby said. \"We know there is H5 virus in the milk of infected cows.\"\n\nIn addition to avoiding unpasteurized milk and thoroughly cooking meat, chicken, and eggs, Nathaniel Tablante, DVM, a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Maryland, advises taking precautions that would help prevent the spread of any pathogen.\n\nThat includes proper storage and handling of food products from animals, as well as \"washing hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds,\" he told Health.\n\nIt's also important to stay up to date on the latest bird flu developments by checking the websites of reliable sources, such as the CDC, FDA, and USDA.", "source": {"uri": "health.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Health.com"}, "authors":

More Cases Are Likely", "body": "(Bloomberg) -- It's spreading rapidly among cows. It's also infecting skunks, mountain lions and red foxes.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nYet as the highly contagious avian flu affects mammals across the US, just one human case has been reported so far.\n\nBut that's probably only because there is extremely limited testing of people underway to detect it. State governments and farm owners have kept Centers for Disease Control and Prevention teams from conducting on-the-ground investigations that would offer a fuller picture of the prevalence of the virus in humans.\n\nThat threatens to impair federal officials' response to an outbreak that many experts view as the biggest test for pandemic readiness systems since Covid-19. The recent patient is recovering after experiencing eye redness as their sole symptom. However, avian flu typically kills half the people known to have been infected, hinting at the danger it poses if it were to spread widely.\n\nThe CDC does not have authorization to carry out on-the-ground investigations without an invitation, and the states that have confirmed infected cattle say they have not made such an overture to the agency.\n\nPrivate dairy farms would also have to welcome the CDC investigators, a fraught proposition in an industry heavily reliant on immigrant workers who are often leery of interacting with government officials and worried about losing income if they test positive. Farms may also be reluctant to scour for infected cows, out of concern that might have downsides for their low-profit margin businesses.\n\n\"The CDC is not able to go in and do the type of testing and investigative work they need to do,\" Abraar Karan, an infectious disease researcher at Stanford University, said. \"That's a huge problem and it's a blatant issue.\"\n\nThe CDC says the current risk to the general public from bird flu is low, because it's not known to transmit efficiently from person to person. But each infection in a cow or human provides an opportunity for the virus to mutate and become better adapted to mammalian respiratory cells.\n\nKey to understanding that risk - and preventing the emergence of a deadly pandemic - is the ability to detect the infection and track molecular changes in the virus.\n\n\"We're playing with fire,\" said Sam Scarpino, a professor at Northeastern University, who helped lead pathogen surveillance at the Rockefeller Foundation during the coronavirus pandemic. \"We're really not doing the surveillance to say that it's not here.\"\n\nOn-The-Ground Testing\n\nCDC Director Mandy Cohen said her agency is prepared to conduct on-the-ground bird flu testing and other forms of surveillance.\n\n\"We are ready to deploy,\" Cohen said in an interview Monday. \"We have been for weeks.\" Those on standby at the CDC include multilingual and multidisciplinary epidemiological teams.\n\nYet the nine states with infected cattle -- Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, Kansas, Idaho, Colorado, North Carolina, Ohio and South Dakota -- said in statements they have not invited the CDC.\n\nIn New Mexico and Texas, the only two states that have reported conducting testing of their own, the scope of that work has been limited. New Mexico tested three people for avian flu, a spokesperson said in an email.\n\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services tested about 20 people, with one positive case in a dairy farm worker. The worker showed signs of conjunctivitis with red, swollen eyes and returned to work the day after testing. A spokesperson for the department said it hasn't invited the CDC \"because we have not found any dairy farms interested in participating in an epidemiological field study.\"\n\nSince March, more than 30 people have been tested for novel influenza A, the broad category of flu that includes H5N1, and over 220 have been monitored for symptoms, many of whom are being asked to self-report signs of disease, according to the CDC.\n\nThe CDC is monitoring multiple flu indicators, and Cohen notes that data from emergency rooms and commercial laboratories across the US isn't currently showing concerning patterns.\n\n\"The good news is we're not seeing anything unusual,\" Cohen said, such as a spike in doctors ordering flu tests.\n\nYet she also stressed the need to continue to work with agriculture partners - especially given the novel nature of how this strain of bird flu is spreading.\n\n\"There is a very robust way in which we've worked with our poultry farmers, but this is new in cattle,\" Cohen said.\n\n'Huge Problem'\n\nThe FDA found traces of the H5N1 virus in 1 in 5 retail milk samples. Although pasteurization has been shown to render the pathogen harmless, that incidence shows it has spread widely among cows. In the US, some 36 dairy herds are known to have been affected.\n\nThe people most likely to be infected - dairy farm workers who have their hands on cows regularly - aren't necessarily going to doctors for treatment, community health workers say.\n\nWastewater testing in Texas found H5N1 traces, which could be attributed to humans or animals with the virus. In a study of wastewater from hundreds of plants in the US, samples from three of them were found to have genetic markers of H5N1.\n\n\"We've almost certainly missed human cases,\" Scarpino said, referencing the Texas wastewater findings. \"The real question we need to answer is: Are there thousands of flu cases we missed, or a handful?\"\n\nWorker Reluctance\n\nEven if the CDC were to gain authorization from states and farms to perform onsite testing, it would face additional challenge: Workers would have to agree to participate, and many of them would likely be hesitant to do so.\n\nFear of job loss, language barriers, transportation costs and distrust in public health systems are all factors that might deter migrants from consenting to test, said Bethany Alcauter, director of research at the National Center for Farmworker Health. She said the situation reminds her of the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, when workers were reluctant to test and the illness wasn't well understood.\n\nLus Chavez, rural outreach director at Family Support Services in Amarillo, Texas, said she spoke with dairy workers in late February with flu-like symptoms including congestion, but they tested negative for flu and Covid. The farm workers, she said, were convinced it was a new strain of Covid that wasn't showing up on tests.\n\nChavez said she has been contacted by the Texas health department to advertise that it can provide voluntary tests, but workers are reluctant to do so out of fear of retaliation for raising concerns or worries about losing pay.\n\nEven if workers elect to test, there is no requirement to reveal where they work, another challenge for authorities trying to track and contain the virus.\n\nThe CDC is engaged in discussions with multiple states about setting up field investigations to answer questions about the ongoing outbreak, including by examining flu antibodies in blood samples from farm workers in order to see if any of them had been previously infected. The CDC would help establish protocols for studies that would allow data to be standardized across states. Such an effort could similarly face hesitation from farms and staff.\n\nIt's not just a dearth of bird-flu testing that concerns public health experts. A lack of funding and research, some say, has also left the US flatfooted if a wider outbreak of bird flu - or any other deadly virus - takes hold.\n\n\"We're not going to be ready,\" Katrine Wallace, epidemiologist at the University of Illinois, said. \"We're not even dealing with what's right in front of us.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

When hundreds of millions of birds were dying because of the bird flu, the mainstream media didn't seem to care very much, so most people in the general population didn't care very much.\n\nThen, bird flu started infecting many mammals all over the globe, and the mainstream media still didn't seem to care very much. But now, here we are in mid-2024, and the mainstream media has suddenly decided to ramp up the fear level.\n\nEven though there has only been one confirmed human case in the U.S. so far this year, the mainstream media is pumping out article after article about the threat that H5N1 could potentially pose to humanity. Do they know something that the rest of us do not?\n\nIt is quite true that if a version of H5N1 comes along that can spread quickly from human to human, the death toll could be catastrophic.\n\nAre we on the verge of seeing that happen? The New York Times reports that H5N1 \"has acquired dozens of new mutations\", and some of them \"may make it more adept at spreading between species\"...\n\nAccording to a new study, the bird flu virus sweeping across dairy farms in multiple states has acquired dozens of new mutations, including some that may make it more adept at spreading between species and less susceptible to antiviral drugs.\n\nI don't like the sound of that at all.\n\nResearchers are telling us that the bird flu \"acquired mutations in late 2023 that allowed it to jump from wild birds to cattle in the Texas Panhandle\"...\n\nIn the new study, the researchers collected samples containing virus from 26 dairy farms in eight states. The researchers said that cows are not typically susceptible to this type of influenza, but H5N1 appears to have acquired mutations in late 2023 that allowed it to jump from wild birds to cattle in the Texas Panhandle.\n\nThe virus then appears to have spread on dairy farms from Texas to Kansas, Michigan and New Mexico. In at least a dozen instances since then, H5N1 has also spilled from cows back into wild birds, poultry, domestic cats and a raccoon.\n\nThis is a very chilling development. In the past, the bird flu would appear for a while and then go away. But for the past couple of years it has been wiping out millions upon millions of birds all over the planet with no end in sight.\n\nFrom this point forward, will H5N1 also permanently threaten our cattle population? Needless to say, that could represent a very serious threat to our food supply.\n\nEven more alarming is the fact that the strain of H5N1 that a dairy worker in Texas caught reportedly had \"a mutation that allowed it to infect people more efficiently\"...\n\nThe only person diagnosed with bird flu during the current outbreak carried a virus with a mutation that allowed it to infect people more efficiently. One cow in the study also carried H5N1 with that mutation.\n\nMore than 200 others were infected with virus versions with different mutations that offer the same advantage. Why are we only learning about this now?

The only indication that he had been infected was a striking case of pinkeye.\n\nDetails about this bird flu infection were published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, from health officials in Texas and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOne Person In Texas Has Been Infected With Bird Flu After Handling Cattle\n\nBird flu was first detected in several herds of dairy cows in late March. Around that same time, the man's right eye started to bother him and became red. He ended up with broken blood vessels in both eyes. Doctors said he had conjunctivitis or pinkeye. The man had been in direct contact with both healthy and sick cows. His pinkeye condition was apparently caused by the bird flu virus.\n\nThe infected man was given the antiviral Tamiflu and was told to isolate as he recovered. No one he lives with became sick, though they, too, were given the antiviral to reduce that risk, the authors of the published report wrote. He never developed respiratory symptoms, which suggests that the virus may not spread easily from person to person through coughs or sneezes.\n\nYet.\n\nThe mainstream media has been reporting that this is likely the first time bird flu has spread to a human from a different mammal species.\n\nAccording to Stat News, nearly 900 people in 23 countries have been infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus since it started spreading from Southeast Asia in late 2003.

The Agriculture Department has rightly issued new testing recommendations meant to keep the virus from spreading across state lines. But this additional testing will do little to address the primary threat that H5N1 poses to humans: the infection of farmworkers. Our failure to protect them threatens their health andgives the virus an opportunity to evolve into a greater threat to people, including those who live far from dairy farms.\n\nThe discovery of viral material in milk sold in American stores is not in itself alarming. Pasteurization, though it doesn't remove pathogens, destroys their ability to infect people. Follow-up testing has confirmed this: Researchers have not been able to isolate and grow the virus from pasteurized milk.\n\nBut H5N1 poses risks to dairy workers, who may be exposed to infected cows and to milk before it is pasteurized. So far, only one dairy worker in the United States is known to have been infected, and fortunately this person experienced only mild eye inflammation. But there are reports that other dairy workers have gotten sick at the same time that cows have. Veterinarian Barb Peterson told Bovine Veterinarian, \"There's been underreporting of the virus. Understandably, there's been a lot of fear. But every dairy that I've worked with has -- with the exception of one -- had sick human beings at the same time they had sick cows.\"\n\nThese reports are concerning, not because the infections are severe but because any rise in human infections boosts the chances that the virus will find its way to someone who has more medical conditions and may have a worse disease outcome if infected. And H5N1 has not historically been mild in humans.

The Department of Agriculture rightly issued new testing recommendations aimed at preventing the virus from spreading across state lines. But this additional testing does little to address the main threat that H5N1 poses to humans: infection of farm workers. If we fail to protect them, we threaten their health and give the virus an opportunity to evolve into a greater threat to people, including those who live far from dairy farms.\n\nIt is not surprising that viral material has been detected in milk sold in American stores. Pasteurization does not eliminate the pathogen, but it destroys its ability to infect humans. Follow-up studies confirmed this. Researchers were unable to isolate and grow the virus in pasteurized milk.\n\nHowever, H5N1 poses a risk to dairy workers, who may be exposed to infected cows or unpasteurized milk. so far, only one dairy worker There is a known case of infection in the United States, but fortunately this person only suffered mild eye irritation. However, there are reports that other dairy workers have also fallen ill at the same time as the cows.veterinarian barb peterson I told the cow veterinarian\"The virus is under-reported. Understandably, there was a lot of fear. But in every dairy farm I've ever worked at, except for one, sick cows and sick cows at the same time. They also had humans.\"\n\nThese reports are alarming, not because the infections are serious, but because increasing human infections means the virus is more likely to spread to sicker people, who can make things worse. This is because there is. Additionally, H5N1 has historically not been mild in humans. Of the approximately 900 known cases of human H5N1 infection worldwide, About half died from the virus..\n\nTherefore, it is important to protect farm workers who may come into contact with infected animals from exposure.

Scientists can't stop worrying about a nightmare scenario: that the virus will get into pigs and, from there, spark a human pandemic.\n\nPigs \"are the perfect vessels through which an even more virulent strain could emerge,\" said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at a May 2 briefing by the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nPigs are capable of harboring both human flu and bird flu, allowing the viruses to mix and match parts of their genetic material. A 2009 flu pandemic started with a pig-to-human transmission. That strain, called H1N1, wasn't deadlier than seasonal flu, but that was just a lucky break.\n\nNow is the time to get ahead of 2024's H5N1 virus with systematic testing of both sick and healthy-looking animals -- including pigs. Scientists agree such testing is essential to understanding the situation, and they have the test kits. What they're missing is a nimble change in policy that would ensure the cooperation of farmers who fear economic ruin if their animals test positive.\n\nThousands of chickens and turkeys are already monitored -- thanks to agreements that reassure farmers they won't be financially ruined by positive tests. Government compensation for \"culling\" birds has brought on its own set of controversies, but right now there's no system to compensate farmers for H5N1 infected cows or pigs, which means they have no incentive to let public health officials do enough testing. The US Department of Agriculture recently required testing of dairy cows only if they were being transferred to other states. It's up to our political leaders to make further policy changes so that farmers are encouraged to work with scientists -- and scientists can do the research they need to do.\n\nThis must extend to testing of healthy-looking animals. A recent analysis of the genetic material of the virus suggests it may have been spreading stealthily in cows since last December, long before the first case was detected in late March. Failing to test asymptomatic animals would be a mistake akin to the insufficient testing for Covid-19 in early 2020.

Shah called the risk of an H5N1 pandemic \"not insignificant,\" and yet there's currently no coordinated effort to test asymptomatic farm animals.\n\nAnd pigs have been silent carriers before. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said that in 2014 scientists found a flu called H3N2 was being transmitted back and forth between pigs and people, many of them kids, at Ohio state fairs.\n\nFlu likes to bind to a sugar on the surface of cells, and the reason bird influenzas usually doesn't spread among humans is that our sugars are very different, explained Richard Webby, a specialist in influenza at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis.\n\nThe cells in a pig's respiratory tract have both kinds of sugars, so both kinds of virus can get in and swap pieces. The infamous 1918 influenza virus, thought to have originated from a bird flu, was transmitted from humans to pigs in the 1920s, where it continued to evolve. It re-emerged in humans in 1957, 1968 and 2009. In recent years, as bird flu surged through domestic flocks, it's gained the power to infect dozens of mammal species, including minks, racoons, foxes, seals and porpoises. We really don't want pigs to be next.\n\nYet the wider the cow infections spread, the more chances the virus has to jump to pigs. They might get infected through contaminated equipment, or if milk from infected cows gets into their feed. Although pasteurization kills the virus in commercial milk, the raw milk remains highly infectious -- it's the lead suspect in deaths of several farm cats infected with H5N1.\n\n\"What's a bit unclear to me is exactly what's happening to all this contaminated milk,\" said Webby. Could some be getting dumped, raw, where other animals could ingest it?\n\nOsterholm said more surveillance on farms is critical. This virus has already traveled from infected cows to poultry on one farm in Michigan. Scientists need more data to understand how the disease is spreading among cows, which would mean adopting policies modeled on those that allow monitoring poultry.\n\nBut right now, farmers who raise pigs and cows see nothing in it for them except lost money and stigma. CDC's Shah said farmers are often deeply skeptical of the federal government. Farm workers are often fearful of missing work, since they have no paid sick leave, which is hampering the parallel need for farm worker testing.\n\n\"Everyone is coming off Covid-19 so fatigued and tired they don't want to hear about another pandemic,\" said Osterholm.

Swabs of the man's throat and eye tested positive for H5N1, but he had mild symptoms and did not infect anyone in his household.\n\nMeanwhile, some 220 workers who work at the 36 US dairies affected by the H5N1 outbreak have been screened, but none has been infected with the virus, according to the US CDC's Dr Todd Davis, speaking at a WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) briefing on Monday.\n\n\"After sequencing several hundred viruses from cattle, we don't see any molecular changes that would indicate increased possibilities of infection or transmission from person to person,\" said Davis.\n\n\"So we still consider this public health risks to be quite low. I think some of the exceptions may be prolonged unprotected exposure to infected dairy cattle, so there are some likely risk associated with occupational exposure.\"\n\nMilk and meat risks\n\nAbout 20% of milk samples collected by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tested positive for H5N1 viral RNA, said Dr Richard Webby, director of the WHO's Collaborating Centre for studies on the ecology of influenza in animals and birds.\n\nMeanwhile, a smaller sample set targeted at the states where outbreaks had occurred found 40% of the milk products contained viral remnants, added Webby, who is based at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis in the US.\n\n\"There has been a relatively large number of samples tested, but so far from a safety perspective, it does look like the pasteurisation process is removing viable virus from those samples,\" added Webby.\n\nDr Moez Sanaa, head of the WHO's Standard and Scientific Advice on Food Nutrition, confirmed that while viral RNA has been found in pasteurised milk, none of this was live virus \"suggesting that the pasteurisation process effectively inactivates H5N1,\" said\n\n\"Preliminary results [of ongoing studies] indicate that virus is inactivated by heat treatment similar to pasteurisation,\" said Sanaa, but added that more studies of milk with higher viral loads was still needed. He warned people to avoid raw milk.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced that all 30 samples of ground beef from retail outlets in the states with infected dairy cattle herds tested negative for H5N1. These results reaffirm that the meat supply is safe.\n\nWebby's group has also tested eggs and found them to be free of H5N1.\n\nCow transmission: mechanical?\n\nFrom the genomic analysis, it appears that the outbreak in the dairy farms stemmed from \"a single introduction\" but that \"the moving of dairy cattle has spread that to multiple farms and different locations\", according to Dr David Swayne, a US influenza veterinarian.\n\nSwayne added that as transmission seemed to occur \"in the unique environment of a dairy parlour\", there were two leading hypotheses about how the rapid transmission was taking place.\n\nOne was that there was \"mechanical transmission\" with infections being spread via milking machines, for example.\n\nThe other was that transmission occurred during the \"continual cleaning\" in dairies that enabled viral spread through \"large droplets produced from that washing down process\".\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Aspen Hammond from WHO's Global Immunization Programme (GIP) said that H5N1 had been found in other animals near the affected dairy cattle herd, including cats, raccoons and wild and domestic birds nearby.\n\nDr Maria van Kerkhove, the WHO's acting head of Epidemic and Pandemic Prevention and Preparedness (EPP), described the outbreak as \"one Health in action\".\n\n\"You cannot look at human health risk without looking at the risk in animals,\" said Van Kerkhove, stressing that partnerships with bodies in the animal health field were essential.\n\n\"Right now, there's a lot of focus on the US but we are seeing a global epizootic of avian influenza, and we've seen H5N1 infection in wild birds and poultry and marine mammals and land mammals,\" she said.\n\n\"But what is concerning is that we are seeing new species that are being infected... We need much stronger surveillance in animals globally, not just in the US, looking at the species that we know can be infected with H5N1, but also in humans at the animal-human interface. \"\n\nShe urged those doing surveillance to continue to sequence and share those sequences to enable regular assessments of the viruses as well as \"what any changes in these viruses mean, in terms of transmissibility in terms of severity.\"\n\nVan Kerkhove also stressed that occupationally exposed people needed to be protected from infection, including by using personal protective equipment and washing hands frequently, \"because prevention is key\".\n\nShe also said that, while it was not yet necessary, the current H5N1 flu was covered by the candidate vaccines in the influenza prevention pipeline.", "source": {"uri": "healthpolicy-watch.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Health Policy Watch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kerry_cullinan@healthpolicy-watch.news", "name": "Kerry Cullinan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RNA virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA sequencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Dairy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Dairy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Dairy_Products", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Dairy Products", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/healthpolicy-watch.news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cows.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541303", "eventUri": "eng-9541303", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

A recent outbreak among dairy cow herds in the United States has raised the virus' profile.\n\nAs of May 2, H5N1 avian influenza cases have been reported in 36 dairy cattle herds in nine states, according to U.S. health officials, who continue to categorize the risk that H5N1 poses to the public as low.\n\nA dairy farm worker in Texas also has been infected -- possibly the first ever case of mammal-to-human transmission of H5N1. Although the worker's symptoms were mild, the case raised questions about the testing of dairy cattle and dairy farm workers in the U.S.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, testing done by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories has not found changes to H5N1 that would make it more transmissible to humans, but health officials have noted that there is an increased risk for people who have close or prolonged unprotected contact with infected birds or other animals.\n\nWe asked Jennifer B. Nuzzo, DrPH, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, if the U.S. is enough to prevent additional cases.\n\nHealio: What are your overall thoughts on the H5N1 bird flu situation?\n\nMy biggest worry today is that H5N1 now poses a serious occupational risk to farm workers. Our top priority right now should be to make sure we protect dairy workers and others who are likely to have exposure to the H5N1 virus. I am also worried about the possibility that this virus could evolve to become better able to infect humans, and, as a worst-case scenario, transmit easily between humans. This would start a new pandemic.\n\nWe learned from the COVID-19 pandemic that a proactive approach to stopping a potential infectious disease outbreak is the only effective course of action. The U.S. government should, today, be working to get a clearer picture of the spread of the virus through expanded testing of cattle and protecting dairy workers who have been in contact with sick animals by expediting vaccines to make them available to farmworkers as soon as possible.\n\nHealio: How would testing help?\n\nWhile there's been only one reported human case in the U.S., there are anecdotal reports of other dairy workers getting sick at the same time as cows. Testing of sick dairy workers would give us a clearer picture of how widespread the virus has become and the amount of resources needed to protect farmworkers who have been or may come in contact with sick animals and mitigate the spread.\n\nBut we also have to acknowledge that testing farmworkers is challenging and, possibly, punitive -- especially given the lack of sick days, and worker's compensation. Any testing we do needs to be tied to incentives, such as easier access to antivirals and job protection assurances.\n\nHealio: Should we be vaccinating people against H5N1?\n\nAs there is not yet proof of widespread human infection, in the current moment the focus should be on testing dairy workers. But work must be ongoing to ensure we will have the vaccines that would be needed and take steps to identify any bottlenecks in making sure we have the vaccines we need as soon as we need them.\n\nI am worried that global supplies will be inadequate to meet demand, which could mean losing supplies that the U.S. is counting on getting. This happened in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. One of the U.S.'s overseas vaccine suppliers informed the U.S. that it would first have to fulfill domestic orders before honoring contracts from the U.S.\n\nHealio: Is there anything the U.S. is not doing now that it should be doing?\n\nThere should be much more testing of dairy cows that expands on the federal government's recent decision to test sick dairy cows and dairy cows crossing state lines. To do this more effectively, we need tests that can be performed directly on farms instead of having to send samples to labs for testing.\n\nAnd there must be much more work to engage with and protect dairy workers -- first through education about the importance of using personal protective equipment and, ultimately, by making vaccines available. This will be challenging, but not impossible.\n\nPublic health agencies are used to engaging with vulnerable groups in this way. We need farms to help in this work -- to protect their workers and to maintain confidence in the safety and quality of their agricultural products.", "source": {"uri": "healio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Healio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University_School_of_Public_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown University School of Public Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2009 swine flu pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal protective equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.healio.com/~/media/slack-news/infectious-disease/misc/infographics/2024/05_may/idn0524nuzzo_graphic_01_web.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541303", "eventUri": "eng-9541303", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 313, "textEnd": 318}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Scientists can't stop worrying about a nightmare scenario: that the virus will get into pigs and, from there, spark a human pandemic.\n\nPigs \"are the perfect vessels through which an even more virulent strain could emerge,\" said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at a May 2 briefing by the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nPigs are capable of harboring both human flu and bird flu, allowing the viruses to mix and match parts of their genetic material. A 2009 flu pandemic started with a pig-to-human transmission. That strain, called H1N1, wasn't deadlier than seasonal flu, but that was just a lucky break.\n\nNow is the time to get ahead of 2024's H5N1 virus with systematic testing of both sick and healthy-looking animals - including pigs. Scientists agree such testing is essential to understanding the situation, and they have the test kits. What they're missing is a nimble change in policy that would ensure the cooperation of farmers who fear economic ruin if their animals test positive.\n\nThousands of chickens and turkeys are already monitored - thanks to agreements that reassure farmers they won't be financially ruined by positive tests. Government compensation for \"culling\" birds has brought on its own set of controversies, but right now there's no system to compensate farmers for H5N1 infected cows or pigs, which means they have no incentive to let public health officials do enough testing. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently required testing of dairy cows only if they were being transferred to other states. It's up to our political leaders to make further policy changes so that farmers are encouraged to work with scientists - and scientists can do the research they need to do.\n\nThis must extend to testing of healthy-looking animals. A recent analysis of the genetic material of the virus suggests it may have been spreading stealthily in cows since last December, long before the first case was detected in late March. Failing to test asymptomatic animals would be a mistake akin to the insufficient testing for Covid-19 in early 2020. That was one of the most egregious public health mistakes of that pandemic - people who didn't meet very specific criteria (like having recently traveled to China) were unable to get a test, allowing the disease to spread further.\n\nScientists agree that keeping H5N1 from sparking a human pandemic requires careful monitoring of cows, pigs and farm workers. Shah called the risk of an H5N1 pandemic \"not insignificant,\" and yet there's currently no coordinated effort to test asymptomatic farm animals.\n\nAnd pigs have been silent carriers before. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said that in 2014 scientists found a flu called H3N2 was being transmitted back and forth between pigs and people, many of them kids, at Ohio state fairs.\n\nFlu likes to bind to a sugar on the surface of cells, and the reason bird influenzas usually doesn't spread among humans is that our sugars are very different, explained Richard Webby, a specialist in influenza at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis.\n\nThe cells in a pig's respiratory tract have both kinds of sugars, so both kinds of virus can get in and swap pieces. The infamous 1918 influenza virus, thought to have originated from a bird flu, was transmitted from humans to pigs in the 1920s, where it continued to evolve. It re-emerged in humans in 1957, 1968 and 2009. In recent years, as bird flu surged through domestic flocks, it's gained the power to infect dozens of mammal species, including minks, racoons, foxes, seals and porpoises. We really don't want pigs to be next.\n\nYet the wider the cow infections spread, the more chances the virus has to jump to pigs. They might get infected through contaminated equipment, or if milk from infected cows gets into their feed. Although pasteurization kills the virus in commercial milk, the raw milk remains highly infectious - it's the lead suspect in deaths of several farm cats infected with H5N1.\n\n\"What's a bit unclear to me is exactly what's happening to all this contaminated milk,\" said Webby. Could some be getting dumped, raw, where other animals could ingest it?\n\nOsterholm said more surveillance on farms is critical. This virus has already traveled from infected cows to poultry on one farm in Michigan. Scientists need more data to understand how the disease is spreading among cows, which would mean adopting policies modeled on those that allow monitoring poultry.\n\nBut right now, farmers who raise pigs and cows see nothing in it for them except lost money and stigma.

Scientists can't stop worrying about a nightmare scenario: that the virus will get into pigs and, from there, spark a human pandemic.\n\nPigs \"are the perfect vessels through which an even more virulent strain could emerge,\" said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at a May 2 briefing by the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nPigs are capable of harboring both human flu and bird flu, allowing the viruses to mix and match parts of their genetic material. A 2009 flu pandemic started with a pig-to-human transmission. That strain, called H1N1, wasn't deadlier than seasonal flu, but that was just a lucky break.\n\nNow is the time to get ahead of 2024's H5N1 virus with systematic testing of both sick and healthy-looking animals -- including pigs. Scientists agree such testing is essential to understanding the situation, and they have the test kits. What they're missing is a nimble change in policy that would ensure the cooperation of farmers who fear economic ruin if their animals test positive.\n\nThousands of chickens and turkeys are already monitored -- thanks to agreements that reassure farmers they won't be financially ruined by positive tests. Government compensation for \"culling\" birds has brought on its own set of controversies, but right now there's no system to compensate farmers for H5N1 infected cows or pigs, which means they have no incentive to let public health officials do enough testing. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently required testing of dairy cows only if they were being transferred to other states. It's up to our political leaders to make further policy changes so that farmers are encouraged to work with scientists -- and scientists can do the research they need to do.\n\nThis must extend to testing of healthy-looking animals. A recent analysis of the genetic material of the virus suggests it may have been spreading stealthily in cows since last December, long before the first case was detected in late March. Failing to test asymptomatic animals would be a mistake akin to the insufficient testing for Covid-19 in early 2020. That was one of the most egregious public health mistakes of that pandemic -- people who didn't meet very specific criteria (like having recently traveled to China) were unable to get a test, allowing the disease to spread further.\n\nScientists agree that keeping H5N1 from sparking a human pandemic requires careful monitoring of cows, pigs and farm workers. Shah called the risk of an H5N1 pandemic \"not insignificant,\" and yet there's currently no coordinated effort to test asymptomatic farm animals.\n\nAnd pigs have been silent carriers before. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said that in 2014 scientists found a flu called H3N2 was being transmitted back and forth between pigs and people, many of them kids, at Ohio state fairs.\n\nFlu likes to bind to a sugar on the surface of cells, and the reason bird influenzas usually doesn't spread among humans is that our sugars are very different, explained Richard Webby, a specialist in influenza at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis.\n\nThe cells in a pig's respiratory tract have both kinds of sugars, so both kinds of virus can get in and swap pieces. The infamous 1918 influenza virus, thought to have originated from a bird flu, was transmitted from humans to pigs in the 1920s, where it continued to evolve. It re-emerged in humans in 1957, 1968 and 2009. In recent years, as bird flu surged through domestic flocks, it's gained the power to infect dozens of mammal species, including minks, racoons, foxes, seals and porpoises. We really don't want pigs to be next.\n\nYet the wider the cow infections spread, the more chances the virus has to jump to pigs. They might get infected through contaminated equipment, or if milk from infected cows gets into their feed. Although pasteurization kills the virus in commercial milk, the raw milk remains highly infectious -- it's the lead suspect in deaths of several farm cats infected with H5N1.\n\n\"What's a bit unclear to me is exactly what's happening to all this contaminated milk,\" said Webby. Could some be getting dumped, raw, where other animals could ingest it?\n\nOsterholm said more surveillance on farms is critical. This virus has already traveled from infected cows to poultry on one farm in Michigan. Scientists need more data to understand how the disease is spreading among cows, which would mean adopting policies modeled on those that allow monitoring poultry.\n\nBut right now, farmers who raise pigs and cows see nothing in it for them except lost money and stigma. CDC's Shah said farmers are often deeply skeptical of the federal government. Farm workers are often fearful of missing work, since they have no paid sick leave, which is hampering the parallel need for farm worker testing.\n\n\"Everyone is coming off Covid-19 so fatigued and tired they don't want to hear about another pandemic,\" said Osterholm. But just imagine how we'll feel if we have to live through another deadly outbreak -- and another series of public health mistakes.\n\n(F.D. Flam is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering science.

To prevent chapter two from becoming a reality, the most important tool in our arsenal will be widespread testing. Testing isn't just about diagnosing people with the virus. Containing the spread of this highly pathogenic bird flu strain in cattle hinges on our ability to detect and track it.\n\nThe H5N1 outbreak in dairy cows is widespread and spans multiple U.S. states. Although only one human infection with the virus has been documented, more infections are likely going undetected. Most importantly, unchecked transmission among cattle means the virus is increasingly bumping up against humans. Every human exposure, in turn, provides an opportunity for new mutations that could enable human-to-human transmission.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains that as of now, the risk to the general public from H5N1 remains low. And indeed, it is entirely possible H5N1 might never turn into a human pandemic.\n\nHowever, being wrong would be incredibly costly.\n\nWe find ourselves in a situation reminiscent of early 2020, when the U.S. stood on the brink of the COVID-19 pandemic and hesitated to take decisive action, restricting testing to only those with epidemiological links to China. Scientists estimate that by early March 2020, less than 1% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the U.S. were detected by testing. We effectively flew blind straight through chapters one and two of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nToday, genomic analyses tell us that bird flu had been circulating in dairy cows for at least four months before it was detected in March 2024. The delay was despite early warning signs of infections on dairy farms in February. The U.S. government cannot afford to repeat the mistakes made at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the risk of an H5N1 pandemic may currently be low, the consequences of inaction could be catastrophic, and the benefits of proactive testing far outweigh the short-term costs.\n\nRead More: Why Experts Are Worried About Bird Flu in Cows\n\nDespite the high stakes, government action initially has been slow and uncoordinated. Until mid-April, testing was not only voluntary but restricted to symptomatic animals, with limits on the number of tests per farm. A complicating factor is that responsibility for outbreak control is divided between three federal agencies: the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for livestock, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for food safety, and the CDC for human health and surveillance. Yet by May, the CDC was aware of only about 30 people who had been tested for bird flu. The CDC has been monitoring data from emergency departments in areas where H5N1 has been found in cattle and has found nothing unusual so far. But if and when infected people show up at the ER, it will be way too late to contain the outbreak at its source.\n\nWe must stop flying blind. Regular and widespread testing is our only way to detect H5N1 and stop the virus from spreading.\n\nThe recent federal order requiring mandatory testing of dairy cows before they cross state lines is a step in the right direction. But we could be doing more: we should incentivize testing, rather than restricting it. A layered testing strategy that combines waste or wastewater surveillance on the farms, routine testing of pooled milk from the cows, and active surveillance testing of animals and humans -- including those without symptoms -- is our best hope of stopping the virus from spreading.\n\nThe tools and infrastructure for such a testing regimen are already at our fingertips. During the pandemic, the U.S. government spent billions supporting testing and creating an extensive biosurveillance infrastructure. Influenza monitoring via wastewater surveillance has already shown increases in the H5 subtype -- the viral group to which H5N1 belongs. In 2024, labs across the U.S. now have PCR machines sitting idle, waiting to be turned back on. And U.S. test manufacturers have efficient automated manufacturing lines capable of producing millions of rapid tests a day.\n\nRead More: Is It Safe to Eat Eggs and Chicken During the Bird Flu Outbreak?\n\nFor animal testing, we should accelerate evaluations of both laboratory and point-of-need tests. Testing should include cows, but also pigs, which are known \"mixing vessels\" for viruses across host species. We should also evaluate different specimens like swabs and cow milk, including the pooling of samples to test more efficiently.\n\nIf existing influenza A rapid tests could detect the virus from a drop of contaminated milk, it would be a game changer. Given the sky-high virus loads detected in milk from infected dairy cows, it is possible that a single drop could be enough. But if the tests need to be tweaked, the USDA and FDA should be funding studies to do so now. With H5N1 circulating in herds nationwide, we can quickly assess the effectiveness of these tests and refine our strategies accordingly.\n\nWhen it comes to human testing, it is laudable that the CDC is now engaging with test manufacturers to develop a widely available H5N1 test. In the meantime, existing authorized rapid tests for influenza A will likely detect H5N1. To confirm, the CDC, FDA, and the National Institute of Health's Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program should support evaluations that close that knowledge gap. If these broad influenza rapid tests detect H5N1, we could send any positive influenza A test to a lab for confirmation and evaluation of H5N1 or another virus. This surveillance testing algorithm, which leverages broad influenza tests for initial screening and reserves more specific H5N1 assays for confirmation, followed by rapid sequencing of positives, would allow us to allocate our public-health resources with maximum efficiency. The rapid turnaround times of point-of-need tests would enable infected people to immediately isolate themselves and get influenza antivirals, minimizing the risk of transmission.\n\nThe federal government keeps the influenza antiviral Tamiflu as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) in its Strategic National Stockpile. To ensure that tests are similarly available, the government must send a clear demand signal to manufacturers, committing to purchase a substantial quantity of tests, just as they do for antivirals and PPE. This would give manufacturers the confidence needed to ramp up production and create a robust national stockpile. Congress should allocate funding to support these efforts, with the White House's new Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response coordinating a unified response across the CDC, USDA, and FDA.\n\nThe government must also address the stigma associated with positive test results and provide financial aid and resources to help affected farmers and their workers. Many of the individuals working on dairy farms are undocumented, for example. The current administration should make assurances that offer protection to undocumented workers who agree to test as a part of public-health surveillance testing programs.\n\nSuccess in public-health prevention is difficult to spot, and success in preventing a pandemic can be misconstrued as a failure or a misappropriation of funds. It's nearly impossible to recognize the absence of a pandemic that never happens, but would have if not for aggressive and early efforts.

Testing by USDA on ground beef reported negative tests, showing the meat supply is safe. Pasteurization of milk renders the virus inactive, and thus, the milk supply is safe also.\n\n\"The main finding is the virus can be present in the milk,\" said Drew Magstadt, clinical associate professor at Iowa State University's College of Veterinary Medicine. \"We have limited data of how long these affected cattle stay positive with a PCR test of their milk.\"\n\nOne group of 20 cows that tested positive for the virus and were tested every week did show almost no sign of the virus in their milk at three weeks past breaking with clinical disease. This is a very small group but is believed to be common for cows.\n\nSince this disease has no mortality connected to it, there are literally no tissue samples that have been tested. Other samples, including nasal swabs, serum, blood, feces and urine, will show an occasional positive, but are very low in virus. Milk tests show the highest amount of virus. Ongoing research is being conducted on mammary glands to find out if there are cell types present in this area of the cow that allow the virus to enter and replicate.\n\nResearchers are trying to determine what are the best types of samples to test in non-lactating cows. Magstadt said it is clear that milk samples are the best way to test, but when determining virus presence or previous infection in other non-lactating cattle, it's important to know what type of samples to use. Antibodies appear to be present in these animals 10 to 14 days after infection, which should help determine what animals may have been previously infected. Determining if the non-lactating cattle are a risk to the lactating cattle is important to assess as well.\n\nTransmission is an important factor in slowing down the disease.\n\n\"This is new and uncharted territory,\" Magstadt said. \"There really isn't a model for a disease like this. How exactly did this get into cows in the first place from wild birds? There appears to be transmission between lactating cows also -- so how is that occurring? Is it aerosolized, or is part of the milking parlor involved? We need to figure that out to help control the spread and keep it out of uninfected sites.\"\n\nLEARNING FROM POULTRY INFECTIONS\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza is what affected the poultry industry and traces back to 1996. But this influenza, also an H5N1 flu, has seen several mutations throughout the years, including being found in several mammalian hosts. A high mortality rate is seen, especially in chickens, but it is not as highly pathogenic in other birds such as ducks.\n\nYuko Sato, Iowa State University Extension poultry veterinarian, said HPAI is what it is called in birds, but not in cattle or humans. Similarly, the H5N1 virus is what is being spread in mammals. She said the good thing about when it hits the mammalian species, many appear to be dead-end hosts. As of April 2022, red foxes appeared to be up to 40% of the mammals affected by H5N1. They became infected by scavenging on birds carrying the virus. In general, if the virus is not fatal to the animal, they will stop shedding virus after recovering from the sickness.\n\nThe PCR testing that is used with milk samples shows if the virus is there or virus particles are present. The other test is the Eliza test, which uses a blood sample and looks at the exposure of the animals and if antibodies are present. Both tests are used in the poultry industry to determine when the birds can be moved.\n\n\"We have learned a lot since the 2015 outbreak,\" Sato said. \"In 2015, we had a low presence of virus in the wild bird population, and 85% of the cases were spread from farm to farm, as compared to the current outbreak, which has had more in the wild birds. As many as 9,000 detections were found in wild birds. Less than 20% of our cases this time are farm to farm spread. That's how we learned from the outbreak.\"\n\nSato encouraged the dairy industry to take a proactive stance and look at creative solutions to dealing with the virus instead of waiting for guidance from the government. Novel strategies need to be used to combat the virus and prevent further spread.\n\nKaisand stressed the importance of reaching out to local and state veterinarians for help with dealing with the H5N1 virus. As of May 6, no further positives had been reported to USDA since April 25. A total of 36 cases have been found in dairy cattle in nine states, including Texas, Colorado, Michigan, Kansas, New Mexico, Idaho, South Dakota, North Carolina and Ohio.", "source": {"uri":

But brain and respiratory tract tissues contained far fewer of this type of receptor.\n\nThat fits with the description of how this virus is behaving in cows, with clear signs of infection in the udders, but little evidence of respiratory tract infections and no reports to date of cows experiencing neurological symptoms. This virus has been seen to attack the brains of a number of other mammalian species it can infect, including cats, which is why consideration of whether cows' brains are also susceptible is important.\n\nThe work was done by scientists at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark's Statens Serum Institut, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nThe distribution of the receptor types -- some of which avian flu viruses can attach to, others to which human flu viruses attach -- raises concerns that cows could potentially give rise to a version of H5N1 or another novel flu virus that is able to transmit efficiently to and among people, the authors suggested.\n\n\"These results provide a mechanistic rationale for the high levels of H5N1 virus reported in infected bovine milk and show cattle have the potential to act as a mixing vessel for novel [influenza virus] generation,\" they wrote.\n\nPigs, which can be infected with both bird flu and human flu viruses, have traditionally been referred to as mixing vessels for new viruses that could pose a pandemic threat. That's because when an animal is co-infected with different flu viruses, the pathogens can swap genes, a process called reassortment. That phenomenon could give rise to new virus strains with enough human genes to be able to easily infect people, but also enough bird flu genes to be foreign enough to human immune systems that they could pose a serious risk to human health.\n\nCows have not been thought to pose such a risk. Though it's known they can be infected with flu viruses, influenza hasn't been seen to be a major issue for cows. And until this outbreak, cows have not played a role in the H5N1 story.\n\nThis virus, first seen in China in 1996, is primarily one that infects wild birds and domestic poultry, though it has been shown to be able to infect numerous mammalian species over the nearly three decades that have followed. In that time, nearly 900 human infections have been detected. Of those people, roughly half have died.\n\nIn the current U.S. outbreak, one human case has been detected, a dairy farm worker in Texas whose sole symptom was conjunctivitis. It's widely believed there may have been other cases, but farmers have in many cases been unwilling to cooperate with health authorities trying to investigate the outbreak and many of the workers have been wary of cooperating as well.\n\nSome scientists not involved in the research described the paper as interesting, but questioned whether one could conclude cows pose a mixing vessel risk based on these findings.\n\nMalik Peiris, chair of virology in the University of Hong Kong's School of Public Health, told STAT in an email that previous research has shown that cows are not highly susceptible to human flu viruses. Furthermore, it would be hard to see how a human flu virus could reach a cow's udder, which contains receptors for both avian and human flu viruses. \"Thus, I do not think the risk of human flu-H5N1 reassortment in cows is likely.\"\n\nAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon, Canada, agreed, noting that knowing which tissues a flu virus can attach to only tells part of the story. There are other factors, she said, that determine whether or not a virus can replicate in the cells it attaches to, triggering infection.\n\nThat said, Rasmussen, who studies animal diseases that can jump into people, is still worried about H5N1 in cows. To date, H5N1 infections have been confirmed in 36 herds in nine states.\n\n\"I'm more concerned about cow H5 evolving toward human-to-human transmission by jumping between different hosts (bird to cow to human, cow to bird to cat, cow to cat) as well as cow to cow. This selects for viruses that can infect, replicate efficiently, and shed enough to transmit onward in many different hosts, and increases the odds that it could do so in a human one,\" she wrote in an email.\n\n\"These data are confirmation to me that it is essential to get the cow outbreak under control, because there are many possibilities for a more transmissible human virus to emerge from it.\"\n\nThe Danish researchers took samples of stored tissues -- brain, respiratory tract, and mammary gland -- from a small number of cows and a calf. Some of the cows were dairy cows; others were beef cattle. They stained the tissue to see what receptors they had, whether they were for human or avian flu viruses, and among the latter whether they were the type best adapted for viruses that circulate among chickens or those that circulate in wild ducks. A spillover of virus from wild birds is believed to have started this outbreak in cows.\n\nThey found few receptors in the brain tissue they examined. \"What we found was that the influenza receptors were expressed in the neurons, but in a very low amount. So we also speculate that this could be the reason why there have not been found any neurological signs\" among infected cattle, said first author Charlotte Kristensen. Kristensen is defending her thesis this week and is set to begin postdoctoral research at the university, in the department of veterinary and animal sciences.\n\nA surprising finding was a lack of receptors in the ducts of the mammary glands, which the authors said argues against the notion that cows are becoming infected by what they call an \"ascending infection.\" The leading hypothesis for how this infection is spreading among cows is that when an infected cow enters a herd, small amounts of its H5N1-contaminated milk can remain on milking equipment, coming in contact with the teats of uninfected cows, who then become infected.\n\nPeiris, while agreeing the receptor pattern in the mammary ducts was surprising, said he still believes this route of infection is most likely, noting that there are reports that some cows only experience infection in some -- not all -- quarters of their udders. \"There is no other way to explain how one segment of the mammary gland is infected while others are unaffected,\" Peiris said.\n\nRasmussen agreed. \"These results are interesting and good to know. But I don't think they are sufficient evidence to rule out contaminated milking equipment or any other hypothetical transmission route. Especially respiratory,\" she wrote.", "source": {"uri": "statnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "STAT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helen_branswell@statnews.com", "name": "Helen Branswell", "type":

Then came word that barn cats -- half of them on one farm -- had died suddenly.\n\nWithin days, the Amarillo veterinarian was hearing about sick cows with unusual symptoms: high fevers, reluctance to eat and much less milk. Tests for typical illnesses came back negative.\n\nPetersen, who monitors more than 40,000 cattle on a dozen farms in the Texas Panhandle, collected samples from cats and cows and sent them to Dr. Drew Magstadt, a friend from college who now works at the veterinary diagnostic laboratory at Iowa State University.\n\nThe samples tested positive for a bird flu virus never before seen in cattle. It was the first proof that the bird flu, known as Type A H5N1, could infect cows.

Experts are confident the meat supply is safe By DEVI SHASTRI - AP Health Writer\n\nSo far, two people in the U.S. have been confirmed to be infected with H5N1, most recently a Texas dairy worker linked to the cattle outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two dozen people have been tested and about 100 people have been monitored since the virus appeared in cows, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a CDC respiratory diseases official, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nDaskalakis said CDC has seen no unusual flu trends in areas with infected cows, but some experts wonder if anecdotal reports of sick workers mean more than one person caught the virus from the animals.\n\nPetersen said some workers had symptoms consistent with flu: fever and body aches, stuffy nose or congestion. Some had conjunctivitis, the eye inflammation detected in the Texas dairy worker diagnosed with bird flu.\n\nDr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, has been taking samples from livestock and people on two Texas farms. On farms with confirmed cattle infections, there have also been reports of mild illnesses among the workers, he said.\n\nHis research has been difficult. Many workers are reluctant to be tested. That may be because they have limited access to health care or fear divulging private health information.\n\nWithout confirmation, no one knows if the sick workers were infected with the bird flu virus or something unrelated, Gray said.\n\n\"They seem to be linked in time and space, so one would say it's biologically plausible,\" said Gray.\n\nSome of the workers who fell ill sought treatment and were offered oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu, Petersen said.\n\nSome farm workers who were exposed to infected animals or people were offered the medication, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said. State health officials are responsible for evaluating and providing treatment, according to federal guidelines.\n\nHealth officials in Texas provided Tamiflu to the person known to be infected with H5N1 and family members, plus two people on a second dairy farm who were exposed to infected animals, said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said he wasn't sure if others had been offered the antiviral.\n\nFarmers have been hesitant to allow health officials onto their land, said Dr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who consulted about the outbreak with Petersen.\n\n\"This particular disease is looked at as a scarlet letter,\" Russo said. \"It has this stigma associated with it right now.\"\n\nRusso called for wider testing of cattle, people and milk.\n\n\"We do not know what we do not measure,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the horse left the barn and took off a lot faster than we were able to mobilize.\"\n\nGray worries that a recent federal order requiring testing of all lactating dairy cows moving between states could hinder cooperation even further. All labs that conduct tests must report positive results to the Agriculture Department. But many farmers may simply decide against testing, hoping to outlast the outbreak, he said.\n\nThe reluctance of workers and farmers to allow testing is \"greatly hampering\" understanding of how the virus spreads, how large the outbreak is now and how quickly it may grow, Gray said.\n\n\"It's a negative, very negative, effect,\" he said.\n\nPetersen said she understands workers' and farmers' fears. She praised the farmers who had been willing to let her gather the first samples that confirmed the outbreak and reflected on what the results could mean.\n\n\"You immediately think about the cows, the people that care for them and the families that have these farms,\" she said. \"You're thinking about the big picture, long term. Your mind starts to go down that entire path of concern.\"\n\nGetting dairy from farm to table is a complex process -- and farmers are adapting to get it there A different way to farm: Using

The company reported that it destroyed 3.6 percent of its total flock after discovering the virus.\n\nA person in Texas was also diagnosed with the bird flu, apparently contracting the disease from dairy cows in what was said to be the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of the virus from a mammal, according to the AP.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration provided an update on the virus on April 25, announcing that remnants of bird flu were found in about one in five recently tested samples, \"with a greater proportion of positive results coming from milk in areas with infected herds.\"\n\nIt said FDA testing \"did not detect any live, infectious virus,\" which reaffirmed the agency's assessment \"that the commercial milk supply is safe.\"\n\nThe virus seems to be primarily affecting raw dairy products, according to an update Wednesday, with the agency saying the results obtained thus far \"show that pasteurization is effective in inactivating\" the virus.\n\nThe FDA said it will continue to \"advise strongly against the consumption of raw milk and recommends that industry does not manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products.\"\n\nA USA Today article on Wednesday warned people who own chickens to take precautions because \"at-home chickens are far from safe.\"\n\nThese include avoiding unprotected contact with chickens that appear sick, avoiding contact with wild birds and properly cooking poultry and eggs, as doing so will kill the virus.\n\nAvian Enterprises, which specializes in bird repellant products, also stressed the importance of having a proper and secure enclosure for chickens to mitigate the risk of contact with infected birds.\n\nIf your chickens show any of these symptoms, immediately contact your local health authorities.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioned that birds infected with the virus might not show any symptoms.\n\nThe CDC advised that if any of the poultry in your flock have the bird flu, you should not touch sick or dead birds or anything they may have contaminated, you should wear the proper personal protection equipment, and you should avoid stirring up dust and bird feathers when trying to clean contaminated areas.\n\nThere are also concerns about pets.\n\nDr. Meghan Davis, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, spoke with Newsweek about ways that animal owners can mitigate the risk of their pets catching the disease.\n\n\"If you are someone who purchases raw milk for consumption at home, take great caution with pets and raw milk,\" Davis said. \"It's not recommended that anyone in the household consume raw milk products.\"\n\nDavis also advised farmers who own dogs to exercise caution, saying animals that live on farms are at the highest risk and their owners should keep them away from dairy cows or chickens.\n\nWhile the FDA and CDC noted there is no imminent cause for concern for the general public, all animal owners, especially those in rural areas, were advised to take the necessary precautions.\n\nProperly cooking your food, exercising proper hygiene and avoiding raw dairy products are the best ways to protect yourself from the bird flu, according to the agencies.\n\nWhen it comes to your animals, you are advised to keep a close eye on them, ensure their enclosures are secure and refrain from feeding them raw dairy products.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"},

He recalls there was a reluctance among farmers to cull their chickens because they weren't being compensated for them. Movement of infected birds to evade culling only served to disseminate the virus, which in the years since has spread to all continents except Australia.\n\nIt's important to keep that experience in mind, he told STAT Monday, as the H5N1 bird flu virus now spreads among dairy cattle in the U.S. Farrar stressed that the social context is key in responding to disease threats like H5N1, noting that a similar reluctance among dairy farmers to report outbreaks or allow testing of their workers is adding to the challenges in assessing how much transmission is occurring and the risk it poses to people.\n\n\"You can't just take the virus and the biological surveillance and divorce it from the environment and the social construct that it's happening in,\" Farrar said in an interview from WHO headquarters in Geneva. \"That's the reality.\"\n\nThough it is believed the virus has been spreading in dairy cow herds for months, to date the U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed only 36 infected herds in nine states. There have been no new outbreaks announced in the week since a federal rule went into effect requiring testing of a portion of the cows in a cattle shipment that is destined to cross state lines, if the cows are lactating. (The infections to date have been detected in lactating cows.)\n\nOn the human health side, there have been multiple anecdotal reports of farm workers who've been exposed to infected cattle suffering from conjunctivitis and other mild symptoms. But Todd Davis, acting chief of the virology, surveillance and diagnosis branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influenza division, told a WHO webinar on Monday that only about 30 people have been tested since the outbreak was first detected in late March. There has been one confirmed infection, in a farm worker from Texas who had conjunctivitis.\n\nBoth the USDA and the CDC have acknowledged that many farmers have been unwilling to allow testing of their animals or to permit public health officials to speak with or conduct testing on their workers. The industry is known to employ migrant and even sometimes undocumented workers, which perhaps explains the unwillingness of those workers to comply with public health efforts to study what is going on in these outbreaks.\n\n\"I know many people within that industry in the United States and other parts of the world are workers paid in a certain way, hourly or daily. They may be reluctant to report illnesses. It's an epidemic of a virus, but the social context it's happening in is just critical,\" Farrar said.\n\nIdeally, public health workers would have drawn blood samples from the Texas worker who tested positive for H5N1 and from people he worked with and lived with, to look for undetected cases that could suggest onward transmission of the virus. But he and the people he lived with refused to allow blood samples to be taken.\n\nWhile he believes the risk of a human flu pandemic triggered by the H5N1 virus is low, should it happen, the social context will also be crucial, Farrar continued. The mental toll of the taxing Covid-19 pandemic hangs over the public, health care workers, public health agencies, and governments. Getting people to again buy into measures that might slow spread, such as social distancing or school closures, would likely be tough, he said.\n\n\"The hangover is absolutely true across all societies, I think,\" Farrar said. \"Public health agencies but also health care workers around the world are shattered. ... It's a global phenomena and the world's willingness to either have vaccines, mRNA, or otherwise, and have any school closures, masks, whatever interventions you may talk about, would not be the same as they were back in 2020.\"\n\nAll the more reason, Farrar suggested, to take the actions needed to ensure the spread of bird flu in cows does not trigger a worse crisis. \"That makes the case that we better do what we can to avoid an event happening because I think the response would understandably be very different.\"", "source": {"uri": "statnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "STAT"},

Experts say there are key scientific and political reasons why the dairy industry was caught off guard by the H5N1 avian influenza virus -- and that understanding those factors will be vital to controlling the disease on dairy farms and preventing an outbreak in humans.\n\n\"The dairy industry has never had to deal with something like this before,\" says Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and a former dairy veterinarian. \"This is probably going to be the most important outbreak in my professional career.\"\n\nAfter weeks of uncertainty -- fueled by the unnerving revelation that the outbreak likely began last December and took months to recognize -- the federal government is taking some action. The USDA has mandated testing for lactating cows that are being transported across state lines in the hopes of squashing the spread of the virus, which has so far been confirmed in 36 herds across nine states. One human case has been reported this year, but the infection was mild, and more than a month has passed with no new cases confirmed. Epidemiologists have called for more human testing to better monitor the situation, however. Meanwhile Food and Drug Administration testing has shown that viral particles that were found in pasteurized milk were not infectious, suggesting little threat to consumers.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

And bird flu has been devastating poultry farms around the world for years now. Veterinarians and epidemiologists have been on high alert since 2022, when a new strain began tearing through wild birds and even mammals, killing or forcing U.S. farmers to cull some 90 million domestic birds. How could it take months to notice the same virus was spreading in dairy cows?\n\nOne reason the outbreak went undetected for so long is that people thought it was unlikely that the virus would jump into cows. Avian influenza is, after all, most common in birds, whereas flus in general have been rare in cows. \"The chances of it going from migratory birds to cows were so low,\" Poulsen says. \"And then it happened.\"\n\nDairy farmers typically worry about contagious bacterial mastitis, an infection of a cow's udder, or bovine viral diarrhea -- illnesses the industry is familiar with and knows how to treat. Avian influenza \"wasn't on our bingo cards for the year,\" says Emily Yeiser Stepp, an animal scientist and executive director of the National Dairy Farmers Assuring Responsible Management (FARM) Program. The program, which is housed within a lobbying group called the National Milk Producers Federation, acts as an on-farm social responsibility program for the dairy industry, a mission that includes promoting animal health.\n\nThe next challenge was connecting the dots to determine what was infecting the cows -- which was difficult because the symptoms of H5N1 in these animals weren't known in advance and aren't particularly distinctive. Sick cows weren't eating well and were producing less milk -- and the milk that they did produce was sometimes thick and yellow-hued. But none of these symptoms were particularly unusual, says Meghan Davis, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former dairy veterinarian.\n\n\"The number-one presenting complaint to call a vet out to your farm is: [your cow is] off feed, and you can't figure out why,\" Davis says. \"So it's not surprising to me that it took a minute to figure this out.\"\n\nMoreover, only about 10 percent of an affected dairy herd seems to get infected with H5N1. And cows aren't dying; they bounce back to health within a couple of weeks. \"Cows are like walking battle tanks,\" Poulsen says. But this is also a very different manifestation of avian influenza than that seen in domestic chickens: H5N1 can blaze through and devastate a flock in days, he adds. Wild mammals that have been infected with avian influenza display serious respiratory and even neurological symptoms such as seizures. In contrast, infected cows are tricky to spot. \"You need to look for it; it's not something very apparent,\" says Zelmar Rodriguez, a dairy veterinarian at Michigan State University, who has visited farms with H5N1-infected cows.\n\nBecause farmers didn't know they had avian influenza on their hands, the low impact of the disease made it easy for them to shrug off the infection. Once veterinarians pinned down H5N1 as the culprit, the situation became more serious because of the implications for human health. The complications of the dairy outbreak make containing it a challenge, however.\n\nScientists still aren't certain how avian influenza jumps between cows. Influenzas are typically considered respiratory diseases, yet cows seem to produce the most virus in their udders, so milking machinery could be carrying virus-laden droplets of milk from one cow to the next. Lactating cows can experience discomfort when they are not milked regularly, so all that's left for farmers to do is to try to increase safety measures in the milking process itself.\n\nAdding to the problem, the dairy industry moves tens of thousands of female cattle between states every week, Poulsen says, because the animals grow well as calves in hot, dry environments but produce more milk as mature cows in cooler regions. This movement of sick animals likely facilitated early spread between farms.\n\nThe USDA has already moved to address this spread: as of April 29, it is requiring that lactating cows test negative for H5N1 before they can cross state lines. Controlling the spread of avian influenza without stopping the complex system of cow movement is a crucial balance, Poulsen says. \"We can't just turn off milk production, and we can't turn off the supply chain of those cows,\" he says.\n\nTesting and other monitoring strategies need to be strengthened even for cows staying in one place, however. \"I think that we are a bit behind on the surveillance,\" Davis says. In particular, she says she'd like to see cows undergo serological testing, which looks for antibodies in blood that are tailored to a specific pathogen and can signify past exposure to that pathogen. She also notes that existing milk-monitoring systems set up for food safety may offer opportunities for better tracking of H5N1, given the virus's prevalence in milk. In addition, the same wastewater monitoring infrastructure that scientists developed to keep an eye on COVID is also offering insight on where avian influenza is striking dairy cows, as well as other animal infections.\n\nTackling avian influenza in dairy animals poses additional logistical complications. Compared with the poultry industry, the dairy industry is more fragmented, Davis says: the latter is made up of many independent farms rather than large, centralized companies that hire farmers on contract.\n\nAnother distinction between the industries is that the government has an indemnification system that reimburses poultry farmers for birds that are culled to keep the disease from spreading. By contrast, experts say that killing cows wouldn't help stem the dairy outbreak because of the animals' lower infection rate and milder symptoms. Yeiser Stepp isn't sure yet what financial strategy makes the most sense for the farmers who work with her. She's also a herd owner who has cows based in states that are not reporting H5N1 cases, and she says her biggest concern is about the fees for calling a vet out to the farm more regularly.\n\nRodriguez says that at present he thinks the priority needs to be strengthening biosecurity measures that can protect both cows and the humans who care for them. Existing recommendations hold that workers should be wearing gloves during the milking process, but doubling down on this guideline and adding additional personal protective equipment such as disposable coveralls, face shields, masks and goggles are important steps for keeping the virus out of humans. Currently, dairy workers are among the people who are most at risk of avian influenza, and many are disempowered migrant workers who face structural barriers to accessing health care. To determine what comes next, however, scientists need to pin down the outbreak's many lingering unknowns, such as how the virus is spreading and how long cows remain infectious. \"I think that biosecurity is the only thing that we can do right now, at least until we have more answers in terms of the dynamic of the virus,\" Rodriguez says.\n\nDespite the stumbles early in the response, Poulsen says, there's still time to put an end to the dairy outbreak before it becomes a bigger issue for the industry as a whole or for the general population. \"We have the best veterinarians and public health scientists in the world,\" he says. \"We can do it. We just need the funding and the political will.\"", "source": {"uri": "scientificamerican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scientific American"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meghan_bartels@scientificamerican.com", "name": "Meghan Bartels", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Culling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mastitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7c4d8ca5d3d6c4cd/original/GettyImages-1167749413.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541303", "eventUri": "eng-9541303", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 6123, "textEnd": 6131}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Namely, how far this H5N1 virus has spread, how it is spreading, and where this situation is likely to go next. The COVID-weary public also wants to know whether humans are at risk.\n\nPublic agencies must move faster and collaborate more efficiently to answer some of those unknowns. After all, this is a pathogen that has loomed large in the minds of infectious disease experts for its potential to cause a deadly human pandemic.\n\n\"It's fair to say for every question we've had answered in the last month, we have 10 to 15 new questions,\" says Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy in Minnesota.\n\nAmong the most essential: Just how widespread is this outbreak?\n\nThe seriousness of the situation escalated after scientists found viral fragments in milk on grocery store shelves -- including in states that had not reported infected herds. The Food and Drug Administration eventually said it had detected H5N1 fragments in one out of every five of the commercial milk samples it tested.\n\nThat suggests the virus has been circulating in cows longer and more easily than anyone realized. Genetic sleuths have traced the outbreak back to a likely spillover event in late 2023, when a wild bird may have infected a cow on a farm.\n\nWidespread testing is essential to understanding the outbreak's true scope -- and to have any hope of containing it. But that's easier said than done. Consider that tens of thousands of cows are being moved around the country any given week, says Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"We can't test them all, so we need to test where it's going to be logistically easy to accomplish.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture recently said cows could not be moved between states without a negative H5N1 test and expanded the amount of testing it will pay for. But the agency is still only requiring farms to test a few dozen cows out of each group, an approach that is not sufficient to stop the spread.\n\nPaulsen and others are working on methods to test bulk milk, but need to ensure they are sensitive enough to pick up even one infected cow out of a pool of milk from as many as two thousand. Because even asymptomatic cows seem to be shedding so much virus in their milk, he thinks that's feasible.\n\nWhich leads us to another seemingly simple, yet still elusive question: How exactly is the virus spreading among cows?\n\nOn a recent call with state public health officials, USDA Chief Veterinary Officer Rosemary Sifford noted that transmission is mostly occurring within cows who are lactating, but it's unclear if the spread primarily is happening through the milking process itself or because a cow with a high viral load in its milk is passing it onto others. The USDA has said that anything that comes in contact with milk, whether that's a human, another animal, a vehicle or fomites, could spread the virus and that it's likely occurring in more than one way.\n\nSo far, the virus really seems to be largely in the mammary glands, though the USDA has found evidence of the virus in the respiratory tract of one cow. The agency is currently conducting transmission studies in cattle that could inform mitigation efforts.\n\nOf course, everyone is wondering what the coming weeks and months will look like -- for herds, for our food supply, for other livestock and, of course, for humans.\n\nTo help answer that, attention should focus on the Texas panhandle, where the outbreak was first detected. Those herds might provide important clues about what the coming months could look like. \"Maybe the simplest question is: When a herd 'recovers,' what does it mean?,\" says Richard Webby, a specialist in influenza at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis.\n\nWe need to know whether cows generate sufficient immunity to ward off another infection, how long that immunity might last, and how widespread that immunity might be. That will mean looking for antibodies to the virus in herds around the country, regardless of whether there was a known outbreak there. Clarity on immunity will help shape future mitigation and monitoring efforts.\n\nWhich leads us to the questions most relevant to the general public: Am I safe?\n\nLet's start with the food supply. The FDA's tests have shown that pasteurized milk is safe to drink. (Raw milk, on the other hand, should be absolutely avoided.) And the USDA, which maintains the meat supply is safe, nevertheless is currently conducting tests of both ground beef on grocery shelves and at processing facilities to understand whether evidence of the virus exists there, too. The agency is also looking at what happens to meat infected in a lab and then cooked at different temperatures.\n\nThen there's the worry of infection. Osterholm, who has been following H5N1 for nearly three decades now, reiterates that despite this new twist of widespread infections in cows, the risk to humans remains low. But \"that should not leave us complacent,\" he says. \"All can change in a heartbeat.\"\n\nSome scientists are working behind the scenes to prepare in case the virus adapts to infect humans. So far, the same antivirals used for the seasonal flu, such as Tamiflu, seem likely to work against H5N1. Meanwhile, two vaccine candidates against H5N1 seem somewhat effective against viral samples taken from infected cows, and enough raw materials exist to make limited doses if needed.\n\nBut the caveats are many. For example, our flu treatments aren't great to begin with -- to be effective, they must be taken within a very short window of developing symptoms. And there's reason to worry that our existing vaccines might be far less helpful if the virus adapted to infect people. Researchers are working on newer antivirals and vaccine strategies, but those efforts are nascent and wouldn't do much for us if the situation suddenly took a more serious turn.\n\nIt's important to keep pushing for answers and transparency. The stakes are too high to let the questions keep piling up.\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

But the two groups can't agree on how to treat the problem.\n\nThough the current strain of the bird flu currently poses a low risk to humans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wants to study the outbreak. Many farmers, however, don't want the federal government on their property. And some state officials are pushing back -- the Texas Department of State Health Services, where the bird flu was first detected, says they haven't invited the CDC down because they haven't found a dairy farmer who wants these officials on their land.\n\nThe debate is grounded in traditional friction over questions of federal overreach, but there's also a distinct political component as red state officials lead the resistance to CDC involvement.\n\nTo understand more about the situation on the ground with the bird flu and the political implications of the CDC's attempts to respond, Nightly spoke with Meredith Lee Hill, a food and agriculture policy reporter for POLITICO who -- along with colleagues David Lim and Marcia Brown -- explored the contours of some of these debates in a piece earlier today. This conversation has been edited.\n\nHow serious is this outbreak of the bird flu?\n\nThe current outbreak currently poses a low risk to humans. But this is the kind of virus that health officials worry could spiral into a pandemic similar to Covid-19 if it ends up being more transmissible to humans and the federal government doesn't quickly get their hands around the situation.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns is how much the federal government doesn't know about the virus that's spreading through U.S. dairy herds, with one confirmed human case in a Texas dairy worker. It's a new situation that federal officials are still trying to figure out, and they're struggling to gather key information about the virus and whether it's likely to spread to more humans.\n\nOne major concern raised by Louisiana's agriculture commissioner Mike Strain, who is also a veterinarian, is that recent studies show the virus has been present in U.S. dairy herds for more than four months.\n\nStrain told me the high level of virus presence in dairy herds and the length of time it's been spreading makes him worry that the current strain could mutate and \"become more likely to move between humans, not just from an animal, from a cow or poultry to humans, but within the human population.\"\n\nWhy don't we know for sure how many people have contracted it?\n\nHuge challenges remain for the federal government and states to track dairy farmworkers and others who've had contact with infected cattle. But at this point, the U.S. just isn't testing enough people to really get a full picture of the current outbreak.\n\nWe do know that at least 30 people have been tested since the bird flu virus was first detected in dairy cows in Texas in March and at least 220 people \"have been monitored for [the virus] after relevant exposures,\" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThere's also some frustration among scientists that federal officials have declined to answer questions about where in the country the monitored workers are, saying only that officials are \"following the herd\" of infected cows.\n\nCan you explain the tension between the states and the CDC over how to respond? Why wouldn't they work closely together to respond to the outbreak?\n\nThe CDC is locked in a power struggle with key states and agriculture players as it tries to better track the virus and prevent another potential pandemic, as we reported this morning.\n\nDairy farmers are extremely wary of their farms being identified as infected. A significant number of farmworkers are also undocumented migrants who are harder for public health officials to reach.\n\nHealth officials are flying a bit blind as they try to track and trace all the possible exposures.\n\nAs POLITICO first reported, CDC officials have raised the prospect of sending federal teams to farms to monitor the health of farmworkers and collect other data, including with a survey.\n\nBut on recent conference calls with all 50 state agriculture chiefs and veterinarians, blue and red state officials strongly pushed back on the CDC suggestion, citing concerns about biosecurity on farms and reluctance among farmers to allow federal officials onto their property.\n\nState agriculture chiefs told us they want to keep state and local public health officials as the main contact to farmers, and then send information to the CDC. The agency is now trying to find a middle ground.\n\nAside from the federal-state conflicts here, is there a political dimension to this?\n\nWe've heard from some state officials who are concerned that the Agriculture Department is not getting enough say in the process of tracking the outbreaks on farms, as the CDC and White House increase their oversight of the federal response. So there are intra-government tensions playing out as well.\n\nBut in red states in particular, there is generally a deep mistrust of federal health officials among elected officials and farmers -- including in Texas, which is the epicenter of the current outbreak.\n\nTexas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller called the CDC proposal \"overreach\" and said it should \"back off.\"\n\nThe former rodeo cowboy is a possible pick to lead the USDA if former President Donald Trump wins the presidential election.\n\nHow scared should we be about the future of bird flu?\n\nAgain, the risk to the general public is low. I think people are generally comforted by the fact that there has only been one confirmed human case so far, but given the lag in testing, health experts say it's possible that number is higher. It's important for people to understand what the federal government knows so far about the virus, and what it doesn't, which is still a significant amount.\n\nWelcome to POLITICO Nightly.

Going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" Merchan said as he found Trump had violated the gag for a 10th time.\n\nTrump looked directly at Merchan as he announced the finding and delivered the strong caution. Merchan also discussed some of the complexities of putting Trump in jail, while saying he would do that if Trump's defiance continues.\n\nSIGNED IN SHARPIE -- Prosecutor Chris Conroy today attempted to undercut the idea that former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg was acting on his own to approve hush-money-related reimbursement payments to Michael Cohen. Conroy got former Trump Organization accountant Deborah Tarasoff to acknowledge that Trump was the ultimate approver when he signed a check.\n\n\"If he didn't want to sign it, he wouldn't sign it.\" Sometimes he instead wrote \"VOID\" on a check with his trademark Sharpie pen. \"It was signed in Sharpie in black, and that's what he uses,\" Tarasoff said.\n\nCASH QUESTIONS -- Jeff McConney -- a former Trump Organization executive -- walked jurors through back-of-the-envelope math he and former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg used to determine how much money Michael Cohen should be reimbursed for the Stormy Daniels hush money payment. While the amount Cohen sent to Daniels' lawyer was $130,000, the executives settled on a much larger amount: $420,000.\n\nThat covered Cohen for any taxes he'd have to pay for the supposed income, and it also included other considerations, like a bonus that Cohen said he was owed.\n\n-- Bernie Sanders set to seek reelection this fall: Bernie Sanders will seek a fourth term in the Senate this fall, a move putting the best-known Senate progressive on track to win another six years in the chamber. The 82-year-old Vermont independent and two-time presidential candidate is currently at the peak of his power in Congress, chairing the Senate's top health care committee and working to push the Democratic Party to the left. Sanders caucuses with the Democrats and serves on Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's leadership team, but will run as an independent yet again.\n\n-- Russia detains U.S. soldier on charges of theft: The Russian government detained a U.S. soldier last week on charges of theft, according to a U.S. official. The soldier, a staff sergeant who is stationed in South Korea, was arrested last Thursday, said the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive incident. The soldier had traveled to Russia to meet a woman, possibly his girlfriend, the official said. The State Department is in touch with the Russian government about the case, the official said, adding that the soldier has been given a pretrial detention until July 1.\n\n-- House GOP set to vote on initiating Garland contempt proceedings next week: House Republicans are escalating their standoff with the Justice Department as they demand the audio of former special counsel Robert Hur's interview with President Joe Biden. The Judiciary Committee will vote on May 16 on recommending Attorney General Merrick Garland be held in contempt of Congress, a person familiar confirmed to POLITICO. Though the committee action next week will initiate contempt proceedings, it still needs to pass the full House before a referral is made to the DOJ.\n\nDOG TALE -- Kristi Noem's story about killing her dog made headlines across America. But it wasn't news to people who worked on her first book, where the tale made it into a draft of the memoir before the publishing team nixed it, POLITICO reports. Then, as now, Noem wanted the story in because it showed a decisive person who was unwilling to be bound by namby-pamby niceties, while others on the team -- which included agents, editors and publicists at Hachette Book Group's prestige Twelve imprint, and a ghostwriter -- saw it as a bad-taste anecdote that would hurt her brand. The tale was ultimately cut, according to two people involved with the project.\n\nSWING STATE SURPRISE -- Milwaukee's election leader has been ousted by the mayor in a surprise move that comes just six months before Wisconsin's largest city will be in the spotlight in the presidential swing state, reports the Associated Press. Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson announced today that he would be replacing Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall with her deputy, Paulina Gutierrez. The change has nothing to do with how Woodall ran elections, but instead had to do with \"other issues internal to the election commission office and to city government that raised concern,\" said the mayor's spokesperson Jeff Fleming. He declined to say what those issues were.\n\nDUNCAN ON TRUMP -- Georgia's former Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, once a rising star in state politics, announced today that he is voting for Joe Biden in the 2024 election.\n\n\"Yes, elections are a binary choice. Yes, serious questions linger about President Biden's ability to serve until the age of 86. His progressive policies aren't to conservatives' liking. But the GOP will never rebuild until we move on from the Trump era, leaving conservative (but not angry) Republicans like me no choice but to pull the lever for Biden. At the same time, we should work to elect GOP congressional majorities to block his second-term legislative agenda and provide a check and balance. The alternative is another term of Trump, a man who has disqualified himself through his conduct and his character,\" Duncan wrote in an op-ed for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nCEASEFIRE OR NOT -- Hamas reportedly accepted a Gaza cease-fire proposal, but it's \"far from\" the deal Israel wants, Israeli officials said.\n\nThat's POLITICO's National Security Daily's main takeaway from this whirlwind of an afternoon, which began when several reporters began tweeting that Hamas agreed to a deal brokered by Egypt and Qatar. For weeks, Israel has been waiting for Hamas to agree to its version of a deal that would see dozens of hostages released in exchange for a temporary cease-fire.\n\nBut the possibility that an agreement would be made was soon shot down. The deal offered by Hamas was a \"softened\" or \"one-sided\" Egyptian version, according to Israeli media.\n\nFrom what it sounds like, there are at least two proposals on the table, neither of which Israel and Hamas agree on. The militant group has repeatedly said it wants a permanent cease-fire as part of a hostage deal -- a concession Israel has been entirely unwilling to make as it pledges to root out Hamas militants in Gaza.\n\n\"Even though the Hamas proposal is far from Israel's basic requirements, Israel will send a delegation of mediators to exhaust the possibility of reaching an agreement under conditions acceptable to Israel,\" the Israeli prime minister's office said in a statement.\n\nSpeaking with reporters this afternoon, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said CIA Director Bill Burns is in the region \"literally working on this right now. I don't want to put a timetable on it, but it's something that is a top priority for everyone in this administration from the president on down,\" Miller said.\n\nTHE BIGGEST NIGHT IN FASHION -- This evening, as celebrities from around the world strut the red carpet before attending the Met Gala inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Vogue's editor-in-chief Anna Wintour will raise an absurd amount of money for the Met and their Costume Institute -- last year the event clocked in at $22 million. But the public exhibitions that the Gala supports, put on by the Costume Institute, have been less successful in recent years, despite all that cash coming in to fund them. In the 2010s, the Costume Institute's head curator Andrew Bolton managed to put on three of the Met's most attended exhibitions ever. But problems have begun to arise, with flagging attendance culminating in a decision by the Met's leadership this year to change Wintour and Bolton's plan for their show this year. All of this fashion insider information might not be obvious when you watch celebrities arrive tonight. But behind the meticulously produced show, there's increasing tensions between the Met and some of its most famous patrons and board members.

Is avian influenza threat? We answer your questions.", "body": "DENVER -- The bird flu has arrived in Colorado, and while it doesn't represent anywhere near the threat that COVID-19 did at the beginning of the pandemic, people should take some precautions with animals that could carry it, experts say.\n\nThe Denver Post compiled the latest information on H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza, the bird flu virus that has jumped to cows in at least nine states -- including Colorado -- and has infected a small number of people.\n\nWhile the virus at this point is only a threat to people who work with animals, scientists are concerned that it could mutate enough to spread between people, possibly sparking another pandemic.\n\nIf you want more in-depth information, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Colorado Department of Agriculture will hold a virtual town hall on avian flu at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday at tiny.cc/birdfluwebinar.\n\nHow widespread is the virus in Colorado?\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza had reached a dairy cow herd in northeast Colorado as of late April. The state also is investigating a second herd, but hasn't released any information while waiting for testing results.\n\nCows typically don't get influenza A viruses, the family that includes H5N1, so it was a shock to find they were infected, said Jenna Guthmiller, an assistant professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus\n\nAt least 36 herds across nine states have tested positive, but without routine testing, the virus could be spreading undetected in others.\n\nOver the last two years, some Colorado poultry operations have had to cull their birds (killing and properly disposing of all members of an infected flock to avoid spreading the virus to other farms), and the state health department has found infected wild birds or mammals in more than half of Colorado's counties. You can reasonably assume that birds in your county also are carrying the virus, even if testing hasn't found it.\n\nRight now, the country doesn't have a clear picture of how widely the virus has spread, particularly among cattle and people who work with them, Guthmiller said. Cows often have mild symptoms and may be able to spread the virus even if they're asymptomatic, she said.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denver_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Denver Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Department_of_Public_Health_and_Environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschutz_Medical_Campus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anschutz Medical Campus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Culling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microbiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asymptomatic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28849/2884972.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541303", "eventUri": "eng-9541303", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Professor Geoghegan explains what this means for New Zealand, its wildlife and potential human-to-human transmission.\n\nH5N1, a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (or bird flu), recently made the jump into dairy cows, infecting multiple farms across the United States. By examining the virus' genome from cows and other hosts such as birds, scientists believe the virus may be transmitting from cow to cow. If this is the case, it makes it a lot more likely the virus could also transmit from person to person because cows and humans are mammals. That hasn't happened yet, and it might not. But every time the virus gets into a mammal, it gives it an opportunity to evolve and get better at infecting mammals. This is something scientists, including Te Niwha experts, are closely monitoring.\n\nUnlike the Covid-19 pandemic, we can't close our borders to infected wildlife. But we can be better prepared for when the virus does arrive. Bird flu has changed dramatically over the last few years. The virus can now infect a much broader host range, and therefore spread across a larger geographical range than was previously thought. So we need to adapt our surveillance systems. We need to get better at spotting then stopping the virus from spreading further. In a recently funded Te Niwha project, my colleagues and I are working on trying to better understand virus transmission among birds in New Zealand. We are also working on ways we can use rapid environmental testing to improve our early warning system.\n\nNew Zealand is home to many bird species that are found nowhere else in the world. But over 80 percent of them are already endangered. This highly pathogenic virus has killed millions of birds around the world. If, or when, this virus arrives in New Zealand, it will be devastating for our native birds.\n\nThe signs of H5N1 vary but the most obvious one is several dead birds or other wildlife species. Signs could be milder, including those related to the nervous system such as lack of coordination and involuntary movement. If you see sick or dying wildlife, do not touch them. They should be reported immediately to Biosecurity New Zealand (0800 80 99 66), which regularly investigates instances of disease.\n\nThe Department of Conservation are using vaccines in a trial with the aim of protecting our most vulnerable species against bird flu to prevent species extinction.

It's why scientists are unsettled by the U.S. dairy cattle outbreak", "body": "Twenty-seven years ago today, a 3-year-old boy in Hong Kong developed a sore throat, spiked a fever, and started to cough. Six days later, he was hospitalized; six days after that, he died of acute respiratory distress caused by viral pneumonia. Testing showed the toddler, who'd had contact with sick chickens before becoming ill, had been infected with H5N1 bird flu.\n\nHis death was the first attributed to a bird flu virus, and since then, dozens more young children across a number of countries have died from this bird flu virus, H5N1. In fact, in the weeks that followed the boy's death, 17 other children in Hong Kong contracted the virus and five more died. It was a tragedy -- and a profound shock for the scientists who studied influenza.\n\nUntil 1997, it was thought avian flu viruses didn't infect people very often, and when they did, at most they caused exceedingly mild disease. That was what was seen when scientists experimentally infected human volunteers with three different bird flu viruses -- not H5N1 -- about 35 years ago.\n\nThe Hong Kong outbreak was the first time the H5N1 virus pulled off the unexpected, rewriting the textbooks that sometimes over-confidently stated what the myriad versions of influenza A viruses found in wild birds and other species could and could not do. But it wouldn't be the last time. In the nearly three decades since, flu scientists have tracked this virus with both vigilance and dread, watching it defy dogma again and again, learning through hard experience that it is a foe not to be underestimated.\n\nMost scientists that STAT has spoken to since the H5N1 outbreak in cattle in the United States was confirmed are unsettled by the notion that the virus is spreading in mammals with which humans have close contact. \"That's a different ball game altogether,\" said Malik Peiris, chair of virology at the University of Hong Kong's School of Public Health. \"That hadn't happened in Asia all this time.\"\n\nNancy Cox, who for years headed the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said this particular lineage of H5N1, a descendent of a virus first spotted in a goose in China's Guangdong province in 1996, is unlike any other family of flu viruses she recalls.\n\n\"It seems that these viruses must have some kind of 'special sauce' that has allowed them to find ways to persistently spread, evolve, and cause what appear to be increasingly serious problems in both wildlife and domesticated animals,\" Cox, who is now retired, told STAT in an email. \"There is an element of unexpected robustness and malleability that has surprised even seasoned influenza watchers.\"\n\nOne such is Peiris, who has been closely tracking H5N1 since its first known foray into people. A few years later, in December 2002, he was planning to travel home to Sri Lanka for Christmas, as he did every year. Then wild water birds -- ducks, egrets, herons, and the like -- started dying in two waterfowl reserves in the city. The cause: H5N1.\n\nThat too was startling. Wild birds had only been seen to be seriously sickened by bird flu viruses once before, in 1961. And ducks, the natural hosts of bird flu viruses, were thought to be more or less impervious to disease caused by them, said Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist in the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nFlu viruses don't attack the respiratory tracts of ducks and other wild water birds, as they do in people. In these birds, the viruses infect cells in the gut, passing through them before being excreted in their droppings. The birds don't get visibly ill, the textbooks said. Until they did.\n\n\"All these species, they were falling over dead,\" Peiris said in a recent interview. \"I missed Christmas. ... I stayed in Hong Kong and was swabbing birds.\"\n\nNecropsies -- the name for an animal autopsy -- showed a surprising pattern of disseminated disease atypical of previous observations of bird flu, and dramatically different from what is seen in human flu infection. This unusual finding of H5N1's ability to spread outside the lungs, to organs like the liver and the brain, has been seen again and again over the intervening years -- in laboratory studies of Kuiken conducted in cats and necropsies of foxes, skunks, mink, and other mammals found to have died of H5N1 infection. It was also reported in a human case, a boy from Vietnam who died in 2004.\n\nIn the spring of 2005, the phenomenon Peiris helped to record in the parks of Hong Kong happened on a much larger scale in a migratory bird reserve in Western China known as Qinghai Lake. Between April and June of that year, there was a large-scale die-off of wild birds there, again traced to H5N1.\n\nA little avian flu background is helpful here. Two groups of bird flu viruses -- those bearing H5 or H7 hemagglutinin proteins on their exteriors -- can transition from being of low pathogenicity to being highly pathogenic when the viruses spread in domestic poultry. (The term highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI, refers to how the virus behaves in poultry.) Seeing highly pathogenic, or high-path, viruses move back into wild birds in a big way raised serious concerns that wild birds could transmit the virus further and faster than was already occurring via the movement of infected poultry across Southeast Asia.\n\n\"We published on it and we warned -- because this is a migrating center -- that this could be spreading far and wide,\" Peiris said. Some scientists took a more sanguine view, spouting an aphorism that was heard often in 2005: Dead birds don't fly. Apparently infected birds do, however. \"Really, within a year it was in India and Egypt and Africa and Central Asia,\" Peiris said.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since the Qinghai Lake incident, H5N1 viruses have made their way around the globe, even to perhaps the most unlikely spot of all, Antarctica, infecting penguins and other wild birds there. Only Australia and New Zealand have yet to find H5N1 at this point.\n\nAnother area in which H5 has rewritten the textbooks relates to what Cox referred to, the virus' astonishing persistence. The former CDC flu director went back through influenza literature -- back to reports of \"fowl plague,\" as avian flu outbreaks in poultry used to be called in the 1800s and early 1900s, before influenza viruses were first identified -- to see how long outbreaks lasted.\n\nOnce high-path viruses emerged in poultry, the outbreaks they triggered tended to burn themselves out within a few years, especially when infected birds were culled to try to stop spread. But since reemerging in Hong Kong in late 2002, H5N1 has never really gone away. At some points it has been more headline grabbing than others -- with the recent discovery that it can infect cows, for instance. (\"Who would have thought cows would get infected? And in this way?\" Peiris exclaimed.) But it has never disappeared.\n\n\"I'm not aware of another ... avian flu virus that's been circulating at this global scale for this long,\" said Jeremy Farrar, the World Health Organization's chief scientist. \"That's unprecedented.\"\n\nCox agreed. \"While it wasn't exactly scientific dogma that [high-path] avian viruses would eventually burn themselves out or fade away, it was clear from the history of past outbreaks that this is what happened for the majority of our well-documented outbreaks,\" she said.\n\nInitially H5N1 was a problem in Southeast and then South Asia, later moving into the Nile River Delta of Egypt and Turkey, then into Europe. But for more than a decade, this highly problematic virus was not found in the Americas, which seemed to support another piece of flu dogma: Flu viruses found in birds that traveled in the migratory flyways that spanned Eurasia did not make their way to the flyways of the Americas. The oft-repeated claim was that the routes flown by migratory birds would keep H5 from crossing to the New World.\n\n\"Pretty sure I might have said something similar,\" admitted Richard Webby, director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals, at St. Jude Children's Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nAnd then, that \"never the twain shall meet\" situation turned out to be wishful thinking. In late 2014 and early 2015, H5N2 and H5N8 viruses -- equally dangerous half siblings of H5N1 from Asia, bearing the same H5 hemagglutinin -- were found in poultry operations in multiple U.S. states. And then in late 2021, H5N1 itself was found in poultry and wild birds in Newfoundland, Canada's easternmost province. So much for the non-intersection of the flyways.\n\n\"By and large, that's true -- the gene pools in migratory birds are distinct,\" Peiris said. \"But looking back, there were some clues of the mixture of viruses at the individual gene level, that reassortment was occasionally taking place.\" (Reassortment is a process by which different flu viruses swap genes within a host, creating hybrids, like H5N2 or H5N8.)\n\nFrom eastern Canada, H5N1 has worked its way through the Americas, infecting two men in the United States, a young girl in Ecuador and a man in Chile in the past couple of years. It has also ignited large poultry outbreaks, and infected and killed an astonishing array of mammals -- seals and sea lions, various types of bears, coyotes, bobcats, mountain lions, raccoons, and otters among them.\n\nSome of these species have previously been seen to be susceptible to influenza, such as seals. But the scale of the toll the virus is taking on wildlife is unlike anything previously attributed to an influenza virus.\n\nIt's believed H5N1 may be spreading mammal to mammal in some of the marine species, though this is hard to prove, Kuiken said. It's clear that it is moving cow-to-cow in the U.S. dairy cattle outbreak -- likely with human help. The dairy cow outbreak has uncovered a fact that had been seen before but not widely noted -- mammary glands are susceptible to flu viruses. The previous such observation occurred in relation to the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, when some infected women complained of mastitis. Canadian scientists infected ferret pups with H1N1 and allowed them to nurse; their mothers developed infection in their mammary glands.\n\nIt is not knowable whether H5N1 will ever acquire the capacity to easily infect people and spread person-to-person -- in other words, trigger a pandemic. But ongoing transmission in a mammalian species gives the virus a chance to adapt to hosts that are far closer, genetically, to humans than are ducks or chickens. No one who has watched this virus thinks letting H5 get seeded into cow populations is a good idea.\n\nAdding to the complexity of this situation is that unlike its behavior in other species it infects, H5N1 isn't making cows seriously ill. It makes the virus harder to track, and gives farmers less impetus to cooperate with authorities trying to determine how far the virus has spread.\n\n\"The latest curveball with [high-path] H5 infection in dairy cattle is very concerning because there is little incentive to test dairy cows or their human contacts,\" Cox said. \"One can see so many potential problems on dairy farms. There are the asymptomatic infections in cows and perhaps people. There are the cows, the dogs, and the cats, and the other farm animals including perhaps pigs, the farm workers, and the family members and so on. It is going to be very challenging to get a clear picture of what is actually happening in anything like real time.\"\n\nIn the nearly three decades of human interaction with H5N1, the virus has taught us a lot about influenza viruses, consigning many things that were previously considered flu facts to the scientific trash bin. Kuiken said in the early 2000s he would give talks about H5N1 with the title \"Breaking Rules.\" He eventually stopped, he said, \"because this lineage broke so many.\"\n\nAll those information resets should have taught us an important and overarching lesson, flu experts say. We should never assume we know everything this virus can do.\n\n\"We absolutely should be hoping for the best, but planning for the possibility that this is going to be able to transmit human to human, and has the potential of becoming a pandemic virus,\" said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Arizona who has been working with an international team of scientists to try to figure out when the cow outbreak started. \"It's much too early to sit back and say, 'Well, it hasn't happened yet, so it's not going to happen.'\"", "source": {"uri": "statnews.com",

Even more, 36 cattle herds in nine states, and one human, tested positive for bird flu since late March, leading the FDA to test dairy products for the virus.\n\nAccording to the FDA's most recent update, the agency conducted tests on 297 pasteurized retail dairy products from 38 states after previous findings showed that fragments of the virus got into the commercial milk supply. The FDA deemed commercial milk safe, and went a step further to test powdered infant and toddler formulas for the virus, reporting no evidence of the bird flu in the products as well.\n\nMeet the expert: Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security\n\nAhead, we break down the foods that are safe to eat during the bird flu outbreak, and what to avoid.\n\n\"Bird flu\" is a colloquial term for avian influenza, which refers to influenza viruses that naturally circulate in avian species, says Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nAt this point in time, there is no evidence that the circulating strain of the bird flu, called H5N1, spreads easily from person to person. The spread of bird flu viruses from one infected person to a close contact is very rare, and when it has happened, it has not led to continued spread among people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nHistorically, humans can contract avian influenza from animals, says Dr. Adalja. \"In fact, the 1918 influenza pandemic virus was an avian influenza virus,\" he notes. Most current cases of bird flu in humans are clustered in individuals who have close contact with infected poultry, though one case has been linked to infected cattle, he adds.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that the person's case was mild and reported eye redness (consistent with conjunctivitis), as their only symptom. No hospitalizations or deaths have been reported as of press time.\n\nStill, the risk to the general public remains low, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told NBC.\n\nThe FDA made clear that the tests showed that the products didn't contain a live virus that could make people sick. In their findings, the FDA determined that in dairy products including cottage cheese and sour cream, in addition to fluid milk, pasteurization was effective in inactivating the virus and these products are safe to eat.\n\nAll dairy products are safe to consume with the exception of dairy that is not pasteurized, says Dr. Adalja. He also notes that \"beef is completely safe to eat.\"\n\nPer the FDA report, the following products are safe to eat and enjoy:\n\nThe new preliminary results \"affirm the safety of the U.S. commercial milk supply,\" Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said during the briefing. He also shared that the latest findings confirm that the pasteurization process inactivates the virus, making the previously infected dairy products unable to infect people. While the FDA tested raw milk for live virus, the agency strongly advises against drinking unpasteurized, raw milk.\n\nAvian influenza is only the newest reason not to partake in unpasteurized dairy products as there are scores of potentially dangerous pathogens present in \"raw\" or unpasteurized milk products, adds Dr. Adalja.\n\nExperts say that foregoing unpasteurized products is key to avoiding bird flu.

The next day, the Colorado Department of Agriculture said the affected dairy cows were located in the northeastern part of the state. The state veterinarian's office received a notification on April 22 about a herd with clinical signs consistent with highly pathogenic avian flu in cattle.\n\nSamples submitted to the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory tested presumptive positive on April 24 and were confirmed by the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratory the following day.\n\nOn May 1, Colorado's agricultural commission and the CDA agriculture commissioner approved an emergency rule to limit the spread of the virus. Colorado has 106 dairies and about 200,000 dairy cows.\n\nAt today's town meeting, Maggie Baldwin, DVM, Colorado's state veterinarian, said investigators are still assessing how the Colorado cows were exposed to the virus. \"We're still putting the puzzle pieces together.\"\n\nShe added that whole-genome sequencing will help tell the story, adding that the state's farmers have been very helpful. \"The goal in getting an answer is stopping additional spread,\" she said.\n\nBaldwin said there are still several unknowns, including the length of the incubation period in cattle, the mechanism of transmission, how long the animals shed the virus, and whether H5N1 poses a risk to nonlactating cattle or other livestock species.\n\nRachel Herlihy, MD, MPH, deputy chief medical officer and chief epidemiologist at the Colorado Department of Public Health, said the overall risk to humans remains low, but it depends on exposure. She said about 70 farm workers have been monitored in Colorado, and none have had symptoms.\n\nRegarding wastewater monitoring, she said Colorado does have a pilot program and officials have not seen any overall rise in flu markers over the past few weeks.\n\nIn other developments, APHIS reported a few more detections in other mammals. They include five red foxes with samples collected on April 24 from Ionia County, Michigan, an area where H5N1 has been reported in dairy cows.\n\nAlso, the virus was found in two samples collected on April 21 and April 22 from a pair of opossums in Ionia County.\n\nAPHIS also reported the virus in a red fox from Onondaga County, New York.\n\nIn research developments, a team led by Kansas State University scientists yesterday reported that pigs are highly susceptible to the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b avian flu virus that struck mink farms in Spain in 2022.\n\nThe virus is different from the B3.13 genotype currently spreading in US dairy cows, but it raised concerns because there was clear evidence of mink-to-mink transmission. Also, researchers worry that the virus is becoming more adapted to mammals.\n\nWriting in Emerging Microbes and Infections, the group described its findings after experimentally infecting pigs with the mink virus. The pigs experienced pneumonia but shed limited amounts of the virus and didn't pass the virus to contact pigs.\n\nSequencing found low frequencies of mammalian-like mutations PB2-E627K and

On 25 March US officials reported H5N1 had been detected in cattle for the first time, which has since spread to cows in 36 herds in 9 states.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert on April 1 after a Texas farm worker tested positive for the virus, which he contracted after being exposed to infected dairy cattle.\n\nSo, should we be worried about it in Australia?\n\nStrains of avian influenza are either classified as \"high pathogenicity\" (HPAI) or \"low pathogenicity\" (LPAI) based on their clinical effect.\n\nMost avian influenza viruses are of low pathogenicity and commonly infect wild birds such as waterfowl (Anseriformes) and shorebirds, terns and gulls (Charadriiformes). But when viruses of the A (H5) and A (H7) subtype get into chickens they have the potential to mutate to become highly pathogenic.\n\nIn 1997 the HPAI H5N1 virus first emerged in poultry in Hong Kong, and again in China in 2003, and has predominantly remained a disease in chickens since.\n\n\"Wild birds very, very rarely carry HP virus around because, obviously, being highly pathogenic, it's got a significant disease impact to the infected birds,\" says Dr Frank Wong, a senior research scientist at the CSIRO's Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (ACDP) and the World Organization for Animal Health (WOHA) laboratory reference expert for avian influenza.\n\n\"his particular lineage [clade 2.3.4.4b] has been quite adaptable and able to infect many species of birds with unpredictable and varying impacts,\" says Wong.\n\nThis means when the virus infects wild migratory waterfowl it might be asymptomatic, and because the birds don't feel sick they are able to carry it over long distances.\n\n\"But when the virus infects other birds, it could also have quite a devastating impact in that the birds fall sick very rapidly and then you also get mass mortalities,\" says Wong.\n\nWong says there is significant concern about the virus impact on poultry production, but also its impact and implications to wildlife populations.\n\n\"H5N1 now presents an existential threat to the world's biodiversity,\" Dr Chris Walzer, Wildlife Conservation Society Executive Director of Health, told Cosmosin March.\n\n\"It has infected over 150 wild and domestic avian species around the globe as well as a dozens of mammalian species.\"\n\nOf the current outbreak in the US in dairy cattle, Wong says there is not a lot of evidence to suggest it's a respiratory infection, instead the virus is infecting the mammary glands.\n\n\"Given how dairy farms operate, obviously if there's high virus growth in the milk there is potential for quite substantial environmental contamination. And also, the milking or farming equipment being contaminated and then spreading from herd to herd.\"\n\nUS authorities say that pasteurisation is effective at inactivating HPAI and testing has not detected any live, infectious virus in the commercial milk supply.\n\nInstances of humans contracting the virus from infected animals are rare. According to the World Health Organization, from 2003 to 1 April 2024 there have been a total of 889 cases and 463 deaths - a 52% mortality rate - reported from 23 countries.\n\nOf these, 13 cases have been associated with clade 2.3.4.4b in 7 countries since January 2022 but no instances of human-to-human transmission have been identified.\n\nWong says that most of these infected cases in humans have been epidemiologically linked to confirm that they were close contacts of infected animals.\n\n\"Most of those cases were from those situations where people were dealing with an outbreak in either domestic or wild birds.\"\n\nWong adds: \"The advisory in the US and also in other countries, including Australia, is that when people are dealing with mortality events or a bird flu event, that only authorised persons are dealing with the sick and dead animals and those authorised people should be wearing PPE.\"\n\nThere is no way to prevent the strain from entering Australia through migratory wild birds.\n\nThus far, Australia has been able to avoid the virus because it is located outside of the migratory flyways of the wild birds that predominantly carry it.\n\n\"But given that this virus has now infected a very large number of different species to different impacts, there is that potential that there are bridging species that could bring the virus into Australia,\" says Wong.\n\n\"For example, Southeast Asia already has this virus ... it's pretty much close to our doorstep.\"\n\nIn December 2023, Australia's Chief Vet published an updated incursion risk assessment on the likelihood of entry and establishment of HPAI in Australia via wild birds found that there is: \"a high risk, with moderate uncertainty.\"\n\nThe authors write: \"It is expected that the likelihood and associated risk of incursions into Australia will continue to remain at these levels for some time and potentially increase rather than diminish given continued virus evolution.\"\n\nRelevant agencies are keeping up to date with regional and global circulation of the virus.\n\nThere is also a campaign to raise public awareness that unusual events should not be dealt with by members of the public. Instead, they are to be reported immediately so the animals can be properly diagnosed in a nominated state laboratory or the ACDP national reference laboratory.\n\nWong says that animal health labs have been coordinating with ACDP to ensure their diagnostic tests are able to pick up this lineage with good sensitivity.\n\n\"There is also a wild bird surveillance program that occurs in Australia, coordinated by Wildlife Health Australia with wild bird faecal sampling to survey for avian influenzas,\" he says.\n\n\"Anything that is positive from active surveillance that is detected by the state animal health labs is sent to us as the national reference lab for confirmation and also for full characterisation.\n\n\"When we do that, we're able to tell whether those viruses are local avian influenza viruses that occur naturally in our wild birds, or whether a sample that is picked up as positive was due to an introduced virus.\"", "source": {"uri": "cosmosmagazine.com", "dataType":

But there has virtually been no testing on farms, and health officials know little about who may be infected.\n\nEven as it has become increasingly clear that the bird flu outbreak on the nation's dairy farms began months earlier -- and is probably much more widespread -- than previously thought, federal authorities have emphasized that the virus poses little risk to humans.\n\nYet there is a group of people who are at high risk for infection: the estimated 100,000 men and women who work on those farms. There has been no widespread testing to see how many may be infected. No one has been vaccinated against bird flu.\n\nThat leaves the workers and their families vulnerable to a poorly tracked pathogen. And it poses broader public health risks. If the virus were to find its way into the wider population, experts say, dairy workers would be a likely route.\n\n\"We have no idea if this virus is going to evolve to become a pandemic strain, but we know today that farmworkers are being exposed, and we have good reasons to think that they are getting sick,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health.\n\nA majority of dairy farmworkers are Spanish-speaking immigrants, often undocumented, who may not have paid sick leave or be protected by occupational safety laws. They may lack access to medical providers, and their employers can be intolerant of absences.\n\n\"This sector of workers is not only at the very, very highest risk because they're having that direct, intimate contact with discharge, raw milk, with infected animals, but they're also at the very, very highest level of risk in terms of having no social safety net,\" said Elizabeth Strater, an organizer with United Farm Workers.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmworker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Farmworker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University_School_of_Public_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University School of Public Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Nuzzo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Nuzzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Farm_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Farm Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_safety_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social safety net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/09/multimedia/09farmworkers-01-tmzv/09farmworkers-01-tmzv-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541303", "eventUri": "eng-9541303", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Two people closely associated with farms have also caught it, but their cases are mild.\n\nHowever people have died in previous outbreaks where the virus was caught directly from chickens, rather than from other people. In a severe outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997, six people died of the 18 confirmed with H5N1. This was the first outbreak in humans. There have been others since, and the overall fatality rate has been about 50 percent.\n\nIt is possible that in order for the virus to adapt to human transmission, it has become less dangerous to us. But we do not know for sure, and it is enough to spark concern from scientists.\n\nOur government has an action plan for when or if H5N1 hits our shores, with the Ministry for Primary Industries, Health Ministry, the Department of Conservation and biosecurity authorities all working together.\n\nMPI chief veterinary officer Dr Mary van Andel tells The Detail they will be asking the public to watch out for dead birds (don't touch them) and to ring into the exotic pest and disease hotline which is 0800 80 99 66.\n\n\"We'll be asking people to keep an eye out for clinical signs in other animals, report those to their veterinarians, report those to the hotline. We'll be asking people to listen to public messaging, and do those things so that we can get the best path through this for New Zealand.\"\n\nShe says DoC is trying out vaccines on captive bird populations, but it is a tricky job - first you have to catch them, they need two doses a month apart, and the immunity doesn't last forever.\n\nAuthorities here are also in contact with colleagues in other countries that have been hit with mass-bird deaths, to get an understanding of the challenges of dealing with H5N1 and find out what needs to be in place to deal with an outbreak.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mink", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Detail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Detail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Primary_Industries_(New_Zealand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--VlRmOAD5--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1712986650/4KRS0EE_000_32XE2VW_jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541303", "eventUri": "eng-9541303", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

State agriculture officials worry the federal response is sidelining animal health experts at the Agriculture Department, and also that some potential federal interventions threaten to hinder state and local health officials rushing to respond to the outbreaks.\n\n\"It's overreach. They don't need to do that. They need to back off,\" Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, a former rodeo cowboy who is a possible pick to lead the USDA if former President Donald Trump wins the presidential election, said in an interview.\n\nTexas, the first state where the bird flu virus was detected, has not invited the CDC to conduct epidemiological field studies there, even though its health department is open to the research, because, \"We haven't found a dairy farm that is interested in participating,\" said Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\nThe resistance of dairy farmers is emblematic of the trust gap between key agriculture players in both red and blue states and federal health officials -- one that public health experts fear could hamper the nation's ability to head off the virus' threat to humans.\n\n\"The risk here of something going from one or two sporadic [human] cases to becoming something of international concern, it's not insignificant,\" CDC Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah said at a Council on Foreign Relations event earlier this week.\n\n\"We've all seen how a virus can spread around the globe before public health has even had a chance to get its shoes on,\" Shah added. \"That's a risk and one that we have to be mindful of.\"\n\nOn recent conference calls with all 50 state agriculture chiefs and veterinarians, Shah and other senior CDC officials have raised the prospect of sending federal teams to farms to monitor the health of farmworkers and collect other data, including with a survey, according to three state agriculture officials and two other people familiar with the conversation who were granted anonymity to discuss the private calls. State agriculture officials quickly voiced opposition, citing concerns about biosecurity on farms and reluctance among farmers to allow federal officials onto their property.\n\nDemocratic, as well as Republican, state officials shared those reservations, including that state and local health officials should continue to lead the response on the ground. Some have also pressed for USDA and its animal health experts to have more of a say in the process.\n\n\"Decouple it from an FDA and a CDC issue,\" said Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding. \"This is a workforce concern that really ought to be expressed from the USDA and Secretary [Tom] Vilsack.\"\n\nShah emphasized at the CFR event this week that USDA has been working \"shoulder to shoulder with us\" on the response effort. \"There has been no resistance on the part of our USDA colleagues from our efforts at CDC to get on the farms,\" Shah told POLITICO. USDA spokespeople say the department is working \"hand in glove\" with the CDC and states. The department's animal health experts have \"extensive experience and success\" in containing animal health diseases, USDA spokesperson Allan Rodriguez said.\n\n\"This situation is no different,\" Rodriguez added.\n\nCDC officials will continue trying to find a middle ground as they race to determine how the outbreak is spreading among dairy cows and whether it could spread widely in people and spur another pandemic. Though the odds are considered low, it's a scenario that public health systems say they are woefully unprepared to handle at this point. State officials say CDC has conveyed \"flexibility\" in the effort and has streamlined the survey.\n\n\"Discussions are underway with farms in multiple jurisdictions to participate in CDC-led epidemiological studies. In the meantime, states continue to test symptomatic farm workers and monitor those who have been exposed to infected animals,\" CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said in an email.\n\nIdaho is one of several states working on a shortened version of the CDC's lengthy questionnaire, with the goal of developing a uniform survey that can be administered nationally, said the state's epidemiologist, Dr. Christine Hahn.\n\n\"Bless their hearts, CDC wanted to know everything,\" Hahn said. \"The concern is that it is so lengthy and so detailed that you'll actually just get a lot of inaccurate answers.\"\n\nShe noted that the Idaho Dairymen's Association, which represents dairy farms in the state, has expressed willingness to participate in the survey if it can be trimmed down and administered off-site or over the telephone by the local health department.\n\n\"The dairies are considering it. Nothing's been decided, but they would prefer local health do that, not CDC or even us, which we totally are okay with,\" said Hahn, whose state has confirmed avian influenza in two dairy herds. \"I think the more local things can get done, the better. It strengthens those relationships.\"\n\nAt least 30 people have been tested since the bird flu virus was first detected in dairy cows in Texas in March, according to the CDC. The agency said Friday that at least 220 people \"have been monitored for [the virus] after relevant exposures.\" Federal officials have declined to answer questions from reporters about where in the country the monitored workers are, saying only that officials are \"following the herd\" of infected cows. But the White House and federal health agencies have repeatedly emphasized the risk to the general public remains low.\n\nAnecdotal stories suggest more people possibly contracted the virus than the one confirmed case of a Texas dairy farmworker, including other dairy workers in the state who have displayed symptoms. Antiviral medication for flu must be administered within days of symptom onset to be effective, meaning early detection is critical if more cases emerge. The infected Texas worker developed conjunctivitis or pink eye and fully recovered.\n\n\"One of the big open questions in my mind is whether there's only been one human case because we haven't surveyed widely enough or whether that is a true reflection of incidence,\" said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who was a founding associate director of the CDC's Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics.\n\nCDC officials are acutely aware of the gaps in the agency's early response to Covid-19 during the Trump administration, a misstep Biden officials are intent on averting just months before the 2024 election. The White House's new Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy has taken charge of coordinating work across the various federal agencies, meeting regularly with top officials and consulting outside experts in an effort to manage the risks facing livestock and humans alike.\n\nSenior pandemic preparedness officials recognize that bird flu represents the first true test for the fledgling office, aides said, especially amid skepticism from Trump and others who have questioned whether it needs to exist.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Jeff Zients has taken a personal interest in the bird flu response. Since taking over that role, the former Covid response czar has periodically stressed to officials that the administration must closely monitor public health threats, for fear of the damage another national crisis would do to the American psyche and Biden's political standing.\n\nStates typically invite the CDC to conduct field epidemiological studies, something few of the states where the virus has been detected have been willing to do.\n\nEven in states with good relationships between their agriculture departments and dairy farmers, state health officials are struggling to get the kind of access the CDC would need for its research.\n\nIn one state with infected dairy cows, a senior health official granted anonymity to speak candidly about the state's work said health staff have been able to get on-site to provide information about what symptoms people should be looking for, but little else.\n\nOne type of research the CDC wants to conduct is testing that can detect if any workers previously were infected with avian flu, according to Shah. But that research -- known as serological testing -- requires a blood test, and thus the participation of both farmers and workers.\n\nA big reason for the resistance: Farms don't want to be identified publicly as potential hotspots for the virus, nor do they want to draw scrutiny to their workers, a significant proportion of whom are undocumented immigrants and fearful of government officials.\n\nGiven that reality, state agriculture officials have specifically pushed for any interviews with farmworkers to be voluntary and conducted off the farms at a different site.\n\n\"We have had conversations with CDC,\" said Dr. Justin Smith, Kansas' animal health commissioner. \"We're willing and the dairies are willing to work through our local public health [offices], there's been a relationship built there.\"\n\n\"Having CDC show up with a response team is very intimidating to the workers,\" Smith added. \"And it's intimidating to the dairies.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Although there is no evidence of human-to-human spread yet, the mortality rate among those infected through contact with animals remains high. Over the past 15 months, WHO has documented 889 human cases across 23 countries, resulting in 463 deaths, equating to a mortality rate of 52 %\n\nCentral government in India maintains that Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), commonly known as Bird Flu, was first detected in India in the state of Maharashtra in February 2006. Since then, the country has experienced annual outbreaks of HPAI in different regions, leading to substantial economic losses. The disease has been reported in 24 states and union territories, resulting in the culling of over 9 million birds to control its spread. India's approach to controlling HPAI follows a \"detect and cull\" policy as outlined in the National Action Plan for Prevention, Control, and Containment of Avian Influenza (revised - 2021). This comprehensive response includes the humane destruction of infected and exposed animals, eggs, feed, litter, and other contaminated materials. Additionally, measures such as restricting the movement of poultry and poultry products, disinfection and clean-up of infected premises, and a Post-Operative Surveillance Plan (POSP) have been implemented. It's important to note that vaccination against HPAI is not permitted in India. The Central Government has maintained that with the long-term use of vaccination either the disease has become endemic and therefore widespread, or the infection in affected animals is too difficult to detect. Accordingly, the Government of India does not permit use of any vaccine against Avian Influenza in the country.\n\nAn article titled, 'Bird flu in US cows where will it end'' in Nature on May 8, 2024, notes that various forms of the H5N1 virus have been circulating since the 1990s. A particularly deadly variant that was first detected in 1996 has killed millions of birds and has been found in numerous mammalian species, including seals and mink. But until now, cows were not among the virus's known hosts. US officials first announced on 25 March that H5N1 had been found in cattle, and cows from 36 herds in 9 states have tested positive as of 7 May. Tests of pasteurized milk have found no living virus. But the virus's increasing ubiquity has made scientists uneasy. It adds further that from a human perspective, cows might be one of the worst possible animal reservoirs for influenza because of their sheer number and the degree to which humans interact with them. Culling poultry has curbed previous bird flu outbreaks, that isn't a viable option for cattle. The animals are too valuable and, unlike birds, don't seem to die from the infection.\n\nData released by the Central Government notes that India, is the third-largest producer of eggs (129.60 billion) and the fifth-largest producer of poultry meat (4.47 million tonnes) globally and in the fiscal year 2022-23, it made significant strides in the global market, exporting a notable 664,753.46 metric tons of poultry products, with a total worth of Rs. 1,081.62 crores (134.04 Million USD) to over 57 countries. According to a recent market intelligence study, the Indian poultry market achieved a remarkable valuation of USD 30.46 billion in 2023 with a CAGR of 8.1% from 2024-2032.\n\nRead Comments", "source":

During an hour-long webinar Wednesday morning State Veterinarian Dr. Maggie Baldwin noted the affected herd was \"in the northeast corner of our state,\" but the Colorado Department of Agriculture declined to say in what county the infection was found.\n\nColorado is the ninth state in which HPAI has been found in dairy cattle. Baldwin said nobody yet knows for sure how the virus has migrated from birds to cattle, but said viral \"spillover\" isn't uncommon. In the wild, for instance, HPAI has been found in skunks, foxes and other mammals, but the April 24 discovery is the first in Colorado among domesticated animals.\n\n\"It has not been detected in any other livestock species,\" Baldwin said. \"We don't know of any concern for beef cattle or other species (of livestock.)\"\n\nSymptoms can include a drop in milk production, loss of appetite, changes in manure consistency, thickened or colostrum-like milk and low-grade fever. Infected cows seem to recover completely after supportive care.\n\nWith fair and livestock show season just around the corner, Baldwin said the U.S. Department of Agriculture hasn't issued guidance yet, but hopes to have some definitive answers soon.\n\n\"We will get information out as quickly as possible but ask people to be patient with us as we work on that,\" she said. \"We don't know what the mechanism of transmission in dairy cattle is, but (there are) a lot of really great people working on studying that to give us a better idea of that.\"\n\nThe virus was first detected in March in dairy herds in Texas and Kansas. By late April the virus had showed up in North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, South Dakota, Colorado, New Mexico and Idaho. The nine-state outbreak in prompted the USDA to issue strict guidelines on April 29 on the movement of dairy cows, especially across state lines. According to that directive, prior to interstate movement, lactating dairy cattle will be required to receive a negative result of testing for influenza type A virus, as performed by an approved National Animal Health Laboratory Network laboratory.\n\nThe federal order can be read in detail at the CDOA's website ag.colorado.gov/HPAIcattle. The website also contains detailed information on maintaining biosecurity in dairy herds.\n\nDr. Rachel Herlihy, the state epidemiologist for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said the risk of spread to humans is low, but could depend on how much a person is exposed to the virus. She said one person was confirmed with HPAI in Colorado in 2022 and another more recently in Texas. Both cases were very mild, Herlihy said, which indicates that the virus has not yet adapted for human-to-human transmission.\n\nWhile the virus does show up in an infected cow's milk, there is no danger to human transmission. Herlihy said pasteurization continues to be effective in killing virus and bacteria in milk.\n\nHPAI has been a concern for several years but mostly among commercial and back-yard poultry flocks. Millions of commercial birds have had to be destroyed because of outbreaks on poultry farms. The virus is easily transmitted among birds of all types, though some that carry the disease show no symptoms from it. So far HPAI has showed up in 48 states on 1,129 properties and has killed more than 10,000 snow geese, 2,200 Canada geese and 150 raptors and avian scavengers.", "source": {"uri":

Dead birds lay along the stretch of shoreline. She'd spent years of her life traveling to viral hot spots in remote corners of the globe to gather samples for her research. Now, as Hill watched her team moving grimly among the carnage, methodically collecting blood samples, she felt profoundly vulnerable. The virus had arrived in her own backyard. And it suddenly felt unstoppable.\n\n\"Am I going to be the next case of a bird to mammalian spillover event?\" Hill, an ecologist who studies how diseases jump between animals, recalls thinking. \"The odds are low, but your imagination will take you there. It's not out of the question.\"\n\nHill knows better than most. She is among a small army of researchers racing to gather crucial data amid an unprecedented outbreak of H5N1, a highly contagious form of bird flu, to find answers to questions many of us would prefer not to consider. Among them: If bird flu can rage unchecked across the globe and adapts itself to infect cats, skunks, cows, and seals, if it can get into our milk supply, then why are human infections so rare? And what might it take for that to change?\n\nAnswering those questions has become more urgent in the last few weeks. Since arriving on the Atlantic Coast via migratory birds in late 2021, the virus has killed tens of thousands of wild birds and hundreds of seals. The scope of the pandemic on Massachusetts beaches, Hill said, is far worse than at any time since its arrival. In April, scientists discovered it had jumped to cows and made its way into the nation's milk supply. Chillingly, scientists at the University of Arizona recently said the spillover into cows likely occurred in December and the virus has been quietly spreading unchecked through the nation's livestock farms since.\n\nPublic health officials have downplayed the immediate threat to human health, noting human infections are rare and viral fragments found in milk have likely been inactivated by pasteurization. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention closely followed more than 6,000 people who had been exposed to the virus between 2022 and 2023; only one was infected.\n\nBut some local epidemiologists are sounding alarms. Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, founding director of the Boston University Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases, is among a growing chorus of disease experts who warn the federal government is moving too slowly. As of last week, only 25 people in the entire country had been tested for the virus, federal health officials said at a briefing -- an effort Bhadelia said is far too anemic given the shape-shifting superpowers of the virus and the consequences of it adapting to human-to-human transmission.\n\n\"We have a small window, and we're not taking advantage of it by increasing our testing to get a true understanding of how widespread this virus is,\" Bhadelia said. \"We have to figure out how it's transmitting, how it's evolving, and stop the transmission so we don't get to a position where we have to think about how we do a broader response for this in humans. We're not doing enough.\"\n\nThe growing list of mammals known to have contracted the virus, she said, should serve as a warning.\n\nSince 1996, when H5N1 was first identified in waterfowl in China, the virus has spread to the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and the United States and infected more than 48 mammal species including tigers, leopards, domestic cats and dogs, minks, pigs, seals, donkeys, horses, and cows.\n\nThough human cases are extremely rare, they can be lethal: Of 887 confirmed human cases since 1996, more than half the people -- 463 -- died. To date, there has been no observed human-to-human transmission, a viral feature that would be necessary to spark a global human pandemic. But the apparent infection of a farm worker in Texas through contact with a cow last month -- the first known case of a mammal infecting a human -- takes it one step closer.\n\nInfected birds are known to have the virus in their saliva and feces, and most previous cases of human infection are believed to have occurred when individuals got the virus on their hands and then touched their eyes, nose, or mouth. The virus can also be inhaled when airborne.\n\nThe good news is that scientists such as Hill and her collaborators, Wendy Puryear and Jonathan Runstadler, virologists at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, have developed and refined powerful tools to foster collaboration and avert calamity.\n\nTo better understand the phenomenon of spillover, to document how the virus is changing, and to track its global progression, they have spent the last decade compiling vast libraries of genetic samples from dead and infected animals, uploading them to shared databases. The most widely used database, GISAID, contains more than 188,333 genetic sequences associated with more than 31,095 individual viral samples.\n\n\"We monitor these sequences for specific, known mutations that are linked to adaptation or a high likelihood of spillover in mammals,\" Hill said.\n\nWhen novel mutations are discovered, said Hill, scientists at labs around the world inject the sequences into mice, ferrets, ducks, and other lab animals and document the impact. Are the viruses deadlier? Does the mutation shift the impact from a gastrointestinal to respiratory transmission? Scientists have not determined how the virus is spreading among cows, though some speculate milking machinery is somehow \"aerosolizing\" the virus, allowing it to spread through droplets in the air.\n\nAndy Pekosz, a virologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies influenza, said he and others are closely watching for mutations in key areas that are needed for spillover into humans.\n\nFirst, H5N1 would likely need to better glom onto receptors on the surface of human cells, which differ from those found in birds, so that it can inject its DNA into human cells.\n\nSecondly, the avian virus in its current form has difficulty commandeering the cellular machinery needed to reproduce itself once it gets inside humans cells.\n\nBody temperature is another important obstacle. Birds, Pekosz notes, \"run hot,\" with an average body temperature of 102 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. The upper respiratory tract of humans is around 91.5 degrees Fahrenheit. That small difference can have a big impact on the ability of the virus to replicate.\n\n\"We have evidence from lots of different infections of mammals that each of these three things can change,\" if the correct mutations occur in the viral DNA, Pekosz said. \"Fortunately, we haven't seen all three of those things change at the same time.\"\n\nBU's Bhadelia worries federal officials aren't doing enough to prevent a mutation from getting a foothold in humans. One reason there is less spillover into humans than into other mammal species, she suggests, may be that other mammals are much more likely to come into contact with infected birds than humans. Now that the virus appears to be endemic on American farms, that will probably no longer be the case.\n\nBhadelia said widespread testing is needed both for farm animals and dairy and farm workers. Others have suggested farm workers should be equipped with eye goggles, masks, and other protective gear.\n\nThe USDA, Bhadelia notes, is attempting to strike a delicate balance between protecting the agricultural industry and maintaining trust with farm owners to ensure access to continued monitoring, and the larger public health threat. But that caution may come at a cost. Each new infection in a human host represents an opportunity for the virus to potentially gain new mutations that better optimize it for survival in its new home.\n\n\"If I were a betting person,\" she said. \"I would guess that there are already other farm workers who may have been infected.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors":

So biologists were highly concerned when a dolphin with the bird flu died in Florida.\n\nThe infected dolphin was trapped between a dock and a seawall in the Big Bend region in March 2022. By the time wildlife officials arrived, it had died. They later found that it was infected with bird flu. The discovery -- the first known case of a dolphin contracting bird flu in U.S. waters -- sent a jolt of concern through wildlife officials.\n\nBird flu is highly contagious and deadly to many animals. If the virus, which can wipe out swaths of both bird and mammal populations, were to spread among dolphins, whales and manatees, it could be \"catastrophic for these populations,\" a recent paper published by the University of Florida and other institutions said.\n\nNow, the new paper is bringing some clarity, offering clues as to how the dolphin may have contracted the virus. To better understand the virus and suss out how the dolphin may have contracted it, the UF team sent tissue samples to an enhanced laboratory at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n\"We wanted to find out, OK, why would this dolphin come down with this?\" said Michael Walsh, a veterinarian working with the aquatic animal health program at the University of Florida, and one of the authors on the study.\n\nHere's a look at what they found.\n\nBiologists were stumped with what they discovered inside the skull of a young male bottlenose dolphin that had died. When University of Florida veterinarians later performed a necropsy, they found inflammation of the dolphin's brain and meninges (membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord).\n\nThe inflammation stemmed from a highly pathogenic variant of bird flu. It was the first known case of bird flu in dolphins in U.S. waters, and only the second known diagnosis in the world.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the virus and its variants can cripple the poultry industry and fuel widespread mortality in wild birds, especially raptors such as eagles, owls, and vultures that might scavenge or prey upon infected animals.\n\nThe disease also can jump to mammals, either through the respiratory system, or when carnivorous such as foxes or mink eat infected birds.\n\nDolphins barely interact with birds. What wildlife officials didn't know when they retrieved the dolphin in Big Bend, was that bird flu was rapidly spreading globally, and had hit the Gulf Coast.\n\n\"We had no idea there were birds dying on the coast when we picked up the dolphin,\" Walsh said. He and his team later worked with bird researchers to connect the dots.\n\nAt the time of the dolphin's death in March 2022, the virus was new to North America. The first bird flu detected occurred on a farm in Newfoundland, Canada, in December 2021, according to the New York Times.\n\nSince then, it has spread aggressively. By January 2022, the virus was detected in wild birds in the Carolinas.\n\nThe Big Bend dolphin died in March, and that summer, the virus had jumped to mammals elsewhere, killing hundreds of gray and harbor seals along the coast of Maine. Was the Florida infection connected to a larger, possibly deadly outbreak?\n\nAfter the UF team sent tissue samples to a lab, genetic analysis there showed that the dolphin's bird flu strain was the same strain that was circulated along the Atlantic and Mississippi flyways -- the routes that migratory birds take -- during the spring of 2022. The Atlantic flyway passes over the area where the dolphin died.\n\nThe study then compared the dolphin's strain to the variant responsible for the outbreak in seals in the Northeast and found them to be different. Also, genome sequencing revealed that the dolphin's virus lacked markers normally associated with mammals passing on the virus.\n\nIn other words, the infection had not traveled down the east coast among mammals -- a good sign.\n\nWhat about local birds?\n\nThere were coastal bird die-offs from bird flu along the Big Bend area, but genetic testing revealed they were driven by a different strain of the virus.\n\nA bird migrating along the Atlantic flyway might have been the source of the dolphins infection. But how? Dolphins don't eat birds.\n\nWalsh theorizes that the dolphin may have played with an infected bird.\n\n\"He was a young male. And it's quite possible when they're bored they're playing, they're investigating things. He may have come upon a bird that was sick and carrying the virus,\" Walsh said.\n\n\"He probably mouthed it. They wouldn't tend to eat it. But they might push it around and play with it. He may have been exposed to feces. Those things could have caused transfer.\" Walsh also said that if the bird was still breathing, the virus could have entered the dolphin's blow hole.\n\nSince 2022, the virus has continued to spread in North, Central and South America, in both birds and mammals.\n\nLast year, the virus killed 24,000 sea lions along the coast of Chile and Peru before spreading south the the Antarctic region where it is now infecting elephant seals.\n\nThe virus can make people sick.\n\nThere have only been two cases of humans contracting the virus in the U.S.\n\nIn 2022, a person with direct exposure to poultry being culled for the disease tested positive. They had fatigue for a few days and recovered.\n\nThe most recent case occurred in Texas in April, when a person working with cattle that were presumed to be infected tested positive. Their only symptom was conjunctivitis.\n\nSymptoms can range from mild (eye infection, upper respiratory symptoms) to severe illness (pneumonia).\n\nBird flu-related deaths have occurred in other countries.\n\nAccording to the CDC, \"people with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.\"\n\nThe CDC says the health risk to humans is relatively low because human-to-human transmission isn't sustainable for the virus.\n\nNo other bird flu has been detected in Florida waters in either dolphins or manatees since the young male dolphin's death, so he appears to have been a one-off, a victim of his own curiosity.\n\nBut the report emphasized that there seems to be no end in sight to the global spread of bird flu, and there is still much that is unknown about how the virus may evolve and affect marine mammals in the future.\n\nWalsh said that wildlife officials have a better understanding now of how the virus made its way to a Florida mammal, and \"we'll have all this in the bank if something else happens.\"\n\n\"We were all very concerned by where this could have gone,\" he said. \"And very fortunate it didn't give us a long-term die-off in our area.\"", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com",

The U.S. needs real-time tracking of livestock movements", "body": "The presence of H5N1 avian influenza virus, better known as bird flu, among dairy cows in Texas -- the second largest producer of dairy cattle -- was first confirmed in late March. By then, H5N1 had likely been circulating among dairy cows for months. Six weeks later, the nine states responsible for more than one-quarter of U.S. dairy production, which accounts for 3.5% of the U.S.'s gross domestic product, had each reported H5N1 cases in dairy cows and continue to do so.\n\nMany questions remain open about the transmission of H5N1 among dairy cows and about the possibility of the virus adapting to transmit among humans. Even with the best possible outcomes, this outbreak reveals the precipice on which the U.S. rests with respect to livestock diseases.\n\nIn the event of an infectious disease outbreak in livestock, even one that does not directly threaten human health, the costs can be catastrophic. The production of animal products (milk, other dairy products, eggs, and meat) can decrease drastically. Other costs can come from the control efforts or trade bans and loss of consumer demand. Twenty years ago, a single case of \"mad cow disease\" caused U.S. beef exports to plummet by more than $2.5 billion, and domestic prices fell by 16%.\n\nNews of the spread of avian influenza among U.S. dairy cows in late April led cattle futures to fall sharply at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the largest U.S. exchange for cattle futures). And Colombia, which buys $43 million in beef annually from the U.S., has restricted beef imports, even though no evidence has yet been found of the virus in beef cattle.\n\nManaging diseases in livestock in a country the size of the U.S. is a huge challenge due to the frequent and extensive movement of animals across the nation. That means local animal disease problems quickly become national. In the ongoing H5N1 outbreak, cattle were moved from a farm in Texas, where infected animals had been detected in March, to farms in Ohio and Michigan that tested positive in early April for a very similar strain of the virus. This suggests that direct cattle-to-cattle transmission is occurring, and implicates animal movements in the large-scale diffusion of the virus.\n\nNational-scale movement of farm animals as they transition through the production cycle is a key component of this highly specialized industry and is unlikely to change. In the U.S., beef cattle might be born in one place, raised and fattened in another, then killed and butchered in another. The U.S. livestock industry is geographically dispersed and intensely connected: 60% of cattle born in a year cross state borders, with particular concentrations in the Plains states. This has been brought about by regional differences in livestock productivity and by economies of scale, which make it more cost-effective to ship live animals than shipping animal feed.\n\nThe U.S. has one of the most intense livestock industries in the world, primarily due to the aggregation of production over the last 50 years and the presence of large markets and mega-scale animal feedlots that are unique to the U.S. When animal movements are disseminating infection, there is a particularly high risk of infection reaching premises with lots of traffic.\n\nLivestock markets act much as airports do for humans: they bring together animals (sometimes of multiple species) coming from many different farms, creating opportunities for contact between infected and susceptible animals before being sold and dispersed to other far-flung farms. Feedlots, facilities at which animals are fattened before slaughter or before being returned to the same or different dairy farms for stronger milk production, can also act as hubs for propagating infection.\n\nIn response to the evolving H5N1 outbreak, the USDA has placed additional influenza-testing requirements on interstate movements of dairy cows. However, the limited information available about livestock movement indicates that the movements of most cattle (dairy or beef) from or to markets occur within states. While the USDA strategy is essential in limiting the geographical diffusion of H5N1, the disease could be moving long distances within states without detection.\n\nGiven the integral role that livestock movement currently plays in U.S. agriculture, and the potential for animal movements to create pathways for the spread of pathogens, understanding the volume and structure of livestock movements across the U.S. is crucial to the success of the nation's infectious disease management efforts. Unfortunately, livestock movements in the U.S. are only partially characterized and, in many states, only when animals cross state lines. But this information comes from veterinary inspection certificates that lack a uniform format. While this approach to tracking the movements of livestock animals aids the response to diseases, it lacks the speed and resolution required for most outbreaks, and it will not move forward the country's preparedness in anticipation of the next livestock disease emergency.\n\nWhat is needed instead is a national view of the U.S. livestock industry that incorporates the vast degree of livestock movement that occurs within the industry. This would ideally be powered by a real-time animal identification and tracking system, where the movements of individual animals are prospectively recorded from birth to slaughter as they change ownership and location. Such \"animal passport systems\" exist throughout the European Union and the U.K.\n\nIn the U.S., a national animal identification and tracking system has been controversial due to concerns of infringement of property and private rights of individuals, the potential cost, and the exposure of business strategies crucial to market competitiveness. But states such as Michigan and Minnesota, motivated by the threat of bovine tuberculosis, and Montana and Wyoming, plagued by chronic outbreaks of brucellosis, have implemented cattle identification and tracking systems, setting examples for a successful national system. While the establishment of these state-level animal identification programs faced some opposition from producers, the keys to their successes have included a cost-effective system, the mandatory nature of the program, and clear communication and education about the benefits of animal identification for both disease management and production management.\n\nThe use of animal tracking data in veterinary epidemiology and mathematical models would be crucial to U.S. preparedness and response to the inevitable future outbreak of an emerging livestock disease. In addition to improving animal health management, animal identification and tracking would also retain and increase export market access (currently out of reach due to unmet animal-tracking regulations), food safety assurances, and producer profitability by improved production efficiency and increased access to information.\n\nInformation provided by animal identification and tracking would make it possible to estimate the scope of a potential outbreak and plan outbreak mitigation and control strategies. Driven by data on animal demographics and movement as well as disease-specific parameters, epidemiological modeling studies could help target and hone these plans to allow maximum business continuity and minimum use of resources.\n\nThe benefits of collecting animal-movement data in real-time include evaluating the potential of an epidemic to spread, designing optimal surveillance programs and control strategies, accurate quantification of ongoing disease threats, and short- and long-term analysis of policies that may affect agricultural business practices. Each of these can help minimize the risk of the next livestock disease emergency, avoiding colossal economic and food losses, ameliorating animal welfare impacts, and mitigating the potential emergence of highly virulent strains with pandemic potential into human populations.", "source": {"uri": "statnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "STAT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They need to back off,\" Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, a former rodeo cowboy who is a possible pick to lead the USDA if former President Donald Trump wins the presidential election, said in an interview.\n\nTexas, the first state where the bird flu virus was detected, has not invited the CDC to conduct epidemiological field studies there, even though its health department is open to the research, because, \"We haven't found a dairy farm that is interested in participating,\" said Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\nThe resistance of dairy farmers is emblematic of the trust gap between key agriculture players in both red and blue states and federal health officials -- one that public health experts fear could hamper the nation's ability to head off the virus' threat to humans.\n\n\"The risk here of something going from one or two sporadic [human] cases to becoming something of international concern, it's not insignificant,\" CDC Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah said at a Council on Foreign Relations event earlier this week.\n\n\"We've all seen how a virus can spread around the globe before public health has even had a chance to get its shoes on,\" Shah added. \"That's a risk and one that we have to be mindful of.\"\n\nOn recent conference calls with all 50 state agriculture chiefs and veterinarians, Shah and other senior CDC officials have raised the prospect of sending federal teams to farms to monitor the health of farmworkers and collect other data, including with a survey, according to three state agriculture officials and two other people familiar with the conversation who were granted anonymity to discuss the private calls. State agriculture officials quickly voiced opposition, citing concerns about biosecurity on farms and reluctance among farmers to allow federal officials onto their property.\n\nDemocratic, as well as Republican, state officials shared those reservations, including that state and local health officials should continue to lead the response on the ground. Some have also pressed for USDA and its animal health experts to have more of a say in the process.\n\n\"Decouple it from an FDA and a CDC issue,\" said Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding. \"This is a workforce concern that really ought to be expressed from the USDA and Secretary [Tom] Vilsack.\"\n\nShah emphasized at the CFR event this week that USDA has been working \"shoulder to shoulder with us\" on the response effort. \"There has been no resistance on the part of our USDA colleagues from our efforts at CDC to get on the farms,\" Shah told POLITICO. USDA spokespeople say the department is working \"hand in glove\" with the CDC and states. The department's animal health experts have \"extensive experience and success\" in containing animal health diseases, USDA spokesperson Allan Rodriguez said.\n\n\"This situation is no different,\" Rodriguez added.\n\nCDC officials will continue trying to find a middle ground as they race to determine how the outbreak is spreading among dairy cows and whether it could spread widely in people and spur another pandemic. Though the odds are considered low, it's a scenario that public health systems say they are woefully unprepared to handle at this point. State officials say CDC has conveyed \"flexibility\" in the effort and has streamlined the survey.\n\n\"Discussions are underway with farms in multiple jurisdictions to participate in CDC-led epidemiological studies. In the meantime, states continue to test symptomatic farm workers and monitor those who have been exposed to infected animals,\" CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said in an email.\n\nIdaho is one of several states working on a shortened version of the CDC's lengthy questionnaire, with the goal of developing a uniform survey that can be administered nationally, said the state's epidemiologist, Dr. Christine Hahn.\n\n\"Bless their hearts, CDC wanted to know everything,\" Hahn said. \"The concern is that it is so lengthy and so detailed that you'll actually just get a lot of inaccurate answers.\"\n\nShe noted that the Idaho Dairymen's Association, which represents dairy farms in the state, has expressed willingness to participate in the survey if it can be trimmed down and administered off-site or over the telephone by the local health department.\n\n\"The dairies are considering it. Nothing's been decided, but they would prefer local health do that, not CDC or even us, which we totally are okay with,\" said Hahn, whose state has confirmed avian influenza in two dairy herds. \"I think the more local things can get done, the better. It strengthens those relationships.\"\n\nAt least 30 people have been tested since the bird flu virus was first detected in dairy cows in Texas in March, according to the CDC. The agency said Friday that at least 220 people \"have been monitored for [the virus] after relevant exposures.\" Federal officials have declined to answer questions from reporters about where in the country the monitored workers are, saying only that officials are \"following the herd\" of infected cows. But the White House and federal health agencies have repeatedly emphasized the risk to the general public remains low.\n\nAnecdotal stories suggest more people possibly contracted the virus than the one confirmed case of a Texas dairy farmworker, including other dairy workers in the state who have displayed symptoms. Antiviral medication for flu must be administered within days of symptom onset to be effective, meaning early detection is critical if more cases emerge. The infected Texas worker developed conjunctivitis or pink eye and fully recovered.\n\n\"One of the big open questions in my mind is whether there's only been one human case because we haven't surveyed widely enough or whether that is a true reflection of incidence,\" said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who was a founding associate director of the CDC's Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics.\n\nCDC officials are acutely aware of the gaps in the agency's early response to Covid-19 during the Trump administration, a misstep Biden officials are intent on averting just months before the 2024 election. The White House's new Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy has taken charge of coordinating work across the various federal agencies, meeting regularly with top officials and consulting outside experts in an effort to manage the risks facing livestock and humans alike.\n\nSenior pandemic preparedness officials recognize that bird flu represents the first true test for the fledgling office, aides said, especially amid skepticism from Trump and others who have questioned whether it needs to exist.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Jeff Zients has taken a personal interest in the bird flu response. Since taking over that role, the former Covid response czar has periodically stressed to officials that the administration must closely monitor public health threats, for fear of the damage another national crisis would do to the American psyche and Biden's political standing.\n\nStates typically invite the CDC to conduct field epidemiological studies, something few of the states where the virus has been detected have been willing to do.\n\nEven in states with good relationships between their agriculture departments and dairy farmers, state health officials are struggling to get the kind of access the CDC would need for its research.\n\nIn one state with infected dairy cows, a senior health official granted anonymity to speak candidly about the state's work said health staff have been able to get on-site to provide information about what symptoms people should be looking for, but little else.\n\nOne type of research the CDC wants to conduct is testing that can detect if any workers previously were infected with avian flu, according to Shah. But that research -- known as serological testing -- requires a blood test, and thus the participation of both farmers and workers.\n\nA big reason for the resistance: Farms don't want to be identified publicly as potential hotspots for the virus, nor do they want to draw scrutiny to their workers, a significant proportion of whom are undocumented immigrants and fearful of government officials.\n\nGiven that reality, state agriculture officials have specifically pushed for any interviews with farmworkers to be voluntary and conducted off the farms at a different site.\n\n\"We have had conversations with CDC,\" said Dr. Justin Smith, Kansas' animal health commissioner. \"We're willing and the dairies are willing to work through our local public health [offices], there's been a relationship built there.\"\n\n\"Having CDC show up with a response team is very intimidating to the workers,\" Smith added. \"And it's intimidating to the dairies.\"", "source": {"uri":

I'll keep doing these weekly updates, but don't be afraid to let me know if I'm oversampling H5N1 or other emerging disease outbreaks, okay?\n\nJeremy Farrar, now the World Health Organization's chief scientist, was working in Vietnam 20 years ago when the H5N1 virus started to spread across Asia -- at that point in poultry. He recalls there was a reluctance among farmers to cull their chickens because they weren't being compensated for them. Movement of infected birds to evade culling only served to disseminate the virus, which in the years since has spread to all continents except Australia.\n\nIt's important to keep that experience in mind, he told STAT Monday, as the H5N1 bird flu virus now spreads among dairy cattle in the U.S. Farrar stressed that the social context is key in responding to disease threats like H5N1, noting that a similar reluctance among dairy farmers to report outbreaks or allow testing of their workers is adding to the challenges in assessing how much transmission is occurring and the risk it poses to people.\n\n\"You can't just take the virus and the biological surveillance and divorce it from the environment and the social construct that it's happening in,\" Farrar said in an interview from WHO headquarters in Geneva. \"That's the reality.\"...\n\nWhile he believes the risk of a human flu pandemic triggered by the H5N1 virus is low, should it happen, the social context will also be crucial, Farrar continued. The mental toll of the taxing Covid-19 pandemic hangs over the public, health care workers, public health agencies, and governments. Getting people to again buy into measures that might slow spread, such as social distancing or school closures, would likely be tough, he said.\n\n\"The hangover is absolutely true across all societies, I think,\" Farrar said. \"Public health agencies but also health care workers around the world are shattered. ... It's a global phenomena and the world's willingness to either have vaccines, mRNA, or otherwise, and have any school closures, masks, whatever interventions you may talk about, would not be the same as they were back in 2020.\"\n\nAll the more reason, Farrar suggested, to take the actions needed to ensure the spread of bird flu in cows does not trigger a worse crisis. \"That makes the case that we better do what we can to avoid an event happening because I think the response would understandably be very different.\"\n\nHappily, Biobot wastewater monitoring (updated May 6th) shows continuing

Yet, as the highly contagious avian flu affects mammals across the US, just one human case has been reported so far.\n\nBut that's probably only because there is minimal testing of people underway to detect it. State governments and farm owners have kept Centers for Disease Control and Prevention teams from conducting on-the-ground investigations that would offer a fuller picture of the prevalence of the virus in humans.\n\nThat threatens to impair federal officials' response to an outbreak many experts view as the biggest test for pandemic readiness systems since Covid-19.

Farms may also be reluctant to scour for infected cows, out of concern that might have downsides for their low-profit margin businesses.\n\n\"The CDC is not able to go in and do the type of testing and investigative work they need to do,\" said Abraar Karan, an infectious disease researcher at Stanford University. \"That's a huge problem and it's a blatant issue.\"\n\nThe CDC says the current risk to the general public from bird flu is low, because it's not known to transmit efficiently from person to person. But each infection in a cow or human allows the virus to mutate and better adapt to mammalian respiratory cells.\n\nThe key to understanding that risk and preventing the emergence of a deadly pandemic is the ability to detect the infection and track molecular changes in the virus.\n\n\"We're playing with fire,\" said Sam Scarpino, a Northeastern University professor who helped lead pathogen surveillance at the Rockefeller Foundation during the coronavirus pandemic. \"We're not doing the surveillance to say it's not here.\"", "source": {"uri": "endtimeheadlines.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "End Time Headlines"}, "authors": [{"uri": "end_time_headlines@endtimeheadlines.org", "name": "End Time Headlines", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cougar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erythema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraar_Karan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abraar Karan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rockefeller Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://endtimeheadlines.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/shutterstock_2459434601.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541303", "eventUri": "eng-9541303", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

In short-term outbreaks in other parts of the world, the mortality rate is 25%,\" Khalif told senators.

One had contact with \"presumably infected\" dairy cows in Texas, and the other was \"involved in poultry culling (population reduction) due to presumed H5N1 avian influenza\" in Colorado.

So all of this has to be coordinated.\"\n\nKhalif explained that once a cow is milked, it \"goes into a bulk tank where a number of cows are mixed together.\"\n\n\"This is a very sensitive area, because if you have infected cattle, you know where the infection is,\" Khalif testified. \"Technically it's fine, but we want to ensure trust. So we need to negotiate to ensure we have a way to handle data securely and to ensure that people are not blamed in the event of an infected swarm.\" We need to continue. So we're working on all of that state by state.\"\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., called on the FDA to engage and communicate frequently with farmers and the public.\n\nShe noted that her home state has a dairy herd of more than 5,000 cows, accounting for 22

The money will help build two facilities on the Fort Garry and Bannatyne campuses, allowing the U of M to play a significant role in addressing future pandemic threats in Canada and globally.\n\nThe money marks the largest federal research investment in the university's history.\n\nKindrachuk says the money gives U of M researchers like himself the capacity to work directly with viruses.\n\n\"It

Health officials say the virus that traveled from poultry to dairy cattle to a few humans -- is unprecedented.\n\nAlabama agriculture and public health officials point out there have been no reported avian flu cases in Alabama. But they are in regular contact with farmers and other stakeholders. Dr. Tony Frazier, the Alabama State Veterinarian, said the avian flu virus has not spread even to states that border Alabama, but they are monitoring migratory birds and are also in regular contact with health and agriculture officials from other states.\n\n\"I'm confident the meat supply is safe, the milk supply is safe -- pasteurization is doing its job -the virus is just not making its way through the normal stopgaps,\" Frazier told News 19.\n\nThe Alabama Department of Public Health issued a news release Tuesday evening regarding the CDC's PPE call.\n\n\"The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) is partnering with the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries (Ag&I) to update plans to ensure that dairy farm workers and other dairy-related supply processors will have access to the recommended personal protective equipment in the event of a confirmed case of avian influenza in cows in Alabama. This is a continuation of our partnership with Ag&I during past avian influenza-related outbreaks in poultry to reduce the risk of human infection.\n\n\"At this time, the risk to the general public is very low. There have been no cases of human avian influenza in Alabama, and no known cases in dairy cattle have been identified. ADPH will continue to monitor and respond to promote and protect the health of the citizens of our state.

What's the risk to people, livestock and native species in Aotearoa New Zealand? Science reporter Jamie Morton explains.\n\nIt's a type of influenza that naturally occurs in birds and spreads through saliva, mucous and faeces. The type at the centre of global concern, HN51, has now been formally detected in nearly 10,000 wild birds and more than 90 million poultry birds.\n\nIt's led to the slaughter of more than half a billion farmed birds worldwide, while wild bird deaths are estimated to number in the millions.\n\nSo far, it's spread to every region of the planet except Oceania - meaning it's not in New Zealand yet.\n\nLast year, it was confirmed the virus had reached as far as Antarctica, with tests confirming HN51 in dead skuas found near an Argentine polar base on the Antarctic Peninsula.\n\nThe virus was first noted back in the 1990s, but since 2021, scientists have observed mutations that have allowed it to dramatically expand its host range.\n\n\"It doesn't just infect certain types of wild birds anymore, but a range of hosts - and that has enabled it to spread to geographic regions where it's never been found before,\" Otago University evolutionary virologist Professor Jemma Geoghegan said.\n\nMore than two dozen mammal species have also been infected, including red foxes in Europe, cattle in the US, wild bears in Canada, minks in Denmark, and seals and sea lions in both hemispheres.\n\nIt's still unclear how the virus showed up in three-dozen outbreaks among dairy herds in the US - potentially through exposure to infected birds - but Geoghegan said evidence suggests it was now being passed from cow to cow.\n\nThat's concerning, given livestock like cows and pigs could act as \"mixing vessels\" to evolve new strains that could ultimately infect humans.\n\n\"In New Zealand, there is a lot more livestock here per capita than anywhere else,\" Geoghegan said.\n\n\"We don't have the virus at the moment, but if it was to travel here and get into our livestock, that would be very concerning.\"\n\nInstances of people being infected by bird flu have been rare - it's been reported in just a few hundred people - but the case fatality rate is higher than 50 per cent.\n\nHowever, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other agencies consider the current risk to humans to be low.\n\nGeoghegan said it was possible HN51 might not evolve to spread between humans, but its expansion into new countries and other mammalian species \"provides more opportunity for that to eventuate\".\n\nOnly one human case - a US farm worker who showed symptoms of conjunctivitis - has been linked to the latest cow infections.\n\nThis year, WHO chief scientist Dr Jeremy Farrar noted a lack of capability across the world's public health authorities to diagnose HN51.\n\nGeoghegan said the virus appeared to have been circulating in US cattle for a month before it was detected.\n\n\"The fact this virus is on every continent apart from Oceania means I'd be surprised if it's not in other livestock farms and animals that we just don't know about.\"\n\nThe biggest risk for the virus reaching our shores was through migrating birds - including the bar-tailed godwit, red knot, ruddy turnstone and Pacific golden plover - either from Antarctica or the north.\n\nFor that reason, Geoghegan and colleagues recently began carrying out sampling among sea, shore and water birds, including \"flyway\" sites where birds typically enter the country.\n\nThe team is also investigating how the virus could transmit among birds here, and methods to monitor it better and faster.\n\nThe Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has systems aimed at preventing it from arriving here through other pathways and detecting suspected cases early.\n\nIn the event of an incursion, Biosecurity NZ would take the lead and co-ordinate a unified response with the Department of Conservation (DoC) and the Ministry of Health.\n\nMPI says any actions, such as movement control, vaccination or depopulation, \"would depend on the infected species and location\".\n\n\"The vast majority of our native species are birds and have never been exposed to a virus like this before,\" said Geoghegan, adding it could pose a potential extinction threat to some especially endangered species if their populations became infected.\n\nThe DoC acknowledges options would be \"limited\" - and the best approach would be to have healthy populations of native species separated across multiple locations.\n\nVaccination might also offer a way to protect some core breeding populations in captivity.\n\nA trial was under way to test a bird flu vaccine on takah\u0113, t\u016bturuatu [shore plover], red-crowed k\u0101k\u0101riki, kak\u012b [black stilt] and k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d.\n\nUnlike with Covid-19, scientists believe a vaccine could be rolled out relatively quickly, with two options at the ready.\n\nMost developed nations - including New Zealand - have stockpiled doses closely matched to avian flu.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has also been preparing a response plan for a potential bird flu pandemic.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz",

Migratory seabirds may be helping avian flu to spread around the world and between species. (Image: Sina Schuldt / Alamy)\n\nA deadly strain of avian influenza is spreading across the global ocean.\n\nScientists estimate that it has caused the death of tens of millions of poultry and wild birds around the world. Officially called A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b, it has also been detected in at least 48 mammal species and is strongly implicated in mass die-offs of sea lions and seals.\n\nBird flu was previously considered primarily a threat to poultry and secondarily a potential human pathogen. But it has now become a terrifying, albeit still largely unquantified, threat to marine life too.\n\nWhere is it?\n\nThe current troubling form of the virus was first detected in Europe in autumn 2020. At the end of 2021, it was discovered in North America and has since been recorded in wild birds in every US state.\n\nThe virus then went south and by December 2022 had reached the southern tip of South America. It has now been detected in Antarctica, as well as Africa and Asia. Only the Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand remain free of it.\n\nHow is it affecting ocean wildlife?\n\nPopulations of wild birds have been hit hard across the globe. At least 100,000 from 24 species had died in Peru's protected areas after contacting the virus between November 2022 and mid-March 2023, a study found.\n\nVarious mammals have been infected by previous strains of H5N1, mainly dogs and cats and some animals classed as 'semiaquatic' such as mink. But the current strain has spread to significantly more species and been reported in 13 marine mammals, according to a March study.\n\nMass deaths have occurred. In Argentina, over 17,000 southern elephant seal pups were found dead on the Vald\u00e9s Peninsula in a die-off attributed to the virus. There have been at least 24,000 sea lion deaths linked to it recorded in Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.\n\nV\u00edctor Gamarra-Toledo is an author of the March study, and a researcher at the Natural History Museum of Peru's San Agust\u00edn de Arequipa National University. He says the large number of deaths is undermining ecosystem services provided by the animals affected. So many birds have perished in Peru it is lowering the production of seabird excrement that farmers use as fertiliser, he told Dialogue Earth.\n\nDeceased elephant seals on Punta Delgada beach, Chubut, Argentina, on 10 October 2023. The recent wave of avian flu has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of seabirds, seals, sea lions and other marine animals. (Image \u00a9 Ralph Vanstreels / University of California, Davis)\n\nHow bad could it get?\n\nThe virus is already exacerbating the predicament of several species of conservation concern. As well as sea lions and elephant seals, this includes marine otters and dolphins.\n\n\"It's a real blow to some species and they will take a long time to recover. The bird flu also reached the Galapagos\", says Claire Smith, UK policy lead on avian influenza at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Of the 56 native Galapagos bird species, 45 are endemic, meaning found only there.\n\nRecommended\n\nImpacts on wild marine birds have varied widely. In the UK, there has been a 70% reduction of northern gannets at their key breeding ground of Bass Rock. But, on the other side of the world in Antarctica, Ad\u00e9lie penguins tested positive without showing any ill effects.\n\nThe true impact of the outbreak is hard to quantify.\n\n\"Any number of deaths is an underestimate. Birds and mammals can die in areas where there's no surveillance and we don't find out. We also don't have much numbers from what's happening in Africa. Millions of birds have died and the impact on populations is significant,\" says Christian Walzer, executive director of health at the Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\nHow did this problem start?\n\nBird flu is nothing new in the poultry industry. These viruses are categorised as either low or highly pathogenic depending on their lethality to poultry. Highly pathogenic H5N1 was first detected in farmed geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996, and quickly spread through populations of captive, commercial birds.\n\nWhat sets the most recent strain apart is the rapidity with which it spreads and the severity of the disease it causes among wild birds and mammals, experts told Dialogue Earth.\n\n\"It used to be present mostly in winter, with peaks of infection, and then a big drop. Now the infection is present all year round, generating many risks and more chances of transmission,\" says Marcela Uhart, director of the Latin America program at the Karen C. Drayer Wildlife Health Center, University of California, Davis.\n\nA tern colony in Tierra del Fuego, at the tip of South America. Animals typically catch avian flu through contact with infected saliva, nasal secretions or droppings. (Image: Alamy)\n\nHow is it spreading?\n\nIn birds, avian influenza primarily spreads through contact with the saliva, nasal secretions, or droppings of infected birds. Once it becomes prevalent among wild populations, it can spread globally as birds migrate, including to marine areas far from farms.\n\nScientists are not yet sure how it passes between birds and mammals. Many infected species are scavengers, suggesting that eating infected corpses could be involved. Healthy animals may also get the virus from contact with faeces from infected members of their own kind. Species that seem to be resistant to severe illness could still be spreading the virus.\n\nRecommended\n\nIn a study published in February, scientists report collecting brain samples from sea lions, one fur seal and a tern found dead on the shores of Argentina. They all tested positive for H5N1 and genome sequencing revealed that the virus was almost identical in each, with mutations that assisted spread in marine mammals.\n\nAre humans at risk?\n\nHumans can be infected with H5N1, but it is relatively rare and the risk to the public has been widely regarded as low. Most infections have been among those, such as poultry workers, who have had close contact with infected birds. A total of 20 countries have reported 882 cases of bird flu in humans since 2003, half of which were fatal, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nExperts advise avoiding close contact with sick or injured birds and mammals.\n\n\"If the virus can be transmitted between marine mammals, as it's now believed, that's a big problem for us [humans],\" says Pablo Plaza, an Argentine veterinarian working at the Centro Cient\u00edfico Tecnol\u00f3gico Patagonia Norte. \"The virus is here to stay, and while things seem to be calmer now, it can keep on surprising us.\"\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nDetecting bird flu early is the primary line of defence, according to the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH). Early detection and timely reporting of infected birds lets countries know which flu subtypes are in circulation. They can then limit the movements of poultry and monitor wildlife.\n\nWhile there is a vaccine being used on poultry, WOAH says it must be part of a wider disease-control strategy. Culling is one of the recommendations, along with quarantining.\n\nWe can't vaccinate wildlife - it would never end\n\nChristian Walzer, Wildlife Conservation Society\n\n\"It's something we have control over, live poultry travels very long distances,\" says Diana Bell, a UK conservation biologist based at the University of East Anglia. Bell suggests making farms self sufficient in rearing eggs and chicks, instead of exporting them internationally. She also advocates stopping the trend towards megafarms that contain over a million birds.\n\nResearchers are trialling a vaccine for endangered condors in the US, but implementing this on a large scale in other wild birds would be difficult. \"We can't vaccinate wildlife; it would never end. It's preferable for the virus to hit a population and for it to develop natural immunity,\" says the Wildlife Conservation Society's Walzer.\n\nOn 26 June 2023, veterinarian Mariana Cadena and zookeeper Fernanda Short collect blood from a brown booby suspected of having bird flu. They work in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, at the Santa Ursula University Marine Animal Rehabilitation Centre. (Image: Bruna Prado, AP via Alamy)\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe spread of the virus is overlapping with environmental changes due to climate change, and the latter could increase the problem of the former. In Chile, for example, the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon had a strong impact last year on fish that birds rely on for food, placing more stress on animals and likely making them more susceptible to the virus.\n\nVivian Fu, Asian Flyways Initative lead at WWF-Hong Kong, says the ongoing bird flu disaster highlights the importance of a One Health approach. This involves looking at the close connection between the health of people, other animals and our shared environment.\n\nFor now, ocean researchers face a nervous wait to see where the virus appears next, how badly it harms the animals it infects, and how that reshapes our understanding of the threats to marine life.\n\n\"Over 40% of the Peruvian pelicans died because of the virus,\" Uhart says. \"A country might have a conservation strategy with marine protected areas and think that is sufficient to mitigate impacts to a species, but the virus brings a new layer of complexity.\n\n\"We might think a bird or a marine mammal is doing well based on their conservation status and the number of individuals out there. But then something like this happens and it changes everything.\"", "source": {"uri": "dialogue.earth", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dialogue Earth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On Wednesday, the markets had tumbled over concerns that a potential positive test would slash consumer demand.\n\nThe USDA has confirmed bird flu in dairy herds in nine states since late March.

These biothreats include exotic diseases, emerging and re-emerging pathogens that decrease livestock and crop yields, and cause biodiversity loss. In livestock production systems, biosecurity protocols and strategies are essential to safeguard food systems from intentional or accidental biothreats.\n\nThe ongoing highly pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b epizootic, or 'bird flu' that began in 2020 continues to have a devastating global impact on poultry production and wildlife populations. In July 2023, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that 67 countries in five continents notified H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza outbreaks in poultry and wild birds to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), with more than 131 million domestic poultry lost due to death or depopulation strategies in an attempt to eradicate the virus. In early April 2024, media reports in the United States confirmed the detection of HPAI H5N1 in dairy herds in four states, including Texas. The outbreak is believed to have been introduced into the dairy herds by wild birds. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed this as the first instance of bird flu spill over to dairy cattle within the country.\n\nThe current HPAI H5N1 epizootic continues to move across geographical boundaries at a rapid rate, with the virus spread by migratory wild birds especially the waterfowl. In late 2022, the virus moved South and was detected in Central and South America resulting in deaths in domestic poultry, shore birds and marine mammals. In the Caribbean, there were reported cases in flamingos at a zoo in Cuba. In addition to being an animal health and food security threat, a major concern is the zoonotic potential of HPAI and its ability to change, adapt and infect humans. Globally, human cases have been sporadic and reported cases have been in persons with direct contact with infected birds combined with poor hygiene standards and lack of personnel protective equipment. These human cases encompassed high-risk groups such as the elderly and young and immunocompromised persons. Bird flu is NOT associated with the consumption of poultry products that are adequately prepared and cooked.\n\nAccording to Diana Francis, IICA Representative in Trinidad and Tobago, the Covid-19 pandemic gave us all a rude awakening about the deadly and rapid transmission powers of contagions, and the need for being prepared, through a functional rapid response capacity to biothreats.' It is for this reason, that the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) funded and organised a poultry industry stakeholder consultation for Avian Influenza (AI) preparedness and outbreak management at the Sugarcane Feeds Centre in Longdenville on March 26, 2024. This consultation was done in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture, Land and Fisheries (MALF), the UWI School of Veterinary Medicine (SVM), the Poultry Association of Trinidad and Tobago (PATT), and the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA). The consultation involved over 60 stakeholders, ranging from MALF officials and private veterinarians to protective and emergency services, including the Coast Guard, Customs, Fire, and Port, and importantly poultry farmers and service providers.\n\nThe local poultry sector in Trinidad and Tobago significantly contributes to food security and produces an average of 42 million broiler chickens annually, and approximately 4,500 metric tonnes of table eggs. Given the potential severity of HPAI H5N1, stakeholders in the poultry industry in Trinidad and Tobago are being warned to be on the alert. HPAI can wipe out an entire poultry industry due to its rapid transmission. Trinidad and Tobago is not unfamiliar with issues related to the bird flu threat, and preparatory work has been underway for some time. As a preventive measure, MALF developed an Avian Influenza Contingency Plan (AICP) in 2007, which was revised in 2014. There was unanimous agreement on the need for vigilance, the updating of protective measures and systems, and for collective action to prevent introduction of the dreaded bird flu into the local poultry industry.\n\nAmong the critical preparatory actions to be supported by the IICA project include updating the AICP and running a desktop simulation to test the response readiness in the event of bird flu detection. As key partner of the IICA-MALF AI preparedness initiative, Dr. Karla Georges, Director of the UWI SVM, confirmed that the SVM 'has the capacity to coordinate these tasks, including importantly, undertaking the PCR testing of the virus, as the SVM was the major lab doing the PCR testing during the initial Covid-19'outbreak.\n\nDr. Desmond Ali, President of PATT and well known for his work in the poultry industry throughout the Caribbean, extended his thanks on behalf of the members of PATT and thanked IICA-MALF, noting that this initial session \"was a very special, well organised exchange of ideas and discussions from all stakeholders on this matter of vital significance to our poultry sector. \"Our congratulations and thanks to all for your attendance and active participation\", Ali said.\n\nIn defining the way forward, Dr. Lana Gyan, MALF Chief Veterinary Officer, confirmed that \"this stakeholder consultation was the first step in a critical multi-agency collaboration to prepare for avian influenza.\n\n\"This collaboration is very timely as the epidemiology of this disease is changing before our eyes. MALF, IICA and our partner agencies will be working very closely in the coming months in order to prepare and test an updated contingency plan which will mark a significant step in our preparedness efforts with the ultimate goal of securing the local poultry sector.\"", "source": {"uri": "trinidadexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Trinidad Express Newspapers"}, "authors": [],

The USDA is now ordering all dairy cattle must be tested prior to moving the animals across state lines as a way to help stop the spread of HPAI H5N1 impacting dairy herds across the country. That comes after a lab at The Ohio State University detected genetic material of the virus in 38 percent of retail milk samples tested - data that suggests the current outbreak is being underreported.\n\nThe USDA has issued clarification regarding guidance for state animal-health officials, accredited veterinarians and producers related to the April 29 Federal Order designed to reduce the risk of HPAI - H5N1 - spreading among cattle and poultry.\n\n* Mandatory testing for interstate movement of dairy cattle - These steps will be immediately required for lactating dairy cattle. USDA requirements for other classes of dairy cattle will be based on scientific factors concerning the virus and its evolving risk profile.\n\n* Mandatory reporting of positive tests - Laboratories must report positive Influenza A nucleic acid detection diagnostic results - PCR or genetic sequencing - in livestock to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Laboratories must report positive Influenza A serology diagnostic results in livestock to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n\nThe Federal Order does not apply to movement of a lactating dairy cow to a sale barn within the state. Subsequent movement for a lactating dairy cow from a sale barn directly to a slaughter facility requires only a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection stating the animal is clinically healthy; no testing is necessary.\n\nIf a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection is not available for movement directly to slaughter, Wisconsin will also accept other documentation of movement approved by the sending and receiving state animal-health officials, and provided to the sending and receiving state animal-health officials. An Owner Hauler statement may be utilized. The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection's Division of Animal Health launched May 2 a new web-form version.\n\nTo facilitate time-sensitive movements, the form may be completed by the animal owner, producer, hauler or market representative. Once submitted, the web form sends a completed copy of the form to participating states - both receiving and exporting states. States not participating are not available in the drop-down menu when completing the form. Visit datcp.wi.gov and search for \"dairy cow slaughter\" for more information.\n\nVisit datcp.wi.gov/Pages/Programs_Services/HPAIAdditionalReqforMovementDairyCattle.aspx for additional requirements for movement under the Federal Order.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nA painful reminder to keep safety top of mind Morel hunters start finding success Back to the farm: Family egg business gets boost from Montana Dept. of Ag Tight time: Feeder cattle show impacts of national herd reduction Farmland prices start to cool, real estate expert says Slaubaughs begin planting in north central North Dakota Deep roots: Family farms Iowa ground since 1873 In our blood: Iowa producer keeps beef business in the family Cattle hay, grain prices predicted to drop in 2024 Processing planned for Midwest Navigating spring grain market trends with Chief Agri: Insights for manufacturing and storage planning Naturally bred cow in North Dakota has quintuplets Hobby farm: Brothers turn video game into farming reality Corn Belt bristles at carbon pipelines Illinois family pivots to feeder cattle business\n\nThe FDA and USDA continue to emphasize that the commercial milk supply is safe because of the required diversion of milk from sick cows and the pasteurization process. Pasteurization has continuously proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses in milk.\n\nThe USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories has now confirmed the presence of HPAI - H5N1 - in dairy herds in Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas. Visit www.aphis.usda.gov for more information.\n\nProducers should continue to enhance biosecurity efforts, and monitor and control disease in their herds and flocks. The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection is closely monitoring HPAI - H5N1 - in dairy cattle and continues to encourage producers that notice unusual clinical signs in their cattle to work with their herd veterinarians. To report herds with unexplained symptoms, Wisconsin veterinarians should call 608-224-4872 during business hours or 800-943-0003 after hours and during weekends.\n\nGregg Doud, president and CEO if the National Milk Producers Federation, addressed the issue in a letter to the public.\n\n\"For more than a month now, dairy farmers and the entire industry have been working together to manage a challenge that they didn't create and didn't bring upon themselves. As of (April 29) farmers are now dealing with new federal mandates that are complicating their livelihoods, even as they're aimed toward mitigating a very real animal and potential public-health risk. And because these challenges revolve around a virus, our circumstances aren't fully under our control.\n\n\"But they're challenges we can meet. Since Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in dairy cattle was first identified in the Texas Panhandle in late March, we at the National Milk Producers Federation, have been tirelessly monitoring, learning and applying new information to the situation as it evolves, answering questions for our members and advocating for dairy's interests, as policymakers and the general public understandably pay increased attention to dairy farms.\n\n\"As farm biosecurity becomes top-of-mind, we're proud to say we've already been thinking about it through our FARM Biosecurity initiative, which was initially developed thanks in part to a USDA cooperative agreement. As knowledge of HPAI and its effects on cattle develop, we're blessed with deep knowledge of animal care and science on our own staff. And as buyers and trade partners ask questions and federal agencies create guidelines, we've been able to address concerns and discourage over-reaction due to our credibility and demonstrated leadership in making sure that U.S. dairy is responsible, reliable and ready to reassure based on science and sound judgment.\n\n\"We've also been encouraged by the collaboration we've seen throughout agriculture, not just among dairy organizations but with federal and state officials, veterinarians and our colleagues in the cattle, poultry and egg industries, as we share best practices and information on how best to confront what may become a longer-term fixture on dairy's landscape. We know from others' experiences that while HPAI may change certain practices, it's far from fatal to either public confidence or to industries affected by it. HPAI is a situation to be managed, not a cause for panic. Calm communication and coordination with others have helped us respond effectively to concerns and build confidence that our responses will succeed in steadying any disruptions we've felt.\n\n\"So even in uncertainty, there's much we can do. What we can't do is declare an early victory over this challenge or predict an endpoint at which these concerns pass. The fact is, there may not be an endpoint. Again, we're dealing with a virus. Viruses mutate, they spread in ways we don't fully understand and they prompt reactions that we can't fully control. While we are hoping that the end of the spring migration - along with stepped-up biosecurity, herd monitoring and testing - will cause HPAI in dairy cattle to fizzle out, the possibility that this virus could become an ongoing, cyclical concern for dairy farmers is real.\n\n\"But we're ready. As we've learned these past few weeks, we have an ability to work together, meet challenges and respond nimbly as circumstances evolve. We are looking forward to rising to meet whatever comes our way, knowing we have the depth, determination and expertise required to make the unexpected manageable, and seemingly daunting tasks the foundation for future success.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Milk Producers Federation, and the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection contributed

(Photo courtesy of Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory)\n\nIt appeared to be a problem with the food.\n\nIn February, dairy cattle in multiple herds in northern Texas were suddenly producing less milk, and what they gave was abnormal and thick.\n\nAnd the typically voracious eaters had seemingly lost their appetites.\n\nFor weeks in March, veterinarian Dr. Barb Petersen, who lives in Amarillo, Texas sought an answer. She talked to dairy owners and exchanged notes with fellow vets in the panhandle of Texas. She submitted numerous samples to labs that tested for more than 200 potential causes.\n\nVeterinarian Dr. Barb Petersen (Photo courtesy of Barb Petersen).\n\n\"Any fluid you can collect from a live animal, I collected it,\" said Petersen, who was raised on a dairy farm near Davenport, Iowa. \"As did many others. There were so many of us at the same time texting each other and trying to figure this out.\"\n\nShe started messaging Dr. Drew Magstadt, who she had studied alongside at Iowa State University years before. He now works at the ISU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory -- a preeminent national animal lab in Ames -- and researches infectious disease in cattle.\n\nWhen the voluminous amount of testing in Texas failed to find any clues, Magstadt and Petersen concluded that a likely cause was ill-made food.\n\n\"The affected cattle were very high-producing dairy cows, and they are on a race-car ration,\" Magstadt said. \"If you mess with that a little bit, it can cause problems.\"\n\nIowa State University professor Dr. Drew Magstadt (Photo courtesy of Dr. Drew Magstadt).\n\nPetersen agreed to send Magstadt some samples of the feed and animals for testing.\n\nBut then the cats started dying.\n\nBarn cats are common on farms. They kill rodents, provide companionship and need little help to survive.\n\nSome dairy farmers also feed them milk from their cows, and sick cows can shed viruses in their milk.\n\n\"A colleague of mine, he told me, 'You know what's strange? I went to one of my dairies last week, and all their cats were missing. I couldn't figure it out -- the cats usually come to my vet truck,' \" Petersen recalled. \"And then someone called me and said half of his cats had passed away without warning, and so then all the alarm bells start going off in your head.\"\n\nThe cats had died from swollen brains, a potential result of influenza. They didn't have rabies.\n\nOutbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza have plagued poultry producers in the United States since early 2022 and have led to the culling of more than 90 million domestic birds in backyard and commercial flocks. It is often transmitted by wild, migrating birds.\n\nThe virus had never been known to infect cattle in the country, and so the potential for it to have sickened the Texas cattle seemed highly unlikely, Magstadt thought.\n\nIt would be a \"zebra,\" Petersen said, which in medical parlance can refer to a surprising, exotic diagnosis.\n\nYet Magstadt immediately tested Petersen's milk samples for influenza A -- which most commonly infects birds -- before investigating the feed. He thought the testing would merely rule out bird flu as a potential cause, but instead it confirmed it.\n\n\"I was incredibly surprised,\" Magstadt said.\n\nFurther testing and retesting over days confirmed that the virus is the type that has been driving the poultry outbreaks, with an official confirmation on March 25.\n\nThe initial affected herds were in northern Texas and southwest Kansas, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Since then, infected cattle have been discovered in far flung states, including South Dakota, often the result of infected cattle being transported to new herds.\n\nSo far, bird flu has been detected in 28 dairy cattle herds in eight states, the USDA said. There is evidence that the virus has transmitted cow-to-cow, an alarming revelation that heightens its threat.\n\nOne person who worked closely with infected cattle also contracted the illness.\n\n\"There's plenty of times that we get called in to these types of situations, and sometimes we strike out,\" Magstadt said. \"The times that we do find something, it's very rewarding. ... Everybody was just stumbling around in the dark, and it's great to be involved in turning on the light.\"\n\nThe Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Ames is the largest tester of livestock disease in the country. It conducted about 1.6 million tests last year. The first construction phase for its new facility recently finished and the second part is expected to be complete in 2026, at a total cost of more than $140 million.\n\nThis story was originally

In theory, this could be a major problem if you don't have the right containment for it,\" Dr. Michael Walsh, a professor in the Aquatic Animal Health Department at the University of Florida, said. This is the first diagnosis of the highly pathogenic strain of the virus in marine life, per the university's published study. At this point, the cause of the dolphin's infection is just theory. \"Obviously, something happened. We theorized originally that since there was a die-off of different species of birds in our area, there was a sick individual that the dolphin either mouthed or potentially inhaled something from,\" Walsh said. During a necropsy of the dolphin, researchers discovered the animal had a swollen brain and spinal cord, according to the study. \"What people don't realize is that currently, this virus is considered a select agent. Select agents have, in theory, potential for use in biowarfare,\" Walsh said.H5N1 avian flu is considered \"widespread\" throughout the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Forty-eight states have experienced outbreaks on land due to birds, and nearly 100,000,000 poultry have been infected. Infected birds have a 90-100% mortality rate, per the CDC's avian flu database.Since 2022, two humans have also been infected with H5N1 avian flu, both of whom survived, according to the database. Symptoms can include conjunctivitis, respiratory problems, and, in more severe cases, pneumonia and death, per the CDC. \"Even though on the timeline, we were the first ones to find it in a cetacean (whale/dolphin), by the time we worked it through the system, you had seen several other animals. There was a common bottlenose dolphin, not only ours, but also one in South America, one in Canada, and one in Sweden. So suddenly, we were behind the curve,\" Walsh said. Since the University of Florida's discovery in 2022, there have not been other positive diagnoses in the State of Florida. It is currently unclear if this disease could or is spreading to different areas of Florida. \"If this were causing a major outbreak, we would have seen more positive cases. That doesn't mean it can't potentially get into other dolphins or whales,\" Walsh said. Walsh believes that as more organizations become aware of the H5N1 avian flu in marine animals, researchers will be more inclined to study the animals' brains and potentially find more cases. \"It threw a whole new perspective on everything. All these organizations are involved in the stranding network. They are all getting dolphins. Are they looking at the brains? And are they protecting themselves until we know this isn't transferable to humans,\" Walsh said.

The study, titled \"Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in a common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in Florida,\" was conducted by researchers from the University of Florida and published in the online journal Communications Biology.\n\nThe study provides a detailed account of how marine rescue teams identified the HPAIV virus in the dolphin after it was found stranded in a Dixie County canal in March 2022 and passed away shortly after its discovery. The dolphin was transported to the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine for further examination, where a postmortem revealed significant health issues, including leptomeninges disease and brain inflammation.\n\nResearchers were surprised to find avian flu in the dolphin, as it is typically associated with birds and not marine mammals. The study highlights the importance of ongoing disease surveillance and biosecurity measures to prevent potentially catastrophic consequences of viruses spreading between different species, particularly within dolphin populations.\n\nThe source of the dolphin's infection is unknown, but the study points to brain inflammation as a common indicator of the virus in Florida wildlife.\n\nThe study concludes by urging routine testing for avian influenza viruses in marine mammal stranding investigations, especially if the animal displays any neurological signs, as the current highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak shows no signs of abating. The detection of HPAIV in a common bottlenose dolphin underscores the need for ongoing research to better understand the transmission and pathogenesis of this virus and other emerging infectious diseases.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bottlenose_dolphin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Common bottlenose dolphin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disease surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meninges", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meninges"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marine mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Encephalitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_infectious_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emerging infectious disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biosecurity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/ustopstories/2024/april/dolphin-29042024-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541303", "eventUri": "eng-9541303", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 71, "relevance": 1}

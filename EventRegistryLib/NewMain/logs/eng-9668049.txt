That number excludes those with Alzheimer's and dementia.\n\nMost don't fit the profile one might imagine.\n\nAround half are under 65, and some are in their 20s. Most don't need help with basic physical activities like eating, transferring to bed or going to the bathroom.\n\nAnd once placed in a nursing home, adults with mental health disabilities are often stuck, staying for an average of at least three years.\n\n\"We found that almost none of the adults with mental health disabilities living in nursing facilities in Missouri need to be in these institutions, even for short-term stays,\" the report found.\n\nMost, the report found, are there against their will and end up in nursing homes out of a series of Missouri's \"deliberate policy choices.\"\n\nThose sent to nursing homes are often resistant to treatment and cycled in and out of psychiatric hospitals.\n\nThe major problems are that the state doesn't provide sufficient community-based mental health services and \"improperly relies\" on guardianship for those who have resisted treatment. Appointed guardians often place the person in nursing facilities.\n\nOne woman in her late 50s interviewed in the report, who was placed in a nursing home by a guardian, is quoted as saying, \"I have a dream that one day I will be free\" -- to live in her community, have overnight stays with her grandkids, and be \"free to not have someone place me in a nursing home and leave me, without any regard to my well-being, mentally and physically.\"\n\nA mother is quoted as saying her son \"had a life before they took him there and now, he has nothing.\" He lives in a locked unit of the facility.\n\nThese adults are largely concentrated in a few dozen facilities across the state. In some facilities, over 80% of the residents have bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. And those facilities generally offer little by way of mental health services beyond medication.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act requires states make reasonable modifications to allow adults with mental health disabilities to live in a setting that is the most integrated with the community as possible. The state can't discriminate through what amounts to segregation of those with disabilities.\n\nThe state will need to work with the DOJ to come up with a plan to fix the violations identified in the report. If they can't reach a resolution, the state could be sued by the DOJ.\n\nThe relevant state agencies told The Independent they are currently reviewing the report. The Department of Mental Health oversees the state's mental health services, the Department of Health Senior Services oversees nursing homes and the Department of Social Services runs Medicaid, which funds eligible nursing home stays and community-based services.\n\n'Sent out of sight and out of mind'\n\nMany of those adults with mental health disabilities in nursing homes are under court-ordered guardianship, the report states.\n\nThe state has relied on guardianship when people resist mental health treatment, which the DOJ found serves as a \"pipeline to unnecessary institutionalization.\"\n\nAccording to the report, one provider called guardianship in Missouri a \"sentence to be locked in a [nursing facility].\"\n\nGuardianship is supposed to be used in extreme cases when a person lacks capacity to make basic decisions and no less-restrictive options exist, but in Missouri it is used more broadly, the report states, and frequently is used when a person with mental health disability is not engaging in treatment.\n\n\"Combining guardianships and nursing facility placement creates the functional equivalent of involuntary and indefinite commitment,\" the report states.\n\nGuardians are often public administrators, meaning county officials who are appointed when no adult relative is available or suitable. Many have heavy caseloads and place the person in a nursing home because they have limited resources and are trying to ensure safety, according to the report.\n\n\"Instead of diverting people with mental health disabilities from unnecessary nursing facility admission or transitioning people from nursing facilities who do not need to be there,\" the report states, \"people are sent out of sight and out of mind.\"\n\nOne man, in his late 20s, has goals well-suited to intensive community-based mental health services: He \"wants to work part time at a fast food restaurant and live in his own apartment or trailer around Kansas City.\n\n\"Instead, he lives in a locked nursing facility over 6 hours away,\" according to the report.\n\nThat person did not receive appropriate services, the report states, which would include permanent supportive housing. He was unhoused and hospitalized several times, some of which were because he needed shelter in the cold. His caseworker recommended guardianship because they lacked access to needed services and a public administrator was appointed.\n\n\"His guardian has since placed him in three different nursing facilities.\"\n\nThe report urges Missouri to prioritize community-based services, including wraparound services that provide assistance with housing, treatment and other needs, directly to the person's home and community.\n\n\"The fact that some of these changes might result in short-term increases in spending does not render them unreasonable,\" the report states.\n\nHoused in jails\n\nBeyond the issues laid out in the DOJ report, Missouri has been struggling with housing those with mental illness in another inappropriate setting: jails.\n\nMissourians who are arrested, deemed unfit to stand trial and ordered into mental health treatment are now detained in jail for an average of 11 months before being transferred to a mental health facility.\n\nThere are currently 312 people in jails waiting to be moved to psychiatric hospitals, according to data provided to The Independent last week by the Missouri Department of Mental Health.\n\nDebra Walker, a spokesperson for the department, said in an email last week to The Independent that the reason the number seems to keep going up is due to a workforce shortage.\n\n\"People in need of mental health care or substance use treatment are unable to access it in a timely manner due to provider shortages,\" she said.\n\nThe state's years-long struggle to transfer people from jails into mental hospitals stems, in part, from a lack of hospital beds and an increase in referrals. Patients are supposed to be moved to receive rehabilitative mental health services that allow them to become competent to stand trial, a process called competency restoration. Instead, they languish in jails -- often solitary confinement -- without having been found guilty of any crime.\n\nMissouri this year passed a law to bring treatment to the jails -- \"jail-based competency restoration\" -- which Department of Mental Health officials said will reduce the wait time.\n\nThe hiring of staff has begun, Walker said, and training will start soon as jail contracts are \"being finalized.\"", "source": {"uri": "maryvilleforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Maryville Forum"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nursing home care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Legal guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_commitment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Involuntary commitment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipolar disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Schizophrenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racial segregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Organizations", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Specialties", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Specialties", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Policy_and_Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Policy and Advocacy", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Organizations", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/maryvilleforum.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/ce/7ce703b1-f41c-51e5-b46d-e674f8b73707/667456adba451.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668049", "eventUri": "eng-9668049", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 237, "relevance": 1}

That number excludes those with Alzheimer's and dementia.\n\nInvestigator tracked Kim Gardner to health clinic as St. Louis prosecutor's office crashed Here are 13 must-visit restaurants in the St. Louis area from Ian Froeb's newsletter New Channel 32?

Most don't need help with basic physical activities like eating, transferring to bed or going to the bathroom.\n\nAnd once placed in a nursing home, adults with mental health disabilities are often stuck, staying for an average of at least three years.\n\n\"We found that almost none of the adults with mental health disabilities living in nursing facilities in Missouri need to be in these institutions, even for short-term stays,\" the report found.\n\nMost, the report found, are there against their will and end up in nursing homes out of a series of Missouri's \"deliberate policy choices.\"\n\nThose sent to nursing homes are often resistant to treatment and cycled in and out of psychiatric hospitals.\n\nThe major problems are that the state doesn't provide sufficient community-based mental health services and \"improperly relies\" on guardianship for those who have resisted treatment. Appointed guardians often place the person in nursing facilities.\n\nOne woman in her late 50s interviewed in the report, who was placed in a nursing home by a guardian, is quoted as saying, \"I have a dream that one day I will be free\" -- to live in her community, have overnight stays with her grandkids, and be \"free to not have someone place me in a nursing home and leave me, without any regard to my well-being, mentally and physically.\"\n\nA mother is quoted as saying her son \"had a life before they took him there and now, he has nothing.\" He lives in a locked unit of the facility.\n\nThese adults are largely concentrated in a few dozen facilities across the state. In some facilities, over 80% of the residents have bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. And those facilities generally offer little by way of mental health services beyond medication.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act requires states make reasonable modifications to allow adults with mental health disabilities to live in a setting that is the most integrated with the community as possible. The state can't discriminate through what amounts to segregation of those with disabilities.\n\nThe state will need to work with the DOJ to come up with a plan to fix the violations identified in the report. If they can't reach a resolution, the state could be sued by the DOJ.\n\nThe relevant state agencies told The Independent they are currently reviewing the report. The Department of Mental Health oversees the state's mental health services, the Department of Health Senior Services oversees nursing homes and the Department of Social Services runs Medicaid, which funds eligible nursing home stays and community-based services.\n\n'Sent out of sight and out of mind'\n\nMany of those adults with mental health disabilities in nursing homes are under court-ordered guardianship, the report states.\n\nThe state has relied on guardianship when people resist mental health treatment, which the DOJ found serves as a \"pipeline to unnecessary institutionalization.\"\n\nAccording to the report, one provider called guardianship in Missouri a \"sentence to be locked in a [nursing facility].\"\n\nGuardianship is supposed to be used in extreme cases when a person lacks capacity to make basic decisions and no less-restrictive options exist, but in Missouri it is used more broadly, the report states, and frequently is used when a person with mental health disability is not engaging in treatment.\n\n\"Combining guardianships and nursing facility placement creates the functional equivalent of involuntary and indefinite commitment,\" the report states.\n\nGuardians are often public administrators, meaning county officials who are appointed when no adult relative is available or suitable. Many have heavy caseloads and place the person in a nursing home because they have limited resources and are trying to ensure safety, according to the report.\n\n\"Instead of diverting people with mental health disabilities from unnecessary nursing facility admission or transitioning people from nursing facilities who do not need to be there,\" the report states, \"people are sent out of sight and out of mind.\"\n\nOne man, in his late 20s, has goals well-suited to intensive community-based mental health services: He \"wants to work part time at a fast food restaurant and live in his own apartment or trailer around Kansas City.\n\n\"Instead, he lives in a locked nursing facility over 6 hours away,\" according to the report.\n\nThat person did not receive appropriate services, the report states, which would include permanent supportive housing. He was unhoused and hospitalized several times, some of which were because he needed shelter in the cold. His caseworker recommended guardianship because they lacked access to needed services and a public administrator was appointed.\n\n\"His guardian has since placed him in three different nursing facilities.\"\n\nThe report urges Missouri to prioritize community-based services, including wraparound services that provide assistance with housing, treatment and other needs, directly to the person's home and community.\n\n\"The fact that some of these changes might result in short-term increases in spending does not render them unreasonable,\" the report states.\n\nHoused in jails\n\nBeyond the issues laid out in the DOJ report, Missouri has been struggling with housing those with mental illness in another inappropriate setting: jails.\n\nMissourians who are arrested, deemed unfit to stand trial and ordered into mental health treatment are now detained in jail for an average of 11 months before being transferred to a mental health facility.\n\nThere are currently 312 people in jails waiting to be moved to psychiatric hospitals, according to data provided to The Independent last week by the Missouri Department of Mental Health.\n\nDebra Walker, a spokesperson for the department, said in an email last week to The Independent that the reason the number seems to keep going up is due to a workforce shortage.\n\n\"People in need of mental health care or substance use treatment are unable to access it in a timely manner due to provider shortages,\" she said.\n\nThe state's years-long struggle to transfer people from jails into mental hospitals stems, in part, from a lack of hospital beds and an increase in referrals. Patients are supposed to be moved to receive rehabilitative mental health services that allow them to become competent to stand trial, a process called competency restoration. Instead, they languish in jails -- often solitary confinement -- without having been found guilty of any crime.\n\nMissouri this year passed a law to bring treatment to the jails -- \"jail-based competency restoration\" -- which Department of Mental Health officials said will reduce the wait time.\n\nThe hiring of staff has begun, Walker said, and training will start soon as jail contracts are \"being finalized.\"\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Around half are under 65 years-old. Yet many of them have been stuck at nursing homes for more than three years.\n\n\"Almost uniformly, adults with mental health disabilities in Missouri's nursing facilities do not want to live in these institutions,\" the report says. \"They dream of lives integrated into the community, consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act's (ADA) requirements. They want to enjoy simple pleasures of daily living, like going to a fair, spending time with friends and family, having a pet, working, and simply being 'independent.'\"\n\nThe investigation started in 2022 after the Department of Justice received a complaint that Missouri was unnecessarily keeping people with mental health disabilities in nursing homes -- often clustered in just 39 homes. The investigators found that the state violated the ADA, because it was segregating people from their communities.\n\nThere are three agencies responsible for the care of people with mental health disabilities living in nursing homes -- the Department of Social Services, the Department of Health and Senior Services and the Department of Mental Health.\n\nSpokespeople for the agencies said they are currently reviewing the report.\n\nThe 45-page report said the agencies failed to take advantage of federal programs that offer resources to help people with mental health disabilities stay in their communities -- including programs that help with employment, housing and peer services.\n\n\"Missouri has made deliberate policy choices that result in unnecessary institutionalization of people with mental health disabilities in nursing facilities,\" the report said.\n\nInstead, people frequently churn in and out of psychiatric hospitals until the state appoints a guardian -- where someone is appointed by a court to make housing and treatment decisions for someone who is deemed unable to manage to get food, shelter, or to protect their own safety -- who then places them in a nursing home. Missouri has a higher percentage of people with bipolar or schizophrenia in a nursing home than most other states.\n\nOveruse of guardianship\n\nOften, the state relies on guardianships as the simplest step when someone repeatedly refuses treatment for their mental health disability. The guardianships are extremely difficult to overturn, which has resulted in thousands of Missourians losing control of their own decisions.\n\n\"When a person with mental health disabilities is under a guardianship, their experience in a nursing facility is even more isolating,\" the report said. \"Nursing facilities afford guardians the option to limit a wide variety of activities, including activities (like their communications) that Missouri law does not allow guardians to restrict. \"\n\nPublic administrators, who are often responsible for assuming guardianship for people who don't have an adult that can step in, are often overburdened. Missouri public administrators are responsible for an average of 91 people, much higher than the industry standard of one guardian per every 20 people.\n\n\"High caseloads and low staffing mean little time to support each of the people under guardianship,\" the report said. \"We spoke with nursing facility residents who told us they went years without seeing their guardians and that guardians do not return phone calls, or are otherwise unavailable to speak with them.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice found that Missouri's system was deliberate. Rather than provide community resources that can help people with mental disabilities integrate with their communities, the state has set up a system that helps push people toward nursing homes.\n\nNow that the report has been released, the Department and Justice and state can work together in an attempt to bring the state's policies in compliance with the ADA. If the state fails to act, the Department of Justice can bring a lawsuit in federal court.", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_desrochers@kansascity.com", "name": "Daniel Desrochers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nursing home care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Legal guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Social_Care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Department of Health and Social Care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipolar disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developmental disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Schizophrenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Organizations", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Policy_and_Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Policy and Advocacy", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Organizations", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/i6qtig/picture251597008/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/03_KCM_3Medicaidcrisis052021JA", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668049", "eventUri": "eng-9668049", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

It also found that the state is improperly relying on guardianship and that this leads to people entering nursing facilities even though community-based services are appropriate for their needs.\n\n\"People with mental health disabilities should not have to be confined to a nursing facility because they cannot access the community-based services they need,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"The Civil Rights Division will safeguard the rights of people with disabilities to participate fully in their communities. The state's reliance on guardianships that serve as a pipeline to nursing facilities, rather than engaging people in community-based mental health services, has led to violations of the ADA.\"\n\nThe department's investigation found Missouri fails to provide community-based mental health services for many people with mental health disabilities who need them, including services such as:\n\nInstead, the state makes nursing facility services for these people. Missouri can reasonably modify its system to remedy this violation by expanding community-based services and implementing processes to ensure that individuals can receive those services rather than entering nursing facilities.\n\nIndividuals with information relevant to this matter can contact the department by leaving a voicemail at 833-610-1242 or emailing Community.Missouri@usdoj.gov.

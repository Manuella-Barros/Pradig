The prelate will be relocating from Zhoucun, in northern Shandong province, it added. The appointment follows a landmark accord the Vatican first struck with China in 2018, renewing it for a further two years in 2022, over the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops in the communist country.

For the first time since the 1950s, both sides recognised the pope as supreme leader of the Catholic Church. Conservative Catholics have criticised the bishops' deal as a sellout to communist China, but the Vatican has defended it as an imperfect means to have some form of dialogue with the authorities for the good of all Chinese Catholics.

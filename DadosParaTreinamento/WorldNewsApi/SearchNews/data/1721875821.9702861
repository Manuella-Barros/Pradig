During the rule of the Kamal Nath-led government, Hina Kawre was the Deputy Speaker. When the BJP returned to power by ousting the Congress government in 2020, election of Deputy Speaker was not held. Nath had done away with the tradition of giving the post to the opposition and elected his own party leader Kawre to the post. When the BJP came to power, there was a dilemma over whether the ruling party should keep the position or give it to the opposition. Because of this dilemma, the House did not get a Deputy Speaker for three and a half years.

The Harford County law enforcement was authorized to extradite him to Maryland. While the extradition can take up to 10 days or more, Martinez-Hernandez is currently being held without bond in a Tulsa County jail with a hold from Maryland to face charges in Morin's death and a detainer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nMorin, a 37-year-old mother of five, was initially reported missing by her boyfriend on August 5, 2023, when she didn't return from a walk at the Ma and Pa Trail in Bel Air, Maryland, according to the Harford County Sheriff's Office. Her body was found the following day and a homicide investigation was launched.\n\nOn Monday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to respond to the arrest of Hernandez as he condemned the murder and took aim at President Joe Biden for his immigration policies.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Trump's spokesperson and the White House via email for comment.\n\n\"ANOTHER one of Crooked Joe Biden's Illegal Immigrant Criminals was just charged with raping and murdering ANOTHER innocent American woman! Rachel Morin was on a run in Maryland, just like Laken Riley was in Georgia, when she was brutally killed by an illegal monster who was wanted for murder in El Salvador and fled to the USA because he knew Crooked Joe would let him in,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump added: \"On day one, we will SHUT DOWN THE BORDER and start deporting millions of Biden's Illegal Criminals. We will once again put AMERICANS First and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! To Rachel Morin's family and especially her 5 children, May God be with you!\"\n\nAccording to officials, Martinez-Hernandez is charged with first-degree murder and first-degree rape in Morin's death after his DNA was found at the scene.\n\nIn addition, CBS News reports that Martinez-Hernandez is believed to have crossed the U.S. border in February 2023 after his name appeared on an arrest warrant in El Salvador on charges he had killed a young woman.\n\nTrump's comments come as immigration is among the top issues ahead of the 2024 presidential election as Trump and Biden have clinched the nominations of the Republican and Democratic parties, respectively, with polls reflecting doubt over Biden's border policies, Trump has pledged tougher policies to launch the largest domestic deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\nBiden continues to face bipartisan criticism on the issue, as the country experiences heightened levels of migrant border crossings. There were more than 2.4 million encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border during the 2023 fiscal year, up from roughly 1.7 million in 2021, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nRepublicans say the uptick in migrants is a direct result of Biden's border policies, which, they argue, incentivize illegal immigration. Other experts have said various factors, including political and financial instability in some Central American countries, drive migration to the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, this is not the first time Trump has taken aim at Biden for immigration, connecting it to the death of another woman.\n\nIn March, while speaking at a rally in Rome, Georgia, Trump lashed out at Biden over the death of Laken Riley, a nursing student whose body was found in a wooded area near the University of Georgia in February. Police have charged Jose Antonio Ibarra, a 26-year-old migrant from Venezuela, in the 22-year-old nursing student's slaying.\n\n\"Laken Riley would be alive today if Joe Biden had not willfully and maliciously eviscerated the borders of the United States and set loose thousands and thousands of dangerous criminals into our country,\" Trump said. \"To her family tonight. I promise you I will demand justice for Laken. Justice for Laken.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Biden has since spoken about the death of Laken during his State of the Union address in March.\n\n\"Laken Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal.

Government agencies, federal and local, need to take responsibility and put American citizens first and not last. Our safety is not being put first.\"\n\nHamilton, who had autism, was raped and strangled to death inside her mobile home in Aberdeen, Maryland, in August 2022. A 17-year-old El Salvadoran who was a member of the MS-13 gang was arrested for allegedly committing the murder. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed that the suspect had entered the U.S. illegally. Earlier this year, Hamilton's family filed a $100 million wrongful death lawsuit against the federal government, accusing the Department of Homeland Security of \"operational negligence,\" ABC's Baltimore affiliate WMAR reported.\n\nA year after Hamilton's murder, Morin, another Maryland woman and a mother of five, was raped and murdered while running on a trail. On Saturday, authorities arrested 23-year-old Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez in Oklahoma and charged him with murdering Morin in August 2023.\n\nHernandez, who is also from El Salvador, illegally entered the U.S. just six months before Morin was killed, according to police. Authorities added that they believe Hernandez has ties to violent gangs and that he had been on a \"crime spree that started in El Salvador and then multiple cities across the United States.\"\n\nBiden was also blasted by Harford County, Maryland, Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler, who said on Saturday, \"I want to now direct these comments to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., and to every member in both chambers of Congress. Here in Harford County, we are 1,800 miles away from the southern border, and the American citizens are not safe because of failed immigration policies. This is the second time in just two years that an innocent Harford County woman has lost her life to a criminal in our country illegally.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nFormer President Donald Trump released a statement addressing Morin's murder on Monday, writing, \"ANOTHER one of Crooked Joe Biden's Illegal Immigrant Criminals was just charged with raping and murdering ANOTHER innocent American woman!\"\n\n\"Rachel Morin was on a run in Maryland, just like Laken Riley was in Georgia, when she was brutally killed by an illegal monster who was wanted for murder in El Salvador and fled to the USA because he knew Crooked Joe would let him in,\" Trump added. \"Now Rachel Morin's 5 young children will grow up without their mother because Crooked Joe refuses to shut down the

Jean Carroll -- from casting himself as the protecter of women against the one person he blames: Biden.\n\n\"On day one, we will SHUT DOWN THE BORDER and start deporting millions of Biden's Illegal Criminals,\" Trump declared. \"We will once again put AMERICANS First and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!\"\n\nWomen's safety will likely be a key issue in the 2024 presidential election, political experts predict, as the nation grapples with the conservative-majority Supreme Court's historic ruling in Dobbs v.

Here's How the Democrat Governor Responded.", "body": "In an interview this week, Maryland Democrat Gov. Wes Moore refused to acknowledge that President Joe Biden's border policies played a part in the death of Rachel Morin, a mother-of-five who was allegedly raped and killed by an illegal alien.\n\nTo recap, Victor Martinez-Hernandez, 23, was arrested late Friday and charged with first-degree murder and first-degree rape of Rachel Morin, 37. Morin was last seen on August 5, 2023 after going for a hike on the Ma & Pa Trail in Bel Air, Maryland. When she never returned, she was reported missing.\n\nThe following day, authorities were alerted that a body had been discovered on the trail. It was Morin's. Her death was determined to be a homicide. The DNA from the crime scene matched the DNA to an assault and home invasion in Los Angeles from earlier that year.\n\nReportedly, Martinez-Hernandez came to the United States illegally in February 2023 after he was suspected of murder in El Salvador.\n\n\"I'm infuriated, and our state is still mourning,\" Moore said during \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday. \"This is a mother of five. Someone who had her life ahead of her. Many celebrations with her family ahead of her, and her life was cut short.\"\n\nMoore pointed out that this crime occurred 1,800 miles from the southern border.\n\n\"This inaction that we continue to see to get any form of sensible immigration policy done is impacting all of us, because all of us and local jurisdictions deal with the consequences of this,\" Moore said, but would not agree that Biden's border policies contributed to Morin's death.\n\n\"This thing is so long-standing, and there's been a lack of courage that we have seen for a long period of time in Washington that has allowed this to take place,\" Moore said. \"There's nothing I take more seriously than public safety, but they're allowing people in my state to become victims because of a long-standing inaction that we continue to see across Congress, and we've got to move on this,\" he said.\n\nIn a press conference last week, Hartford Sheriff Jeff Gahler spoke directly to Biden and to U.S. Congress.\n\n\"We are 1,800 miles from the southern border and the American citizens are not safe because of failed immigration policies. This is the second time in just two years that an innocent Hartford County woman has lost her life to a criminal in our country illegally.\"\n\nIn both cases, the suspects hailed from El Salvador with ties to gangs.\n\n\"Victor Hernandez did not come here to make a better life for himself or for his family. He came here to escape the crime he committed in El Salvador. He came here and murdered Rachel. And God-willing, no one else. But that should have never been allowed to happen,\" he added.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, the White House said, \"We extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Rachel Morin,\" adding that, \"We cannot comment on active law enforcement cases. But fundamentally, we believe that people should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if they are found to be guilty.\"", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madeline_leesman@townhall.com", "name": "Madeline Leesman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alien (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bel_Air,_Harford_County,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bel Air, Harford County, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bel Air, Harford County, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_&_Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox & Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hartford, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hartford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/132/9f53954d-519e-4538-98b5-bfdd6bc77440.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659808", "eventUri": "eng-9659808", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Because she is more than just a statistic. She was a mother and a daughter and someone that was very dearly loved. And I don't want to reduce her life to just a political name,\" Rachel's mother, Patty Morin, said in an interview on \"The Story\" Monday.\n\nPolice announced the arrest of Victor Martinez Hernandez, a 23-year-old illegal El Salvador migrant, last Friday after a 10-month investigation into Morin's alleged killer. Hernandez, who has reportedly been in the U.S. since February 2023, was apprehended \"casually sitting\" at a bar in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Police said he arrived in the states only a month after he allegedly murdered a young woman in El Salvador. His DNA was also linked to a March home invasion in Los Angeles where a mother and her 9-year-old daughter were assaulted, according to authorities.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Monday, former President Trump blamed President Biden for allowing the suspected \"illegal monster\" into the U.S. with his administration's open border policies and vowed to \"shut down the border\" if re-elected.\n\nMorin's grieving mother told anchor Martha MacCallum that while Hernandez's arrest underscores the importance of heightened security at the southern border, she hopes her daughter's life won't be reduced to a political talking point.\n\n\"They're using my daughter like a political flag, and I don't want to underestimate the importance of what's going on at the southern border - we're almost 2,000 miles away from it, and we've had two murders in the county that I live in and Rachel lived in. So it has come all the way up, halfway up from the southern border of the United States,\" Morin said.\n\n\"I don't think that people, when they hear these murders caused by illegal immigrants, they would use it for whatever side they're on, and it kind of devalues the life of the person,\" she continued. \"And I really want people to understand that life itself is valuable and precious, and that that is what we need to preserve.

Her body was found on a trail the following day.\n\nHernandez was charged with first-degree murder and first-degree rape.\n\nIn a press conference on Saturday, Harford County Sheriff Jeffery Gahler shared details of the arrest, adding that police \"suspected that Rachel was not his first victim.\" The sheriff later turned his attention to the crisis at the southern border, directing his remarks to the White House and to \"both members of Congress.\"\n\n\"We are 1800 miles of the southern border,\" Gahler said. \"And American citizens are not safe because of their failed immigration policies.\"\n\n\"This is the second time in two years that an innocent Harford County woman has lost her life to a criminal in our country illegally,\" he said, repeating his statement. \"In both cases, they are suspects from El Salvador with ties to criminal gangs.

He was taken into custody on Friday after law enforcement agents found him in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe 37-year-old woman's family accused President Joe Biden, saying he has blood on his hands for refusing to secure the southern border and allowing dangerous illegal immigrants to wreak havoc on American communities.\n\nPatty Morin said her daughter's death was unnecessary, suggesting that if former President Donald Trump were still in office, Rachel would be alive today. She said Biden's lax border policies are the same as if you'd open your front door and let strangers walk into your home. The mother blamed Biden for innocent lives being taken every day as illegal aliens continue to flood the border and enter the United States.\n\n\"It's a senseless death,\" Morin said on Fox News's Jesse Watters Primetime. \"Who would expect, almost 2,000 miles from the south border, somebody coming from another country, coming into our small town, and just randomly attacking somebody and brutally murdering them? We're not protecting ourselves, we're not protecting our families, and I think that if they had left things in place, and here I am going, I promised I wouldn't be political, but if we had left things in place, my daughter might still be here today.\"\n\nMorin's brother, Michael, said that his sister was killed in a \"very safe neighborhood\" where \"nothing like this has ever happened.\" He alluded to Biden's anti-American policies being the reason Rachel was killed, and similar to his mother, suggested that if Trump were still in office none of it would have happened.\n\n\"I don't want to talk politics, but I know how I'm voting this year,\" Michael Morin said.\n\nThe family's lawyer echoed similar sentiments, blaming Morin's death on Biden's immigration policies, calling on the president to \"reset the border.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic Party refuses to take accountability for its policies that have resulted in countless lives being taken, states being destroyed, and criminals pouring into the United States.\n\nThe number of Venezuelan gang members illegally crossing the border unvetted by the Biden Department of Homeland Security is rising to an unprecedented amount -- with many being from deadly gangs such as Tren de Aragua.\n\nHowever, despite expressing fury and frustration with the number of illegal aliens flooding the country along with the rising number of deaths as a result, Democrats fall short of casting the blame on Biden.\n\nDemocrat Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD) said that he is \"infuriated\" with Morin's death and admitted that the border crisis is affecting every single person across the country. However, he refused to point fingers at the president and his lax policies.\n\n\"This inaction that we continue to see to get any form of sensible immigration policy done is impacting all of us because all of us and local jurisdictions deal with the consequences of this.\" Moore said, claiming that there can be no \"partisan\" blame on the Biden Administration for the crimes committed by illegal aliens.\n\n\"This thing is so long-standing, and there's been a lack of courage that we have seen for a long period of time in Washington that has allowed this to take place,\" Moore added. \"There's nothing I take more seriously than public safety, but they're allowing people in my state to become victims because of a long-standing inaction that we continue to see across Congress, and we've got to move on this.\"", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_arnold@townhall.com", "name": "Sarah Arnold", "type": "author",

When Morin did not return home, her boyfriend, Richard Tobin, reported her missing. The following day, her body was found on the side of the trail.\n\nOn June 15, the Tulsa Police Department announced that they had arrested 23-year-old Victor Antonio Martinez Hernandez, an illegal alien from El Salvador with ties to the MS-13 Gang, in connection with Morin's rape and murder as well as a violent assault of a nine-year-old girl and her mother in Los Angeles, California.\n\nSince Martinez Hernandez's arrest, Morin's sister Rebekah tells the New York Post that she believes Rachel is not the only American victim of the illegal alien.\n\n\"Something we've been concerned about is that there are other victims out there ... whether they were attacked and it ended the same way as my sister, or maybe there are some out there who are still alive but never came forward,\" Rebekah told the Post. \"Hopefully now they do come forward.\"\n\n\"Somebody who commits these types of crimes does them because they don't care,\" Rebekah continued. \"They don't think about what they are doing, and a person who doesn't care about human life can easily do this to anybody they come across.\"\n\nOn Facebook, Tobin wrote that the news of Martinez Hernandez's arrests was \"really indescribable\" and said he wants to see his girlfriend's accused killer locked up for the rest of his life.\n\n\"I try to forgive, but I [swear] on everything I love, [you're] going to rot in jail for the rest of your sorry a** life!!!,\" Tobin wrote.\n\nMorin's rape and murder has swept national headlines after the young mother became only the latest American woman to seemingly fall victim to open borders.\n\nIn July 2022, Angel Mom Tammy Nobles's 20-year-old daughter, Kayla Hamilton, was murdered in her bedroom in Maryland, allegedly at the hands of an illegal alien MS-13 Gang member whom the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released and resettled in the United States.\n\nNobles has testified before Congress regarding Hamilton's murder, advocating for fierce enforcement of federal immigration law. She told the New York Post that President Joe Biden has no interest in \"prevent[ing] these types of crimes from happening.\"\n\n\"He is the one that is welcoming the illegal immigrants here,\" Nobles said of Biden, saying she is unfortunately aware of the pain and suffering Morin's family is currently going through.\n\n\"I am incredibly saddened that something like this has occurred again. I understand what Rachel's mom and family are going through and the nightmare that they have to endure every day,\" Nobles said.\n\nDHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, responsible for carrying out the administration's catch and release network, pushed back on the accusation that the agency is partially responsible for Morin's murder.\n\n\"A criminal is responsible for the criminal act,\" Mayorkas told CNN. \"The criminal who committed this heinous act should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law, and forcefully so. That is my response.\"\n\nMartinez Hernandez crossed the United States-Mexico border in February 2023, fleeing murder charges in his native El Salvador. According to law enforcement, Martinez Hernandez murdered a young woman in his home country in January 2023 -- just a month before he successfully crossed the southern border.\n\nMartinez Hernandez remains in Tulsa Police Department custody, and Maryland officials have until early July to have him extradited to the state to face charges for Morin's rape and murder.", "source": {"uri":

An illegal immigrant whom the Biden administration caught and released as an unaccompanied alien child, and for whom authorities missed MS-13 indicators, has been charged with that crime.\n\nAcross the country, illegal immigrants who arrived on Mr. Biden's watch are now being charged with serious crimes, including the slaying of Laken Riley in Georgia, the beating of two police officers in New York City and an attempted incursion into Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia.\n\n\"The fact that the border is open has let any criminal they want come into the U.S. You're seeing that,\" said Emilio Gonzalez, who ran U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Bush administration.\n\nHe said it undercuts Mr. Biden's recent attempt to change the politics of the border narrative with his executive actions two weeks ago, where he revealed a tough new approach to asylum claims.\n\nUnder the new policy, most migrants are no longer prodded to see if they want to claim asylum, and those who still lodge claims are held to a higher standard.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'Parole' test case results show Biden enforcement problems; migrants duck deportation\n\nThe intent was to shut down the sea of bogus claims that have swamped the immigration system, allowing people to remain in the U.S. for years while the immigration courts struggle to deliver a verdict on their cases.\n\nThe move spurred condemnation from Republicans, who said it was too little and too late. But it also angered Mr. Biden's left political flank, where immigration activists said they were horrified by the attempt to restrict asylum.\n\nThe president is expected to attempt a make-up on Tuesday with a new policy to help illegal immigrants married to U.S. citizens. They are already virtually insulated from deportation unless they have a significant criminal history, but Mr. Biden's plan is expected to give them a path to adjust their status without having to return to their home countries.\n\nImmigration activists on Monday predicted the plan would be wildly popular with Hispanic voters and Mr. Biden's base and could even help sway some independent and Republican voters by drawing a contrast between a pro-family policy and the family separations that erupted under Mr. Trump's \"zero tolerance\" border policy.\n\n\"We anticipate that immigrants and Latino voters will express their gratitude at the ballot box in November,\" said Gustavo Torres, head of CASA, a major immigration group in the mid-Atlantic.\n\nMeanwhile at the border, the Department of Homeland Security says the asylum changes are already paying off.\n\nOfficials claimed a 10% reduction in Border Patrol arrests in the days after the new policy. They predicted those numbers would continue to improve as would-be migrants change their calculations about their chances of successfully gaining a foothold in the U.S.\n\nBut the ongoing criminal cases suggest Mr. Biden hasn't escaped the grim border headlines that have dogged him from his first days in office.\n\nThe latest YouGov/Economist survey, taken after Mr. Biden's policy reversal, showed immigration remained the second highest issue for voters. And Mr. Biden's approval rating on the issue remains decidedly negative, with 64% disapproving compared to just 29% approving.\n\nMr. Gonzalez said Mr. Biden's problem is he nationalized the border, making communities far afield, such as Boston, New York, Chicago and Harford County feel the pain.\n\n\"It's become a national phenomenon where the effects of uncontrolled immigration by normally inadmissible aliens -- and that's a key word,\" Mr. Gonzalez said. \"None of these people would have been allowed into the U.S. if they had done it right. But they did it wrong and they overwhelmed the system and they were allowed in.\"\n\nSheriff Gahler said Harford County officials connected Mr. Hernandez to the crime and linked him to a Los Angeles home invasion through DNA evidence. Authorities caught up with him at a bar in Tulsa.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had yet to release details about Mr. Hernandez's case as of Monday afternoon.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump weighed in, drawing parallels between Morin and Riley, the Georgia student whose slaying became a national tragedy.\n\n\"On day one, we will SHUT DOWN THE BORDER and start deporting millions of Biden's Illegal Criminals. We will once again put AMERICANS First and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!\" he said on Truth Social.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_dinan@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Stephen Dinan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-13", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MS-13"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harford_County,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harford County, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harford County, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Base_Quantico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marine Corps Base Quantico"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Citizenship_and_Immigration_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Citizenship and Immigration Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of George W.

but now has a court date in Maryland, Morin's attorneys said.\n\n\"Under Maryland bail review standards a judge evaluates numerous factors to determine if a defendant should be held or released pending trial,\" attorney Randolph Rice said in a statement.\n\n\"In the Rachel Morin murder investigation, the judge will consider recommendations from pretrial release services, the severity of the offense and the evidence against the defendant,\" he said.\n\nRice said the judge will also consider \"the potential danger the defendant poses to the community.\"\n\nMorin, 37, was attacked while out for a hike on the Ma & Pa Heritage Trail in Bel Air on Aug. 4.\n\nAccording to police, the fatal assault was so brutal that her heartbroken family said it appeared as though \"her head had been smashed with a rock.\"\n\nAbout a month later, police matched Hernandez's DNA from a home invasion and assault of a young girl in Los Angeles - which includes surveillance video of the brute leaving the scene of the crime - to the Maryland crime scene, authorities said.\n\nHe was officially identified in May.\n\nRice said he is due to be hauled in front of a judge in Hartford County after being extradited from Tulsa and is scheduled for a bail hearing on Friday, with the case to be presented to a grand jury.\n\nAuthorities said Hernandez entered the US illegally in February 2023, and was known to be affiliated with violent street gangs in El Salvador, where he is suspected in the murder of another woman.\n\nThe state attorney's office in Hampton County, which is handling the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rice University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00edctor_Mart\u00ednez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "V\u00edctor Mart\u00ednez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford_County,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hartford County, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hartford County, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_County,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hampton County, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hampton County, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tulsa, Oklahoma"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Murder_Mystery", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Murder Mystery", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/84145277.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659808", "eventUri": "eng-9659808", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 302, "textEnd": 309}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 948, "textEnd": 954}], "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

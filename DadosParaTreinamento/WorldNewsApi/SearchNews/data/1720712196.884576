Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told Raw Story after voting on the House floor Wednesday. Biden\u2019s new executive order will force asylum seekers to be turned back at the border whenever the seven-day average for migrant encounters \u2014 an unscientific measurement that sometimes double or triple counts asylum seekers \u2014 tops 2,500 between entry points. With immigration firmly on voters' minds, AOC and other progressives are questioning why Biden seems to be borrowing a play from former President Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant playbook.

It\u2019s not okay,\u201d said Ocasio-Cortez, who has endorsed Biden in his reelection bid. \u201cI think what we need to do is support a natural path to citizenship and the resources necessary.\u201d It\u2019s not just AOC and her fellow so-called \u201cSquad\u201d members up in arms this time. This week, the American Civil Liberties Union announced it\u2019s challenging Biden\u2019s executive order in court, just as it did under then-President Trump. \u201cThe Biden administration just announced an executive order that will severely restrict people\u2019s legal right to seek asylum, putting tens of thousands of lives at risk,\u201d the ACLU tweeted on X. \u201cThis action takes the same approach as the Trump administration\u2019s asylum ban. We will be challenging this order in court.\u201d Biden took the bait laid out by the conservative messaging machine, said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake, what he's doing,\u201d Jayapal told reporters on the Capitol steps Wednesday. \u201cI think it's using tools \u2014 and I want to be clear that Joe Biden is significantly different from Donald Trump \u2014 but he\u2019s using tools that Donald Trump used and that we all spoke out against.\u201d Progressives are banking on the courts overturning the measure, but they complain Biden\u2019s White House has now caved to the far-right. \u201cI think this will be declared unconstitutional, just as Trump's was when he tried to do the same thing, but it's troubling that our Democratic president and some Democrats are endorsing this strategy. It's not going to fix things at the border,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cYou can't fix things because to fix things, you need legal pathways and you need resources. You need to modernize the system, which Republicans have refused to do over and over again.\u201d ALSO READ: Texas AG Ken Paxton campaign ad mistakenly implicates Donald Trump Jayapal is questioning why their party\u2019s standard-bearer ceded this issue to the GOP, especially after Republicans \u2014 at Trump\u2019s behest \u2014 walked away from a bipartisan Senate immigration reform package earlier this Congress. \u201cWe need to talk to the American people, because I don\u2019t think that they, despite all the badgering from many Republicans, I think the American people actually want immigrants here. They just want an orderly process, which we all want. So we need to talk about our vision,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cAnd it needs to be very different from Republicans.\u201d More moderate Democrats are defending Biden in the face of the withering criticisms he\u2019s facing from the far-left of the party. \u201cThe president's promise was that he was going to present an immigration reform bill to the Congress that would be comprehensive, and that's what he did. He did that in the very first piece of legislation on his first day,\u201d Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) said just off the House floor Wednesday. \u201cHis intention is a broad immigration reform package. That's getting nowhere. We've been pushing that for years, with no support in the Republican conference.\u201d Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) speaks outside the U.S. Capitol on December 13, 2023 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) After Republicans walked, the president still moved forward with some of the policies being pushed by the far-right, which is infuriating progressives. \u201cIsn't he caving to Fox News talking points?\u201d Raw Story asked. \u201cNo. I think he's trying to address half the issue \u2014 the half of the issue that he is able to address. He needs to address the other piece of it,\u201d Garcia told Raw Story of the push for broader immigration reforms. \u201cI am hopeful through my conversations with the White House that there's more action coming.\u201d Democrats still want immigration-related measures such as a pathway to citizenship for otherwise law-abiding people living in United States illegally and dealing with so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 children brought to America illegally and who, in many cases, have lived here most of their lives.

He's trying to address this. We\u2019ve got to address the other half. Just addressing border security is not going to solve the challenge.\u201d Without Republican buy-in, Garcia says to expect more action from Biden on immigration in the coming months, as he and Trump get closer and closer to Election Day. \u201cWhat I can say is there are other executive orders that I think the White House is assessing,\u201d Garcia said. It\u2019s unclear if those actions will be enough for the younger, energetic progressive wing of the party. When it comes to Gen Z voters, Ocasio-Cortez has a simple message \u2014 one she and other progressives hope reverberates all the way down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. \u201cI\u2019m profoundly disappointed by it,\u201d AOC told Raw Story.

If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\nNetflix made its first public comments about the online sleuthing surrounding its hit British stalker drama Baby Reindeer, telling a U.K. Parliament committee that it took pains to disguise the real-life identities that were the basis of its characters.\n\nBenjamin King, Netflix's Senior Director of Public Policy in the U.K. and Ireland, addressed the scrutiny around the series in a Wednesday hearing with the Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee. While the hearing was generally about policy around British film and \"high-end television\" and also included execs from Prime Video U.K., NBCUniversal International, and Paramount, one Paraliament committee member asked King about Baby Reindeer in particular, pointing out that fans had seemingly found the real-life identity of the woman who was the basis of the stalker of the show.\n\n\"Baby Reindeer is an extrodinary story, and it is obviously a true story of the horrific abuse that the writer and protagonist, Richard Gadd, suffered at the hands of a convicted stalker,\" King began. \"We did take every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story in the making of the show while also striking a balance of veracity and authenticity of Richard's story, because we didn't want to anonymize that or make it generic to the point where it was no longer his story, because that would undermine the intent behind the show.\"\n\n\"I personally wouldn't be comfortable with a world in which we decided it was better that Richard was silenced.\n\nAs King noted, the creator and star of Baby Reindeer, comedian Richard Gadd, tells his the true story of his extensive stalking situation in the British series. Gadd has previously spoken about the lengths he went to keep viewers from being able to find the woman that the stalker character, Martha (played by Jessica Gunning), is based on, but as Baby Reindeer surged in popularity, online sleuths seemingly tracked her down.\n\nAfter fans claimed to have found another real-life person portrayed in the series, former Gadd collaborator Sean Foley, Gadd released a statement saying, \"Please don't speculate on who any of the real life people could be. That's not the point of our show.\" Foley said on X/Twitter that police had been investigating \"all defamatory abusive and threatening posts against me\" in the wake of fans accusing him of being portrayed in the series.\n\nDuring the hearing, King further defended Baby Reindeer and Netflix's approach to its real-life subject, adding that they worked with U.K. stalker helpline Suzy Lamplugh Trust in the promotion and launch of the series.\n\n\"Richard Gadd was very clear that that was not the intent of the show, that it should inspire people to try and track down the real-life individuals,\" King added. \"Ultimately, it's obviously difficult to control what viewers do, particularly in a world where everything is amplified by social media. But fundamentally, this is about Richard's story and telling Richard's story in a truthful way. I personally wouldn't be comfortable with a world in which we decided it was better that Richard was silenced and not allowed to tell his story.\"\n\nKing went on to say that they're \"following the situation very closely.\" When asked if the production had reached out to the real-life Martha in the making of the series, King said it wouldn't be \"appropriate\" for him to delve into specifics, and that he didn't \"want to give further fuel to some of the theories which are circling on the internet.\"\n\nMartha Seemingly Comes Forward\n\nDespite the attempted secrecy on the part of the production, a woman that's been targeted by fans and is claiming to be the woman that Baby Reindeer's Martha is based on, Fiona Harvey, has come forward herself. Piers Morgan announced earlier today that he's conducting an interview with Harvey, which will air on Thursday, and that she wants to \"set the record straight.\"\n\nHarvey previously said in an interview with Daily Record UK that she's considering legal action due to the disruption to her life that's come from the series.\n\nBaby Reindeer debuted on Netflix on April 11 and has since become a massive hit for the streaming platform, regularly appearing at the top of its Top 10 most-viewed chart.

But following her appearance with Piers Morgan we have decided to publish her picture.\n\nToday, the alleged stalker hit out at Morgan, saying she felt she had been 'set up' during her appearance on his show.\n\nThe Scottish woman broke her silence in her first ever TV interview with Piers tonight at 8pm.\n\nYet before the t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the celebrity interviewer even aired, the woman has already gone on the offensive, saying she is 'not happy' and felt she was being 'set up' by the interviewer.\n\nDescribing the 30-minute grilling as a 'sparring match', the alleged female stalker has accused Morgan of trying to 'trip her up' with his questions.\n\nRead More The real-life 'Martha' from Baby Reindeer is now targeting ME: I've had a four-day barrage of non-stop calls and terrifying messages just like on the Netflix show, writes NEIL SEARS. As I type, the phone is ringing again...\n\n'Piers kept saying to me ''are you sure you haven't sent this guy 41,000 emails and phone calls?''. A lot of the interview, for a good 10 minutes, he kept coming back to this,' she told the Daily Record.\n\n'I said, ''Look, even if I had sent some emails, it doesn't mean I'm guilty of the rest of the stuff''. As I said, in order to bill something as a ''true story'', it's got to be pretty much 100 per cent true.'\n\nShe added: 'It seemed to me that I was set up. I feel a bit used.'\n\nThe Piers Morgan Uncensored special is airing on the broadcaster's YouTube channel, which has 2.58million subscribers.\n\nThe woman will be looking to 'set the record straight' as she breaks her silence following Baby Reindeer's global success, the preview said.\n\nBefore her big interview, she paid a visit to celebrity hairdresser John Hala - who has styled the barnets of A-listers Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sigourney Weaver, Elle MacPherson and Kate Moss - at his salon in London's Canary Wharf.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Record, she claimed she was paid \u00a3250 for the interview and had turned down requests from the likes of This Morning to talk about Baby Reindeer.\n\nThe chilling real-life drama was inspired by the ordeal suffered by Scottish creator and leading man Richard Gadd - who is called Donny Dunn in the show.\n\nWorking as a struggling stand-up comic, Dunn first meets his stalker after he offered 'a crying stranger a cup of tea' while he was working at a bar in London.\n\nBaby Reindeer delves into Richard's harrowing real-life stalking ordeal and brutal sexual abuse as he plays a fictionalised version of himself called Donny Dunn (pictured)\n\nThings rapidly turn sinister, with the series claiming 'Martha' bombarded the 34-year-old from Fife with more than 41,000 emails.\n\nShe also sent him hundreds of tweets and and flooded his phone with hours of voicemails over an alleged four-year campaign of terror.\n\nPosting ahead of the show, Morgan said: 'The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show.'\n\nHe added: 'Is she a psycho stalker? Find out on Piers Morgan Uncensored.'\n\nBaby Reindeer has proven a surprise smash for Netflix, having been viewed more than 60 million times in the first month.\n\nRiding on the show's phenomenal success, the cast were pictured attending a swanky screening in Los Angeles on Wednesday.\n\nRichard Gadd and Jessica Gunning - who plays Martha - beamed as they posed arm in arm and joined Nava Mau and others for a Q and A on stage.\n\nRichard Gadd and Jessica Gunning attended a photo call for a screening in LA on Tuesday\n\nThe actress looked worlds away from her role as Martha and had a glamorous Hollywood makeover as they took to the stage\n\nOver four and a half years, Gadd says he received 41,071 emails, 744 tweets, letters totalling 106 pages and 350 hours of voicemail messages from the older woman, whom he calls Martha in the show\n\nHowever, the show's runaway success has been far from a joy for the 'real-life' Martha, who claimed she had been left a 'victim' by its surprise popularity.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Mail+ last month, the woman insisted she was not a stalker and said: 'He's using Baby Reindeer to stalk me now. I'm the victim. He's written a bloody show about me.'\n\nShe accused Gadd of having 'main character syndrome' and claimed she had faced 'bullying' as a result of the show and was now considering legal action against him.\n\n'He always thinks he's at the centre of things. I'm not writing shows about him or promoting them in the media, am I? If he wanted me to be properly anonymous, he could have done so. Gadd should leave me alone,' she added.\n\nGadd claimed he went to great lengths to conceal the identity of the woman who stalked him in real life.\n\nDespite the comic begging fans not to search for the real 'Martha', internet sleuths went on to claim she was the inspiration for the character.\n\nIn the series, after Gadd meets his stalker at the bar, things soon descend into chaos.\n\nIt sees him being regularly followed at home and work, and tracked on Facebook using three fake accounts.\n\nRichard Gadd was a struggling stand-up comic working behind the bar at a pub in London\n\nHe told The Times: 'At first everyone at the pub thought it was funny that I had an admirer. Then she started to invade my life, following me, turning up at my gigs, waiting outside my house, sending thousands of voicemails and emails.'\n\nRead More Baby Reindeer knocked off Netflix's top spot by new 'must-watch' drama - but it's left people completely divided\n\nIt developed to terrifying lengths as the crazed fan got closer to her obsession - including her turning up at his gigs, his workplace and bombarding him with messages.\n\nThe actor and comedian was subjected to a campaign of obsession by the woman, known as Martha, that manifested in 41,071 emails, 744 tweets, 106 pages of letters and a staggering 350 hours of voicemail.\n\nHe says it was 'years' before the police eventually took his complaints seriously - and six years before they finally intervened - something which prolonged the agony for everyone involved including his relatives.\n\nThe police told him at the time that unless his stalker became physically violent, there was little they could do to resolve the issue.\n\nHe has said he still finds it hard to trust people and has had 'every therapy going'.\n\nHe added that the years of being stalked have left him with something 'like PTSD'. For the Netflix role, he lost weight to match his 10-and-a-half stone 'neurotic' self at the height of his own stalking nightmare.\n\nGadd has revealed he first encountered 'Martha' when he was working in a pub and offered her a cup of tea because she was crying\n\nRead More Who is the real-life stalker from Netflix hit Baby Reindeer and where is she now? Fans of 'mind-blowing' show desperately search for woman who made Scottish comedian's life a misery\n\nGadd says he's currently single and 'is more cautious' of people because of the campaign of terror that Martha inflicted, saying: 'It takes me a long time to trust them. Before, I entered situations with such abandonment and I got burnt.'\n\nHowever, performing a version of what happened to him has enabled him to have 'ownership' of the trauma. Gadd earned a Fringe award for his show, also called Baby Reindeer, in 2019.\n\nSpeaking to the Telegraph in 2019 about the one-man show that he wrote after the ordeal, which is currently on at London's Bush theatre, he said: 'It was debilitating beyond belief.\n\n'I'd listen to her voicemails and just feel my eyes welling up. They were tears of frustration. Proper brain-heavy stress.'\n\nMailOnline has approached Piers Morgan and Gadd for comment.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

Fiona Harvey says she's never been to jail.\n\nIn Baby Reindeer, Martha was sentenced to nine months in prison and given a five-year restraining order.\n\nThough Gadd told The Times the stalking issue has been 'resolved', adding that he 'mixed feelings about it' because he 'didn't want to throw someone who was that level of mentally unwell in prison'.", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LADbible"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TalkTV_(British_TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TalkTV (British TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voicemail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voicemail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restraining order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/bltcd74acc1d0a99f3a/bltb4ea140d07ebf776/663c80b88360b56db5ae1489/baby-reindeer-martha-piers-morgan.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 109, "textEnd": 114, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

The people with no lives, no jobs, whatever. I don't want to be a celebrity.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer follows Richard Gadd's character Donny as he works behind a bar while struggling to make it as a comic.\n\nOne day an emotional Martha walks in and he offers her a free cup of tea when she says she has no money.\n\nShe tells him she is a lawyer, but it soon becomes clear there is more to Martha than meets the eye.\n\nOver the coming episodes, Donny finds himself sent thousands of emails and texts from Martha, who affectionately refers to him as 'Baby Reindeer'.\n\nThe series takes many dark twists and turns as it delves into the trauma from Donny's own past, as well as confronting Martha's demons.\n\nThe show has become a huge breakout hit for Netflix, garnering millions of viewers across the globe and topping the chart in more than thirty countries.\n\nIt has even won praise from the master of horror, bestselling author Stephen King.\n\nRichard Gadd opened up about how important it was for him to tackle the tough themes highlighted in the autobiographical series.\n\n\"When a man gets stalked, it can be portrayed in films and television as a sexy thing. Like a femme fatale who gradually becomes more sinister,\" he told The Times.\n\nHe continued: \"It doesn't carry as much threat of physical violence, is less common and can be trivialised.\n\n\"I was physically scared because I didn't know how far she could take it.\"\n\nHe has admitted that some elements of the show have been dramatised to create added suspense.\n\nHowever, Richard also urged viewers not to target or look for the real life woman that made his life so uncomfortable.\n\nHe also claimed he went to great lengths to conceal the identity of the woman who stalked him in real life.\n\nTaking to social media Richard wrote: \"People I love, have worked with, and admire... are unfairly getting caught up in speculation.\n\n\"Please don't speculate on who any of the real-life people could be. That's not the point of our show. Lots of love, Richard.\"\n\nWARNING: The below contains some spoilers from Baby Reindeer\n\nIn the final episode of Baby Reindeer, viewers watched as Martha was jailed for stalking Donny.\n\nThis has led to fans wondering if Fiona ever went to jail for allegedly stalking Richard Gadd.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Record, she said: \"Gadd needs to prove I went to jail, which just didn't happen.\n\n\"I've never been sent to jail. That is blatantly obvious.\"\n\nThroughout Baby Reindeer the character of Martha claims to be a lawyer.\n\nFiona has also revealed she is a lawyer, and that she studied law in Aberdeen.\n\nIn fact, she told us that she will use her legal skills to 'sue Netflix' over her alleged representation in Baby Reindeer.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Scottish Sun, Fiona said: \"I have a claim against Netflix as this is being billed as part of a true story.\n\n\"I'm a highly competent lawyer. I'd have to do it myself. I'm very good.\n\n\"I have a photographic memory and can memorise huge files. I was top in my school at everything.\"\n\nShortly after the armchair detectives claimed that Fiona was the 'real Martha' she hit out at Richard Gadd on social media.\n\nShe tweeted: \"My boyfriend thinks Gadds is angry that he never freckin got me in the bedsheets.\n\nAgain speaking to The Scottish Sun, she had some very harsh words.\n\nFiona said: \"There's a fat actress that's supposed to be me.\n\n\"He's come up with this character called Martha and he has put me right in the frame.\"\n\nShe added: \"I don't want to be a celebrity.\"\n\nTalented actress Jessica has enjoyed an incredible career so far, which includes starring in high profile shows like the comedy-drama The Outlaws which was directed by Stephen Merchant.\n\nFiona will now break her silence on Baby Reindeer in an exclusive interview with Piers Morgan.\n\nOver the US, you can stream the chat from 3pm ET and 12pm PT.\n\nAfter this time, you can continue to stream it on the Piers Morgan Uncensored YouTube Channel.\n\nPromoting the must see TV, Piers told fans: \"Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show.\n\n\"Fiona Harvey wants to have her say & 'set the record straight.'\n\n\"Is she a psycho stalker?

I feel a bit used.\"\n\nThe interview will be available to watch on YouTube via the Piers Morgan Uncensored account.\n\nThe show will stream live at 8.00pm in the UK and 3pm ET in the US.\n\nWhile Richard Gadd claims Baby Reindeer is based on a true story, many viewers have been left questioning which parts were fabricated for the Netflix show.\n\nWe've separated the facts from the fiction.\n\nIn Baby Reindeer, Gadd's character Donny offers Martha a free drink after feeling sorry for her when she said she couldn't afford one.\n\nGadd claims this is true and his seemingly harmless act of kindness quickly snowballed into a shocking turn of events.\n\nGadd says his stalker sent him 41,071 emails, 350 hours of voicemail, 744 tweets, 46 Facebook messages and 106 pages of letters over four-and-a-half years.\n\nIn real life, she also reportedly sent him a variety of strange gifts, including a reindeer toy, sleeping pills, a woolly hat and boxers.\n\nNetflix said that every email Donny receives in the show is real, all of which end with 'sent from my iPhone' - despite the fact she didn't have an iPhone and wasn't emailing from one.\n\nIn the series, Donny wasn't taken seriously when he initially reported Martha to the police.\n\nAccording to Gadd, it was six years before they finally intervened.\n\nGadd has spoken about how some details of the show have been changed to protect identities of those involved.\n\nHe explained that 'Martha' had been disguised to such an extent that he doesn't think she'd 'recognise herself'.\n\nIt's also unclear whether the real-life Martha went to prison. Fiona Harvey says she's never been to jail.\n\nIn Baby Reindeer, Martha was sentenced to nine months in prison and given a five-year restraining order.\n\nThough Gadd told The Times the stalking issue has been 'resolved', adding that he 'mixed feelings about it' because he 'didn't want to throw someone who was that level of mentally unwell in prison'.", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LADbible"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talk show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restraining order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/bltcd74acc1d0a99f3a/blt54a35cd250c66ce5/663c68cf5a8ace69d246ef6d/real-life-martha-piers-morgan-uncensored_(2).png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Details explored", "body": "Richard Gadd's Baby Reindeer has taken the streaming platform by storm after it was released in April 2024 on Netflix. Following an autobiographical account of Gadd which traces an experience he had in his 20s of being stalked by a customer at a bar where he worked, Gadd had initially created a one-man show, which eventually led to the hit comedy-drama series.\n\nThe series stars Jessica Gunning as Martha Scott, a criminal lawyer with a concerning past who was effectively the stalker in the series. As the story is based on real life, Piers Morgan has landed an interview with the real-life Martha Scott, shedding light on her perspective of the story as she aims to disprove the notion that she is merely a 'stalker.'\n\nMorgan, an investigative journalist, television personality, and author, has held a range of big interviews in recent years, with the real-life Martha Scott, named Fiona Harvey, intent to have her say on the matter.\n\nThe interview is set to air live on Thursday, May 9, at 8 PM ET and will be available to be live-streamed on Morgan's YouTube Channel.\n\nWhere to watch Piers Morgan's interview with Baby Reindeer's real-life Martha Scott?\n\nIn an earlier post announcing the iconic interview, Morgan had noted the following on his X account earlier --\n\n\"The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show. Fiona Harvey wants to have her say & 'set the record straight.' Is she a psycho stalker?\"\n\nSince then, the interviewer has posted several updates about the live stream. Morgan, in another post, claimed that almost 1000 people were already waiting for it to air --\n\n\"Incredible.. nearly 1000 already waiting on our @PiersUncensored YouTube channel for the #MarthaUncensored interview with 2.5hrs to go until it drops.\"\n\nThe interview will be available to be watched for free, on the Piers Morgan Uncensored YouTube Channel, which has already added a link for the video.\n\nFurthermore, the entire clip can then be expected to make its way to Morgan's YouTube channel. The interview has the title,\" \"Richard Gadd is PSYCHOTIC\" Baby Reindeer's 'Real' Martha Fiona Harvey\", although no other details about its contents have been released thus far.\n\nAs the title suggests, Fiona Harvey is aiming to shed light on her side of the story and wants to prove that she is not a stalker, as she was portrayed in Baby Reindeer.\n\nHowever, one thing is certain. Harvey is going to come up with a range of revelations that might as well shed further light on the Baby Reindeer story.\n\nRichard Gadd is the writer as well as the male lead in the series. The series comprises seven episodes and all of them are currently streaming on Netflix.\n\nThe streaming service reports that with 18.6 million views, or 73.6 million viewing hours, Baby Reindeer topped Netflix's Global Top 10 TV Shows ranking for the week of April 29 to May 5.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rishab_b@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Rishab B.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martha Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobiography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autobiography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychosis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Blankets_and_Bedding", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Blankets and Bedding", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Celebrity_Homemakers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Celebrity Homemakers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/e9454-17152780993873-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "dateEnd": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 2890, "textEnd": 2907}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 986, "textEnd": 991}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

However, the real-life person who inspired the show's stalker Martha Scott is not happy about it, having sat down for an interview to tell her side of the story.\n\nCreated by Richard Gadd, who was also the lead star and executive producer on the Netflix dark comedy, Baby Reindeer is based on Gadd's true story. The creator, who plays the fictionalized version of himself in the show called Donny Dunn, revealed he has deliberately changed his real-life stalker in the series to avoid getting sued or recognized, calling her Martha Scott on the show. However, the real-life Martha is now speaking up.\n\nRelated 'Thank God Misery Came Out First': Stephen King Pens Detailed Review of Netflix Hit Limited Series Stephen King has nothing but praise for the new Netflix series dominating the streaming service's top 10.\n\nFiona Harvey, who revealed her identity in a The Daily Record article over the weekend, has previously opened up about her portrayal on Baby Reindeer, admitting she is considering legal action against Gadd. \"He's using Baby Reindeer to stalk me now,\" she told the Daily Mail. \"I'm the victim. He's written a bloody show about me.\"\n\nHarvey has since sat down with Piers Morgan for an exclusive interview on Thursday night. Morgan has described the series as \"astounding,\" and he revealed that Harvey \"wants to have her say and set the record straight.\" The announcement also suggestively ends with the question, \"Is she a psycho stalker?\"\n\nThe official trailer previewing the interview consists of a series of clips of reviews of the show, several of Gadd from interviews, and several glimpses at some of the questions he'll ask. In the teaser, Morgan asked Harvey when she realized she was the person portrayed in Gadd's show, how she felt about Gadd, and whether she ever showed up at his house.\n\nRelated Netflix's Baby Reindeer Star Doesn't See Stalker Character as a Villain Baby Reindeer's Jessica Gunning reveals why she doesn't see her character as the villain. Close\n\nIn the full interview, which can be watched above, Harvey details the relationship she had with Gadd from her point of view. She denied the stalking claims, reaffirming that she's considering taking legal action. She denied sending emails to Gadd, noting, \"I didn't write him the emails... I think he probably made them up himself, I've no idea.\" Harvey also described the ordeal as \"obscene\" and \"horrendous,\" though she also admitted that she hadn't actually watched the show.\n\nRichard Gadd Didn't Want Fans to Find Martha's Real Identity\n\nAlthough Baby Reindeer is inspired by true events, Gadd made it clear he didn't want fans speculating on who the real Martha was. The comedian argued that was not the point of the show, and that he wanted to tell his story. After fans tried to discover her identity, he hopped on social media, writing, \"Please don't speculate on who any of the real life people could be. That's not the point of our show.\"\n\nWhen speaking about whether the real-life Martha would be able to recognize herself, Gadd told GQ, \"We've gone to such great lengths to disguise her to the point that I don't think she would recognize herself. What's been borrowed is an emotional truth, not a fact-by-fact profile of someone.\" It looks like that wasn't the case, now that Harvey is planning to tell her side of the story.\n\nBaby Reindeer is streaming exclusively on Netflix.\n\nSource: The Daily Record, The Daily Mail, Piers Morgan, GQ\n\nTV-MA BiographyDrama\n\nRelease Date April 11, 2024 Creator(s) Richard Gadd Cast Richard Gadd , Jessica Gunning , Danny Kirrane , Nava Mau Main Genre Drama Seasons 1 Writers Richard Gadd", "source": {"uri": "cbr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "monica_coman@cbr.com", "name": "Monica Coman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martha Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stephen King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Blankets_and_Bedding", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Blankets and Bedding", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Celebrity_Homemakers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Celebrity Homemakers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Baby_Food", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Baby Food", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/baby-reindeer-martha.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-04-", "textStart": 3701, "textEnd": 3709}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

I'm the victim. He's written a bloody show about me.'\n\nShe accused Gadd of having 'main character syndrome' and claimed she had faced 'bullying' as a result of the show and was now considering legal action against him.\n\n'He always thinks he's at the centre of things.

For the Netflix role, he lost weight to match his 10-and-a-half stone 'neurotic' self at the height of his own stalking nightmare.\n\nGadd has revealed he first encountered 'Martha' when he was working in a pub and offered her a cup of tea because she was crying\n\nGadd says he's currently single and 'is more cautious' of people because of the campaign of terror that Martha inflicted, saying: 'It takes me a long time to trust them.

The woman lashed out at Morgan on Facebook, calling him \"a twerp and a bully\" following their sit-down chat.\n\nAhead of Morgan's interview premiering at 8pm tonight, a new interview with Baby Reindeer stars Gadd and Gunning has been published, with both actors revealing new information about the creation of the show that is set to break Netflix records and become the streaming platform's most-watched show.\n\nThe seven-episode series, drawing from creator Gadd's own harrowing experiences with stalking, portrays Martha as a relentless stalker who ends up jailed for nine months after her persistent harassment of the Scottish comedian, starting in a Camden pub after Gadd offered her a free cup of tea.\n\nJessica Gunning, Richard Gadd and Nava Mau in L.A earlier this week\n\nThrough his experiences with Martha, Gadd's character Donny is also forced to address a past trauma, thanks to being raped and sexually abused by a writer years before meeting Martha. Donny's abuse - similar something to what Gadd experience in real-life - is revealed throughout episode four of the series, with some dark and traumatic scenes.\n\n\"We did close the set, but I was looking over and you'd see the props guys wiping tears from their eyes as they would be putting the props back how they should be,\" Gadd recalled when discussing how he filmed the possibly triggering scenes. \"The show was based in such a trauma that everyone on set felt at times it was a huge, weighty thing. And it's why I think everyone had such respect for everything. I was blessed with this amazing team who kind of felt it with me in a lot of ways.\"\n\nIn the same interview Gunning explained how Gadd works with We Are Survivors, a nonprofit organization that supports male and nonbinary sexual abuse, rape and sexual exploitation survivors across Greater Manchester, and since Baby Reindeer premiered at the start of April, the organisation has experienced a 200% increase in people joining for support, with 60% citing Baby Reindeer as the reason why they got in touch.\n\nThe Martha actress then described her character as \"really complicated\" as she told Variety how Gadd's writing helped her tap in to the fictional stalker. \"It's not an easy, buttoned-up story,\" Gunning told the publication. \"Everything doesn't get tied up at the end. I think it's messy, like life is. Their dynamic is complicated and he's really honest about that. That's so refreshing to see. The response to it is shown that audiences are really hungry for that. Hungry for honest, messy storytelling.\"\n\nGadd previously urged Baby Reindeer viewers not to try and identify any of the real-life characters\n\nThe woman claiming to be the real-life Martha has seemingly hit out at Morgan on social media following their interview hours before it hits the air. Writing on her Facebook page after sitting down with the broadcaster, the woman told her connections on the platform: \"Piers is a twerp.\n\n\"But we [already] know this. You will see in my interview. I'll let the [interview] speak for itself. Piers is a bully, we all know that. He triggers emotions. But this interview will get more views. By far most of his other interviews with all misogynist men he often defends Andrew Tate Donald Trump.\"\n\nTaking to Twitter to promote the upcoming interview, Morgan yesterday shared an image of himself and the woman on the set of his Piers Morgan Uncensored YouTube show and boasted: \"WORLD EXCLUSIVE The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show. He continued: \"[Redacted] wants to have her say and 'set the record straight. ' Is she a psycho stalker? Find out tomorrow on @PiersUncensored. \"\n\nThe Mirror has approached representatives for Richard Gadd and Netflix for comment.\n\n*If you've been the victim of sexual assault, you can access help

Fiona Harvey wants to have her say & 'set the record straight.' Is she a psycho stalker?\"\n\nDuring the interview, Harvey told Morgan how internet sleuths tracked her down and and that she has received online death threats because of the series.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Daily Mail, the-then unnamed Harvey said she was threatening to sue Gadd because she was \"being bullied for fame.\"\n\nHarvey doubled down on her claims in her interview with Morgan, saying she considering legal action against both Gadd and Netflix.\n\nIn the Netflix limited series that debuted on April 11, Gadd tells a fictionalized version of his harrowing tale as Donny Dunn, a struggling comedian and bartender who is stalked by a woman he calls \"Martha\" (played by Jessica Gunning) after he shows the lonely woman a bit of kindness at the pub he works at.\n\nBaby Reindeer is based on Gadd's 2019 one-man stage show in the UK. Martha is said to have sent Gadd more than 41,000 emails and left 350 hours of voicemails over four-plus years.\n\nMorgan asked Harvey about the emails, and she said she only sent a few, along with a few text messages and about 18 tweets. She estimated that she maybe sent about 10 emails to Gadd.\n\nIn a Wednesday interview with the Daily Record posted after Morgan's X announcement, Harvey said of her talk with host, \"There was a heavy emphasis from Piers Morgan on Gadd and the emails I am supposed to have sent. I have my own thoughts on it that I'd like to keep to myself but I wouldn't say I was happy. It was very rapid to try to trip me up. He did it fast paced to catch me off guard.\"\n\nAs such, Harvey said, \"Piers kept saying to me 'are you sure you haven't sent this guy 41,000 emails and phone calls?' A lot of the interview, for a good 10 minutes, he kept coming back to this.\"\n\nIn interviews about the series, Gadd said while Baby Reindeer was fictionalized for the Netflix series, he noted that, \"Emotionally, it's all 100% true.\"\n\nHarvey countered Gadd's story in the Morgan interview, saying, \"I just generally think he's got extreme psychiatric problems... It's a work of fiction. It's a work of hyperbole, as I've always said. And there are two true facts in that. His name is Richard Gadd, and he works as a jobbing barman on benefits, in the Hawley Arms. And we met, two or three times ...\"\n\nIn her interview with the Daily Record about the Morgan interview, Harvey also questioned the claims of the series' truthfulness.\n\n\"I said, 'Look, even if I had sent some emails, it doesn't mean I'm guilty of the rest of the stuff,'\" Harvey told the Daily Record. \"As I said, in order to bill something as a true story, it's got to be pretty much 100% true. It seemed to me that I was set up. I feel a bit used.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of her video interview with Piers Morgan, Fiona Harvey recalled how the TV host said the sit-down \"went well.\"\n\n\"He referred to it as a sparring match,\" Harvey told the Daily Record. \"He landed a few punches on me and I landed a few punches on him.\"\n\nShe didn't take kindly, however, to one particular question. \"He asked me if I loved Richard Gadd and I said you've got to be joking,\" Harvey told the Daily Record.\n\nHarvey noted for the publication that Morgan contacted her last week for the interview and that other shows have be contacting her to talk.\n\n\"I've had people telling me they are publicists or agents but it's difficult to know who to trust,\" Harvey told the Daily Record. \"I've had people using the most foul language on the phone telling me they could make me a lot of money.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer has amassed big viewership for Netflix since the series debut. In numbers released by the streaming platform this week, Baby Reindeer topped Netflix's Global Top 10 TV Shows chart for the week of April 29 to May 5 with 18.6 million views, which translates to 73.6 million viewing hours.\n\nThe series has attracted such high profile viewers as horror novelist Stephen King.\n\nRichard Gadd, meanwhile, participated in a Netflix interview panel for Television Academy members earlier this week, where expressed empathy for the woman he calls \"Martha\" in the series.\n\n\"I saw someone who was kind of lost by the system, really,\" Gadd said during the panel. \"I saw someone who needed help and wasn't getting it.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer is streaming on Netflix.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_series_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limited series (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bartender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Television_Arts_&_Sciences", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy of Television Arts & Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/663d163c5c0231b512fa52a6/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1288,900,x150,y0,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "dateEnd": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 4319, "textEnd": 4336}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 1139, "textEnd": 1147}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Fiona Harvey wants to have her say & 'set the record straight.' Is she a psycho stalker?\"\n\nDuring the interview, Harvey told Morgan how internet sleuths tracked her down and and that she has received online death threats because of the series.\n\nYou can watch the Morgan interview by clicking the video below.\n\nIn the Netflix limited series that debuted on April 11, Gadd tells a fictionalized version of his harrowing tale as Donny Dunn, a struggling comedian and bartender who is stalked by a woman he calls \"Martha\" (Jessica Gunning) after he shows the lonely woman a bit of kindness at the pub he works at.\n\nBaby Reindeer is based on Gadd's 2019 one-man stage show in the UK. Martha is said to have sent Gadd more than 41,000 emails and left 350 hours of voicemails over four-plus years.\n\nMorgan asked Harvey about the emails, and she said she only sent a few, along with a few text messages and about 18 tweets. She estimated that she maybe sent about 10 emails to Gadd.\n\nIn a Wednesday interview with the Daily Record posted after Morgan's X announcement, Harvey said of her talk with host, \"There was a heavy emphasis from Piers Morgan on Gadd and the emails I am supposed to have sent. I have my own thoughts on it that I'd like to keep to myself but I wouldn't say I was happy. It was very rapid to try to trip me up. He did it fast paced to catch me off guard.\"\n\nAs such, Harvey said, \"Piers kept saying to me 'are you sure you haven't sent this guy 41,000 emails and phone calls?' A lot of the interview, for a good 10 minutes, he kept coming back to this.\"\n\nIn interviews about the series, Gadd said while Baby Reindeer was fictionalized for the Netflix series, he noted that, \"Emotionally, it's all 100% true.\"\n\nIn her interview with the Daily Record about the Morgan interview, Harvey questioned the claims of the series' truthfulness.\n\n\"I said, 'Look, even if I had sent some emails, it doesn't mean I'm guilty of the rest of the stuff,\" Harvey told the Daily Record. \"As I said, in order to bill something as a true story, it's got to be pretty much 100% true. It seemed to me that I was set up. I feel a bit used.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of her video interview with Piers Morgan, Fiona Harvey recalled how the TV host said the sit-down \"went well.\"\n\n\"He referred to it as a sparring match,\" Harvey told the Daily Record. \"He landed a few punches on me and I landed a few punches on him.\"\n\nShe didn't take kindly, however, to one particular question. \"He asked me if I loved Richard Gadd and I said you've got to be joking,\" Harvey told the Daily Record.\n\nHarvey noted for the publication that Morgan contacted her last week for the interview and that other shows have be contacting her to talk.\n\n\"I've had people telling me they are publicists or agents but it's difficult to know who to trust,\" Harvey told the Daily Record. \"I've had people using the most foul language on the phone telling me they could make me a lot of money.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer has amassed big viewership for Netflix since the series debut. In numbers released by the streaming platform this week, Baby Reindeer topped Netflix's Global Top 10 TV Shows chart for the week of April 29 to May 5 with 18.6 million views, which translates to 73.6 million viewing hours.\n\nThe series has attracted such high profile viewers as horror novelist Stephen King.\n\nRichard Gadd, meanwhile, participated in a Netflix interview panel for Television Academy members earlier this week, where expressed empathy for the woman he calls \"Martha\" in the series.\n\n\"I saw someone who was kind of lost by the system, really,\" Gadd said during the panel. \"I saw someone who needed help and wasn't getting it.\"\n\nDuring their interview, Harvey told Morgan that she thought Gadd had \"extreme psychiatric problems.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_series_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limited series (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bartender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voicemail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voicemail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Television_Arts_&_Sciences", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy of Television Arts & Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/663d163c5c0231b512fa52a6/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1288,900,x150,y0,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "dateEnd": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 3719, "textEnd": 3736}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 921, "textEnd": 929}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions. And this is just complete nonsense.\"\n\nAsked about Gadd, Harvey said: \"We've had no apologies from Netflix or him, nothing.\n\n\"I mean, for someone who says he feels sorry for me, I've had no apology.\n\n\"My character seems to have smashed up a bar, sexually assaulted him in a canal, been to prison.\n\n\"There are a number of other allegations, and... That's not true.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer is billed as \"a True Story\".\n\nShe said Gadd was \"making money out of untrue facts\" and vowed to sue the show's makers after being thrust into the spotlight and suffering online abuse.\n\nShe denied ever being at his home, contacting his parents or sending thousands of texts and emails messages.\n\nDuring the much-anticipated one-on-one, she admitted owning four mobile phones and a string of different email addresses.\n\nShe claims to be in a five-year relationship with a lawyer. She went public after being 'outed' within hours as the 'real-life Martha' online.\n\nShe said: \"On the internet, sleuths tracked me down and hounded me and gave me death threats.\n\n\"So it wasn't really a choice. I was forced into this situation.\"\n\nAsked by Morgan if she had watched Baby Reindeer, she said: \"No, I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene.\n\n\"I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online... You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nhe added: \"I just generally think he's got extreme psychiatric problems... It's a work of fiction. It's a work of hyperbole, as I've always said.\n\n\"And there are two true facts in that. His name is Richard Gadd, and he works as a jobbing barman on benefits, in the Hawley Arms.\n\n\"And we met, two or three times...\"\n\nOn whether she was ever in love with Gadd, she said: \"Piers. Is that a serious question? No... I gave him the brush off.\n\n\"He asked me to sleep with him with a big green spot in his face one day. I said no I'm sorry, I'm not interested. He asked me to sleep with him.\n\n\"He said, 'would I like my curtains fixed'? And I laughed and he said, that's a euphemism.\n\n\"You want me to come home with you?\n\n\"I said, 'I've got a boyfriend'. I gave him the brush off big time, I think, you know, subtly so.\n\n\"But the bottom line is, no, I don't fancy little boys without jobs. That sounds awful. That sounds really, really callous. But, you know.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer was based on the real-life experiences of Scots comedian Gadd, the show's creator and star.\n\nIt follows a disturbing chain of events after he gave a customer of the Hawley Arms pub in London, where he was working as a barman, a free cup of tea.\n\nThe woman, who is called Martha Scott in the mini-series, becomes obsessed with him, camping out at his home, attacking his trans girlfriend and sending him thousands of emails.\n\nIt is just over a month since the Netflix Show Baby Reindeer premiered and it has earned Gadd rave reviews, along with praise over how he portrayed themes of stalking and sexual abuse.\n\nBut one person who isn't impressed is Harvey, the woman internet sleuths quickly identified as the 'real' Martha, who harasses Gadd's character Donny Dunn in the show.\n\nHarvey first denied being a stalker exclusively in the Daily Record. She also agreed to an exclusive photo shoot and to be identified in this paper last week.\n\nBut this was her first appearance on a TV channel, albeit YouTube, with thousands tuning into the Piers Morgan Uncensored show an hour before the interview had even begun to air.\n\nThe Scot, originally from Fyvie in Aberdeenshire, went head to head with celebrity interviewer Piers Morgan in the TV clash.\n\nShe repeatedly denied stalking Gadd in real life; calling the Scots comedian \"psychotic\" and a \"liar\".\n\nShe also claimed she intended to take legal action in the near future.\n\nBut when pressed on whether Gadd possessed around 41,000 emails from her, she revealed that she uses four separate phones, saying: \"I like keeping people on separate phones\".\n\nsent from iphoen\n\nTo watch the full interview, go to the Piers Morgan Uncensored channel on YouTube -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/PiersMorganUncensored\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_dingwall@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "John Dingwall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scots language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberbullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeenshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aberdeenshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aberdeenshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32770531.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_CapturePNG.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The hit series, starring and created by comedian Richard Gadd, is about a woman he calls Martha who he claims stalked him for years in real life when he was in his 20s.\n\nMr Gadd said he \"went to great lengths\" to change Martha's identity in Baby Reindeer for legal reasons and begged viewers to avoid searching for her, adding: \"That is not the point of the show\". However, it didn't stop internet trolls and sleuths from unmasking Fiona Harvey as the \"real-life Martha\" soon after its release on April 11.\n\nOn Thursday night, Ms Harvey gave her first TV interview to former Good Morning Britain news anchor Piers Morgan in what he described as a \"world exclusive\". Ms Harvey said she hoped the interview would finally \"set the record straight\", but told the Daily Record ahead of its release that she was \"not happy\" with Piers' grilling, after it was recorded in London.

The interview - which is titled, The Real Martha Uncensored - was streamed on the Piers Morgan Uncensored YouTube Channel on Thursday evening and saw the 58-year-old Scots law graduate become defensive and flustered at points.\n\nShe strongly refuted the show's portrayal of her relationship with Mr Gadd and said she would be taking legal action against the comic as well as against Netflix. We tuned in to watch the interview at 8pm, and here are eight things we learned. Try WalesOnline Premium for FREE by clicking here for no ads, fun puzzles and brilliant new features\n\n1. Fiona Harvey claimed she had received death threats\n\nTelling Piers why she had decided to go public, she said internet sleuths had hounded her down and given her death threats. She added: \"It wasn't really a choice. I was forced into this situation...some of the death threats have been really terrible online, people phoning me up. It's been horrendous.\"\n\n2. She believed she had nothing to hide and denied sending thousands of messages\n\nMs Harvey claimed the Netflix show was \"fiction\" and a \"work of hyperbole\" She denied sending Mr Gadd 41,000 emails, 350 voice messages, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages and 106 letters.\n\n\"That's simply not true\", she claimed to Piers. \"I don't think I sent him anything. There may have been a couple of emails exchanging, that was it, just jokey banter emails.\"\n\nWhen Piers suggested Netflix used the real communications in its show, she claimed: \"This is completely incorrect\". She admitted sending tweets several years ago, which she described as no more than \"banter\".\n\n3. She claimed she had never had an apology from Mr Gadd\n\n\"I mean, for someone who says he feels sorry for me, I've had no apology,\" she claimed. \"And I have this Martha character who seems to have smashed up a bar, sexually assaulted him in a canal, been to prison,\" she added, claiming there had been a \"number of other allegations\". \"That's not true,\" she claimed.\n\n4. She wants to take legal action\n\nWhen Piers pointed out that it would be very easy to prove the source of the communications via the IP address, she added: \"I understand that\".\n\nShe claimed she was still \"prepared\" to take legal action because \"I didn't write him the emails\". She said she would like to see Netflix's evidence that the \"real Martha\" sent Mr Gadd thousands of messages, which would be revealed in court if she sued.\n\n5. Ms Harvey said she regretted ever going to the pub featured in the series\n\nMs Harvey said she regretted ever going into the Hawley Arms where Richard Gadd worked. The show depicts it as the place where the pair first met.\n\nShe said of her impression of Mr Gadd: \"I got the impression that he was all out for himself... wanted to, sort of control that bar. Very, very inarticulate, very full of himself...I should never have gone in that bar.\"\n\n6. She denied she had ever had a prison sentence or been charged with a criminal offence\n\nMs Harvey is shown a clip from Baby Reindeer in which Martha is seen crying in the dock as she is sentenced to nine months in prison.\n\nPiers asked her if she had ever been to jail or charged with a criminal offence, to which she responded \"no\". She said: \"No. That is completely false... I'm not a stalker and I've never been to jail.\"\n\n7. Ms Harvey said she was in a relationship\n\nMs Harvey said she had dated a number of men \"over the years\", and that she was currently in a relationship. Piers asked her what her previous boyfriends would think about the current situation.\n\nShe replied: \"I think they are going to think what I think of Richard Gadd... and I'm not worried about the current one because he's a lawyer.\" Ms Harvey said she had been in a relationship with her partner for the last five years.\n\n8. She said she wanted people to watch her interview\n\nConcluding her interview Ms Harvey shared a message to those who still doubted her. Looking directly into the camera she said: \"I think you should watch this. I think you should look at the number of articles that Richard Gadd and Jessica the actress have done and how Netflix and he have promoted this.\n\n\"I think you should look at him saying that I'm some sort of mental case and I think you should judge for yourselves. I can't change your mind on this. I can just rebut what has been said but you need to make up your mind. But my mind is made up.\"", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucy_john@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Lucy John", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(slang)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troll (slang)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Media Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scots law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IP address"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article29142411.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_ljr_090324_marthaJPG.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 656, "textEnd": 664}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

If somebody was sending somebody 41,000 emails or something, they'd be doing how many a day? Lots,\" she said. \"None of that's true. I don't think I sent him anything ...

The lawyer also claimed to have given Gadd \"the brush off,\" adding that he allegedly \"asked me to sleep with him.\"\n\n\"I think he's psychotic,\" she said. \"And I think that anyone going along, being in that play and doing this to somebody, I find that I find the behavior outrageous.\"\n\nToward the interview's end, Harvey, who announced her intention to sue Gadd and Netflix, shared one final message directed at the comedian: \"Leave me alone, please.

In the inflammatory interview, she accused Gadd, 34, of \"using Baby Reindeer to stalk\" her.\n\n\"I'm the victim. He's written a bloody show about me,\" she said.\n\nShe also revealed that she was considering legal action against Gadd for the seven-episode dark comedy. In another interview for the Daily Record, Harvey -- who gave the publication permission to name her \"because people have to know what is going on\" -- said the series' story is \"a load of rubbish.\"\n\n\"This is all made up and hyperbole. There are no restraining orders, injunctions or interdicts anywhere. There's just no way. I've not had the police at my door about any of these things,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Gadd, over four and a half years, he was inundated with voicemails, emails, tweets and letters from his stalker, who he named Martha in the Netflix series. He told GQ in April 2024 that he changed aspects of the character (played by Jessica Gunning) so no one could identify her.\n\nRelated: Baby Reindeer's Richard Gadd Cleared of Misconduct After Woman He Dated Claims He Was 'Conflating' Work with Romance\n\n\"We've gone to such great lengths to disguise her to the point that I don't think she would recognize herself,\" the former Sex Education writer said. \"What's been borrowed is an emotional truth, not a fact-by-fact profile of someone.\"\n\nDuring a panel for the show at a For Your Consideration event, Gadd described his experience with the stalker, confessing that he has a \"toxic empathy problem.\"\n\n\"I never saw someone who was a villain.

She has told viewers of Baby Reindeer that in her opinion, not everything that happened in the show is how it was in real life.\n\nHere is a complete rundown of everything Fiona Harvey, the real life Martha, has said since the release of Baby Reindeer on Netflix.\n\nStraight after Baby Reindeer was released, viewers were trying to track down the real Martha. Richard Gadd released a statement asking people not to do this, but at the same time, Fiona was doing interviews to share her side of the story. At the time she was kept anonymous, but now Fiona Harvey has identified herself as the real Martha, and said she is happy to be named.\n\nAt first Fiona Harvey said she didn't even know who Baby Reindeer creator Richard Gadd is. \"Richard Gadd who is not known to me wrote a show four or five years ago for the festival fringe called Baby Reindeer it would appear to be popular on Netflix now among twenty-somethings with no brain,\" she said on Facebook. \"I do not follow the rantings of Richard Gadd or failed comedians like him. I have no idea what he's said apart from a few quotes thrown at me this week by other people.\"\n\nShe continued: \"He seems to have some fat ugly woman called Martha being played by an actress pretending to be me. Again. I do not know this actress. Richard Gadd was a jobbing barman in the Hawley Arms, Camden. I did know that. I used to live in Camden and no longer do.\"\n\nThen, speaking anonymously to the Daily Record, she added that she felt she was the victim in the whole situation. \"I'm the victim here, not Richard Gadd,\" she said. \"I've had death threats as a result of his show despite the fact that a lot of the things he claimed are just not true.\n\n\"I was in Richard Gadd's company on occasions but I didn't stalk him like he claims. His story is that this is a gross intrusion into my privacy. I haven't seen him for 12 years.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Scottish Sun, Fiona then said she is a successful lawyer, with plans to sue Netflix over the show. \"I have a claim against Netflix as this is being billed as part of a true story,\" she said.\n\nFiona added: \"There's a fat actress that's supposed to be me. I'm a highly competent lawyer. I'd have to do it myself. I'm very good. I have a photographic memory and can memorise huge files. I was top in my school at everything. People are probably saying I'm a mass murderer. This can't continue. I will kick their asses.\" Speaking of Richard Gadd, she added: \"I am very attractive. He's not Brad Pitt.\"\n\nFiona then said she's received death threats from people who have watched the show, and has likened the people messaging her to a cult. She said she has been harassed herself, and \"could be killed\" by \"nutters\" who won't stop hounding her.\n\n\"These people are nutters. It's a cult thing like the Moonies,\" she said in an interview. \"I've had to block people who say they are determined to stalk me the same way I am stalking them.\"\n\nShe added she fears for her life following the show on Netflix, and said: \"Apparently, I play with baby reindeers all day. What upsets me is that some of these stalkers could be dangerous. They could be violent. I could be killed. I'm not suicidal...but I think this would have driven anyone else to suicide. I really do.\"\n\nTalking of people approaching her and reaching out to her, the woman added: \"These people need to get a life. They need to do their housework, go and get a degree, get a job.\"\n\nShe said she doesn't have a Netflix subscription, but has been forced to cancel plans because the show has got in the way of her normal life so much. \"This whole situation has wrecked my week. I've had to put off several appointments,\" she added. \"I've had to cancel a hospital operation and there have been domestic things I have tried to get done but this takes up so much of my time.\"\n\nIt was then that Fiona Harvey identified herself as the real Martha, and called the Netflix show about her a \"load of rubbish\". In an interview with Daily Record, Fiona Harvey explained: \"You have my authority to name me. I give you my permission to name me because people have to know what is going on.\"\n\nIn Baby Reindeer the character based on Fiona was jailed for four-and-a-half years before she met Donny, and this is a scenario Fiona has strongly denied ever happened.\n\nShe explained: \"I've not been to prison. I don't know where the four -and-a-half years and nine months comes in. None of this happened. It's a load of rubbish. Gadd needs to prove I went to jail which just didn't happen. I've never been sent to jail. That is blatantly obvious.\n\n\"Police at your door would be the first thing, then you'd be charged, then you would have a trial. Then you'd be fined or something or go to prison. This is all made up and hyperbole. There are no restraining orders, injunctions or interdicts anywhere. There's just no way. I've not had the police at my door about any of these things. It's a load of rubbish. I don't have any money but I'm a perfectly capable lawyer so I will represent myself.\"\n\nShortly after revealing herself as the real Martha, Fiona Harvey said she was going to do a TV appearance about Baby Reindeer.

The Daily Record carried the first current picture and newspaper interview with Fiona Harvey, 58, after she was exposed as the real-life Martha by internet sleuths.\n\nAnd now the Scot, originally from Fyvie in Aberdeenshire, has gone head to head with celebrity interviewer Piers Morgan in a TV clash which will hit screens tonight (Thursday).\n\nDiscussing the upcoming interview on her ITV show earlier today, Lorraine said: \"That's Piers Morgan there with the 'real-life Martha' from Netflix's hit show, Baby Reindeer, his interview is going to be out later today.\n\n\"Apparently, the stalking drama was based on her with [actress] Jessica Gunning playing a version of her in the show but it's also a drama, it was based on real true life.

'It's a work of fiction, hyperbole, and there are two true facts in that that he's Richard Gadd and was a jobbing barman.'\n\nRecalling when she met him - which she said was 10 to 12 years ago - Harvey claimed: 'He didn't offer me a cup of tea. I was in for a meal with a drink of Lemonade. I'm diabetic so I was very hungry.'\n\nShe said Gadd 'commandeered' the conversation she was having with another barman, adding: 'He seemed to be obsessed with me from that moment onward.'\n\nHarvey did admit she had a reindeer toy, but 'categorically' denied he ever turned up outside her house as depicted in the show.\n\nWhen asked about the 41,000 emails, she said: 'That's simply not true. Absolutely not. None of that is true. I don't think I sent him anything. There may have been a couple of emails.'\n\nShe did admit to having tweeted Gadd around 18 times, and didn't understand Piers' question about Martha in Baby Reindeer signing off 'sent from my iPhone' - seemingly pretending to own one.\n\nHarvey, who claims to have a photographic memory, also denied having sexually assaulted Gadd, assaulting his girlfriend, or launching at him across a bar - something Martha did in the show.\n\nViewers took to X saying how surreal it was that Baby Reindeer is seeping into real life television.\n\n'OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!! The interview so far is surreal!!!' said @neetal4u, while others called it 'bizarre'.\n\nEarlier today Harvey said she felt 'used' by Morgan looking back at the interview.\n\nHarvey told the Daily Record: 'I have my own thoughts on it that I'd like to keep to myself but I wouldn't say I was happy. It was very rapid to try to trip me up. He did it fast paced to catch me off guard.'\n\nShe claims Morgan grilled her about sending 41,000 emails to Gadd for ten minutes of the interview.\n\nShe defended herself saying that even if the emails are true, it does not mean the entire saga was completely factual.\n\n'It seemed to me that I was set up. I feel a bit used,' Harvey added.\n\nMorgan reportedly described the interaction as a 'sparring match' between the pair, for which his interviewee claims she was only paid \u00a3250.\n\nHarvey claims she was bombarded with interview requests and said yes to the former Good Morning Britain host because she liked him.\n\n'Piers said it went well,' Harvey continued. 'He referred to it as a sparring match. He landed a few punches on me and I landed a few punches on him. He asked me if I loved Richard Gadd and I said you've got to be joking.'\n\nIn parliament, Netflix insisted they took 'every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story.'\n\nPreviously speaking about the process of turning his ordeal into a TV show, Gadd told Metro.co.uk he wanted Baby Reindeer 'to be three-dimensional'.\n\n'I wanted it to be nuanced. I just remember my idea of stalking in life was so different to what actually happened,' he said.\n\n'My idea of what a stalker was, was that they are fundamentally, sort of, psychopathic characters. But it just wasn't that case. I saw someone very vulnerable, really.'\n\nHe added there was no 'moral point for people to take away' but there was 'a subtle reference to the fact that this is a vulnerable person who needs help'.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Richard Gadd reveals the moment which caused Baby Reindeer crew to cry\n\nMORE : Is Bodkin a real place?

The hit series, created by comedian Richard Gadd, portrays Martha as a stalker who allegedly harassed and abused Gadd for years during his 20s.\n\nGadd says he 'went to great lengths' to change Martha's identity in the show for legal reasons and begged viewers to avoid searching for her, adding: \"That is not the point of the show\". In the blockbuster series, Gadd plays as Donny Dunn and Jessica Gunning takes on the role of Martha.\n\nThe show has gone on to achieve world-wide acclaim after its release last month. It is still number one in Netflix's top ten list of TV programmes in the UK since it came out April 11.\n\nNow, to share her side of the story, Fiona Harvey will be grilled by former Good Morning Britain news anchor Piers Morgan in what he describes as a \"world exclusive\". Sharing the news on social media, the outspoken journalist posted a picture of Harvey in his studio last night.\n\nHe wrote: \"The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show.

Since sharing the news last night, Morgan's post on X has already received seven million views and thousands of comments.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Record, Harvey says she was \"not happy\" with Piers' questioning after the interview was recorded in London. She described her interview as a \"sparring match\" and was forced to refute claims by Piers that she \"loved\" Gadd.\n\nFiona told how Piers refused to accept Harvey's denial that she stalked Gadd, saying: \"There was a heavy emphasis from Piers Morgan on Gadd and the emails I am supposed to have sent. I have my own thoughts on it that I'd like to keep to myself but I wouldn't say I was happy. It was very rapid to try to trip me up. He did it fast paced to catch me off guard.\"\n\nShe added: \"Piers kept saying to me 'are you sure you haven't sent this guy 41,000 emails and phone calls?'.

The interviewer has gone head-to-head with the woman thought to be the stalker who appears in comedian Richard Gadd's hit show. The 48-year-old woman from Scotland is seeking to 'set the record straight' following the show's phenomenal global success. But Morgan has already faced a backlash from mental health campaigners and survivors of stalking over his 'irresponsible' decision to interview the woman. And today, the alleged stalker - who MailOnline had decided not to name or picture until she appeared on Morgan's show - has hit out, saying she felt she had been 'set up'. Piers has now released the 58-second trailer ahead of tonight's broadcast of the show on Piers Morgan Uncensored.\n\nIn the clip, Morgan asks: 'First of all, why have you decided to go public? When did you know that you were the person being depicted? Have you ever been to prison?' 'What do you feel about Richard Gadd? Do you think he's mentally unwell? Did you ever turn up at his house? Would you accept that someone who did that would be very obsessive about someone?' The trailer ends with Morgan asking: 'Here's the thing, I don't know the truth - you do. Would you look down the barrel of that camera... to people who still doubt you, what do you say to them?' before the clip cuts to the woman. But campaigners have rounded on Morgan for his decision to interview the alleged stalker. Kerri Layton, whose life was destroyed after she faced a 14-year nightmare at the hands of her stalker, today said: 'I feel sick to the stomach for so many reasons. 'Having being through the criminal justice system myself with a 14 year stalking incident, I know how dangerous this is.\n\n'Stop glamorizing stalking,' added the professional jazz singer and business coach in a post on social media. The Scottish woman is set to break her silence in her first ever TV interview with Piers tonight from 8pm. But before the t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the celebrity interviewer has even aired, the woman has already gone on the offensive, saying she is 'not happy' and felt she was being 'set up' by the interviewer. Describing the 30-minute grilling as a 'sparring match', the alleged female stalker has accused Morgan of trying to 'trip her up' with his questions. 'Piers kept saying to me \"are you sure you haven't sent this guy 41,000 emails and phone calls?\". A lot of the interview, for a good 10 minutes, he kept coming back to this,' she told the Daily Record. 'I said, \"Look, even if I had sent some emails, it doesn't mean I'm guilty of the rest of the stuff\". As I said, in order to bill something as a \"true story\", it's got to be pretty much 100 percent true.' She added: 'It seemed to me that I was set up. I feel a bit used.'\n\nThe Piers Morgan Uncensored special will air on the broadcaster's YouTube channel, which has 2.58 million subscribers, at 8 pm. The woman will be looking to 'set the record straight' as she breaks her silence following Baby Reindeer's global success, the preview said. Before her big interview, she paid a visit to celebrity hairdresser John Hala - who has styled the barnets of A-listers Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sigourney Weaver, Elle MacPherson and Kate Moss - at his salon in London's Canary Wharf. Speaking to the Daily Record, she claimed she was paid \u00a3250 for the interview and had turned down requests from the likes of This Morning to talk about Baby Reindeer. The chilling real-life drama was inspired by the ordeal suffered by Scottish creator and leading man Richard Gadd - who is called Donny Dunn in the show. Working as a struggling stand-up comic, Dunn first meets his stalker after he offered 'a crying stranger a cup of tea' while he was working at a bar in London . Things rapidly turn sinister, with the series claiming 'Martha' bombarded the 34-year-old from Fife with more than 41,000 emails.\n\nShe also sent him hundreds of tweets and and flooded his phone with hours of voicemails over an alleged four-year campaign of terror. Posting ahead of the show, Morgan said: 'The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show.' He added: 'Is she a psycho stalker? Find out on Piers Morgan Uncensored.' Baby Reindeer has proven a surprise smash for Netflix, having been viewed more than 60 million times in the first month. Riding on the show's phenomenal success, the cast were pictured attending a swanky screening in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Richard Gadd and Jessica Gunning - who plays Martha - beamed as they posed arm in arm and joined Nava Mau and others for a Q and A on stage. However, the show's runaway success has been far from a joy for the 'real-life' Martha, who claimed she had been left a 'victim' by its surprise popularity.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Mail+ last month , the woman insisted she was not a stalker and said: 'He's using Baby Reindeer to stalk me now. I'm the victim. He's written a bloody show about me.' She accused Gadd of having 'main character syndrome' and claimed she had faced 'bullying' as a result of the show and was now considering legal action against him. 'He always thinks he's at the centre of things. I'm not writing shows about him or promoting them in the media, am I? If he wanted me to be properly anonymous, he could have done so. Gadd should leave me alone,' she added. Gadd claimed he went to great lengths to conceal the identity of the woman who stalked him in real life. Despite the comic begging fans not to search for the real 'Martha', internet sleuths went on to claim she was the inspiration for the character. In the series, after Gadd meets his stalker at the bar, things soon descend into chaos. It sees him being regularly followed at home and work, and tracked on Facebook using three fake accounts.\n\nHe told The Times : 'At first everyone at the pub thought it was funny that I had an admirer. Then she started to invade my life, following me, turning up at my gigs, waiting outside my house, sending thousands of voicemails and emails.' It developed to terrifying lengths as the crazed fan got closer to her obsession - including her turning up at his gigs, his workplace and bombarding him with messages. The actor and comedian was subjected to a campaign of obsession by the woman, known as Martha, that manifested in 41,071 emails, 744 tweets, 106 pages of letters and a staggering 350 hours of voicemail. He says it was 'years' before the police eventually took his complaints seriously - and six years before they finally intervened - something which prolonged the agony for everyone involved including his relatives.\n\nThe police told him at the time that unless his stalker became physically violent, there was little they could do to resolve the issue. He has said he still finds it hard to trust people and has had 'every therapy going'. He added that the years of being stalked have left him with something 'like PTSD'. For the Netflix role, he lost weight to match his 10-and-a-half stone 'neurotic' self at the height of his own stalking nightmare. Gadd says he's currently single and 'is more cautious' of people because of the campaign of terror that Martha inflicted, saying: 'It takes me a long time to trust them. Before, I entered situations with such abandonment and I got burnt.' However, performing a version of what happened to him has enabled him to have 'ownership' of the trauma. Gadd earned a Fringe award for his show, also called Baby Reindeer, in 2019. Speaking to the Telegraph in 2019 about the one-man show that he wrote after the ordeal, which is currently on at London's Bush theatre, he said: 'It was debilitating beyond belief.\n\n'I'd listen to her voicemails and just feel my eyes welling up. They were tears of frustration. Proper brain-heavy stress.' He added that the years of being stalked have left him with something 'like PTSD'.

MailOnline has approached Piers Morgan and Gadd for comment.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

I suppose in the case of Baby Reindeer, it's a bit hard to tell the two apart.\n\nThe Netflix show has taken the world by storm, thrusting its creator Richard Gadd into the spotlight and dominating Netflix's Top 10 chart for weeks. It's sparked a lot of conversation -- some of it healthy, some of it not so much.\n\nOn the one hand, as I noted in my review of Baby Reindeer, the limited series is a heartbreakingly raw examination of trauma and abuse. It's also just an incredibly well-written -- if stress-inducing -- series, with some extraordinary performances from Gadd (playing a version of himself named Donny), Nava Mau as his girlfriend Teri, Tom Goodman-Hill as Darrien, a writer who Donny meets and is abused by, and especially Jessica Gunning as Martha, the middle-aged woman who ends up stalking Donny, though the show is smart enough to show us how it's never quite so simple as a one-way street.\n\nOn the other hand, a lot of the online conversation has been speculation and amateur sleuthing around the real-life identities of Martha and Darrien. The latter remains a mystery, but it didn't take long to trace Martha to her real-life counterpart, Fiona Harvey, a Scottish lawyer who has threatened to sue Netflix and Gadd over her depiction in Baby Reindeer.\n\nI've avoided discussing this because up until now, it seemed more important to keep private individuals private. But perhaps it should come as no shock to anyone that the woman Martha is based off of has found her place in the spotlight.\n\nToday, she will appear on Piers Morgan's YouTube channel, Piers Morgan Uncensored. In a tweet Wednesday, Morgan wrote:\n\n*WORLD EXCLUSIVE*\n\nThe real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show.\n\nFiona Harvey wants to have her say & 'set the record straight.'\n\nNot very subtle there, Morgan, though this will surely be quite the interview, drawing in countless fans curious to see what Harvey will be like in person.\n\nThe interview will air on Morgan's channel at 8pm GMT / 4pm EST / 1pm PST on Thursday, May 9th.\n\nAs for Harvey, she told The Daily Record that Gadd's accounting in Baby Reindeer is \"a load of rubbish.\"\n\n\"This is all made up and hyperbole,\" she said. \"There are no restraining orders, injunctions or interdicts anywhere. There's just no way. I've not had the police at my door about any of these things.\n\n\"It's a load of rubbish. I don't have any money but I'm a perfectly capable lawyer so I will represent myself.\"\n\nAs for the interview, which was recorded earlier this week, Harvey told The Daily Record that she wasn't happy with Morgan and his line of questioning. \"It seemed to me that I was set up,\" she said. \"I feel a bit used.\"\n\nThe whole thing is a bit tawdry, but I suppose that's how these things are. As I said above, life is often stranger than fiction, but here we have real life bleeding into a fictionalized story and then bleeding right back into real life again in a way that seems almost fitting. After all, in Baby Reindeer Donny never really can let go of Martha. The cycle continues. The end is the beginning.

Morgan announced her guest appearance on social media on Wednesday, May 8.\n\nWhile teasing the upcoming interview, the British TV personality shared a photo of himself and Harvey from his Uncensored studio and claimed she \"wants to have her say and 'set the record straight.'\"\n\nHarvey's first TV appearance comes after she previously gave an anonymous interview to The Daily Mail, in which she claimed she was considering taking legal action against Gadd and Netflix, and then later publicly revealed her identity as the alleged real-life Martha in an early May interview with the U.K. outlet The Daily Record.\n\nIn Baby Reindeer, which Gadd both wrote and stars in as a fictional version of himself named Donny Dunn, the Scottish comedian examines how he was stalked by a woman who sent him over 40,000 emails and 350 hours of voicemail messages over four years. Actress Jessica Gunning plays the woman, renamed Martha, in the series.\n\nSince the seven-episode miniseries' release on April 11, it's become a sleeper hit for Netflix and garnered acclaim. As more viewers tuned into the series, it also prompted speculation among some fans of the true identities of Martha and the character Darrien, a man who sexually assaults Donny (played in the series by Tom Goodman-Hill).\n\nAs Gadd had previously said in interviews he went to \"great lengths\" to disguise the identity of the woman who inspired Martha, he was also quick to shut down viewers' speculation.\n\n\"That's not the point of our show,\" he wrote in a since-expired statement that he shared to Instagram Stories, per Deadline.\n\nGunning has also spoken out about how \"Netflix and Richard really didn't want\" viewers to try to find the real people behind the series.\n\nIn an interview with Dazed, she said, \"I think it's really sad if that is happening because they clearly haven't watched the show in the right way and haven't got the message of the show.\"", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie Claire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Goodman-Hill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Goodman-Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sleeper hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/opiWAh6np3sYaQzcauKTKL-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 610, "textEnd": 615}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 701, "textEnd": 706}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 1615, "textEnd": 1623}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

While the hearing was generally about policy around British film and \"high-end television\" and also included execs from Prime Video U.K., NBCUniversal International, and Paramount, one Paraliament committee member asked King about Baby Reindeer in particular, pointing out that fans had seemingly found the real-life identity of the woman who was the basis of the stalker of the show.\n\n\"Baby Reindeer is an extraordinary story, and it is obviously a true story of the horrific abuse that the writer and protagonist, Richard Gadd, suffered at the hands of a convicted stalker,\" King began. \"We did take every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story in the making of the show while also striking a balance of veracity and authenticity of Richard's story, because we didn't want to anonymize that or make it generic to the point where it was no longer his story, because that would undermine the intent behind the show.\"\n\n\"I personally wouldn't be comfortable with a world in which we decided it was better that Richard was silenced.\n\nAs King noted, the creator and star of Baby Reindeer, comedian Richard Gadd, tells the true story of his extensive stalking situation in the British series. Gadd has previously spoken about the lengths he went to in order to keep viewers from being able to find the woman that the stalker character, Martha (played by Jessica Gunning), is based on, but as Baby Reindeer surged in popularity, online sleuths seemingly tracked her down.\n\nAfter fans claimed to have found another real-life person portrayed in the series, former Gadd collaborator Sean Foley, Gadd released a statement saying, \"Please don't speculate on who any of the real life people could be. That's not the point of our show.\" Foley said on X/Twitter that police had been investigating \"all defamatory abusive and threatening posts against me\" in the wake of fans accusing him of being portrayed in the series.\n\nDuring the hearing, King further defended Baby Reindeer and Netflix's approach to its real-life subject, adding that they worked with U.K. stalker helpline Suzy Lamplugh Trust in the promotion and launch of the series.\n\n\"Richard Gadd was very clear that that was not the intent of the show, that it should inspire people to try and track down the real-life individuals,\" King added. \"Ultimately, it's obviously difficult to control what viewers do, particularly in a world where everything is amplified by social media. But fundamentally, this is about Richard's story and telling Richard's story in a truthful way. I personally wouldn't be comfortable with a world in which we decided it was better that Richard was silenced and not allowed to tell his story.\"\n\nKing went on to say that they're \"following the situation very closely.\" When asked if the production had reached out to the real-life Martha in the making of the series, King said it wouldn't be \"appropriate\" for him to delve into specifics, and that he didn't \"want to give further fuel to some of the theories which are circling on the internet.\"\n\nMartha Seemingly Comes Forward\n\nDespite the attempted secrecy on the part of the production, a woman that's been targeted by fans and is claiming to be the woman that Baby Reindeer's Martha is based on, Fiona Harvey, has come forward herself. Piers Morgan announced earlier today that he's conducting an interview with Harvey, which will air on Thursday, and that she wants to \"set the record straight.\"\n\nHarvey previously said in an interview with Daily Record UK that she's considering legal action due to the disruption to her life that's come from the series.\n\nBaby Reindeer debuted on Netflix on April 11 and has since become a massive hit for the streaming platform, regularly appearing at the top of its Top 10 most-viewed chart. It's gotten raves from critics as well, with IGN's own 9/10 review saying it \"pulls no punches and raises the bar for Netflix originals.\"\n\nAlex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

She is evidently an emotionally unstable individual with a volatile personality, much more to be pitied than condemned.\n\nThrough the interview, she repeatedly appeared to lie and contradict herself, while throwing insults and wallowing in self-pity.\n\nPiers Morgan last night with Fiona Harvey, the inspiration for Martha, where she gave a bombshell interview on his YouTube show Uncensored\n\nThe writer and star of Baby Reindeer, comedian Richard Gadd, was 'psychotic' and 'the ultimate misogynist', she said. 'He's got extreme psychiatric problems.' Whether any of these statements about Gadd are accurate is doubtful.\n\nBut I ask again what sort of society treats this as entertainment? She calls it a 'bizarre circus' herself. What has this country become, that we goad a woman to justify herself after she has been labelled 'mad' in a TV drama based (without her permission) on an episode in her life?\n\nI'll tell you what sort of society -- one that trumpets the sanctimonious catchphrase #BeKind like a national slogan.\n\nNaturally, Harvey's appearance on Uncensored, aired from 8.30pm and instantly viewed by more than half a million people, will not be the final word.\n\nBaby Reindeer, the seven-part comedy drama, currently the most popular series on Netflix with record-breaking audience figures in the UK and the US, is a combination of cringeworthy memoir and horror movie. At the end of every episode, viewers are told that it is based on a true story -- one that is thinly fictionalised, it must be said.\n\nIn the opening scene, Donny -- played by Gadd -- is a scrawny, bearded millennial with a desperate need for attention who is working as a barman in a London pub when a tearful woman (played by Jessica Gunning) sits down at the bar.\n\nJessica Gunning plays Martha in the hit Netflix show Baby Reindeer which is based on a true story\n\nFiona is evidently an emotionally unstable individual with a volatile personality, much more to be pitied than condemned, writes Chris Stevens\n\nShe is based on Harvey, but given the name 'Martha' to disguise her real identity, the writer has said. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to protect Harvey from internet sleuths.\n\nHe gives her a cup of tea on the house, flirts a little and makes her laugh. Over the next few weeks, she comes in regularly, and the flirting becomes sexual banter -- which Martha takes seriously.\n\nFiona Harvey admits she used to go to The Hawley Arms in Camden, London, and chat to Gadd behind the bar. But she denied emphatically that the drama is a truthful reflection of what happened next - a terrifying, obsessive campaign of stalking.\n\nHarvey is accused of sending Gadd 41,000 emails, 350 hours of voice messages, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages and 106 letters. 'That's simply not true,' she insisted. 'If I was sending someone 41,000 emails or something, they'd be doing how many a day? Lots. I don't think I sent him anything... No, I think there may have been a couple of emails exchanging... Just jokey banter emails.'\n\nShe went on to protest there were fewer than ten emails, just 18 tweets and one letter. When Morgan asked who had sent all the other messages Gadd claimed to have received (many of which are quoted in the show), she retorted, 'I have no idea. I think he's probably made it up.'\n\nThe voicemails must have been recordings made surreptitiously in the pub while she was talking, she suggested. 'I've not phoned the guy. I don't have his number.' Who isn't being entirely truthful? Both of them?\n\nGadd's character Donny states in the first episode of Baby Reindeer that his tormentor had previously been jailed for conducting similar campaigns: 'I had a convicted stalker stalking me.'\n\nIn fact, though Harvey has been accused of making other people's lives miserable with her obsessive messaging, she was never jailed for it. That's a figment of Gadd's imagination -- as is the conclusion of the drama, where Martha pleads guilty to intimidation and is sentenced to a further nine months.\n\n'That's completely untrue,' Harvey said. 'Very, very defamatory to me, very career damaging. I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, This is just complete nonsense.'\n\nREAD MORE: The real-life 'Martha' from Baby Reindeer is now targeting ME: I've had a four-day barrage of non-stop calls and terrifying messages just like on the Netflix show, writes NEIL SEARS. As I type, the phone is ringing again...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt must be said -- and to his credit -- that Piers Morgan trod carefully, challenging her more dubious statements but never hectoring or pressuring her. He pointed out contradictions in what she was saying but, commendably, did not attempt to dismantle her testimony, as he might do with a politician.\n\nHe afforded her the chance to open fire on both Gadd and Netflix who, she says, are making millions out of libelling her - 'milking it for all it's worth'.\n\n'We've had no apologies from Netflix or him, nothing. My character seems to have smashed up a bar, sexually assaulted him in a canal... That's not true.'\n\nLooking understandably anxious and upset, Harvey answered every question without hesitation. When Morgan showed her clips from the series, her face remained impassive.\n\nShe seemed more distressed to see clips of YouTube podcasters discussing the show and commenting on her character -- something that would surely leave most people shaken.\n\nEven when accusing Gadd of lying about her, Harvey kept her voice level. There was no shouting, no hysterics. She had no option but to try to clear her name, she said, adding: 'On the internet, sleuths tracked me down and hounded me and gave me death threats. So it wasn't really a choice. I was forced into this situation.'\n\nAsked whether she had watched Baby Reindeer, she said: 'I haven't watched any of it.' 'You're not curious?' Piers asked.\n\n'No, I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.' She also denied attacking one of Gadd's girlfriends in a jealous rage: 'No, I don't think he had a girlfriend. I think he's, say, homosexual.'\n\nShe added: 'He's done bloody well out of defaming me. He's making money out of untrue facts. He's been the ultimate misogynist.' All she wanted to say to him was, 'get a life, get a proper job. Leave me alone please'.\n\nBut after stepping so decisively into the spotlight, there's no chance that Fiona Harvey will be left alone any time soon.

I've never been sent to jail. That is blatantly obvious,\" she said.\n\n\"This is all made up and hyperbole. There are no restraining orders, injunctions, or interdicts anywhere. There's just no way.

Because Gadd pulled from personal experience to craft the true crime tale, journalists and internet sleuths have attempted to track down the real people behind Baby Reindeer's characters.\n\nThe focus has fallen on two characters in particular: the stalker Martha, played by Jessica Gunning, and the creative mentor Darrien who drugged and sexually assaulted Gadd, played by Tom Goodman-Hill. The fever burned so hot and inspired so many stories that Gadd took to Instagram to urge fans to stop the speculation because innocent people were getting caught in the mess. \"That's not the point of our show,\" he posted.\n\nNot everyone heeded the call. Piers Morgan teased a \"world exclusive\" interview on Wednesday, announcing that he's booked a woman named Fiona Harvey who claims to be Gadd's stalker. \"Fiona Harvey wants to have her say & 'set the record straight,'\" Morgan detailed in a post on X, along with a photo of the newsman standing behind Harvey on the set of his Piers Morgan Uncensored. The post went viral and has drawn a range of reactions with some questioning the moral responsibility of engaging with someone who may be suffering from mental illness.\n\nCoincidentally, Morgan's post came hours after Baby Reindeer came up during a U.K. parliament hearing focused on British film and television projects and featuring Netflix policy chief Benjamin King. He told lawmakers that the streamer and producers at Clerkenwell Films took \"every reasonable precaution\" to disguise the identities of the people who inspired Gadd's work, which started out as a stage play of the same name.\n\nBaby Reindeer follows Gadd's Donny Dunn, a struggling comedian who encounters a lonely woman at the bar where he works. The chance encounter, during which he offers her a cup of tea on the house, spirals as Martha is revealed to be a dangerous, serial stalker. Over the course of multiple years, she sent him more than 41,000 emails, 744 tweets, 100 pages of letters and 350 hours of voicemails. \"It was relentless and felt like it was everywhere, and I felt like my life wasn't really functioning. I still had these unbelievable pangs of feeling sorry for her,\" he said during a TV Academy panel in L.A. on Tuesday night, adding that he never thought of her as a villain in his story. \"I saw someone who was lost by the system, really. I saw someone who needed help and wasn't getting it.\"\n\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, King also said that while precautions were taken, \"We didn't want to anonymize that or make it generic to the point where it was no longer his story because that would undermine the intent behind the show,\" he said. \"Ultimately, it's obviously very difficult to control what viewers do, particularly in a world where everything is amplified by social media.

The seven-part series is based on Gadd's real-life experiences of being a victim of stalking, sexual assault and abuse.\n\nOn May 8, Morgan revealed that a woman named Fiona Harvey, who claims Martha is based on her, will be on the May 9 episode of his show, Piers Morgan Uncensored.\n\nPeople on X (formerly Twitter) aren't impressed with the British journalist's decision to have Harvey on his show, with many slamming it for being \"irresponsible\" and \"vile.\"\n\nNewsweek emailed a spokesperson for Morgan for comment on Thursday.\n\n\"*WORLD EXCLUSIVE* The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show. Fiona Harvey wants to have her say & 'set the record straight.' Is she a psycho stalker? Find out tomorrow on \u2066@PiersUncensored,\" Morgan posted on X, alongside a photo of himself and Harvey in his studio.\n\nAt the time of writing, the post had been viewed 7.6 million times.\n\nPeople have flocked to the comments and replies to share their disdain for the interview.\n\n\"Exploiting someone who is - if baby reindeer is accurate in its representation - very clearly mentally unwell in the name of \"setting the record straight\" not only puts her in danger but also allows richard gadd's (likely) trauma to be debated for what?? fun?? vile,\" one person wrote.\n\n\"Men like piers morgan will cry about male victims not getting the same recognition as female victims, and then go ahead and platform their abuser/stalker when they do,\" said another.\n\n\"This story has highlighted the many issues we have in British journalism when it comes to duty of care to contributors and training on mental health reporting. This woman is clearly mentally unwell + vulnerable. Journalists need to stop giving her air time so they can go 'viral,'\" a third person commented.\n\nA different X user added: \"This woman is mentally ill. This is irresponsible.\"\n\nHowever, others shared how much they are looking forward to the interview.\n\n\"Must see TV!!! Would be awesome if the Baby Reindeer interview broke the Donald Trump viewership record for Piers Morgan Uncensored,\" one person wrote.\n\n\"This is just completely irresponsible and downright exploitative and for those reasons I will absolutely be tuning in,\" said another.\n\nThe Netflix series has gone viral since its release on April 11 and many online have speculated about Gadd's story, including who the real person is behind Martha. Despite people's curiosity, Gadd previously asked fans on his Instagram stories to respect people's privacy.\n\n\"Please don't speculate on who any of the real-life people could be. That's not the point of our show.

But she did admit that she met Gadd\n\n\"I should never have gone into that bar,\" Ms Marsh said of the pub in London where the accused staling began.\n\nThe chilling Netflix drama was inspired by real-life events suffered by the leading man Richard Gadd, who plays Donny Dunn in the show.\n\nGadd claims to have received 41,071 emails, 744 tweets, 106 pages of letters and 350 hours of voicemail from the woman who inspired the character Martha Scott.\n\nIn the show, Martha developed an obsession with Donny after he gives her a cup of tea for free at the pub where he worked as a bartender because \"he feels sorry for her\".\n\nWriting on her Facebook social media page after recording the interview with Morgan, Ms Harvey wrote: \"Piers is a twerp.

In a testy YouTube interview with Piers Morgan, she explained her reasons for believing the story is false enough to deserve her filing a lawsuit against Gadd, Netflix, and others associated with the series.\n\nIn the nearly one-hour-long interview, Harvey denied stalking Gadd, saying it was \"completely untrue\" and \"very defamatory to me.... I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail. I've got no injunctions.\"\n\nRelatedIs 'Baby Reindeer' Based on a True Story?\n\nHarvey complained that she received no apologies from Gadd, the streaming service, or others associated with the show, even after being harassed by \"internet sleuths\": \"[They] tracked me down and hounded me and gave me death threats, so it wasn't really a choice [to come forward].\"\n\nIn late April, shortly after the show's debut, Gadd did implore audiences not to try to seek out the real-life people who'd inspired the series in a social media post, writing, \"That's not the point of our show.\" Meanwhile, Netflix's policy chief said at a UK Parliament hearing that the streamer took \"every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story.\"\n\nThough Harvey claimed she had not watched Baby Reindeer, she took issue with the portrayal of Martha, saying, \"It's a work of fiction. It's a work of hyperbole, as I've always said. And there are two true facts in that. His name is Richard Gadd, and he works as a jobbing barman on benefits, in the Hawley Arms. And we met, two or three times.\"\n\nShe went on to say that she \"doubted\" he could prove his story by producing hundreds of voicemails from her, claiming that the only way it could happen is if he'd recorded her at the bar. She also said it was \"categorically\" untrue that he'd ever been caught peeping in her window and it was \"simply not true\" that she sent the number of emails and social media messages the show claims Martha did -- \"There may have been a couple of emails,\" she said, adding there were \"about 18 tweets,\" zero Facebook messages, and \"a couple of emails\" in all. She also denied ever heckling him at a comedy show.\n\nOne bit she did concede may be based in reality is the source of the show's title, admitting that she did have a reindeer toy, and saying, \"I had a toy reindeer and he'd shaved his head, that bit is true, and there were reindeers in the shops because it was Christmas time or something. It was a joke. So I have inadvertently penned the name of the show.\"\n\nHarvey went on to suggest Gadd had \"extreme psychiatric problems.\" Her ultimate message to Gadd? \"Leave me alone, please, and get a life, get a proper job.\"\n\nWatch the full interview in the embed above.\n\nBaby Reindeer, Netflix\n\nMore Headlines:\n\nAfter 'Baby Reindeer,' Fiona Harvey, Who Claims Martha Is Based on Her, Has Fiery Interview With Piers Morgan: Here Are the Highlights'9-1-1' Star Ryan Guzman on Buck & Eddie: 'It's Baby Steps Towards Anything & If Anything'Taye Diggs Returning to 'All American' -- How Can Dead Billy Baker Come Back?'Frasier' Season 2 Begins Production, Peri Gilpin Returning as Roz DoyleWill 'Mary & George' End Like the Book?

The Netflix show follows a comedian who is stalked by a woman named Martha and is a dramatisation of Gadd's real experience with an alleged stalker.\n\nREAD MORE: Baby Reindeer's 'real Martha' slams 'bully' Piers Morgan hours before interview airs\n\nREAD MORE: Click for more brilliant Daily Star TV stories\n\nIt has been a huge hit and fans had been desperate to find out the identity of the real Martha, even though the comic urged people to stop digging. During the interview, Fiona told Piers the show is \"horrifying and misogynistic\" and she won't watch it because it'll make her \"sick\".\n\nSpeaking on Morgan's new YouTube channel, she continued: \"I haven't watched any of it. I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. \"I find it quite obscene. I've had a horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that. And it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nSince recording the interview, Piers has reflected in his latest The Sun column. He wrote: \"I also found it very strange that she admitted to having up to 6 email addresses, and 4 mobile phones which she 'used for different people. That's not normal. She also made a series of emphatic blanket denials about how long she knew Gadd, and how much contact she had with him, that are provably false.\n\nThe claim that she only sent him one letter, when he says he has 105, seems especially disingenuous.

She also denied assaulting Gadd's former girlfriend and said she did not sexually assault Gadd on a canal path.\n\nHarvey acknowledged that she had met Gadd in a London pub, but said she had only seen him \"five [or] six times\" during her life. She admitted sending him some \"jokey banter emails.\"\n\nHarvey claimed she had not watched Baby Reindeer, but argued that Gadd was \"completely off his head\" and questioned his mental wellbeing.\n\n\"He is lying and they [Netflix] are lying,\" Harvey told Morgan. \"They have billed it as a true story, so has he, and it's not. It's blatantly not.\" In a message to Gadd, she added: \"Leave me alone please.\"\n\nNetflix has been contacted for comment. Benjamin King, Netflix UK's senior public policy director, said on Wednesday that the streamer could not control social media speculation and was not prepared to censor Gadd.\n\n\"I personally wouldn't be comfortable with a world in which we decided it was better that Richard was silenced and not allowed to tell the story,\" he told a UK Parliament hearing.\n\nBaby Reindeer launched on Netflix with little fanfare but has exploded on the streamer, amassing nearly 54M views since debuting on April 11.

She will speak with Piers Morgan in an interview, and the British broadcaster has shared a photo with her on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nPiers shared a photo with Fiona and wrote, \"*WORLD EXCLUSIVE* The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show. Fiona Harvey wants to have her say & 'set the record straight.' Is she a psycho stalker?

The disturbing adaptation of the true story sparked an internet wide hunt for the person the story was based on. It didn't take long (in fact, only a few days) as \"Martha Scott\" was outed as one Fiona Harvey, and the woman herself confirmed as much shortly after being discovered.\n\nFiona promised that and she would set the record straight after saying the Netflix show made her look bad. Up until now we've only had Gadd's side of the story, but Harvey's recent interview with Piers Morgan has provided some surprising revelations that give an entirely new perspective on what went down, so here are some of Fiona's most shocking claims.\n\nAccording to the show, \"Martha\" supposedly went to jail twice. Once before she entered \"Donny's\" life and once again afterwards. But Fiona claims that this was never the case; when asked by Morgan whether she had ever been to prison, she replied \"of course not.\" That means, if Harvey is being truthful, that the scene where Martha pleads guilty at the end of the show must have have happened. There would be police files to prove that Harvey went to jail, but she seemed confident there would be no such records of her ever being sent to prison.\n\nAlthough she didn't deny being in the company of Gadd on a number of occasions, Fiona Harvey says that she didn't stalk him the way the show presented it. The stories she tells to Piers change a few times over the course of the hour interview, in some instances she claims that she only met Gadd \"maybe 5 or 6 times\" and then she says they were friends, and then she says that her interactions with him only spanned 2 to 3 months. She also claims that she hadn't seen him in 12 years, although a few of her tweets were from less than 12 years ago. Either way, Harvey admits that the play and subsequent show came as a surprise.\n\nExplaining to Piers why she made the decision to come on the show Harvey claims that internet sleuths tracked her down and sent her death threats so coming on the show \"wasn't really a choice, I was forced into this situation.\" The internet can be brutal sometimes so it's certainly possible that she's telling the truth when she says \"some of the death threats have been really terrible online.\"\n\nWhen asked if she'd actually watched Baby Reindeer, she told Piers, \"not at all [...] I haven't watched any of it.\" Explaining why she'd avoided it thus far she said, \"I think I'd be sick, it's taken over enough of my life, I find it quite obscene, I find it horrifying.\" Telling Piers that the show is \"not really my kind of drama\" she clearly was not a fan of the decisions made in portraying her character.\n\nHarvey denied a number of events from the show, including the fact that Gadd supposedly gave her free drinks, she claims she never heckled him at a comedy gig, asking \"why would I do that?\" She also denies ever attacking Gadd's girlfriend, and says that she never even knew where he lived, let alone showing up to his house and waiting outside. Those are just a few of the things she denied, although throughout her conversation with Morgan she did confirm a few things, like calling Gadd \"Baby Reindeer,\" and that the \"hanging curtains\" remark was real.\n\nPiers Morgan decided to focus on the emails, quizzing Fiona on them for a good portion of the interview. She denied she sent anything at first, but then later admitted that she did send a few messages, \"I don't think I sent him anything [...] there may have been a couple of emails.\" When questioned further by Morgan she'd be happy for someone to check her computer or phone to prove she never sent all those emails.\n\nThere were supposedly around 41,000 emails sent but Fiona claims she only sent around ten. She did admit to having multiple different email addresses, six in total which is probably a bit more than the average person would have.\n\nSaying the comedian was \"full of himself,\" Fiona claims that Gadd needed help as well as implying he's a hypocrite, \"for someone who says he feels sorry for me, I've had no apology.\" She claims that the whole show is just an attack on her by Gadd, and a way to him to make money. She also went on to say that he was actually the one obsessed with her saying, \"Leave me alone please, get a life, get a proper job.\" She also believes that Gadd wanted her to be found as a way of hurting her with Morgan, agreeing that there wasn't a lot done to protect her identity, \"I've been a journalist 40 years, I could have discovered it was you in about 10 minutes.\"\n\nShe claims that she did a law degree at Aberdeen University, as well as stating she had a photographic memory, although she avoided answering Morgan's question regarding what grade she got for her degree. When she did finally answer, it was a non-committal response, saying she did got \"alright\" grades. She also apparently got a trainee job at a law firm in the 90's. When Piers read that her boss claimed to have sacked her after a few days, Harvey denied this and claimed that she resigned.\n\nHarvey has already threatened a lawsuit against Gadd and Netflix, as the streaming giant defamed her. When Morgan asked her \"and you will categorically be taking legal action,\" she replied, \"absolutely against both him and Netflix.\" She also doubled down on the fact that when it goes to court they will find none of the emails Gadd claims he received, \"I wouldn't be suing if I thought there were 41,000 emails out there.\"\n\nThis is a pretty major part of the entire story, and yet another thing that Harvey claims is completely untrue. In fact, she says that Gadd actually asked her to sleep with him, however, she brushed him off telling Morgan \"I don't fancy little boys without jobs.\"\n\nHow true is any of what Fiona told Piers? It's up for debate; she seems incredibly confident that there is absolutely no evidence to prove Gadd's story, but we'll likely find out if she pushes on with her lawsuit and this goes to court.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_collins@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Jordan Collins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eidetic memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Aberdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hypocrisy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Anomalous_People", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Anomalous People", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Piers-Morgan-Baby-Reindeer.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

In a testy YouTube interview with Piers Morgan, she explained her reasons for believing the story is false enough to deserve her filing a lawsuit against Gadd, Netflix, and others associated with the series.\n\nIn the nearly one-hour-long interview, Harvey denied stalking Gadd, saying it was \"completely untrue\" and \"very defamatory to me.... I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail. I've got no injunctions.\"\n\nRelatedIs 'Baby Reindeer' Based on a True Story?\n\nHarvey complained that she received no apologies from Gadd, the streaming service, or others associated with the show, even after being harassed by \"internet sleuths\": \"[They] tracked me down and hounded me and gave me death threats, so it wasn't really a choice [to come forward].\"\n\nIn late April, shortly after the show's debut, Gadd did implore audiences not to try to seek out the real-life people who'd inspired the series in a social media post, writing, \"That's not the point of our show.\" Meanwhile, Netflix's policy chief said at a UK Parliament hearing that the streamer took \"every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story.\"\n\nThough Harvey claimed she had not watched Baby Reindeer, she took issue with the portrayal of Martha, saying, \"It's a work of fiction. It's a work of hyperbole, as I've always said. And there are two true facts in that. His name is Richard Gadd, and he works as a jobbing barman on benefits, in the Hawley Arms. And we met, two or three times.\"\n\nShe went on to say that she \"doubted\" he could prove his story by producing hundreds of voicemails from her, claiming that the only way it could happen is if he'd recorded her at the bar. She also said it was \"categorically\" untrue that he'd ever been caught peeping in her window and it was \"simply not true\" that she sent the number of emails and social media messages the show claims Martha did -- \"There may have been a couple of emails,\" she said, adding there were \"about 18 tweets,\" zero Facebook messages, and \"a couple of emails\" in all. She also denied ever heckling him at a comedy show.\n\nMore from this section Insane Like Me?

He wrote the series which documented Donny's strange and layered relationship with a woman named Martha, played by Jessica Gunning, whose initially friendly demeanour unravels as she begins to stalk Donny relentlessly.\n\nDuring the course of multiple years, Martha sends Donny more than 41,000 emails, 744 tweets, 100 pages of letters and 350 hours of voicemails. It is on course to become one of the streaming platform's most watched shows. In a bid \"to set the record straight\", the woman claiming to be the real-life Martha Scott has spoken to former Good Morning Britain news anchor Piers Morgan.\n\nThe woman, who the Mirror has chosen not to name or identify via photographs, has revealed what message she has for Baby Reindeer creator Richard Gadd. During the sit down interview with Piers Morgan he asked what she would say to him if he was watching.\n\nShe replied: \"Leave me alone, please. Get a life, get a proper job. I am horrified at what you've done.\" The woman also revealed she hasn't watched the Netflix series. Asked if she had seen it, she said: \"Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff... I haven't watched any of it.\"\n\nRichard Gadd wrote and starred in the Netflix series Baby Reindeer\n\nPiers asked: \"You're not curious, too?\" She replied: \"No, I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nPiers Morgan's sit down interview aired at 8pm on Thursday night and ahead of the show, it appeared the woman was already having regrets. She claims the controversial broadcaster \"triggered\" her emotions during their sit-down for his YouTube channel - and then branded him a \"bully\" and a \"twerp\".\n\nThe law graduate, who claims to be the woman accused in Richard Gadd's drama series, said yes to the star because she wanted to air her side of the story. But she denies suggestions she is cashing in on the hit show. The woman claimed she earned just a few hundred pounds from her trip to London. She told her connections on Facebook: \"Piers is a twerp. But we [already] know this. You will see in my interview I'll let the [interview] speak for itself. Piers is a bully, we all know that. He triggers emotions. But this interview will get more views.

The programme tells the story of writer and comedian Richard Gadd's experience of being stalked by a woman named Martha in the show. In Gadd's seven part series, Martha is a terrifying stalker who winds up with a nine month jail sentence for a campaign of harassment against the comic after meeting him in a Camden pub.\n\nDuring an interview with Piers Morgan tonight, she claims several things were untrue about the Netflix show - including that he never offered her a free cup of tea, and she never messaged him as much as she said she did.\n\nRichard Gadd wrote the Netflix show Baby Reindeer\n\nThe Netflix show is marketed as a 'true story'. However, in the interview, she told Piers: \"It's completely untrue. Very, very defamatory to me, very career-damaging. And I wanted to rebut that completely on this show. I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions. And this is just complete nonsense.\"\n\nOffer of tea\n\nThe \"real life\" Martha disputed that she had been offered a free cup of tea when he was working in the pub. Asked directly about that, she said it was untrue. She explained: \"No, that's not correct. He didn't offer me a cup of tea... I was in for a meal with, a drink of lemonade, and I was very, very hungry. I'm diabetic, so, very hungry. So that's true.\"\n\nCorrespondence\n\nIn the show, Martha sent 41,000 emails, 350 hours of voice messages, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages, and 106 letters to Gadd but the self-proclaimed \"Martha\" has denied this was the case in her experience, insisting she did have correspondence with him but not of this volume.\n\nAsked about this, she said: \"That's simply not true. If somebody was sending somebody 41,000 emails or something, they'd be doing how many a day? Lots.\" When asked what she did send, she later added: \"Now, none of that's true. I don't think I sent him anything... No, I think there may have been a couple of emails exchanging, but that was it. Just jokey banter emails. There may have been a couple of emails,\" but insisted she never sent text messages or Facebook messages.\n\nJessica Gunning plays Martha in the show\n\nWhen asked if she tweeted him, she added: \"I may have done years and years ago... No, it wasn't numerous. It's about 18 tweets.\"\n\nSmashing up a bar\n\nThe 'real life' Martha has insisted she never smashed up a bar. She told Piers tonight: \"We've had no apologies from Netflix or him, nothing. I mean, for someone who says he feels sorry for me, I've had no apology. My character seems to have smashed up a bar, sexually assaulted him in a canal, been to prison. There are a number of other allegations, and... That's not true.\"\n\nJail time\n\nShe also denied she has ever faced prison for what happened. The 'real life' Martha has said she did not watch the show and has no plans to - admitting she'd be \"sick\" if she ever laid eyes on the Netflix show.\n\nAsked if she's seen it, she told Piers: \"Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff... I haven't watched any of it. I think I'd be sick [if I watched it]. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nWhat is true\n\nDuring the interview, the woman claiming to be the 'real life' Martha called the show a 'work of fiction', and said there were just two true facts in it.\n\n\"It's a work of fiction.

The individual, who The Mirror has chosen not to name or photograph, insists she's the inspiration behind stalker Martha.\n\nNetflix's Baby Reindeer tells the story of writer and comedian Richard Gadd's experience of being stalked by a woman named Martha in the show. In Gadd's seven part series, Martha is a terrifying stalker who winds up with a nine month jail sentence for a campaign of harassment against the Fifer comic after meeting him in a Camden pub.\n\nSince the show hit the streaming service, the 'real Martha' said she is considering legal action to 'right the wrongs of the show' in which she claims that she is portrayed as a terrifying stalker. The 'real Martha' also vowed to represent herself in court as a 'perfectly capable lawyer' after having her life turned upside down by the Netflix series, said to be based on her relationship with Gadd.\n\nMartha is played by an English actress in the Netflix series\n\nPiers announced yesterday that he recently sat down for a chat with the 'real-life Martha', with their pre-recorded conversation set to air on the former Good Morning Britain anchor's YouTube channel at 8pm this evening. Ahead of the 'real-life Martha's' first-ever televised interview airing, Lorraine spoke about the upcoming chat on Thursday's show.\n\nLorraine said: \"That's Piers Morgan there with the 'real-life Martha' from Netflix's hit show, Baby Reindeer, his interview is going to be out later today. Apparently, the stalking drama was based on her with [actress] Jessica Gunning playing a version of her in the show but it's also a drama, it was based on real true life. I just hope the 'real-life Martha' is actually alright, that she's okay and she's going to be fine to be interviewed...\"\n\nTaking to Twitter (X) to promote the upcoming interview, Piers yesterday shared an image of himself and the woman on the set of his Piers Morgan Uncensored YouTube show and boasted: \"*WORLD EXCLUSIVE* The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show.\n\nHe continued: \"[Redacted] wants to have her say & 'set the record straight.'

In the 30-minute show, Harvey will talk openly about being outed as the Scots comedian's alleged stalker.\n\nShe will be grilled regarding allegations that she became obsessed with the Fife-born comic over a period of years - inspiring the character of Martha in Gadd's hit Netflix drama.\n\nFiona told how Piers refused to accept her denial that she stalked Gadd, as she told us: \"There was a heavy emphasis from Piers Morgan on Gadd and the emails I am supposed to have sent.\n\n\"I have my own thoughts on it that I'd like to keep to myself but I wouldn't say I was happy. It was very rapid to try to trip me up. He did it fast paced to catch me off guard.\n\n\"Piers kept saying to me 'are you sure you haven't sent this guy 41,000 emails and phone calls?'. A lot of the interview, for a good 10 minutes, he kept coming back to this.\n\n\"I said, 'Look, Even if I had sent some emails, it doesn't mean I'm guilty of the rest of the stuff'. As I said, in order to bill something as a true story, it's got to be pretty much 100% true.\n\n\"It seemed to me that I was set up. I feel a bit used.\"\n\nIn the show Gadd, 34, plays a fictionalised version of himself called Donny Dunn who is ruthlessly stalked by a Scot called Martha. The show tells viewers it is based on a \"true story\".\n\nGadd asked viewers not to try and track down the real-life Martha. But they defied his plea and found clues that revealed her identity, including references to a Baby Reindeer bar scene in which Martha asks for help getting her curtains hung only to face a barrage of innuendo.\n\nThe sleuths identified a social media post sent on September 23, 2014, in which Harvey tweeted, \"@MrRichardGadd my curtains need hung badly.\"\n\nEnglish actress Jessica Gunning, 38, plays Martha, a Scottish woman in her 40s who, like Harvey, lives in Camden and studied law. The Netflix show has become the most viewed programme on Netflix in 30 countries.\n\nAnd now viewers will be able to watch as the real 'Martha' goes head to head with Piers Morgan to offer up her side of the story....", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eve_beattie@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Eve Beattie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scots law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeenshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aberdeenshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aberdeenshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scots language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Camden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Camden"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Camden"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32770358.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Screenshot-2024-05-08-at-165334.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-09-23", "textStart": 2311, "textEnd": 2329}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

That's not the point of the show.'\n\nSNP MP John Nicolson, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, added that efforts hadn't stopped fans finding the real life Martha onlin.\n\nBut Mr King said Netflix needed to balance protecting identities with upholding the 'veracity and authenticity' of the show.\n\n'We didn't want to anonymise that or make it generic to the point where it was no longer his story because that would undermine the intent behind the show,' the senior public policy director said.\n\n'Ultimately, it's obviously very difficult to control what viewers do, particularly in a world where everything is amplified by social media.\n\n'I personally wouldn't be comfortable with a world in which we decided it was better that Richard was silenced and not allowed to tell the story.'\n\nMr Nicolson also asked if Netflix had given any support to the woman identified online as Richard's stalker - who is set to do a TV interview this week.\n\nMr Nicolson also asked if Netflix had given any support to the woman identified online as Richard's stalker - who is set to do a TV interview this week.

I don't want to give further fuel to some of the theories which are circling on the internet,' Mr King said.\n\nHe added that Netflix worked closely with the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, a support charity for stalking victims, and the show had raised awareness for male victims.\n\nBaby Reindeer delves into Richard's harrowing real-life stalking ordeal and brutal sexual abuse as he plays a fictionalised version of himself called Donny Dunn.\n\nDonny is flooded with 41,071 emails, 744 tweets, 350 voicemails and 106 pages of letters from stalker Martha, played by Jess Gunning. The series also details Donny's horrifying rape at the hands of his comedy mentor Darrien played by Tom Goodman-Hill.\n\nDarrien coaxes Donny to come to his flat and get high on drugs, by promising him that TV producers are interested in his work.\n\nHowever while on drugs he sexually assaults Donny multiple times.\n\nMr Gadd has opened up about what it was like to re-enact his trauma for the small screen - and how he hopes it will aid his healing process.\n\nOn reliving his 'severe' twenties, Mr Gadd told Attitude: 'It's hugely challenging, but I hope for catharsis when the show comes out.'\n\nBaby Reindeer, the extraordinary hit Netflix drama which has taken the television world by storm, has been viewed more than 60 million times in the past month\n\nThe chilling real-life drama was inspired by the ordeal suffered by Scottish creator and leading man Richard Gadd at the hands of 'Martha' (played by Jessica Gunning, right)\n\nIt comes as the real-life 'Martha' claims she has been bombarded with calls since the show became a global sensation.\n\nThe woman has claimed that since the release of the show, she has been inundated with calls from 'foul-mouthed' publicists or agents trying to book her.\n\nRead More 'I'm the victim.

It is based on series star and creator Richard Gadd's real-life experience with a stalker and as a victim of sexual abuse. The stalker, Martha, is portrayed by Jessica Dunning and quickly endears herself to lead Donny Dunn (Gadd), before turning obsessive, inundating him with emails and phone calls, then eventually showing up outside his home.\n\nHarvey recognized quickly that Martha was based on her, and while Gadd has made it clear that Martha was never meant to be an exact replication of his real-life stalker, Harvey still spoke out, threatening legal action against him.\n\n\"He's using Baby Reindeer to stalk me now,\" she claimed in an interview with The Daily Mail. \"I'm the victim. He's written a bloody show about me.\"\n\nShe added that Gadd was \"bullying an older woman on television for fame and fortune.\"\n\nNow, Harvey is looking to set the record straight, and while the interview hasn't even aired yet, she is already saying she felt \"set up\" by Morgan and that she felt used.\n\n\"Piers kept saying to me 'are you sure you haven't sent this guy 41,000 emails and phone calls?'\" she told the Daily Record, referring to Gadd's claim on the show. \"A lot of the interview, for a good 10 minutes, he kept coming back to this.\n\n\"I said, 'Look, even if I had sent some emails, it doesn't mean I'm guilty of the rest of the stuff,'\" she continued. \"As I said, in order to bill something as a 'true story,' it's got to be pretty much 100 percent true.\"\n\nThe trailer concludes with Morgan pointedly saying to Havey, \"Here's the thing: I don't know the truth. You do. Look down the barrel of that camera. To people who still doubt you, what do you say to them?\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "russell_steinberg@usmagazine.com", "name": "Russell Steinberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Baby-Reindeer-Real-Martha-Faces-Questions-From-Piers-Morgan-in-Interview-Trailer.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 152, "textEnd": 157}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 450, "textEnd": 458}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Gadd subsequently urged viewers to refrain from speculating, saying: \"That's not the point of our show.\"\n\nWho is the real-life Martha in Baby Reindeer?\n\nThe woman chose to publicly reveal her identity this week in an interview with the Daily Record, after a flurry of speculation since the release of the show.\n\nShe is Fiona Harvey, a 58-year-old Scottish lawyer, who in the interview described the show as \"a load of rubbish\".\n\nSpeaking about the decision to come forward, she said she did so \"because people have to know what is going on.\"\n\nShe went on to tell the newspaper that she has not been to prison, adding: \"I don't know where the four-and-a-half years and nine months comes in.\"\n\nThreatening legal action against Gadd and Netflix, she said: \"Gadd needs to prove I went to jail which just didn't happen. I've never been sent to jail. That is blatantly obvious.\n\n\"Police at your door would be the first thing, then you'd be charged, then you would have a trial. Then you'd be fined or something or go to prison.\n\n\"This is all made up and hyperbole. There are no restraining orders, injunctions or interdicts anywhere. There's just no way. I've not had the police at my door about any of these things.\n\n\"It's a load of rubbish. I don't have any money but I'm a perfectly capable lawyer so I will represent myself.\"\n\nHarvey is also due to appear on Piers Morgan Uncensored on May 9, in an attempt to \"set the record straight\".\n\n\"I'm the victim here, not Richard Gadd,\" Harvey also told the Daily Record. \"I've had death threats as a result of his show despite the fact that a lot of the things he claimed are just not true.\"\n\nShe went on to say that she had been getting by on \"two hours sleep\" per night since the show had been released, which she said she had not watched.\n\n\"I was in Richard Gadd's company on occasions but I didn't stalk him like he claims. His story is that this is a gross intrusion into my privacy. I haven't seen him for 12 years.\n\n\"I read that he had written that show for the festival four or five years ago and I thought, 'Oh my God'.

While millions tuned in to Richard Gadd's dramatized account of his real-life experience with a stalker in his 20s, there was one unfortunate consequence he desperately wanted to avoid: revealing Martha's identity.\n\nIn Gadd's defense, the Scottish comedian said that he never told his stalker's name to the media. He also changed key facts about her for the Netflix show, so much so that the woman wouldn't even recognize herself.\n\nIn an interview with GQ in April, Gadd explained that their \"focus was on capturing the emotional truth, not creating a factual profile,\" he said. \"We've gone to such lengths to disguise her that I doubt she would recognize herself in the show.\"\n\nYesterday, Netflix Policy Chief Benjamin King told a UK Parliament that the streamer and producer Clerkenwell Films had taken \"every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story.\"\n\n\"We didn't want to anonymise that or make it generic to the point where it was no longer his story because that would undermine the intent behind the show,\" King said. \"Ultimately, it's obviously very difficult to control what viewers do, particularly in a world where everything is amplified by social media.\"\n\nHowever, their best efforts to hide Martha's identity unraveled when internet sleuths began hunting for clues. Quickly, social media users directed attention to the Twitter account of Fiona Harvey, a woman who sent multiple tweets to Gadd in 2014, one of which was allegedly mentioned in the show.\n\nGadd and Gunning urged the public to stop trying to uncover the identity of his former stalker. \"Please don't speculate on who any of the real life people could be. That's not the point of our show,\" Gadd said in a now-expired Instagram story.\n\nMeanwhile, Gunning told BBC Scotland's The Edit that the speculation around Martha was \"quite sad\" and \"not the point of the show at all.\" She continued, \"If you like the show and you are a fan of it, you should stick with the story of Martha and Donny being what connects you, not trying to do any detective work and find out any real identities.\"\n\nOn April 26, 2024, a woman claiming to be Gadd's stalker anonymously told the Daily Mail that she was considering legal action against Gadd.\n\nThe woman said that Gadd's script amounted to \"bullying an older woman on television for fame and fortune\" and that she had received online \"death threats and abuse from Richard Gadd supporters.\" She insisted that now, Gadd was the one who was obsessed with her.\n\n\"He's using Baby Reindeer to stalk me now,\" she told the tabloid. \"I'm the victim. He's written a bloody show about me.\"\n\nBut the speculation about Martha's identity didn't stop there. Fiona Harvey, the woman that social media sleuths were convinced was Martha, will now be interviewed on Piers Morgan Uncensored on May 9.\n\n\"The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show,\" Morgan wrote in the tweet. \"Fiona Harvey wants to have her say & 'set the record straight.\"\n\nWhen John Nicolson, a Scottish National Party MP who sits on the Culture, Media, and Sport Committee, was asked at the UK Parliament panel whether Netflix had provided any support to Harvey -- who is planning to give an interview with Morgan -- he said that he couldn't get into any details.\n\n\"I cannot get into the specifics of what happened around the making of the show because it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment,\" Nicolson clarified. \"I don't want to give further fuel to some of the theories which are circling on the internet.\"\n\nKing added that Netflix worked with the Suzy Lamplugh Trust to support stalking victims.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score":

So, I actually bought the play text, which is a bit Martha of me.\"\n\nGadd, Gunning, actor Nava Mau, director Weronika Tofilska and editor Peter Oliver served as panelists Tuesday night at the DGA Theater Complex for Netflix's FYC screening and panel for the limited series. The streamer submitted \"Baby Reindeer\" for consideration to be nominated for best limited series at the Emmys, along with Gadd to be considered for best actor and best writing.\n\nAdapted from Gadd's eponymous stage play, which premiered at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2019, \"Baby Reindeer\" follows a fictionalized version of Gadd named Donny who meets a woman named Martha (Gunning) while working in a pub. What starts off as Donny offering her a cup of tea out of sympathy turns into a twisted and complex relationship where Martha wreaks havoc on Donny's relationships. Through his experiences with Martha, Donny is forced to confront the trauma of a past sexual assault and come to terms with his sexuality.\n\nGadd said he went into an \"obsessive place\" to write the series, which started off as his one-man hour-long show. He wrote the series during the COVID-19 lockdown and described the process as difficult and cathartic.\n\n\"I never wanted to kind of lie,\" he said. \"I always had to constantly check myself to be like, 'Does this feel truthful to me to my experience all the way through?' And if it didn't, I would have to bring it back.\"\n\nHe continued to explain that filming episode 4, which depicts scenes of his sexual assault by a writer he worked with, was difficult for the entire crew.\n\n\"We did close the set, but I was looking over and you'd see the props guys wiping tears from their eyes as they would be putting the props back how they should be,\" Gadd said. \"The show was based in such a trauma that everyone on set felt at times it was a huge, weighty thing. And it's why I think everyone had such respect for everything. I was blessed with this amazing team who kind of felt it with me in a lot of ways.\"\n\nGunning explained that Gadd works with We Are Survivors, a nonprofit organization that supports male and nonbinary sexual abuse, rape and sexual exploitation survivors across Greater Manchester. She said since the airing of the series, the organization had a 200% increase in people joining for support, with 60% citing \"Baby Reindeer\" as the reason why they got in touch.\n\nShe also said Gadd's writing helped her tap in to her character Martha, who she describes as a \"really complicated character.\"\n\n\"It's not an easy, buttoned-up story,\" Gunning said. \"Everything doesn't get tied up at the end. I think it's messy, like life is. Their dynamic is complicated and he's really honest about that. That's so refreshing to see. The response to it is shown that audiences are really hungry for that. Hungry for honest, messy storytelling.\"", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_series_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Limited series (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh Festival Fringe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning,_New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gunning, New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gunning, New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Complex Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151989541.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The woman, who the Mirror has chosen not to name or identify via photographs, branded Morgan \"a twerp and a bully\" on her Facebook page since the interview was conducted.\n\nReleased with little promotion of hype at the start of April, Baby Reindeer quickly topped streaming charts across the world and is now on course to become one of Netflix's most-watched series of all time. The comedy-drama tells the chilling tale of writer and star Richard Gadd's character Donny's ordeal with a persistent stalker named Martha, played by Jessica Gunning.\n\nThe seven-episode series - inspired by creator Gadd's actual real-life experiences with stalking and sexual abuse- depicts Martha as an unyielding stalker who ends up behind bars for nine months due to her constant harassment of the Scottish comic, beginning in a Camden pub.\n\nMorgan announced yesterday that he recently sat down for a chat with the 'real-life Martha', dividing fans of the series still dominating cultural conversations and debates weeks on from its premiere. Taking to Twitter today, just hours before the interview airs at 8pm, a delighted Morgan shared a snap of a newspaper's front page dedicated to the upcoming broadcast.\n\n\"Front page news before it even airs....\" Morgan boasted as he captioned the image. However, many of the journalist's followers and critics were quick to share their concerns regarding the controversial interview. \"What could go wrong? Thinking this is maybe not a good idea for anyone participating, on so many levels,\" one Twitter (X) user wrote as they quote-tweeted Morgan's original post.\n\nUndeterred by the criticism, Morgan teased the chat would be bigger than his infamous interview with Cristiano Ronaldo, in which the footballer aired his grievances with Manchester United.\n\nThe fictional Martha was played by Jessica Gunning\n\n\"Not had such a massive global build-up reaction to any of my interviews since Ronaldo. I don't think anyone will be disappointed,\" he posted followed by a series of flame emojis.\n\nDespite Piers' hype, fans were quick to vent their concerns for the 'TV event'.\n\nOne argued: \"Men like piers morgan will cry about male victims not getting the same recognition as female victims, and then go ahead and platform their abuser/stalker when they do.\" A third wrote: \"Hearing Piers Morgan has interviewed the 'real life Martha' portrayed in Baby Reindeer fills me with dread. A vulnerable woman exploited for the entertainment of people who became stalkers themselves. What the fuck are we doing as a society?\"\n\nOthers shared different thoughts on the interview ahead of its premiere, with one musing: \"In two minds about the Martha from Baby Reindeer thing because a) I had my own Martha and was continuously met with expectations to show them grace because they weren't all there while they terrorized me unchecked and also don't think she should be anywhere near Piers poxy Morgan.\"\n\nMany expressed excitement to watch the woman's chat with Morgan, with one admitting: \"Have I cancelled a cinema mate date to watch martha on Piers Morgan with a takeaway? Absolutely.\" Another joked: \"Is this weird? Absolutely. Is this irresponsible? Absolutely. Will I be watching? Absolutely.\"\n\nTaking to Twitter (X) to promote the upcoming interview, Morgan yesterday shared an image of himself and the woman on the set of his Piers Morgan Uncensored YouTube show and boasted: \"WORLD EXCLUSIVE The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show.He continued: \"[Redacted] wants to have her say and 'set the record straight. ' Is she a psycho stalker? Find out tomorrow on @PiersUncensored.\"\n\nApparently responding to the criticism, Piers followed this up by reposting some support, as one follower asked: \"I mean if that lad can turn her life into a no1 Netflix special then why can't she respond?\"\n\nThe woman claiming to be the real-life Martha has seemingly hit out at Morgan on social media following their interview hours before it hits the air. Writing on her Facebook page after sitting down with the broadcaster, the woman told her connections: \"Piers is a twerp. But we [already] know this. You will see in my interview.\" She then added: \"I'll let the [interview] speak for itself. Piers is a bully, we all know that. He triggers emotions. But this interview will get more views. By far most of his other interviews with all misogynist men he often defends Andrew Tate Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe Mirror has approached representatives for Richard Gadd and Netflix for

In a testy YouTube interview with Piers Morgan, she explained her reasons for believing the story is false enough to deserve her filing a lawsuit against Gadd, Netflix, and others associated with the series.\n\nIn the nearly one-hour-long interview, Harvey denied stalking Gadd, saying it was \"completely untrue\" and \"very defamatory to me.... I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail. I've got no injunctions.\"\n\nHarvey complained that she received no apologies from Gadd, the streaming service, or others associated with the show, even after being harassed by \"internet sleuths\": \"[They] tracked me down and hounded me and gave me death threats, so it wasn't really a choice [to come forward].\"\n\nIn late April, shortly after the show's debut, Gadd did implore audiences not to try to seek out the real-life people who'd inspired the series in a social media post, writing, \"That's not the point of our show.\" Meanwhile, Netflix's policy chief said at a UK Parliament hearing that the streamer took \"every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story.\"\n\nThough Harvey claimed she had not watched Baby Reindeer, she took issue with the portrayal of Martha, saying, \"It's a work of fiction. It's a work of hyperbole, as I've always said. And there are two true facts in that. His name is Richard Gadd, and he works as a jobbing barman on benefits, in the Hawley Arms. And we met, two or three times.\"\n\nShe went on to say that she \"doubted\" he could prove his story by producing hundreds of voicemails from her, claiming that the only way it could happen is if he'd recorded her at the bar. She also said it was \"categorically\" untrue that he'd ever been caught peeping in her window and it was \"simply not true\" that she sent the number of emails and social media messages the show claims Martha did -- \"There may have been a couple of emails,\" she said, adding there were \"about 18 tweets,\" zero Facebook messages, and \"a couple of emails\" in all. She also denied ever heckling him at a comedy show.\n\nOne bit she did concede may be based in reality is the source of the show's title, admitting that she did have a reindeer toy, and saying, \"I had a toy reindeer and he'd shaved his head, that bit is true, and there were reindeers in the shops because it was Christmas time or something. It was a joke. So I have inadvertently penned the name of the show.\"\n\nHarvey went on to suggest Gadd had \"extreme psychiatric problems.\" Her ultimate message to Gadd? \"Leave me alone, please, and get a life, get a proper job.\"", "source": {"uri": "tvinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TV Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amanda_bell@tvinsider.com", "name": "Amanda Bell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heckler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/baby-reindeer-richard-gadd-jessica-gunning-1014x570.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Answered | The Mary Sue", "body": "Netflix's sleeper hit Baby Reindeer gives viewers a vague timeline of events when telling the unbelievable true story of comedian Donny Dunn (Richard Gadd) and his stalker, Martha (Jessica Gunning). But when did the incident take place in real life?\n\nAfter dominating the streaming charts for just shy of a month, Netflix's dark comedy Baby Reindeer has officially been dethroned by Jeff Daniels' new series, A Man in Full. Still, Baby Reindeer had a seriously impressive run in the No. 1 spot, bringing its cast -- particularly its writer/star/producer, Gadd -- into the limelight with a gripping tale of love, suspense, and drama.\n\nBaby Reindeer follows down-on-his-luck comedian Donny Dunn (a fictionalized version of Gadd himself) over the course of five years as he becomes the victim of a serial stalker named Martha. The two initially meet at the pub Donny works at, and a simple act of kindness -- giving Martha a free cup of tea -- quickly spirals into flat-out obsession when Martha begins following Donny home, showing up unprompted at his gigs, and sending him raunchy emails, among other things.\n\nEventually, Martha turns dangerously possessive and starts to meddle in Donny's personal life, threatening his parents, his ex-girlfriend, and even his prospective love interest, Teri (Nava Mau). However, when Donny seeks out the police for help, they turn him away, citing a lack of evidence -- despite Martha having a criminal record of stalking and harassment. Understandably, the whole situation takes a toll on Donny's mental health, made even worse by his personal struggles with sexuality, identity, self-blame, and trauma at the hands of a successful TV writer.\n\nUltimately, Martha is sent to prison on three counts of stalking and harassment, though it's hard to say if the real-life \"Martha\" suffered a similar fate. Although Gadd himself has never publicly confirmed her identity, a women claiming to be the inspiration behind the character has since stepped forward after internet sleuths tried to unearth her identity despite Gadd's wishes and belief that she's mentally unwell. bashing the Netflix miniseries and denying that it's true.\n\nRegardless, Gadd knew this was a story worth telling, and made art out of his seriously disturbing experience by turning the incident into a one-man show. Also titled Baby Reindeer, the play opened at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2019 and was picked up by Netflix around 2022 ,before being adapted to the small screen in April 2024. So when did the real-life events that laid the foundation for the Baby Reindeer TV show take place?\n\nA review published by The Guardian, following the Baby Reindeer play's opening in 2019, claims that Donny first met Martha in 2013, as he said the events took place \"six years ago\" at the time. The ensuing chaos -- a.k.a., Martha's thousands of emails, Facebook messages, and tweets -- occurred throughout the next four or so years, putting her trial around 2017 or 2018. Given that Gadd told the outlet that he considered the issue to be resolved by 2019, this seems to imply that he hasn't been in contact with \"Martha\" since, similar to the timing of the Netflix show.\n\nAlthough the timeline of Baby Reindeer is a bit spotty -- especially in the Netflix series -- the only thing that really matters is that Gadd seems to have gotten a sense of closure from the whole thing.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amanda_landwehr@themarysue.com", "name": "Amanda Landwehr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Man_in_Full_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A Man in Full (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sleeper hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh Festival Fringe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Richard-Gadd-Baby-Reindeer-copy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

He explained: \"We didn't want to anonymize that or make it generic to the point where it was no longer his story because that would undermine the intent behind the show.

Now, the person accused of being the 'real life' Martha by internet sleuths has spoken out by going head to head with interviewer Piers in a TV clash.\n\nThe woman, who we are not naming, recorded her first \"big TV interview\" with the controversial broadcaster earlier this week in which she hoped to \"set the record straight\".\n\nLet's take a look at some of the most explosive bombshells from her interview...\n\n'I won't watch Baby Reindeer'\n\nPiers' interviewee was asked numerous questions about the show to which she is suspected to have inspired the 'Martha' character. But when asked whether she has watched the Netflix series, she replied: \"I haven't watched any of it. I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life.\"\n\nShe continued to say: \"I find it quite obscene. I've had a horrifying, misogynistic.\"\n\nDeath threats\n\nThe woman on the show had been 'unmasked' by internet sleuths who named her as the 'real Martha' after investigating her on social media. The woman then revealed that following the airing of Baby Reindeer, she has received a number of death threats.\n\nShe said: \"Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that.\n\n\"And it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nDenying stalker charges\n\nIn the final scenes of Baby Reindeer, the character of Martha is jailed for nine-months with charges of stalking of Richard's character, Donny. When Piers asked his interviewee about whether she'd ever been to prison, she replied: \"That is completely untrue, very, very defamatory to me. Very career damaging and I wanted to rebut that completely on this show, I'm not a stalker, I've not been to jail - it's complete nonsense.\"\n\n\"If you're charged with a criminal offence it will go fine, bigger fine, very few people go to jail nowadays.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer details\n\nDuring the course of the interview, the 'real life' Martha has disputed the 'facts' of the show. The first being the cup of tea that Martha in the Baby Reindeer series accepts from Richard's character Donny - instead, she said: \"I was in for a meal with, a drink of lemonade, and I was very, very hungry. I'm diabetic, so, very hungry.\"\n\nThe next thing she says is untrue is the amount of correspondence she had had with Richard. In the show Martha sent 41,000 emails, 350 hours of voice messages, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages, and 106. However when Piers puts that to her, she responds with: \"Now, none of that's true.

Still, the internet is the internet, which is how a woman named Fiona Harvey ended up on Piers Morgan today talking about how Gadd is the real obsessive liar.\n\nEven though Gadd and Netflix claimed to scrub any identifying details from the show, the internet quickly identified Harvey -- a Scottish lawyer who bears a resemblance to Jessica Gunning, the actor who plays Martha -- as the most likely candidate. That connection was initially made based on a number of tweets she had sent to Gadd over the years, and furthered by a Daily Mail article that did not include her name. Still, that didn't stop dozens of other outlets from putting it out there, leading to her first major interview today.\n\nThe entire 54-minute Piers Morgan segment is a brutal watch. Harvey repeatedly claims that Gadd made up the entire series (which she claims not to have watched) and that he's the one with \"extreme psychiatric problems,\" before contradicting her own answers over and over again, sometimes within the same sentence. There are only \"two true facts\" in the show, she opens: \"His name is Richard Gadd and he worked as a barman at the Holy Arms, and we met two or three times.\" Later, she says they met \"five or six\" times, refers to him as a (former) friend, and admits she went to his comedy show. At one point, she says she didn't send Gadd anything and then immediately admits she sent \"a couple emails but that's it. Just jokey banter emails.\" She admits to making the joke about her curtains and says Gadd asked to sleep with her. You get the picture.\n\nWe're not here to speculate about whether Harvey's claims -- or Gadd's, for that matter -- are true or false. We certainly don't have all the necessary information. What is evident, though, is that this whole situation is incredibly sad. What happened to Gadd was awful. The fact that people took his story and immediately turned it into an exploitative media sensation is awful. That Netflix and producer Clerkenwell Films failed this dramatically in their duty of care toward the show's subjects is awful. The fact that Harvey is making talk show appearances instead of getting the assistance that she needs -- either because the allegations in Baby Reindeer are true or because her identity was made public and is now receiving death threats -- is awful. Stories like Baby Reindeer are important and brave, but it's time for a reckoning in our true crime-obsessed society. Sometimes, it's okay to just appreciate a piece of art for what it is and stop trying to dig any further.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

During an interview with Piers Morgan tonight, she claims several things were untrue, including that he never offered her a free cup of tea, and she never messaged him as much as she said she did.\n\nThe Netflix show is marketed as a 'true story' but, in the interview, she told Piers: \"It's completely untrue. Very, very defamatory to me, very career-damaging. And I wanted to rebut that completely on this show. I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions. And this is just complete nonsense.\"\n\nOffer of tea\n\nThe \"real life\" Martha disputed that she had been offered a free cup of tea when he was working in the boozer. Asked directly about that, she said it was completely untrue.\n\nShe explained: \"No, that's not correct. He didn't offer me a cup of tea... I was in for a meal with, a drink of lemonade, and I was very, very hungry. I'm diabetic, so, very hungry. So that's true.\"\n\nCorrespondence\n\nIn the show, Martha sent some 41,000 emails, 350 hours of voice messages, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages, and 106 letters to Gadd but the self-proclaimed \"Martha\" has denied this was the case in her experience, insisting she did have correspondence with him but not of this volume.\n\nAsked about this, she said: \"That's simply not true. If somebody was sending somebody 41,000 emails or something, they'd be doing how many a day? Lots.\" When asked what she did send, she later added: \"Now, none of that's true. I don't think I sent him anything... No, I think there may have been a couple of emails exchanging, but that was it. Just jokey banter emails. There may have been a couple of emails,\" but insisted she never sent text messages or Facebook messages.\n\nWhen asked if she tweeted him, she added: \"I may have done years and years ago... No, it wasn't numerous. It's about 18 tweets.\"\n\nSmashing up a bar\n\nThe 'real life' Martha has insisted she had never smashed up a bar. She told Piers tonight: \"We've had no apologies from Netflix or him, nothing. I mean, for someone who says he feels sorry for me, I've had no apology. My character seems to have smashed up a bar, sexually assaulted him in a canal, been to prison. There are a number of other allegations, and... That's not true.\"\n\nJail time\n\nShe also denied she has ever faced jail for what happened. The 'real life' Martha has said she did not watch the show and has no plans to - admitting she'd be \"sick\" if she ever laid eyes on the Netflix show.\n\nAsked if she's seen it, she told Piers: \"Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff... I haven't watched any of it. I think I'd be sick [if I watched it]. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nWhat is true\n\nDuring the interview, the woman claiming to be the 'real life' Martha called the Netflix show a 'work of fiction', and said there were only two true facts in it.\n\n\"It's a work of fiction. It's a work of hyperbole, as I've always said. And there are two true facts in that. His name is Richard Gadd, and he works as a jobbing barman on benefits, in the Hawley Arms. And we met, two or three times,\" she told Piers.\n\nNetflix or Gadd himself have yet to comment on claims that Fiona Harvey is the 'real-life' Martha.\n\nNetflix's policy chief Benjamin King said yesterday that the streaming service and the production company \"took every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story.\"\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_paul_clark@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "John-Paul Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jasmine_allday@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Jasmine Allday", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Production company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32775796.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_fiona-harvey.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Baby Reindeer is now all set to attain another milestone by becoming one of the most popular shows of all time on the streaming giant. After releasing on April 11 this year, the show witnessed a major growth in its viewership just on the basis of massive word-of-mouth, which led it to the most-watched charts.\n\nAccording to a Deadline report, the stalker series gained around 18 million views between April 29 and May 5, bringing the total to 56.5 million in just 26 days. With this, the show is not only at the top of the streamer's TV charts but has also become the most-watched title of the week again.\n\nWith that said, Baby Reindeer is now close to hitting Netflix's most popular list, with almost 60 million views in its first month of release. Also, it just needs 27 million in the next 65 days of its 91-day premiere window to successfully enter the list of the Top 10 Most-Watched Netflix Shows of all time.\n\nCurrently, shows like Wednesday and Stranger Things are ruling the list with around 252 million views and 140 million views in the first and second positions, respectively. Also, The Witcher is the tenth most-watched show with 83 million views and Bridgerton season 2 is the ninth most-watched show with 93 million views.\n\nMore About Baby Reindeer\n\nWritten by and starring Richard Gadd, the seven-episode biographical series follows the story of Donny Dunn, a struggling comedian who happens to encounter a lonely woman, Martha Scott, at the bar where he works.

The programme tells the story of writer and comedian Richard Gadd's experience of being stalked by a woman named Martha in the show. In Gadd's seven-part series, Martha is a terrifying stalker who winds up with a nine-month jail sentence for a campaign of harassment against the comic after meeting him in a London pub.\n\nREAD MORE: Baby Reindeer - what's true and what's fiction as 'real Martha' shares her side with Piers Morgan\n\nDuring an interview with Piers Morgan, she claimed several things were untrue about the Netflix show - including that he never offered her a free cup of tea, and she never messaged him as much as he said she did.\n\nThe Netflix show is marketed as a 'true story'. However, in the interview, she told Piers: \"It's completely untrue. Very, very defamatory to me, very career-damaging. And I wanted to rebut that completely on this show. I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions. And this is just complete nonsense.\"\n\nOffer of tea\n\nThe \"real-life\" Martha disputed that she had been offered a free cup of tea when he was working in the pub. Asked directly about that, she said it was untrue. She explained: \"No, that's not correct. He didn't offer me a cup of tea... I was in for a meal with, a drink of lemonade, and I was very, very hungry. I'm diabetic, so, very hungry. So that's true.\"\n\nCorrespondence\n\nIn the show, Martha sent 41,000 emails, 350 hours of voice messages, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages and 106 letters to Gadd, but the self-proclaimed \"Martha\" has denied this was the case in her experience, insisting she did have correspondence with him, but not of this volume.\n\nAsked about this, she said: \"That's simply not true. If somebody was sending somebody 41,000 emails or something, they'd be doing how many a day? Lots.\" When asked what she did send, she later added: \"Now, none of that's true. I don't think I sent him anything... No, I think there may have been a couple of emails exchanging, but that was it. Just jokey banter emails. There may have been a couple of emails,\" but she insisted she never sent text messages or Facebook messages.\n\nWhen asked if she tweeted him, she added: \"I may have done years and years ago... No, it wasn't numerous. It's about 18 tweets.\"\n\nSmashing up a bar\n\nThe 'real-life' Martha has insisted she never smashed up a bar. She told Piers: \"We've had no apologies from Netflix or him, nothing. I mean, for someone who says he feels sorry for me, I've had no apology. My character seems to have smashed up a bar, sexually assaulted him in a canal, been to prison. There are a number of other allegations, and... That's not true.\"\n\nJail time\n\nShe also denied she has ever faced prison for what happened. The 'real-life' Martha has said she did not watch the show and has no plans to - admitting she'd be \"sick\" if she ever laid eyes on the Netflix show.\n\nAsked if she's seen it, she told Piers: \"Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff... I haven't watched any of it. I think I'd be sick [if I watched it]. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nWhat is true\n\nDuring the interview, the woman claiming to be the 'real-life' Martha called the show a 'work of fiction', and said there were just two true facts in it.\n\n\"It's a work of fiction. It's a work of hyperbole, as I've always said. And there are two true facts in that. His name is Richard Gadd, and he works as a jobbing barman on benefits, in the Hawley Arms. And we met, two or three times,\" she told Piers.\n\nNetflix or Gadd himself have yet to comment on claims the lady - who The Mirror is not identifying through photographs or by name - is the 'real-life' Martha. Netflix's policy chief Benjamin King said that Netflix and the production company \"took every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story\".\n\n*Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok, Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

Netflix aimed to balance protecting identities with upholding the authenticity of Richard Gadd's story. Despite efforts, real-life individuals like Fiona Harvey faced online backlash after being identified in the show.\n\nSince it's debut on April 11, 2024, Baby Reindeer has become a smash hit for Netflix by racking up almost 54 million views, and staying at the top of the streamers' charts as their most popular English-language series for three consecutive weeks. Not only have viewers been captivated by the story based on comedian Richard Gadd's real-life experiences with a stalker, but internet sleuths have also been trying to figure out the real identities behind the characters. Netflix has said little about what's been happening on social media regarding the guessing game that's been going on, but all that changed recently when policy chief, Benjamin King, stood before the UK Parliament.\n\nAccording to Deadline, King stood before the Culture, Media and Sport Committee to answer questions about whether Netflix did all that it could to keep the identities of the characters in Baby Reindeer under wraps. King commented that Netflix had the difficult task of balancing the job of protecting everyone's identities, while at the same time upholding the \"veracity and authenticity\" of Gadd's story. He says that was the one part they didn't want to \"anonymize.\"\n\n\"We didn't want to anonymize that or make it generic to the point where it was no longer his story , because that would undermine the intent behind the show.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer (2024) TV-MA 4.5/5\n\nA seemingly innocent interaction with a customer turns into a chaotic journey as the life of aspiring comedian Donny spirals out of control and brings up the past.\n\nRelease Date April 11, 2024 Cast Richard Gadd , Jessica Gunning , Danny Kirrane , Nava Mau Main Genre Drama Seasons 1\n\nEven though Baby Reindeer stars Richard Gadd and Jessica Gunning have asked fans not to play the guessing game, King would go on to state that it's difficult for Netflix to control what viewers do online in this day and age of social media where everything is scrutinized. However, he also commented that he would not want to live in a world where \"Richard was silenced and not allowed to tell the story.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, it's obviously very difficult to control what viewers do, particularly in a world where everything is amplified by social media. I personally wouldn't be comfortable with a world in which we decided it was better that Richard was silenced and not allowed to tell the story .\"\n\nBaby Reindeer's Real-Life Martha Plans to 'Set the Record Straight' Close\n\nDespite Netflix taking \"every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story,\" according to King, the character of Martha was identified as Scottish lawyer Fiona Harvey, who is obviously outraged by the treatment she's received online and in person since the big reveal. She plans to \"set the record straight\" by telling her side of the story in an interview with Piers Morgan on May 9, 2024. When asked if Netflix has provided any type of support for Harvey, King responded that he didn't think it was appropriate to get into specifics.\n\n\"I cannot get into the specifics of what happened around the making of the show because it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment. I don't want to give further fuel to some of the theories which are circling on the internet .\"\n\nRelated Baby Reindeer Producers Investigate Alleged Misconduct During the Casting Process The investigation stemmed from a 2021 incident where Gadd dated Reece Lyons, a transgender actress who was interested in auditioning for the series.\n\nThe series and its rabid fan base of amateur sleuths has unfortunately led to some being falsely accused, including Olivier Award-winner Sean Foley, who had to file a report with police after it was wrongly determined that he was the real-life Darrien, the man who is portrayed as having sexually assaulted Richard Gadd. Gadd took to Instagram at the time to shut down the rumors, commenting that people he loves are getting caught up \"unfairly in the speculation.\"\n\n\"People I love, have worked with, and admire (including Sean Foley) are unfairly getting caught up in speculation. Please don't speculate on who any of the real life people could be. That's not the point of our show .\"\n\nKing did point out that Baby Reindeer has gone on to raise awareness for males who are the target of stalking, and that Netflix has worked with the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, a support charity for stalking victims.\n\nBaby Reindeer is available to stream on Netflix, and you can watch the trailer for the series below.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Kirrane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Danny Kirrane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Foley_(director)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Foley (director)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/baby-reindeer-2.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-04-", "textStart": 503, "textEnd": 511, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Under her relentless barrage of attention -- including the pet name that gives the series its title -- his life spirals out of control, and past traumas are unearthed. In addition to sending emails, voicemails and Facebook messages, Martha appears at Donny's place of residence, contacts his parents and gropes him without consent, among other frightening behaviors.\n\nAs evidence to support Harvey's claim to be the \"real\" Martha, Morgan cited online sleuths who \"outed\" Harvey as the alleged basis for the character after cross-referencing her social media posts with those depicted in the show.

Is she a psycho stalker? Find out tomorrow on @PiersUncensored.\" Morgan's announcement received a mixed reaction, with many excited to watch the interview but others condemning the broadcaster for exploiting a possibly vulnerable woman.\n\nWriting on her Facebook page ahead of her first TV appearance airing at 8pm this evening, the woman told her connections on the social media site: \"Piers is a twerp. But we [already] know this. You will see in my interview.\" She then added: \"I'll let the [interview] speak for itself. Piers is a bully, we all know that. He triggers emotions. But this interview will get more views. By far most of his other interviews with all misogynist men he often defends Andrew Tate Donald Trump.\"\n\nAlthough many are excited to watch the interview on YouTube this evening, others slammed Morgan as he promoted the chat on social media yesterday. \"This is completely irresponsible. I actually feel a bit sick tbh. Why is contemporary media culture like this? It's like televised cannibalism,\" one wrote to Morgan on Twitter (X).\n\nAnother added: \"exploiting someone who is - if baby reindeer is accurate in its representation - very clearly mentally unwell in the name of \"setting the record straight\" not only puts her in danger but also allows richard gadd's (likely) trauma to be debated for what?? fun?? vile.\"\n\n\"This is completely irresponsible broadcasting and I cannot wait to watch it,\" one conflicted Twitter user joked with their followers, with another potential viewer sharing the same mindset as they wrote: \"kind of shocked and disgusted that piers is exploiting a vulnerable person with severe mental issues that being said I will be watching because curiosity killed the cat.\"\n\nThe smash-hit Netflix series Baby Reindeer chronicles writer and star Richard Gadd's harrowing experience of confronting a relentless stalker named Martha, played by Jessica Gunning. The story, which transpires over seven gripping episodes, portrays Martha as a relentless stalker who eventually gets incarcerated for nine months due to her incessant harassment of the Fifer comic, which started in a Camden pub.\n\nActress Jessica Gunning played Martha in the gripping Netflix series\n\nAmid Baby Reindeer topping streaming charts across the world - and on course to become Netflix's most-watched show - the self-professed 'real Martha' previously revealed that she is contemplating litigation to \"right the wrongs of the show\", alleging a harsh portrayal. She also declared her intention to stand up for herself in court as a \"perfectly capable lawyer\", blaming the Netflix series for turning her life topsy-turvy - all purportedly linked to her relationship with Gadd.\n\nShe told the Daily Record last month: \"I've not been to prison. None of this happened. It's a load of rubbish.\" She also expressed her distress, saying she is now 'living in fear' due to online detectives tracking her down and sending threats. She revealed: \"Gadd and Netflix have portrayed this as a true story and now some little man in North Carolina giving me death threats believes it's a true story. But I think you'd need to be really stupid to believe it is true.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Any semblance of a normal life I had is gone. It's open season on me and this is my chance to speak out. Would it have been better if I spoke to nobody? No, I don't think so.\" The woman also disclosed her plans for a \"major TV appearance soon\" to set the record straight: \"everyone may as well know who I am and at least they'll hear the truth.\" She further clarified: \"I think we can easily prove I'm not a career criminal by saying I've not been to prison. I have no criminal convictions of any description.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zoe_delaney@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Zoe Delaney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Tate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannibalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32762989.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Sunday-Morning.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

I mean, for someone who says he feels sorry for me, I've had no apology.\n\n\"My character seems to have smashed up a bar, sexually assaulted him in a canal, been to prison. There are a number of other allegations, and... That's not true.\"\n\nOn being 'outed' as the 'real-life Martha' online within hours of the show dropping Netflix, she told Piers: \"On the internet, sleuths tracked me down and hounded me and gave me death threats. So it wasn't really a choice. I was forced into this situation.\"\n\nWhen Piers asked Fiona if she'd watched Baby Reindeer, she replied: \"Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff... I haven't watched any of it.\"\n\n\"You're not curious, too?\" Piers added.\n\n\"No, I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic.\n\n\"Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous.\n\n\"I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nFiona told Piers she only found out about the show being picked up on Netflix two weeks ago.\n\nOn Gadd, she said to Piers: \"I just generally think he's got extreme psychiatric problems... It's a work of fiction. It's a work of hyperbole, as I've always said.\n\n\"And there are two true facts in that. His name is Richard Gadd, and he works as a jobbing barman on benefits in the Hawley Arms. And we met, two or three times...\"\n\nAsked by Piers whether she told Gadd he looked like a baby reindeer toy she had as a child, Fiona answered: \"I had a toy reindeer and he'd shaved his head, that bit is true, and there were reindeers in the shops because it was Christmas time or something. It was a joke. So I have inadvertently penned the name of the show.\"\n\nWhen Piers pressed her on the 41,000 emails, 350 hours of voice messages, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages, and 106 letters she allegedly sent Gadd, she replied: \"That's simply not true. If somebody was sending somebody 41,000 emails or something, they'd be doing how many a day? Lots.\"\n\nPushed further by Piers, she admitted there \"may have been a couple of emails... A handful, if that... Less than ten\" -- and went on to reveal she'd also sent him one letter.\n\nAnd in relation to the number of times she allegedly tweeted Gadd, she told Piers: \"I may have done years and years ago... No, it wasn't numerous. It's about 18 tweets.\"\n\nPiers asked Fiona if she'd ever attacked one of Gadd's girlfriends during a jealous rage, to which she replied: \"No, I don't think he had a girlfriend. I think he's, say, homosexual.\n\n\"But no, I have never been to his house or attacked any girlfriend or anything like that.\"\n\nWhen Piers asked her about how true scenes depicting Martha sitting at a bus stop for hours on end were, and whether she'd ever done that, Fiona replied: \"No, I don't know, I don't know where he lived. No. Absolutely no... This is a fictional character. Hyperbole, exaggeration. This is a fiction. It's based on his imagination.\"\n\nShe also denied ever contacting his parents.\n\nDuring the interview Fiona and Piers watched a clip showing Martha pleading guilty to intimidating Gadd's character Donny and being sentenced to nine months in prison.\n\nPiers then asked Fiona whether she'd ever been charged or spent time in prison.\n\nShe replied \"no\" to both questions before adding: \"That's completely untrue. Very, very defamatory to me, very career damaging.\n\n\"And I wanted to rebut that completely on this show. I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions, interdicts. This is just complete nonsense.\"\n\nWhen the Uncensored host asked if she was ever in love with Gadd, she responded: \"Piers. Is that a serious question? No... I gave him the brush off.\n\n\"He asked me to sleep with him with a big green spot on his face one day. I said no, I'm sorry, I'm not interested.\n\nShe added: \"I've got a boyfriend'. I gave him the brush off big time, I think, you know, subtly so.\n\n\"But the bottom line is.. No, I don't fancy little boys without jobs. That sounds awful. That sounds really, really callous. But, you know.\"\n\nTurning the tables on the host, Fiona asked Piers how much she thinks Gadd has made out of the hit Netflix show, to which he replied that it could be \"several millions\".\n\nIn response to this, Fiona said: \"I think he's done bloody well out of defaming me... He's making money out of untrue facts.

In the 30-minute show, the Scottish law graduate is due to talk openly about being named as comedian Richard Gadd's alleged stalker.\n\nNetflix 's original series Baby Reindeer is based on a true story and follows comedian and performer Richard's experience with a female stalker in his 20s - named Martha in the show - and how the trauma impacted his life. Now, the person accused of being the 'real life' Martha by internet sleuths has spoken out by going head to head with interviewer Piers in a TV clash.\n\nThe woman, who we are not naming, recorded her first \"big TV interview\" with the controversial broadcaster earlier this week in which she aimed to \"set the record straight\". But she told the Daily Record she was \"not happy\" with Piers' questioning and told her Facebook connections that he is a \"bully.\"\n\nShe even branded her interviewer \"a twerp\" and compared Morgan to \"misogynist men he often defends\". The 30-minute Piers Morgan Uncensored special is set to air on the broadcaster's YouTube channel, which has 2.58 million subscribers, later today.\n\nWriting on her Facebook page ahead of her first TV appearance, the woman told her connections: \"Piers is a twerp. But we [already] know this. You will see in my interview.\"\n\nShe then added: \"I'll let the [interview] speak for itself. Piers is a bully, we all know that. He triggers emotions. But this interview will get more views.\" Referring to some of his previous head-to-head, she added: \"By far most of his other interviews with all misogynist men he often defends Andrew Tate Donald Trump.\"\n\nIn the show Fife-born comic Richard, 34, plays a fictionalised version of himself called Donny Dunn who is ruthlessly stalked by a Scot called Martha. The show tells viewers it is a \"true story\".\n\nRichard asked viewers not to try and track down the real-life Martha. But they defied his plea and found clues that revealed her identity, including references to a Baby Reindeer bar scene in which Martha asks for help getting her curtains hung only to face a barrage of innuendo.\n\nEnglish actress Jessica Gunning, 38, plays Martha, a Scottish woman in her 40s who lives in Camden and studied law. The TV show has become the most viewed programme on Netflix in 30 countries and is billed by the streaming channel as a true story.\n\nThe woman accused says she is now mulling over legal action against both the comedian and Netflix over the character Martha who is depicted being sent to prison twice, once for a historical crime of stalking and again for stalking Richard. In real life, she was given a police warning for her conduct involving Richard but has never been to prison or convicted for stalking.", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tiffany_wallis@ok.co.uk", "name": "Tiffany Wallis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Tate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innuendo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innuendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article32769120.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BR_104_Unit_00170_RT.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

It has become an overwhelming hit for Netflix following its 11 April release.\n\nIn a pre-taped interview for Piers Morgan Uncensored that aired on Thursday (9 May), Harvey denied stalking Gadd and said she is considering suing Netflix for defamation.\n\nBefore the episode aired on YouTube, viewers questioned the ethics of Morgan's decision to interview Harvey since Gadd told The Independent that the real person who inspired Martha was \"mentally unwell\".\n\nAs it aired, fans shared their guilt about watching the bizarre and controversial interview.\n\n\"Part of me doesn't want to watch the interview but I can't stop watching,\" said one.\n\n\"My face during this whole interview,\" wrote another alongside a gif of Steve Carrell's character in The Office grimacing.\n\n\"Time to watch Piers Morgan conducting one of the most unethical interviews ever,\" added a third.\n\nA fourth shared a gif of a man watching through his fingers.\n\nMorgan's Uncensored did not respond to The Independent's request for comment.\n\nDuring the interview, Harvey denied sending Gadd 41,000 emails and 100 letters while stalking him. Netflix has previously claimed that the emails in the show are the real emails received by Gadd from his stalker.\n\n\"I think he probably made them up himself,\" Harvey alleged, instead suggesting she sent him just \"a handful\". When pressed by Morgan for a number, she said she sent the comedian \"less than 10 emails\".\n\nShe also discussed her treatment online after fans of the show discovered her identity. \"It's taken over enough of my life,\" she said. \"I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous.\"\n\nHowever, Harvey did admit to coming up with the nickname that inspired the series: \"I had a toy reindeer and he'd shaved his head, that bit is true, and there were reindeers in the shops because it was Christmas time or something. It was a joke. So I have inadvertently penned the name of the show.\"\n\nHarvey - a 58-year-old Scottish solicitor - was tracked down by tabloid newspapers after her description closely matched that of Martha.\n\nAttempts have also been made to identify the man who raped Gadd, in a sexual assault that is recreated in the show's fourth episode - and that he explored in 2016 in his award-winning one-man show Monkey See, Monkey Do.\n\nAn actor and director named Sean Foley has indicated that he has contacted police over \"defamatory, abusive and threatening posts\" following speculation made about him in connection to the show.\n\nOn his Instagram, Gadd urged viewers to stop. \"People I love, have worked with, and admire (including Sean Foley) are unfairly caught up in speculation. Please don't speculate on who any of the real-life people could be. That's not the point of our show.

It was written by Gadd, who also starred in the show as Donny Dunn. He documented Donny's strange and layered relationship with a woman named Martha, played by Jessica Gunning.\n\nHer initially friendly demeanor unraveled as she begins to stalk Donny relentlessly. Throughout numerous years, Martha sends Donny more than 41,000 emails, 744 tweets, 100 pages of letters and 350 hours of voicemails. In a bid \"to set the record straight\", the woman claiming to be the real-life Martha has spoken to Piers Morgan.\n\nThe woman, who the Mirror has chosen not to name or identify via photographs, was asked by the controversial broadcaster if she was ever in love with Gadd. She replied: \"Piers. Is that a serious question?\" The woman continued: \"No... I gave him the brush off. He asked me to sleep with him with a big green spot in his face one day. I said no I'm sorry, I'm not interested. He asked me to sleep with him.\n\nThe woman claiming to be Martha has said she was never in love with Richard Gadd\n\n\"He said, 'would I like my curtains fixed'? And I laughed and he said, that's a euphemism. You want me to come home with you? And I said, 'I've got a boyfriend'. I gave him the brush off big time, I think, you know, subtly so. But the bottom line is.. No, I don't fancy little boys without jobs. That sounds awful. That sounds really, really callous. But, you know.\"\n\nShe also addressed her own love life during the interview where she said she was in a five-year relationship with a lawyer. The woman told Piers: \"I don't want to drag him in. He thinks this is horrendous. All of my lawyer friends do. All of my professional friends do. Other people do. People are being really sympathetic. People I don't know are saying things like, 'Are you getting hounded in the street?' You know, people are being really, really nice, anyone who does know about this.\"\n\nDuring the sit down interview with Piers Morgan, he asked what she would say to him if he was watching. She replied: \"Leave me alone, please. Get a life, get a proper job. I am horrified at what you've done.\" The woman also revealed she hasn't watched the Netflix series. Asked if she had seen it, she said: \"Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff...

It was written by Richard Gadd, who starred as struggling comedian Donny Dunn and showed his strange and layered relationship with a woman named Martha, played by Jessica Gunning.\n\nThroughout the series, she began to stalk Donny relentlessly and Martha ended up sending Donny more than 41,000 emails, 744 tweets, 100 pages of letters and 350 hours of voicemails. In a bid \"to set the record straight\", the woman claiming to be the real-life Martha has spoken to Piers Morgan in her first televised interview.\n\nThe woman, who the Mirror has chosen not to name or identify via photographs, addressed the number of emails it was claimed Martha sent in the show. She said: \"There are not 41,000 emails. That's over a year.\" Piers replied: \"According to you there's only a handful.\" The woman added: \"Yeah. I mean how long would that take someone to type up?\"\n\nControversial broadcaster Piers asked: \"How many do you think you sent him?\" She replied: \"A handful, if that.\" The woman was then pushed about what she meant and asked to give a number. She told Piers: \"Less than ten.\" Piers repeated: \"Ten emails.\" The woman continued: \"Not 41,000.\" The host quipped: \"There's a massive disparity between the two things,\" as she added: \"I agree, I agree.\"\n\nThe 'real-life' Martha has shared how many emails she sent Richard Gadd\n\nDuring the sit down interview, Piers asked what she would say to him if he was watching. She replied: \"Leave me alone, please. Get a life, get a proper job. I am horrified at what you've done.\" The woman also revealed she hasn't watched the Netflix series. Asked if she had seen it, she said: \"Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff... I haven't watched any of it.\"\n\nPiers asked: \"You're not curious, too?\" She replied: \"No, I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene.

Is that a serious question?\" The woman continued: \"No... I gave him the brush off. He asked me to sleep with him with a big green spot in his face one day. I said no I'm sorry, I'm not interested. He asked me to sleep with him.\n\n\"He said, 'would I like my curtains fixed'? And I laughed and he said, that's a euphemism. You want me to come home with you? And I said, 'I've got a boyfriend'. I gave him the brush off big time, I think, you know, subtly so. But the bottom line is.. No, I don't fancy little boys without jobs. That sounds awful. That sounds really, really callous.

Created by and starring Scottish comedian Richard Gadd, the show is based on his real-life experience. The psychological thriller centers around Donny (Gadd), a struggling comedian who meets Martha (Jessica Gunning) during a bartending gig. The encounter quickly spirals into a terrifying stalking case.\n\nThe real Martha has now allegedly come forward, claiming Gadd's version of the story is \"completely untrue.\"\n\n\"Very, very defamatory to me, very career-damaging. And I wanted to rebut that completely on this show. I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions. And this is just complete nonsense,\" Fiona Harvey, 58, said on \"Piers Morgan Uncensored,\" which aired Thursday. \"I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic.\"\n\nI've interviewed a lot of very dangerous people in my career, from serial killers to medically diagnosed psychopaths.\n\nAnd the common denominator is that they're invariably very skilled liars, often because their warped minds have made them believe what they're saying even if facts speak otherwise.\n\nFiona Harvey hasn't killed anyone.\n\nBut if she did all the things she is depicted as doing in Baby Reindeer, then she is certainly a very unstable, obsessive, and threatening stalker who made Richard Gadd's life utter hell.\n\nAnd indeed, the lives of other people she's accused of harassing too. But IS it all true?\n\nNetflix boasts it's a \"true story\" at the start of the series, without equivocation. And lest there be any doubt of the streamer's position, Benjamin King, Netflix's Senior Director of Public Policy in the UK, told a Parliamentary committee this week: \"'Baby Reindeer' is an extraordinary story, and it is obviously a true story of the horrific abuse that the writer and protagonist, Richard Gadd, suffered at the hands of a convicted stalker.\"\n\nYet Fiona says she's never been convicted of stalking Gadd, let alone shame-facedly admitted it in court as the show says.\n\nAnd no journalists have yet found any evidence that she has ever been charged or convicted of any crime.\n\nPerhaps she's lying.\n\nBut it's not a difficult thing to check, and if it turns out that Fiona Harvey has never been convicted of stalking Gadd or anyone else, then that surely blows a massive hole in Baby Reindeer's credibility?\n\nAnd it would call into serious question just how much of Gadd's version of events can be believed.\n\nNetflix also claims it did everything possible to avoid the real people behind the characters in the show being identified.\n\nBut the actress they chose to play Martha bears a striking resemblance physically, and in the way she spoke in the series, to Fiona Harvey.\n\nAnd as a result of all the clues they gave, including specific phrases used in tweets and messages purportedly from Martha to Gadd, internet sleuths identified her in about ten nanoseconds.\n\nThis led very quickly to people bombarding Fiona Harvey with abuse and death threats.\n\nAll of which points to a spectacular duty of care failure by Netflix, Gadd, and Clerkenwell Films who produced the series, which I would think carries with it serious legal jeopardy.\n\nOf course, none of this means Fiona Harvey told me the truth. I found her to be intelligent, quick-thinking, and combative.\n\nAnd on a human level, I felt sorry for her that she's been publicly dragged through the mincer like this.\n\nHer general behavior, on and off camera, with me and my team didn't give any of us cause for concern about either her potential danger or her mental state, though it should be said that stalkers can be very convincing in their ability to hide their real personalities or obsessive intent.\n\nBut there were moments in the interview where my suspicious alarm bells rang loud, especially when she suddenly said, \"Even if the email thing was true, the rest is not.\"\n\nThe \"email thing\" is the 41,000 emails she's said to have sent Gadd. And if that bit is true, then it would suggest she was very obsessively pursuing contact with him.\n\nI also found it very strange that she admitted to having up to six email addresses, and 4 mobile phones which she \"used for different people.\"\n\nThat's not normal.\n\nShe also made a series of emphatic blanket denials about how long she knew Gadd, and how much contact she had with him that are provably false.\n\nThe claim that she only sent him one letter, when he says he has 105, seems especially disingenuous.\n\nOn balance, I'd say Fiona Harvey lied to me quite a lot in the interview and if her threatened legal action against Netflix and Gadd goes ahead, I suspect it will quickly emerge she did send all the emails, messages, and letters to him.\n\nBut that doesn't mean she can't be a victim here too.\n\nGadd, by his own admission, is a very damaged guy who took a lot of drugs, enthusiastically pursued a chaotic lurid sex life, and did lead on Martha in a way that may have fueled her obsession. He's also been accused of propositioning trans actresses who he was lining up for work.\n\nFrankly, it's all a mess.\n\nBut if Richard Gadd feels entitled to make millions airing his side of the story, and make very serious allegations about Fiona Harvey in the process, then she is surely entitled to respond and defend herself.\n\nAs for who is exploiting whom, I'll leave that to the court of public opinion to decide.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_thriller", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological thriller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_streamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online streamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerkenwell_Films", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clerkenwell Films"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/81526494.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Gadd recently asked fans on Instagram: \"Please don't speculate on who any of the real-life people could be. That's not the point of the show.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Ms Harvey denied ever being at Gadd's home, contacting his parents or sending thousands of texts and emails. But she admitted owning four mobile phones and four to six different email addresses, as well as having a toy reindeer when she was younger, as depicted in the series.\n\nShe told Morgan she was in a five-year relationship with a lawyer and had never been charged with a criminal offence. In Baby Reindeer, Martha is given a prison sentence for stalking.\n\nAsked if it was true Gadd had offered her a free cup of tea after she first walked into the pub where he was working, Ms Harvey said she was actually having a meal with lemonade as she is diabetic, and had met him only \"five or six times\" in her life.\n\nAsked if she spoke with him after first meeting him, she told Talk TV: \"He interrupted a conversation... he said, 'Oh, you're Scottish', and basically commandeered the conversation.\n\n\"You know, I was talking to somebody. It's pretty rich. Interrupt. So he seemed to be obsessed with me from that moment onwards.\"\n\nPressed on the 41,000 emails, 350 hours of voice messages, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages, and 106 letters she is alleged to have sent Gadd, Ms Harvey said: \"That's simply not true.\"\n\nShe accepted sending him \"a handful\" of emails, which she numbered as \"less than ten\", and sent \"about 18 tweets\" to him \"years and years ago\" as well as a letter. She said she also went to one of his comedy shows.\n\nShe was questioned about the possibility of Gadd having voice messages from her in real life, but claimed these \"would be [from] taping me in the Hawley Arms\".\n\n\"I mean, my point is, though, even if that were true, I didn't lunge at him across the bar. I didn't sexual[ly] assault him in a canal. I didn't go to jail,\" she said.\n\n\"On the internet, sleuths tracked me down and hounded me and gave me death threats. So it wasn't really a choice. I was forced into this situation,\" she said.\n\nMs Harvey told Morgan she had a \"standard Scottish\" upbringing, and had not told her mother about the drama.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament this week, Netflix policy chief Benjamin King said that the streamer and Clerkenwell Films, which made the show, took \"every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story\".\n\nHe added: \"I personally wouldn't be comfortable with a world in which we decided it was better that Richard was silenced and not allowed to tell the story.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TalkTV_(British_TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TalkTV (British TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerkenwell_Films", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clerkenwell Films"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LSbF6PNu75FQPMM6V1j4Kw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/7fede90f758e8a7addba1735be059970", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

I mean, for someone who says he feels sorry for me, I've had no apology.\n\n\"My character seems to have smashed up a bar, sexually assaulted him in a canal, been to prison. There are a number of other allegations, and... That's not true.\"\n\nOn being 'outed' as the 'real-life Martha' online within hours of the show dropping Netflix, she told Piers: \"On the internet, sleuths tracked me down and hounded me and gave me death threats. So it wasn't really a choice. I was forced into this situation.\"\n\nWhen Piers asked Fiona if she'd watched Baby Reindeer, she replied: \"Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff... I haven't watched any of it.\"\n\n\"You're not curious, too?\" Piers added.\n\n\"No, I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic.\n\n\"Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous.\n\n\"I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nFiona told Piers she only found out about the show being picked up on Netflix two weeks ago.\n\nOn Gadd, she said to Piers: \"I just generally think he's got extreme psychiatric problems... It's a work of fiction. It's a work of hyperbole, as I've always said.\n\n\"And there are two true facts in that. His name is Richard Gadd, and he works as a jobbing barman on benefits in the Hawley Arms. And we met, two or three times...\"\n\nAsked by Piers whether she told Gadd he looked like a baby reindeer toy she had as a child, Fiona answered: \"I had a toy reindeer and he'd shaved his head, that bit is true, and there were reindeers in the shops because it was Christmas time or something. It was a joke. So I have inadvertently penned the name of the show.\"\n\nWhen Piers pressed her on the 41,000 emails, 350 hours of voice messages, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages, and 106 letters she allegedly sent Gadd, she replied: \"That's simply not true. If somebody was sending somebody 41,000 emails or something, they'd be doing how many a day? Lots.\"\n\nPushed further by Piers, she admitted there \"may have been a couple of emails... A handful, if that... Less than ten\" -- and went on to reveal she'd also sent him one letter.\n\nAnd in relation to the number of times she allegedly tweeted Gadd, she told Piers: \"I may have done years and years ago... No, it wasn't numerous. It's about 18 tweets.\"\n\nPiers asked Fiona if she'd ever attacked one of Gadd's girlfriends during a jealous rage, to which she replied: \"No, I don't think he had a girlfriend. I think he's, say, homosexual.\n\n\"But no, I have never been to his house or attacked any girlfriend or anything like that.\"\n\nWhen Piers asked her about how true scenes depicting Martha sitting at a bus stop for hours on end were, and whether she'd ever done that, Fiona replied: \"No, I don't know, I don't know where he lived. No. Absolutely no... This is a fictional character. Hyperbole, exaggeration. This is a fiction. It's based on his imagination.\"\n\nShe also denied ever contacting his parents.\n\nDuring the interview Fiona and Piers watched a clip showing Martha pleading guilty to intimidating Gadd's character Donny and being sentenced to nine months in prison.\n\nPiers then asked Fiona whether she'd ever been charged or spent time in prison.\n\nShe replied \"no\" to both questions before adding: \"That's completely untrue. Very, very defamatory to me, very career damaging.\n\n\"And I wanted to rebut that completely on this show. I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions, interdicts. This is just complete nonsense.\"\n\nWhen the Uncensored host asked if she was ever in love with Gadd, she responded: \"Piers. Is that a serious question? No... I gave him the brush off.\n\n\"He asked me to sleep with him with a big green spot on his face one day. I said no, I'm sorry, I'm not interested.\n\nShe added: \"I've got a boyfriend'. I gave him the brush off big time, I think, you know, subtly so.\n\n\"But the bottom line is.. No, I don't fancy little boys without jobs. That sounds awful. That sounds really, really callous. But, you know.\"\n\nTurning the tables on the host, Fiona asked Piers how much she thinks Gadd has made out of the hit Netflix show, to which he replied that it could be \"several millions\".\n\nIn response to this, Fiona said: \"I think he's done bloody well out of defaming me... He's making money out of untrue facts. He's been the ultimate misogynist.\"\n\nFiona was also asked by Piers what message she had for Gadd if he was watching, and she replied: \"Leave me alone, please. Get a life, get a proper job. I am horrified at what you've done. \"\n\nWhen Piers asked Fiona in the Uncensored interview whether she would take legal action against Gadd, she answered: \"Absolutely.

The intense interest in the seven-episode series, which is billed as a true story based on the experience of the comedian Richard Gadd, has also spawned an army of amateur detectives trying to uncover the actual identities of the characters onscreen.\n\nThose efforts have resulted in the online abuse of a British writer and director as well as blowback for Netflix officials, one of whom was questioned about the streamer's \"duty of care\" by a British lawmaker this week. Gadd has all but begged internet sleuths to stop digging, writing on social media: \"Please don't speculate on who any of the real life people could be. That's not the point of the show.\"\n\nBut in an interview that ran Thursday, Fiona Harvey, who says that the show's stalker character was modeled after her, provided her side of the story on camera for the first time.\n\nIn \"Baby Reindeer,\" a woman named Martha (Jessica Gunning) approaches an aspiring comedian, Donny (Gadd), while he is working as a bartender and eventually torments him through emails and voice mail messages.\n\nIn an hourlong interview on YouTube with the television personality Piers Morgan, Harvey said she had not watched the series -- \"I think I'd be sick,\" she said -- but had become aware of her connection to it after reading news media reports and being contacted by journalists.

And it's why I think everyone had such respect for everything. I was blessed with this amazing team who kind of felt it with me in a lot of ways.\"\n\n\"I never wanted to kind of lie,\" he said about writing the series.\n\n\"I always had to constantly check myself to be like, 'Does this feel truthful to me to my experience all the way through?' And if it didn't, I would have to bring it back.\"\n\nGadd, 34, himself stars in the Netflix series which is based on his real-life experiences of stalking and sexual abuse.\n\nBaby Reindeer follows struggling comic Donny Dunn, played by Gadd, as he is relentlessly harassed and stalked by Martha Scott, played by Jessica Gunning, for four and a half years.\n\nA subplot sees Dunn groomed and raped by an older man called Darrian, played by Tom Goodman-Hill, who works in the comedy industry. Similar events happened to Gadd in real life which became the subject of the fourth episode.\n\nSince the seven-episode show's release on 11 April, it has become a word-of-mouth sensation, shooting to the top of the streaming service's most-watched charts with very little promotion.\n\nNetflix has now submitted Baby Reindeer to the Emmy Awards for consideration as the best limited series and Gadd as the best actor and the best writer.\n\nGadd previously talked about the charity We Are Survivors and thanked them for supporting him through the years.\n\n\"Sometimes I speak to male survivors, and I'm not an advice giver or a professional, but the first advice is: break the silence. Talk to someone, and if that's too scary, just write it down, process it into something. Because I think the more you get it out, the smaller it becomes,\" he told The Guardian.\n\nAt the panel, Gunning again brought up the charity, which works with male and nonbinary sexual abuse, rape and sexual exploitation survivors across Greater Manchester, saying it had seen a 200 percent increase in people looking for support, with 60 per cent saying Baby Reindeer was the reason behind them getting in touch.\n\n\"It's not an easy, buttoned-up story,\" Gunning said.\n\n\"Everything doesn't get tied up at the end. I think it's messy, like life is. Their dynamic is complicated and he's really honest about that. That's so refreshing to see. The response to it is shown that audiences are really hungry for that. Hungry for honest, messy storytelling.\"\n\nMany have praised Gunning's sensitive portrayal of Scott, including The Independent's chief TV critic Nick Hilton, who said in his four-star review of the show: \"Gunning's performance as Martha adds another layer of ambiguity: at times she is vicious, at times she is vulnerable, but she's always a compelling presence in his life and on screen.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer is streaming now on Netflix.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Complex Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_series_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limited series (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directors_Guild_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Directors Guild of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh Festival Fringe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Goodman-Hill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Goodman-Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Word of mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/23/14/baby%20reindeer%203.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 1925, "textEnd": 1933}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

She replied: \"Piers. Is that a serious question?\" The woman continued: \"No... I gave him the brush off. He asked me to sleep with him with a big green spot in his face one day. I said 'no I'm sorry, I'm not interested'. He asked me to sleep with him.\n\n\"He said, 'would I like my curtains fixed'? And I laughed and he said, 'That's a euphemism. You want me to come home with you?' And I said, 'I've got a boyfriend'. I gave him the brush off big time, I think, you know, subtly so. But the bottom line is... No, I don't fancy little boys without jobs. That sounds awful. That sounds really, really callous. But, you know.\"\n\nShe also addressed her own love life during the interview, where she said she was in a five-year relationship with a lawyer. The woman told Piers: \"I don't want to drag him in. He thinks this is horrendous. All of my lawyer friends do. All of my professional friends do. Other people do. People are being really sympathetic. People I don't know are saying things like, 'Are you getting hounded in the street?' You know, people are being really, really nice, anyone who does know about this.\"\n\nDuring the sit-down interview with Piers Morgan, he asked what she would say to Gadd if he was watching. She replied: \"Leave me alone, please. Get a life, get a proper job. I am horrified at what you've done.\" The woman also revealed she hasn't watched the Netflix series. Asked if she had seen it, she said: \"Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff... I haven't watched any of it.\"\n\nPiers asked: \"You're not curious, too?\" She replied: \"No, I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

In the interview, which aired Thursday afternoon, Harvey officially came forward as the real-life Martha and called Richard Gadd, the writer and star of the series who plays a fictionalized version of himself, a \"liar\" and \"misogynist\" who's profiting off her misery by embellishing their interactions with one another. Both Gadd and Netflix have said the series is \"a true story.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer follows Gadd's complicated relationship with his stalker, as he's plagued by Martha's constant presence and correspondence, which he says consisted of 41,000 emails, 350 voicemails, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages, and 106 letters. But Harvey said this week that none of that ever happened -- and she plans to sue Gadd, Netflix, and anyone else who's \"going along and being in that play and doing this to somebody.\"\n\nAccording to Harvey, she and Gadd only met \"two or three times\" in real life. \"I don't lie,\" she told Morgan in their interview. But she was somehow both emphatic in her denial and uncertain at the same time. Harvey told Morgan that her only message to Gadd would be, \"Leave me alone please. Get a life, get a proper job,.\" She added, \"I am horrified at what you've done,\" and called him \"the ultimate misogynist\" and \"psychopath.\"\n\nHowever, Harvey got a bit wobbly when asked to defend herself. Questioned about whether or not she'd sent Gadd 41,000 emails, Harvey doubled down that the show is \"a figure of [Gadd's] imagination,\" but later admitted, \"There may have been a couple of emails,\" but just \"jokey banter ones.\" She said that at the time, \"I didn't think [Gadd] was a complete psychopath that would attack me.\"\n\n\"Even if it were true\" that she'd sent Gadd 41,000 emails (\"just playing devil's advocate here,\" she said), \"I didn't lunge at him across the bar, I didn't go to jail,\" as depicted in the series. Morgan pointed out that law enforcement could likely pinpoint which device the emails came from and whether it belonged to her -- and now that the world has heard her voice, it could easily be determined whether or not she'd left him the 350 voicemails. His line of questioning ultimately drove Harvey to clash with her interviewer. \"You've gone on at length for a good 10 minutes about the emails,\" she said to Morgan, sounding heated.\n\n\"I wouldn't be suing if I thought 41,000 emails were out there,\" she added, with the caveat that \"it wouldn't blow the case\" if that many emails were found. She also let slip that she has \"four phones\" and \"six email addresses\" -- but only because she likes separate communications on different devices, she said.\n\nHow Netflix's Stalker Series 'Baby Reindeer' Became a Viral Sensation\n\nAs far as the alleged 350 voicemails, Harvey initially said she \"doubt[s]\" Gadd really has that many voicemails and said, \"I've not phoned the guy\" -- but she later admitted to calling him before and even writing him a letter. If Gadd is able to provide 350 voicemails as evidence, Harvey said it'd only be because he'd taped her in the interest of drumming up media attention for his series. \"He's maybe forged things. People have forged a lot of things these days,\" she said of the other 105 handwritten letters she said she didn't write.\n\nKeeping up with the flip-flopping theme of the conversation, Harvey first told Morgan that she'd be willing to take a lie detector test to prove that she hadn't stalked Gadd, since \"I don't fancy little boys without jobs.\" But on second thought, \"A lie detector test for what?\" she asked, pushing the conversation to a different topic: \"They used [lie detectors] for mass murder and things. They don't use them that much.\"\n\nIn all, Harvey said the way she's been depicted in the series is \"completely untrue\" and has been \"very career-damaging\" to her job as an attorney, ever since social media users discovered her identity. \"Internet sleuths tracked me down, hounded me, gave me death threats,\" she said.\n\n\"[Gadd and Netflix] are milking it for all it's worth, for the money,\" she continued, adding that the actress playing Martha, Jessica Gunning, doesn't even look like her -- a point on which many viewers have disagreed.\n\nThe Scene That Should Win Netflix's 'Baby Reindeer' an Emmy\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

This is everything we can expect from Fiona Harvey's Piers Morgan interview tonight:\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Record, Fiona described her talk with Piers as a \"sparring match\" where she was forced to refute claims that she \"loved\" Richard Gadd.\n\nFiona said that Piers refused to accept her denial that she stalked Richard Gadd, saying: \"There was a heavy emphasis from Piers Morgan on Gadd and the emails I am supposed to have sent.\n\n\"I have my own thoughts on it that I'd like to keep to myself but I wouldn't say I was happy. It was very rapid to try to trip me up. He did it fast-paced to catch me off guard.\n\n\"Piers kept saying to me 'are you sure you haven't sent this guy 41,000 emails and phone calls?'. A lot of the interview, for a good 10 minutes, he kept coming back to this.\n\n\"I said, 'Look, Even if I had sent some emails, it doesn't mean I'm guilty of the rest of the stuff. As I said, in order to bill something as a true story, it's got to be pretty much 100 per cent true.\n\nFiona Harvey also confirmed she was only paid \u00a3250 for the interview.\"It seemed to me that I was set up. I feel a bit used,\" she said.\n\nPiers told her the interview went well, however. \"He landed a few punches on me and I landed a few punches on him.\"\n\nDuring the half an hour interview, Piers asks Fiona whether she loved Richard Gadd and she replies \"you've got to be joking.\"\n\nTelling how the interview with Piers was set up, Fiona said: \"Piers contacted me last week about going on his show and, of course, I agreed. This Morning and everybody else has been chasing me.\n\n\"I've had people telling me they are publicists or agents but it's difficult to know who to trust. I've had people using the most foul language on the phone telling me they could make me a lot of money.\n\n\"How all these people got my phone number I just don't know but it's been hell.\"\n\nBut after calls by many other shows, Fiona said \"Piers and his people got in touch and I said yes because he's the best of them all and is seen by an awful lot of people.\n\n\"He is the biggest interviewer out there and has the biggest show so obviously I was going to speak to him. Piers sent a car to pick me up and drop me off.\n\nFiona \"Let him know what was off limits\" before the interview. \"I told him I wouldn't talk about boyfriends or my family,\" she said.\n\nBaby Reindeer is available on Netflix now.

Fiona Harvey, a 58-year-old Scottish woman who has previously been accused of stalking, now claims that Gadd is \"obsessed\" with her.\n\nSpeaking with Piers Morgan on Thursday's episode of his YouTube show, Harvey said she was forced to go public after the show debuted on April 11. \"The internet sleuths tracked me down and hounded me and gave me death threats,\" she said. \"So it wasn't really a choice.\" VF has reached out to reps for Netflix and Gadd for comment.\n\nHarvey, who says she has not watched any of the seven-episode series, referred to it as \"obscene,\" \"horrifying,\" and \"misogynistic\" in its depiction of Martha, a character played by Jessica Gunning. After first revealing her identity in an interview with The Daily Record, Harvey offered further details of her alleged relationship with Gadd, claiming to only have met him \"two or three times\" -- a number that shifted to \"five, six times\" by the interview's end.\n\nUnlike Baby Reindeer's Martha and Gadd's Donny, Harvey says that Gadd did not buy her a cup of tea on the day they met. \"Nobody gets anything for free at The Holy Arms,\" she said, referencing the pub where they allegedly met, before claiming that Gadd \"commandeered the conversation\" she was having with another person at the bar. \"He seemed to be obsessed with me from that moment onwards,\" Harvey said.\n\nMorgan pressed Harvey about the fact that both Netflix and Gadd say he is in possession of around 41,000 emails, 350 voice messages, 106 letters, and a number of tweets she sent to him. Harvey admitted to sending \"a handful\" of \"jokey banter emails,\" one letter, and some tweets, which can still be publicly viewed. One, dated September 1, 2014, reads, \"did you get my emails or am I emailing the wrong address?\" Harvey denied having left Gadd any voicemails. \"Unless he was taping me in The Holy Arms, I didn't phone him,\" she said. Morgan asked, \"Are you challenging him to reveal his audience?\" to which she replied, \"No, I'd challenge him to leave me alone.\"\n\nHarvey maintained that she was able to identify herself in Martha not because of the stalking, but the Netflix series' title. \"I appear to have written most of the show in my sleep,\" she said. \"I had a toy reindeer and he shaved his head, that bit is true.

It was very rapid to try to trip me up. He did it fast paced to catch me off guard.'\n\nShe claims Morgan, 59, grilled her over the subject of 41,000 emails sent to Gadd for a 10 minute chunk of the interview.\n\nIn an attempt to defend herself, she hit back that even if the emails are true, it does not mean the entire saga was completely factual.\n\n'It seemed to me that I was set up. I feel a bit used,' Harvey added.\n\nMorgan reportedly described the interaction as a 'sparring match' between the pair, for which his interviewee claims she was only paid \u00a3250.\n\nShe claims she has been in 'hell' as she was hounded for interviews but caved to the former Good Morning Britain host because she liked him.\n\nAs part of the deal, the 'real Martha' was given a professional hair stylist and glam team to help prepare for the first ever on screen appearance.\n\n'Piers said it went well,' Harvey continued. 'He referred to it as a sparring match. He landed a few punches on me and I landed a few punches on him. He asked me if I loved Richard Gadd and I said you've got to be joking.'\n\nThe 30-minute special will air on the Uncensored YouTube channel, which has 2.58 million subscribers, at 8pm tonight.\n\nIn a tweet, Morgan wrote: '*WORLD EXCLUSIVE* The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show.\n\n'Fiona Harvey wants to have her say & 'set the record straight.'

Fiona Harvey has come forward as the inspiration behind the character and said: \"He's come up with this character called Martha and he has put me right in the frame.\"\n\nHere is what we learnt from the hour-long interview, which was streamed live on Youtube on Thursday night (May 9)...\n\nFiona denied sending Gadd over 40,000 emails\n\nPiers Morgan questioned whether Fiona Harvey had sent Richard Gadd over 40,000 emails, 350 hours of voice messages, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages and 106 letters.\n\nShe denied sending him the alleged 41,000 emails sent to Gadd, some of which were shown in the show, adding: \"It's simply not true.\"\n\nShe added: \"If somebody was sending somebody 41,000 emails or something, they'd be doing how many a day? Lots. How many would that take somebody to type up?\" Pressed on where this information came from, she replied: \"I've no idea.\"\n\nShe later said she sent him 'a few emails' and approximated 'less than 10' when questioned by Morgan, admitting she sent him only 'jokey, bantery emails'.\n\nFiona claimed Richard Gadd was actually 'obsessed' with her\n\nMs Harvey said that despite not actually watching the show, she thought it was 'horrifying' Gadd had promoted it. She first claimed she had only met Gadd 'two or three times' before later approximating it was 'five to six times'.\n\nShe said the show was a 'work of fiction'. She said she initially met Gadd having first visiting the Hawley Arms pub for a meal. Ms Harvey denied Gadd offered her a cup of tea, as shown in the series.\n\n\"I was in for a meal with, a drink of lemonade, and I was very, very hungry. I'm diabetic, so, very hungry. So that's true,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a work of fiction,\" she continued about the show. \"It's a work of hyperbole, as I've always said. There are two true facts in that. His name is Richard Gadd, and he works as a jobbing barman on benefits, in the Hawley Arms. We met, two or three times.\"\n\nFiona said jail sentence part of the show was false and denies being his stalker\n\nMs Harvey said the scene in which Martha is jailed was 'complete nonsense' and that she was 'not a stalker' and had 'not been to jail'.\n\n\"It is completely untrue and very career-damaging,\" she said. \"I want to rebuttal that. I'm not a stalker. It's just complete nonsense.\n\n\"[It is] very, very defamatory to me, very career damaging. And I wanted to rebut that completely on this show. I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions, interdicts. This is just complete nonsense.\"\n\nFiona claimed she had not received an apology from Gadd\n\nMs Harvey later claimed she had never received an apology from the writer and comedian for the allegations made since the Netflix show aired.\n\n\"I mean, for someone who says he feels sorry for me, I've had no apology,\" she said. \"And I have this Martha character who seems to have smashed up a bar, sexually assaulted him in a canal and been to prison.\"\n\nShe added that there had been a 'number of other allegations' that were 'not true' in the show. She denied she was someone who needed help, which was widely referred to in the show.\n\nFiona said she didn't have Gadd's number and that she never left him voicemails\n\nMs Harvey said she never left voice messages for Gadd. Morgan asked: \"Why would there even be a possibility of him having that number of voice messages from you?\"\n\nMs Harvey responded. \"I've not phoned the guy. I don't have his number.\n\n\"The only explanation for having a voicemail from me would be taping me in the Hawley Arms. That's the only place we've ever met. I mean, my point is, though, even if that were true, I didn't lunge at him across the bar. I didn't sexually assault him in a canal. I didn't go to jail.\"\n\nFiona admitted having numerous phones and 'between four and six email addresses'\n\nMs Harvey said she might have up to six email addresses and used various mobile phones. She claimed she used the different emails and devices for various means, such as paying utility bills and for close friends.\n\n\"I like to keep people on different phones and different emails,\" she told Morgan. \"Maybe four. I think it's four to six. Yeah, it's just easier, it's easier. So you have some for your utilities, some for close friends.\"\n\nWhen Morgan said he didn't know anyone with six emails, she responded: \"You don't know many people then, and I know... I know people with four or six email addresses.\"\n\n\"I like keeping people on separate phones, maybe that makes me a maniac or a stalker or something,\" Ms Harvey then joked.\n\nFiona claimed they only ever shared 'Scottish banter'\n\nGrilled on whether the writer was ever her friend, she said: \"No. No. Staff asked me that as well. No, I don't think so.\" She said the pair had shared 'Scottish banter' at the pub.\n\nShe said she was never in love with him, saying: \"Is that a serious question? No. I'm not interested.\"\n\nFiona shared final direct message to viewers\n\nMs Harvey shared a final message to viewers at the end of the interview. Looking into the camera to address those watching, she said: \"I think you should look at him saying that I'm some sort of mental case and I think you should judge for yourselves. I can't change your mind on this... I can just rebut what has been said, but you need to make up your mind.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_holt@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "James Holt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voicemail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Voicemail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemonade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lemonade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29142034.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GNKMmanWkAAKxj2jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1126, "textEnd": 1131}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

He's the man who turned his experience first into a one-man play and later the Netflix series he also stars in.\n\n\"That's simply not true,\" Harvey said. \"If somebody was sending somebody 41,000 emails or something, they'd be doing how many a day? Lots.\"\n\nMorgan responded by agreeing it would be \"obsessive\" before pressing her on what she might have sent instead. Again, Harvey denied Gadd received anything from her before admitting a couple \"jokey\" emails were sent.\n\n\"I don't think I sent him anything ... No, I think there may have been a couple of emails exchanging, but that was it,\" she clarified. \"Just jokey banter emails.\"\n\nA large part of the series' success rests on Jessica Gunning's performance as Martha - the character Gadd allegedly based on Harvey. Despite the accolades for both the show and Gunning's character specifically, Harvey refuses to watch \"Baby Reindeer\" as it's \"a fiction ... based on his imagination.\"\n\n\"No, I think I'd be sick,\" she told Morgan. \"It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous.\"\n\nHarvey also made it clear she expects an apology from either Netflix or Gadd himself for the \"completely untrue\" depiction of her.\n\n\"We've had no apologies from Netflix or him, nothing,\" she said. \"I mean, for someone who says he feels sorry for me, I've had no apology. My character seems to have smashed up a bar, sexually assaulted him in a canal, been to prison. There are a number of other allegations, and ... that's not true.\"\n\n\"Baby Reindeer\" enjoyed a meteoric rise following its April 11 debut. Gadd explained during a Q&A held in Los Angeles after the show's success that he went to an \"obsessive\" place while writing the series.\n\n\"I wrote a lot of it literally surrounded by white walls on a garden deck chair and a laptop on my lap,\" he said. \"It's amazing I didn't go insane. It was a crazy, mad thing. I had to go into a very obsessive place. I did mad hours on it. My best writing was like, 5 a.m. onwards. I would get up at half four and obsessively write almost til I went to bed the next day.\"\n\nWatch the entire \"Piers Morgan Uncensored\" interview, below:", "source": {"uri": "thewrap.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheWrap"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_bryant@thewrap.com", "name": "Jacob Bryant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Baby-Reindeer-Real-Martha.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 2225, "textEnd": 2233}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

I'm diabetic, so, very hungry. So that's true.\"\n\nHarvey claimed that Gadd spoke to her first in the pub.\n\n\"He interrupted a conversation...he said, 'Oh, you're Scottish', and basically commandeered the conversation,\" she alleged. \"You know, I was talking to somebody. It's pretty rich. So he seemed to be obsessed with me from that moment onwards.\"\n\nShe also said about Gadd, \"I got the impression that he was all out for himself. [He] wanted to sort of control that bar. Very, very inarticulate, very full of himself. I should never have gone in that bar.\"\n\nThroughout her interview with Morgan, Harvey cited multiple moments from the show that allegedly didn't accurately explain her real-life experience with Gadd. For example, Harvey said she never caught Gadd peeping through her window, which transpired in one scene.\n\n\"I didn't see him at my house. I think it would be impossible to look through a window... That categorically didn't happen,\" she claimed.\n\nHarvey also did not harass Gadd by sending him over 40,000 emails and reaching out via voicemails, text messages, Facebook messages and letters, she claimed.\n\n\"That's simply not true,\" Harvey said. \"If somebody was sending somebody 41,000 emails or something, they'd be doing how many a day? Lots.\"\n\nWhen Morgan pressed Harvey on the topic of the harassing messages, she responded, \"I don't think I sent him anything. No, I think there may have been a couple of emails exchanging, but that was it. Just jokey banter emails.\"\n\nHarvey claimed she sent Gadd \"less than ten\" emails and \"not 41,000.\" She also denied she reached out to Gadd by text or on Facebook, though she did admit she messaged him on Twitter \"about 18\" times and sent him one letter.\n\nOne scene from \"Baby Reindeer\" showed Martha heckling Donny at his comedy show, but Harvey said that never happened in real life.\n\n\"Why would I do that? No, no, no. I don't generally go to comedy shows,\" she claimed.\n\nFurthermore, Harvey denied attacking Gadd's girlfriend and claimed that he's \"homosexual.\" She also insisted she never sat for hours at a bus stop outside Gadd's apartment alone, contacted his parents, or was sentenced to prison for nine months for harassing Gadd.\n\n\"That's completely untrue. Very, very defamatory to me, very career damaging,\" she said about the series showing Martha go to prison in the finale. \"And I wanted to rebut that completely on this show. I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions, interdicts. This is just complete nonsense.\"\n\nWhile \"Baby Reindeer\" is a bonafide hit on Netflix and is garnering major Emmy buzz, Harvey -- who has said she's considering taking legal action against Gadd -- still hasn't watched the show.\n\n\"I think I'd be sick,\" she told Morgan after he asked her if she's \"curious\" about the series, adding, \"It's taken over enough of my life.\"\n\n\"I find it quite obscene,\" Harvey said. \"I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heckler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/piers-morgan-uncensored-interviews-real-81531254.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nBaby Reindeer viewers are questioning the ethics behind Piers Morgan's interview with the woman whose alleged campaign of stalking and harassment inspired the series.\n\nThis week, the broadcaster revealed he had spoken to Scottish lawyer Fiona Harvey, labelled the \"real Martha\", with the interview set to air on his YouTube show Uncensored on Thursday (8 May).\n\nAfter filming the interview, though, Harvey said she felt \"used\" by Morgan, who she said placed \"a heavy emphasis\" on the thousands of emails she allegedly sent Baby Reindeer creator and lead star Richard Gadd.\n\nHarvey, who has received death threats since the show started, has now hinted that Morgan capitalised on the furore, telling Daily Record: \"I wouldn't say I was happy. It was very rapid to try to trip me up. He did it fast paced to catch me off guard.\n\n\"It seemed to me that I was set up. I feel a bit used.\"\n\nHarvey's claims corroborate general feeling about Morgan's interview, which was met with consternation when the broadcaster announced the \"world exclusive\" on Wednesday (8 May).\n\nHe wrote on X/Twitter: \"The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show. Fiona Harvey wants to have her say & 'set the record straight.' Is she a psycho stalker?\"\n\nThe post's replies section was flooded with messages from users calling the interview \"irresponsible\" and \"unethical\" due to the fact that Gadd himself told The Independent that the real person who inspired Martha to be \"mentally unwell\".\n\n\"This is exploitation of a person who is in a vulnerable position. Clearly unethical,\" one person wrote, with another adding: \"This guy has absolutely no shame!\" Others branded the decision to interview Harvey \"disgraceful\" and \"absolutely vile\".\n\nThe Independent has contacted Morgan's Uncensored for comment.\n\nMorgan's announcement arrived hours before Gadd, Gunning, co-star Nava Mau and series director Weronika Tofilska participated in a panel discussion about the show in Los Angeles.\n\nThe event was held to stir up interest among TV awards voters in Hollywood. Both Gadd and Gunning are strongly expected to receive Emmy and Golden Globe nominations in the forthcoming awards race.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/09/09/Baby-Reindeer-Martha-Piers%20Morgan.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 488, "textEnd": 493, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Where does his ownership of his own story end and his responsibility to others begin? And what role do we - as media and audiences alike - have to play in the equation?\n\nJust as it was inevitable that sleuths would find the (allegedly) \"real Martha\" - Fiona Harvey, 58, was located by viewers in five seconds flat, despite Gadd's pleas to call off the search - so the ensuing media circus shouldn't surprise us. On the contrary: the fact that controversy merchant Piers Morgan is gearing up to air a tell-all interview with Harvey on his YouTube channel (hip!) this evening is the most predictable thing about this whole fascinating tangle of thorns.\n\nIn the internet age, giving an audience a mystery is practically a guarantee of them trying to solve it; having framed the show as being based on a true story, it was only a matter of time before Martha's \"true\" identity came to light.\n\nBaby Reindeer might have been fiction, but it tapped into our limitless capacity for \"true crime\", steeping ourselves in the waters of human depravity with seemingly no thought for the consequences; that impulse might be ugly, but that doesn't make it any less true.\n\nNo question, then, that there is appetite for Morgan's interview - \"Is she a psycho stalker?\" barks his post on X, viewed 8.2 million times at the time of writing - the quandary is whether it should be catered to. After all, I want to eat seven kilos of chocolate, drink four bottles of wine, and smoke 500 cigarettes. Does that mean I should press on, or is it worth pausing to consider my impulses?\n\nI loved Baby Reindeer as much as anyone, and I'd be lying if I said I had no interest in seeing the \"real Martha\" - on the contrary, one small, dark bit of my psyche can think of nothing more fascinating. That doesn't mean I should indulge it - nonetheless, I believe that being honest about our nastier impulses makes it easier to see what is happening here.\n\nTuning in to watch a jumped-up school bully \"catch out\" a mentally ill woman for baying crowds is not a good look for any of us, yet millions will do just that on Thursday night - the highest of moral high horses can't carry you away from that reality.\n\nViewers want horror - and in search of ratings and clicks, cynical media can pander to our worst appetites. It's what made The Jeremy Kyle Show one of the most successful UK daytime TV shows of all time; it's also arguably what fuelled audiences for public executions, or the witch trials in medieval Europe.\n\nWe're not always nice, and it's important that we face up to that - otherwise, people like Morgan will exploit it just as they do people like Harvey. Certainly, she seems especially vulnerable; Gadd himself noted that the \"real Martha\" was \"unwell\" and \"needed help\", while Harvey says she has received death threats from Baby Reindeer fans. There's no one in the world who thinks that the decision to interview this woman is kind or responsible. What's more, if Morgan's \"psycho stalker\" tweet is anything to go by, the resulting video will no doubt be salacious and shallow - ethically and artistically bankrupt, a home run!\n\nBut however troubled we are by either Baby Reindeer or Piers Morgan Uncensored, arbitrary ethical guidelines aren't the answer; short of illegality, we have to let people make bad things (\u00e0 la Morgan) if we want them to make good things like Gadd. Rather than asking creatives to police themselves, we have to prove that we can be trusted with complex material - otherwise they'll stop taking risks altogether. And while I would love Morgan to stop taking risks if this is his idea of one, I'm afraid we can't have one without the other.\n\nOf all its triumphs, Baby Reindeer's most astonishing achievement is its unflinching moral ambiguity. Gadd's character Donny is frightened by Martha but also titillated, flattered and affirmed by her attention. Similarly, she is tender as well as terrifying, veering between gentle and brittle, fixated and funny. Gadd's honesty about his own twisted feelings is what made Baby Reindeer so compelling and refreshing - approaching the same subject matter, I'm afraid I don't hold out hope for equivalent nuance from Morgan, but perhaps audiences can take a leaf out of Gadd's book.\n\nIt's tempting to lash out at writers like Gadd, and even more so at provocateurs like Morgan, when TV gets morally muddy, but ultimately, it's down to viewers to break the cycle. If we can resist watching nonsense like Morgan's, he'll stop making it - as it stands, we're calling for his head while surreptitiously reminding each other to tune in when the interview is shown.\n\nPerhaps it's time to turn the focus on ourselves; there's a lot to learn from Baby Reindeer, not least the power of self awareness even (or especially) when it is most uncomfortable.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_watkins@inews.co.uk", "name": "Emily Watkins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobiography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autobiography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jeremy_Kyle_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Jeremy Kyle Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chocolate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Blankets_and_Bedding", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Blankets and Bedding", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Celebrity_Homemakers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Celebrity Homemakers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Children", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Children", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SEI_203338872.jpg?crop=62px%2C0px%2C2336px%2C1319px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The series, penned by Richard himself, explores Donny's complex relationship with a woman named Martha, portrayed by Jessica Gunning.\n\nInitially friendly, Martha's behaviour becomes increasingly obsessive, culminating in her sending Donny over 41,000 emails, 744 tweets, 100 pages of letters and leaving 350 hours of voicemails over several years.\n\nThe show is set to become one of Netflix's most-watched series. In an attempt \"to set the record straight\", the woman claiming to be the real-life Martha Scott spoke to former Good Morning Britain news anchor Piers Morgan.\n\nThe woman, whose identity has been kept anonymous by OK!, revealed she had a message she has for Baby Reindeer creator Richard during her interview with Piers.\n\nSpeaking directly to the camera, she said: \"Leave me alone, please. Get a life, get a proper job. I am horrified at what you've done.\"\n\nThe woman also shared that she hasn't tuned into the Netflix series. When asked if she had watched it, she responded: \"Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff... I haven't watched any of it.\"\n\nPiers inquired: \"You're not curious, too? \" To which she retorted: \"No, I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nThe interview with Piers was set to air at 8pm on Thursday, but it seems the woman was already expressing regret before the broadcast. She accused the divisive TV personality of having \"triggered\" her emotions during their conversation for his YouTube channel, subsequently calling him a \"bully\" and a \"twerp\".\n\nThe law graduate, who is allegedly the woman at the centre of Richard's drama series, agreed to speak with the star to share her perspective. However, she refutes the idea that she's profiting from the show's success.\n\nShe reportedly made only a modest sum for her London visit. On Facebook, she expressed her opinion: \"Piers is a twerp. But we [already] know this. You will see in my interview I'll let the [interview] speak for itself. Piers is a bully, we all know that. He triggers emotions. But this interview will get more views. By far most of his other interviews with all misogynist men he often defends Andrew Tate Donald Trump.\"", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alice_penwill@ok.co.uk", "name": "Alice Penwill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "mia_o_hare@ok.co.uk", "name": "Mia O'Hare", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Tate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/tv/article32775799.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_br_101_unit_00014_rt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

He did it fast paced to catch me off guard.\"\n\n\"Piers kept saying to me 'are you sure you haven't sent this guy 41,000 emails and phone calls? '. For a significant part of the interview, at least 10 minutes, he repeatedly questioned this.\"\n\n\"I told him, 'Look, Even if I had sent some emails, it doesn't mean I'm guilty of the rest of the stuff. As I said, in order to bill something as a true story, it's got to be pretty much 100% true.\"\n\n\"It seemed to me that I was set up. I feel a bit used.\"\n\nShe also mentioned: \"Piers said it went well. He referred to it as a sparring match. He landed a few punches on me and I landed a few punches on him. He asked me if I loved Richard Gadd and I said you've got to be joking.\"\n\nHarvey disclosed that she received a mere \u00a3250 for the half-hour interview.

In the series he stars as the fictionalised version of himself, Donny, while Martha is played by actress Jessica Gunning.\n\nBenjamin King has stated that Netflix aimed to balance protecting the identities of the real people with upholding the \"veracity and authenticity\" of Baby Reindeer. \"We didn't want to anonymize that or make it generic to the point where it was no longer his story because that would undermine the intent behind the show,\" he said. \"Ultimately, it's obviously very difficult to control what viewers do, particularly in a world where everything is amplified by social media. I personally wouldn't be comfortable with a world in which we decided it was better that Richard was silenced and not allowed to tell the story.\" He also said Netflix had worked with the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, the British charity that provides support for stalking victims.\n\nRichard and his co-star Jessica have both asked fans not to speculate on the real identity of Martha, or of any other characters in the series that follows Donny's experiences with Martha, who he first meets when she comes into the pub where he is working.\n\nOn Instagram, Richard wrote: \"Please don't speculate on who the real life people could be.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe woman claiming to be the real-life Martha Scott from Netflix's hit series Baby Reindeer has issued a plea to Richard Gadd. The show, which has become a viral sensation, stars Gadd as struggling comedian Donny Dunn.\n\nHe penned the series that explores Donny's complex relationship with a woman named Martha, portrayed by Jessica Gunning. Initially friendly, Martha's behaviour becomes increasingly obsessive as she starts to stalk Donny, reports the Mirror.\n\nOver several years, Martha bombards Donny with more than 41,000 emails, 744 tweets, 100 pages of letters and 350 hours of voicemails. The show is set to become one of the most viewed on the streaming platform. In an attempt \"to set the record straight\", the woman alleging to be the real-life Martha Scott spoke to former Good Morning Britain news anchor Piers Morgan.\n\nREAD MORE A Yorkshire Farm star Amanda Owen 'at one' as she braves wild swim\n\nThe woman revealed her message for Baby Reindeer creator Richard Gadd during her interview with Piers Morgan. He asked what she would say to him if he was watching. She retaliated, saying: \"Leave me alone, please. Get a life, get a proper job. I am horrified at what you've done.\"\n\nThe lady also opened up about not having watched the Netflix series. When asked if she had seen it, her response was simply: \"Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff... I haven't watched any of it.\"\n\nWith a tone of curiosity, Piers Morgan asked, \"You're not curious, too? \" She retorted assertively, \"No, I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nPier Morgan's sit down interview was broadcasted at 8pm on Thursday night. Prior to the show, it seemed the lady was already expressing regret. She accused the contentious journalist of triggering her emotions during their YouTube discussion, subsequently branding him as a \"bully\" and a \"twerp\".\n\nThe law graduate, who is alleged to be the woman portrayed in Richard Gadd's drama series, agreed to speak with the star to share her perspective. However, she refutes the idea that she's profiting from the show's success.\n\nThe woman stated she only made a modest sum for her London visit. On Facebook, she expressed her views about Piers Morgan: \"Piers is a twerp. But we [already] know this. You will see in my interview I'll let the [interview] speak for itself. Piers is a bully, we all know that. He triggers emotions. But this interview will get more views.

From X to the real Martha speaking out and now due to appear on TV with Piers Morgan, there are still so many questions I have about the situation.\n\nDespite being totally engrossed in the show on Netflix, the whole show was actually based on an award winning play that Richard Gadd performed actually created and performed across the country before the story made it on the big screen. Here's a look at all the ways the Baby Reindeer play was different from the Netflix show.\n\nUsing a number of characters in the Netflix series to tell his relationships with Teri, Darrien and Keeley, Richard instead opted to perform the original play as a one man show. Performing it at Edinburgh Fringe Festival five whole years before the release of the Netflix show, Richard delivered the show's dialogue and performance alone on stage.\n\nDuring the period of time she stalked him, the real Martha actually gifted Richard an array of strange gifts. This was reflected in the play, with the performance revealing some of the items he received to be underwear, sleeping pills, a toy reindeer and a wooly hat. In the Netflix series, the only thing Donny receives from Martha is a photograph of herself in her underwear.\n\nDespite this seeming like a small detail to omit, this context was telling of the dynamic between Donny and Martha, adding layers to their relationship as he received gifts from a customer.\n\nWe hear on the Netflix show that Richard was inundated with messages, voicemails and social media messages from the real Martha, but the amount was actually significantly downplayed in comparison to the real life events. Donny explains that he received around 80 emails a day, but Richard actually got a total of 41,071 emails, 350 hours worth of voicemails, 744 tweets, 46 Facebook messages and 106 pages worth of letters throughout the four years he was stalked. The play was much more realistic when explaining the scale of messages sent by the real Martha but of course without visual representations.\n\nDespite the Netflix show portraying Martha in court and being sentenced to nine months in prison, Richard Gadd's play did not see his stalker receive prison time. Explaining in multiple interviews that he also saw the real Martha as a victim of trauma, Richard didn't write the prison sentence into his original play script as he was aware he had done several things which made him an unfavourable character himself at times and that this would have been an unfair end to the story.\n\nBaby Reindeer is available on Netflix now.

A number of viewers quickly became curious about who the 'real Martha' actually is - despite writer and star of the show Richard Gadd urging them to leave such investigations well alone.\n\nNow, a woman who allegedly inspired Martha in the seven-part series has given a televised interview with Piers Morgan, who has drawn ire for potentially exploiting a vulnerable individual. The controversial interview will air on the former Good Morning Britain anchor's YouTube channel at 8 pm this evening (May 9).\n\nTaking to social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Piers announced: \"*WORLD EXCLUSIVE* The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show.\n\n\"[Redacted] wants to have her say & 'set the record straight.' Is she a psycho stalker? Find out tomorrow on @PiersUncensored.\" As a heated debate over interview ethics continues to swell, the Mirror takes a look at the truth, and the fiction, in Baby Reindeer...\n\nMartha The real Martha sent Richard more than 41,000 emails\n\nScottish writer and comedian Richard Gadd penned the script, which is based on his one-man show of the same name, and even stars as a fictionalised version of himself - Donny Dunn. A barman by day, and comedian by night, Donny keeps his severe emotional wounds deeply buried but is ultimately forced to confront his demons when seasoned stalker Martha Scott takes a seat at his bar.\n\nAs Martha, Jessica Gunning gave the performance of a lifetime, managing to imbue the complex character with both menace and compassion. Like Donny, we first meet Martha in a forlorn state, crying at the bar in The Heart Pub where the dejected comedian works.\n\nFeeling sorry for Martha, who doesn't even have enough money on her for a drink, Donny offers her a cup of tea on the house - inadvertently sparking a bond that would quickly snowball into a full-blown obsession. At first, Donny views Martha as a harmless fantasist who notices him in the way his tepid audiences never do.\n\nIt soon dawns on him, however, that something far more serious is going on below the surface, with Martha's stalking behaviours infiltrating every part of his life. Martha is indeed based on a real individual who subjected Richard to a campaign of stalking - but a few details were changed during the screenwriting process.\n\nIn an interview with Variety, Richard explained that they had to make the character of Martha different from the real Martha for 'legal reasons', but what he was looking for was an actress who could capture that 'kind of energy'. According to Richard: \"I needed to see someone who was vulnerable one moment, angry the next, volatile but so desperate and sympathetic. I needed to see someone who could capture a full gamut of emotions. When somebody has severe mental health problems, they tend to leap from one emotion to the next, sometimes even quite quickly. And that's very hard to do from an acting point of view, but Jess seems to have it in her pores, it seems to just fall out of her.\"\n\nExpressing that he felt empathy for Martha, Richard continued: \"I have a bit of empathy overdrive sometimes. But it's not like anything I've seen on television before. Stalking usually is depicted as someone who is kind of evil, whereas I felt like there was a vulnerable person who genuinely couldn't stop, who for whatever reason had believed the reality that was inside her head and no matter what couldn't change from that. I mean, it is a mental illness and I wanted to portray that. I did see someone who I felt sorry for.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with The Independent, Richard shed some light on the ceaseless messages from Martha that pepper every episode. In real life, 'Martha' was similarly prolific, firing off more than 41,000 emails, 350 hours of voicemail, 744 tweets, and 46 Facebook messages, as well as 106 pages of letters. In the show, Martha is sent to jail. However, it is not believed that Richard's real-life stalker was ever convicted.\n\nAhead of tonight's pre-recorded conversation with Piers, the woman who allegedly provided the inspiration for Martha lashed out at the outspoken broadcaster, describing him as 'a twerp' and 'a bully'. In a heated Facebook post, the woman in question, who the Mirror has decided not to name or identity via pictures, wrote: \"Piers is a twerp. But we [already] know this. You will see in my interview.\"\n\nShe added: \"I'll let the [interview] speak for itself. Piers is a bully, we all know that. He triggers emotions. But this interview will get more views. By far most of his other interviews with all misogynist men he often defends Andrew Tate, Donald Trump.\"\n\nAssault by TV writer Cruel Darrien positioned himself as Donny's mentor, before repeatedly assaulting him\n\nBaby Reindeer took another dark turn in episode four, which explored Donny's rape at the hands of Darrien O'Connor (Tom Goodman-Hill), a successful TV writer who initially positions himself as Donny's mentor. Donny first encounters Darrien as a young comedian cutting his teeth at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and is quickly mesmerised by him.\n\nA connection that Donny initially perceives as a friendship emerges, with Darrien showering the fledgling comic with the praise he so desperately craves. For all Darrien's talk of Donny's bright future, however, the pair spend their weekends in Darrien's dingy flat, where the older man plies his 'protege' with drugs and repeatedly assaults him.\n\nIt makes for a devastating watch, with Donny's ordeal having a catastrophic effect on his sense of self-worth. As with the character of Martha, Richard has changed the name of his abuser, but Darrien is based on a real person.\n\nIn behind-the-scenes Netflix footage, Richard clarified: \"It's a true story, based on my early 20s when I went through some pretty crazy things... There's a flashback episode where we actually go back in time to Donny going to the Edinburgh Fringe and meeting someone in the industry who helps them in their career but goes on to abuse Donny and that's obviously taken from my real-life experiences.\"\n\nHe continued: \"It was a hell of a thing to write and shoot. It shows a side of abuse that I don't think we've seen before. I still think there's an idea that sexual abuse is a pill in a drink and dissolves and someone wakes up and doesn't know where they are and that does happen, and it's a big problem, but a lot of abuse occurs in very intimate relationships. I wanted to show how complicated and psychologically messed up situations could get to.\"\n\nRelationship with Teri Donny's inner demons ultimately capsized his budding romance with Teri\n\nIn Baby Reindeer, we see Donny fall for Teri (Nava Mau), a beautiful American trans-woman who initially believes her background as a therapist could help her reach through to Martha. Although Donny clearly has strong feelings for Teri, he manages to jeopardise their blossoming romance at every turn as, in his words: \"I loved one thing in the world more than her - hating myself.\"\n\nWracked with self-loathing, Donny lies about his own name, ditches Teri on the tube and, ultimately, his internalised shame and trauma bonding with Martha leads to the demise of their relationship. Viewers have naturally been curious to know whether there really was a Teri in Richard's life.\n\nIn the behind-the-scenes Netflix video, Richard revealed that Teri was indeed based on a real woman, who he says was a 'voice of reason'. He shared: \"The real-life person always used to call me out on my s*** and I always used to find it confronting. My behaviour was irrational and so it was very important to have Teri be the voice of reason in the show. I mean, she was the voice of reason in my life at that point as well, not that I listened to her as much as I should have.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with The Independent, Richard also explained that Donny's doomed relationship with Teri was inspired by his own experience dating a trans woman, which has left him with some real regrets. Richard said: \"It's in the public consciousness now, but it wasn't back then, when I was dating. It felt so new that it added a certain pressure, to me, that I really regret now. But that's what it explores in the show. This story was set back in a time when things were very different.\"\n\nOnstage breakdown In episode six, Donny finally let himself be vulnerable in a heart-wrenching monologue\n\nIn episode six, Baby Reindeer reaches an emotional climax when, faced with a disdainful audience, Donny drops the props and the jokes and delivers the most powerful monologue of the series. After bottling up his trauma for so long, Donny opens up to the silent audience about what he's endured - in what turns out to be a turning point in the series.\n\nFootage of his speech goes viral, and Donny soon attracts praise for being so open, with his unexpected admission even bolstering his flagging comedy career. This also proves to be the catalyst that sees Donny finally tell his parents about the abuse he's suffered, receiving their support and honesty in return. Donny's onstage breakdown was one of the most memorable moments, but is there any truth in it?\n\nThis scene actually didn't happen in real life, however, Richard has spoken out about his experiences of sex abuse and stalking in his scripted theatre show Monkey See Monkey Do, in which a large monkey was used as a metaphor for the heavy burden of abuse.\n\nAlthough this show wasn't impromptu, as Donny's was, the response to Richard's story, at a time before male sexual assault was widely spoken about, proved to be equally life-changing. Remembering rehearsing before his first performance, Richard told The Guardian: \"I remember cracking up, because it was all going so badly, and the producer said, 'What do you want from this, man?' And I turned to him with tears in my eyes, and said, 'I just want to make it out alive'. Little did I know that it would provide a lifeline for me. The way people received that show, and received me, and accepted what happened to me: it saved my life. It's mad that it happened that way.\"\n\nDonny's moving monologue is given further authenticity as it contains excerpts from Richard's Baby Reindeer autobiographical one-man show, which inspired the hit series.\n\nIf you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

It comes shortly after Morgan announced the 'world exclusive' earlier this week.\n\nTaking to X, formerly known as Twitter, Morgan shared an image of himself and the woman on the set of his Piers Morgan Uncensored YouTube show.\n\nHe boasted: \"*WORLD EXCLUSIVE* The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show. [Redacted] wants to have her say & 'set the record straight.' Is she a psycho stalker? Find out tomorrow on @PiersUncensored.\"\n\nBut just hours before its 8pm broadcast this evening, Harvey told her connections on Facebook: \"Piers is a twerp. But we [already] know this.\n\n\"You will see in my interview I'll let the [interview] speak for itself. Piers is a bully, we all know that. He triggers emotions. But this interview will get more views. By far most of his other interviews with all misogynist men he often defends Andrew Tate Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe Record exclusively told yesterday how Harvey, originally from Fyvie in Aberdeenshire, was unhappy with the questions that Piers put to her. She described her interview as a \"sparring match\" and was forced to refute claims by Piers that she \"loved\" Fife-born Richard Gadd, whom she is accused of stalking in the Netflix series.\n\nShe said: \"There was a heavy emphasis from Piers Morgan on Gadd and the emails I am supposed to have sent. I have my own thoughts on it that I'd like to keep to myself but I wouldn't say I was happy. It was very rapid to try to trip me up. He did it fast paced to catch me off guard.\n\n\"Piers kept saying to me 'are you sure you haven't sent this guy 41,000 emails and phone calls?'. A lot of the interview, for a good 10 minutes, he kept coming back to this.\n\n\"I said, 'Look, Even if I had sent some emails, it doesn't mean I'm guilty of the rest of the stuff. As I said, in order to bill something as a true story, it's got to be pretty much 100% true.\n\n\"It seemed to me that I was set up. I feel a bit used.\"\n\nShe added: \"Piers said it went well. He referred to it as a sparring match. He landed a few punches on me and I landed a few punches on him. He asked me if I loved Richard Gadd and I said you've got to be joking.\"\n\nHarvey said she was paid only \u00a3250 for the 30-minute interview. During the show, the Scots law graduate will talk openly about being outed as comedian Richard Gadd's alleged stalker.\n\nIt is expected to air on the broadcaster's YouTube channel - which has 2.58 million subscribers - at 8pm on Thursday.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ruth_suter@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Ruth Suter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Tate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeenshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aberdeenshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aberdeenshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scots law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32770531.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_CapturePNG.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

A number of viewers quickly became curious about who the 'real Martha' actually is - despite writer and star of the show Richard Gadd urging them to leave such investigations well alone.\n\nNow, a woman who allegedly inspired Martha in the seven-part series has given a televised interview with Piers Morgan, who has drawn ire for potentially exploiting a vulnerable individual. The controversial interview will air on the former Good Morning Britain anchor's YouTube channel at 8pm this evening (May 9).\n\nREAD MORE: 'This is not OK' - US publication sparks outrage over 'embarrassing' Barry Keoghan Met Gala post\n\nTaking to social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Piers announced: \"*WORLD EXCLUSIVE* The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show.\n\n\"[Redacted] wants to have her say & 'set the record straight.' Is she a psycho stalker? Find out tomorrow on @PiersUncensored.\" As a heated debate over interview ethics continues to swell, the Mirror takes a look at the truth, and the fiction, in Baby Reindeer...\n\nMartha\n\nScottish writer and comedian Richard Gadd penned the script, which is based on his one-man show of the same name, and even stars as a fictionalised version of himself - Donny Dunn. A barman by day, and comedian by night, Donny keeps his severe emotional wounds deeply buried but is ultimately forced to confront his demons when seasoned stalker Martha Scott takes a seat at his bar.\n\nAs Martha, Jessica Gunning gave the performance of a lifetime, managing to imbue the complex character with both menace and compassion. Like Donny, we first meet Martha in a forlorn state, crying at the bar in The Heart Pub, where the dejected comedian works.\n\nFeeling sorry for Martha, who doesn't even have enough money on her for a drink, Donny offers her a cup of tea on the house - inadvertently sparking a bond that would quickly snowball into a full-blown obsession. At first, Donny views Martha as a harmless fantasist who notices him in the way his tepid audiences never do.\n\nIt soon dawns on him, however, that something far more serious is going on below the surface, with Martha's stalking behaviours infiltrating every part of his life. Martha is indeed based on a real individual who subjected Richard to a campaign of stalking - but a few details were changed during the screenwriting process.\n\nIn an interview with Variety, Richard explained that they had to make the character of Martha different from the real Martha for 'legal reasons', but what he was looking for was an actress who could capture that 'kind of energy'. According to Richard: \"I needed to see someone who was vulnerable one moment, angry the next, volatile but so desperate and sympathetic.\n\n\"I needed to see someone who could capture a full gamut of emotions. When somebody has severe mental health problems, they tend to leap from one emotion to the next, sometimes even quite quickly. And that's very hard to do from an acting point of view, but Jess seems to have it in her pores, it seems to just fall out of her.\"\n\nExpressing that he felt empathy for Martha, Richard continued: \"I have a bit of empathy overdrive sometimes. But it's not like anything I've seen on television before. Stalking usually is depicted as someone who is kind of evil, whereas I felt like there was a vulnerable person who genuinely couldn't stop, who for whatever reason had believed the reality that was inside her head and, no matter what, couldn't change from that. I mean, it is a mental illness and I wanted to portray that. I did see someone who I felt sorry for.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with The Independent, Richard shed some light on the ceaseless messages from Martha that pepper every episode. In real life, 'Martha' was similarly prolific, firing off more than 41,000 emails, 350 hours of voicemail, 744 tweets, and 46 Facebook messages, as well as 106 pages of letters. In the show, Martha is sent to jail. However, it is not believed that Richard's real-life stalker was ever convicted.\n\nAhead of tonight's pre-recorded conversation with Piers, the woman who allegedly provided the inspiration for Martha lashed out at the outspoken broadcaster, describing him as 'a twerp' and 'a bully'. In a heated Facebook post, the woman in question, who the Mirror has decided not to name or identify via pictures, wrote: \"Piers is a twerp. But we [already] know this. You will see in my interview.\"\n\nShe added: \"I'll let the [interview] speak for itself. Piers is a bully, we all know that. He triggers emotions. But this interview will get more views, by far, than most of his other interviews with all the misogynist men he often defends.... Andrew Tate, Donald Trump.\"\n\nAssault by TV writer\n\nBaby Reindeer took another dark turn in episode four, which explored Donny's rape at the hands of Darrien O'Connor (Tom Goodman-Hill), a successful TV writer who initially positions himself as Donny's mentor. Donny first encounters Darrien as a young comedian cutting his teeth at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and is quickly mesmerised by him.\n\nA connection that Donny initially perceives as a friendship emerges, with Darrien showering the fledgling comic with the praise he so desperately craves. For all Darrien's talk of Donny's bright future, however, the pair spend their weekends in Darrien's dingy flat, where the older man plies his 'protege' with drugs and repeatedly assaults him.\n\nIt makes for a devastating watch, with Donny's ordeal having a catastrophic effect on his sense of self-worth. As with the character of Martha, Richard has changed the name of his abuser, but Darrien is based on a real person.\n\nIn behind-the-scenes Netflix footage, Richard clarified: \"It's a true story, based on my early 20s when I went through some pretty crazy things... There's a flashback episode where we actually go back in time to Donny going to the Edinburgh Fringe and meeting someone in the industry who helps them in their career but goes on to abuse Donny and that's obviously taken from my real-life experiences.\"\n\nHe continued: \"It was a hell of a thing to write and shoot. It shows a side of abuse that I don't think we've seen before. I still think there's an idea that sexual abuse is a pill in a drink and dissolves and someone wakes up and doesn't know where they are and that does happen, and it's a big problem, but a lot of abuse occurs in very intimate relationships. I wanted to show how complicated and psychologically messed up situations could get to.\"\n\nRelationship with Teri\n\nIn Baby Reindeer, we see Donny fall for Teri (Nava Mau), a beautiful American trans-woman who initially believes her background as a therapist could help her reach through to Martha. Although Donny clearly has strong feelings for Teri, he manages to jeopardise their blossoming romance at every turn as, in his words: \"I loved one thing in the world more than her - hating myself.\"\n\nWracked with self-loathing, Donny lies about his own name, ditches Teri on the tube and, ultimately, his internalised shame and trauma bonding with Martha leads to the demise of their relationship. Viewers have naturally been curious to know whether there really was a Teri in Richard's life.\n\nIn the behind-the-scenes Netflix video, Richard revealed that Teri was indeed based on a real woman, who he says was a 'voice of reason'. He shared: \"The real-life person always used to call me out on my s*** and I always used to find it confronting. My behaviour was irrational and so it was very important to have Teri be the voice of reason in the show. I mean, she was the voice of reason in my life at that point as well, not that I listened to her as much as I should have.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with The Independent, Richard also explained that Donny's doomed relationship with Teri was inspired by his own experience dating a trans woman, which has left him with some real regrets. Richard said: \"It's in the public consciousness now, but it wasn't back then, when I was dating. It felt so new that it added a certain pressure, to me, that I really regret now. But that's what it explores in the show. This story was set back in a time when things were very different.\"\n\nOnstage breakdown\n\nIn episode six, Baby Reindeer reaches an emotional climax when, faced with a disdainful audience, Donny drops the props and the jokes and delivers the most powerful monologue of the series. After bottling up his trauma for so long, Donny opens up to the silent audience about what he's endured - in what turns out to be a turning point in the series.\n\nFootage of his speech goes viral, and Donny soon attracts praise for being so open, with his unexpected admission even bolstering his flagging comedy career. This also proves to be the catalyst that sees Donny finally tell his parents about the abuse he's suffered, receiving their support and honesty in return. Donny's onstage breakdown was one of the most memorable moments, but is there any truth in it?\n\nThis scene actually didn't happen in real life, however, Richard has spoken out about his experiences of sex abuse and stalking in his scripted theatre show Monkey See Monkey Do, in which a large monkey was used as a metaphor for the heavy burden of abuse.\n\nAlthough this show wasn't impromptu, as Donny's was, the response to Richard's story, at a time before male sexual assault was widely spoken about, proved to be equally life-changing. Remembering rehearsing before his first performance, Richard told The Guardian: \"I remember cracking up, because it was all going so badly, and the producer said, 'What do you want from this, man?' And I turned to him with tears in my eyes, and said, 'I just want to make it out alive'. Little did I know that it would provide a lifeline for me. The way people received that show, and received me, and accepted what happened to me: it saved my life. It's mad that it happened that way.\"\n\nDonny's moving monologue is given further authenticity as it contains excerpts from Richard's Baby Reindeer autobiographical one-man show, which inspired the hit series.\n\nIf you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

In the interview, which aired Thursday afternoon, Harvey officially came forward as the real-life Martha and called Richard Gadd, the writer and star of the series who plays a fictionalized version of himself, a \"liar\" and \"misogynist\" who's profiting off her misery by embellishing their interactions with one another. Both Gadd and Netflix have said the series is \"a true story.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer follows Gadd's complicated relationship with his stalker, as he's plagued by Martha's constant presence and correspondence, which he says consisted of 41,000 emails, 350 voicemails, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages, and 106 letters. But Harvey said this week that none of that ever happened -- and she plans to sue Gadd, Netflix, and anyone else who's \"going along and being in that play and doing this to somebody.\"\n\nAccording to Harvey, she and Gadd only met \"two or three times\" in real life. \"I don't lie,\" she told Morgan in their interview. But she was somehow both emphatic in her denial and uncertain at the same time. Harvey told Morgan that her only message to Gadd would be, \"Leave me alone please. Get a life, get a proper job,.\" She added, \"I am horrified at what you've done,\" and called him \"the ultimate misogynist\" and \"psychopath.\"\n\nHowever, Harvey got a bit wobbly when asked to defend herself. Questioned about whether or not she'd sent Gadd 41,000 emails, Harvey doubled down that the show is \"a figure of [Gadd's] imagination,\" but later admitted, \"There may have been a couple of emails,\" but just \"jokey banter ones.\" She said that at the time, \"I didn't think [Gadd] was a complete psychopath that would attack me.\"\n\n\"Even if it were true\" that she'd sent Gadd 41,000 emails (\"just playing devil's advocate here,\" she said), \"I didn't lunge at him across the bar, I didn't go to jail,\" as depicted in the series. Morgan pointed out that law enforcement could likely pinpoint which device the emails came from and whether it belonged to her -- and now that the world has heard her voice, it could easily be determined whether or not she'd left him the 350 voicemails. His line of questioning ultimately drove Harvey to clash with her interviewer. \"You've gone on at length for a good 10 minutes about the emails,\" she said to Morgan, sounding heated.\n\n\"I wouldn't be suing if I thought 41,000 emails were out there,\" she added, with the caveat that \"it wouldn't blow the case\" if that many emails were found. She also let slip that she has \"four phones\" and \"six email addresses\" -- but only because she likes separate communications on different devices, she said.\n\nAs far as the alleged 350 voicemails, Harvey initially said she \"doubt[s]\" Gadd really has that many voicemails and said, \"I've not phoned the guy\" -- but she later admitted to calling him before and even writing him a letter. If Gadd is able to provide 350 voicemails as evidence, Harvey said it'd only be because he'd taped her in the interest of drumming up media attention for his series. \"He's maybe forged things. People have forged a lot of things these days,\" she said of the other 105 handwritten letters she said she didn't write.\n\nKeeping up with the flip-flopping theme of the conversation, Harvey first told Morgan that she'd be willing to take a lie detector test to prove that she hadn't stalked Gadd, since \"I don't fancy little boys without jobs.\" But on second thought, \"A lie detector test for what?\" she asked, pushing the conversation to a different topic: \"They used [lie detectors] for mass murder and things. They don't use them that much.\"\n\nIn all, Harvey said the way she's been depicted in the series is \"completely untrue\" and has been \"very career-damaging\" to her job as an attorney, ever since social media users discovered her identity. \"Internet sleuths tracked me down, hounded me, gave me death threats,\" she said.\n\n\"[Gadd and Netflix] are milking it for all it's worth, for the money,\" she continued, adding that the actress playing Martha, Jessica Gunning, doesn't even look like her -- a point on which many viewers have disagreed.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voicemail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Voicemail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polygraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mass murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1715289606/martha_orxhcj", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Read our privacy policy\n\nOne of the most toxic aspects of British media culture is our tendency to seek out people - usually women, usually vulnerable in some way - who we use as a consequence-free punching bag. We did it to Jade Goody, we did it to Susan Boyle, and with the runaway success of the hit Netflix drama Baby Reindeer it seems as though we're about to start doing it to the real-life inspiration behind the show's antagonist, Martha.\n\nIf you're one of the three people who hasn't watched it yet, Baby Reindeer is a semi-fictionalised account of the life of the show's creator, Richard Gadd. The show focuses on struggling comedian Donny (Gadd's stand-in), who finds his life turned upside down when he is stalked by a customer of the pub he works at. Around 22 million people have watched the show according to Netflix's own viewing figures, which perhaps inevitably has resulted in fans wanting to know more about the real people on which the story is based.\n\nEver a man of the people, Piers Morgan has promised to satiate fans' desires by airing an interview with Fiona Harvey, the 58-year-old Scottish lawyer on whom Martha is allegedly based. The interview was filmed in advance and Harvey has already expressed some dissatisfaction with how it was conducted:\n\n\"I wouldn't say I was happy. It was very rapid to try to trip me up. He did it fast paced to catch me off guard ... It seemed to me that I was set up. I feel a bit used.\"\n\nThat isn't too surprising. In a tweet to promote the interview Morgan, with his limitless grace and tact, asked of Harvey \"Is she a psycho stalker?\", just in case you were wondering what kind of tone he's likely to strike. But that's just Piers Morgan being Piers Morgan - you can no more expect him to be sensitive than you can expect a fish to climb a tree. Morgan isn't the issue here - the real problem with this interview is that there's a market for it at all.\n\nIt seems like, when it comes to certain people, we feel as though we are entitled to wring as much entertainment and information as we can out of them to satisfy our insatiable need for drama. Regardless of what Harvey has or has not allegedly done (she denies stalking Gadd), it isn't something that any number of controversy-baiting television interviews will resolve. It certainly isn't something that can be solved with death threats, which Harvey claims to have received since being outed.\n\nIf there are any \"psycho stalkers\" in this story, it's us - the people sitting at home trying to dig up information about real people, who have experienced real trauma, because we aren't satisfied with the four-hour dramatised confessional created specifically for our consumption (probably because we binged it too quickly - I know I did). I understand being curious. If I'm being honest, the first thing I did after finishing the show was read as much information about it as I could.\n\nBut surely there's a limit to that curiosity? There should be - especially when it involves a person who might be considered vulnerable. It can be fun playing internet detective, gossiping about scandal and outrageous events - but we have a responsibility to take a step back, and consider if that gossip has the potential to be harmful.\n\nLet's not forget, part of the problem here lies with Richard Gadd himself. If Gadd wants to self-mythologise, that's one thing, but in creating Baby Reindeer he was always running the risk of dragging another, potentially highly vulnerable person into his quest for fame. Harvey has effectively been sacrificed on the altar of Gadd's career, and now she has to live with a type of fame she never asked for.\n\nDoes he have a right to do that? To tell his own story, regardless of how it might impact the other key players? Sure - it's worth remembering that he's a victim of trauma too. But while he had a measure of agency in how he approached that trauma, Harvey has not been afforded the same privilege.\n\nThere's a nasty tradition in this country of punching down on people like Harvey - people we collectively decide are worthy of our derision and declare open season on. Jeremy Kyle made an entire career out of it. It's a cornerstone of our political institutions. GB News wouldn't exist without it. But there's such a thing as going too far - and I'd say gawking at somebody with an alleged history of mental health issues qualifies.\n\nIf you're really desperate for more Baby Reindeer content, consider just rewatching the show. Bring a friend over who hasn't seen it, and enjoy watching them squirm. Or better yet, do yourself a favour and just watch something else.

Actor Sean Foley informed police that he has been wrongly identified as the \"real\" Darrien (who assaults Donny). Gadd has asked fans not to play guessing games with the identities of these people, as it's \"not the point of our show.\"", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bethy_squires@vulture.com", "name": "Bethy Squires", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baby_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Baby (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh Festival Fringe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Foley_(director)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Foley (director)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1aa/323/2caa5f71e8d86f8140d292e7042498e0fb-baby-reindeer.1x.rsocial.w1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Harvey was identified on Facebook by fans of the show and subsequently wrote a string of posts detailing a not-so-friendly relationship with Gadd.\n\n\"Fiona Harvey wants to have her say & 'set the record straight,'\" Morgan detailed in a post on X, along with a photo of the newsman standing behind Harvey on the set of his Piers Morgan Uncensored. The post went viral, with many users questioning the moral responsibility of providing such a public platform to someone who may be suffering from mental illness.\n\nMorgan's post came hours after Baby Reindeer came up during a U.K. parliament hearing focused on British film and television projects and featuring Netflix policy chief Benjamin King.\n\nHe told lawmakers that the streamer and producers at Clerkenwell Films took \"every reasonable precaution\" to disguise the identities of the people who inspired Gadd's work, which began as a stage play of the same name.\n\nKing said: \"Ultimately, it's obviously very difficult to control what viewers do, particularly in a world where everything is amplified by social media.

If there is even the slightest crack in the foundations of that hit, it will open into a chasm.\"\n\nHe concluded: \"All of the money that's spent on compliance and aftercare and all of those things is just in case.

I never expected it to sort of blow up like this.\n\n\"I believed it would be successful but I didn't expect overnight, I don't even like to use this word, fame.\n\n\"Suddenly I couldn't really walk down the street any more.\"\n\nBaby Reindeer is set to be the most popular Netflix show of all time.\n\nIn his first major interview since the show made him an overnight success, Gadd said \"I always believed in the show and I really loved it and I thought it would sit as a little cult, artistic gem on the Netflix platform maybe.\n\n\"But then overnight it was crazy. It felt like I woke up one day and everyone was watching it.\"\n\nGadd and his co-stars Jessica Gunning and Nava Mau headed to the US this week.\n\nThey took part in a Screen Actors Guild discussion panel on Tuesday night and attended an Emmys for your consideration screening of Baby Reindeer at West Hollywood's DGA Theater Complex on Sunset Blvd, Hollywood.\n\nThe series has been submitted as best limited series along with Gadd for best actor and best writing.\n\nGadd, who also plays the sexually ambiguous stalking victim Donny Dunn in Baby Reindeer, previously starred in the 2022 mini-series flop Wedding Season.\n\nHe revealed he lost a staggering five stone in weight in order to star in Baby Reindeer.\n\nHe said: \"I'd just shot this TV series called Wedding Season. No one watched it but I played this villain in it.\n\n\"I was about 16 stone when I did that. I was really really massive.\n\n\"I had tattoos and a weird haircut and all this stuff.\n\n\"Then Baby Reindeer, going out in that sort of post-drugs sort of fuelled, abuse-fuelled life.\n\n\"When I look back on my life in that period of time I was rake-thin so I really wanted to go back and feel that fragile in my body and feel emotionally fragile.\n\n\"So I went from 96kg down to 68.\n\n\"It was about a third of my body weight in the end.\n\n\"I was still writing the show and it was quite self-punishing.\"\n\nHe added: \"It was very much indicative of a very sort of troubled period in my life.\n\n\"I really wanted to go back there.\n\n\"We did closed sets, but I was looking over and you'd see the props guys wiping tears from their eyes.\n\n\"The show was based on such a trauma that everyone on set felt it at times.\"\n\nThe series is an adaptation of Gadd's one-man Edinburgh Fringe show.\n\nIt has drawn controversy over the ease with which internet sleuths were able to identify the real life Martha.\n\nThey trawled social media for the real posts seen in the show and identified Scots law graduate Fiona Harvey, 58.\n\nGadd admits to mixed feelings for Harvey.\n\nHe said: \"I remember when I was getting stalked, it was relentless and felt like it was everywhere and I felt like my life wasn't really functioning.\n\n\"I still had these unbelievable pangs of feeling sorry for her.\n\n\"I never saw someone who was a villain.\n\n\"I saw someone who was lost, by the system really. I saw someone who needed help and wasn't getting it.\"\n\nAnother major storyline involves Gadd being raped by a powerful male TV producer. Despite his failure to report the abuser to the police, he is proud to have shed a light on male rape and sexual assault with a spike in victims seeking help from charities including the Suzy Lamplaugh Trust, which supports victims of stalking.\n\nGadd said: \"It's amazing. All stalking and abuse charities are on the up.\n\n\"But the main sexual abuse charity for men in Britain is called We Are Survivors and they're up 200% in terms of referrals and 53% cite Baby Reindeer as the reason why.\n\n\"And then the work of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust. That's like the legacy that I want the show to have really.\"\n\nHe also admits it was difficult finding a balance between the true story and the needs of a compelling drama.\n\nGadd said: \"I never wanted to, kind of lie.\n\n\"I always had to constantly check myself to be like, does this feel truthful to me and to my experience all the way through?\n\n\"If it didn't, I would have to bring it back. But it was a tightrope.\n\n\"It was a constant process between what works for a TV show and not selling out on your own story, and that continued all the way from writing all the way to filming and all the way through the editing process in finding that right balance.\n\n\"I think we did in the end, but it was a hell of a process.\"\n\nHe added: \"I quite like the fact that its message is ambiguous.\n\n\"I sometimes have problems with work where it's so clear what it's trying to say to you.\n\n\"I've seen so many different articles on the ending of Baby Reindeer.\n\n\"For example, that where Donny looks up at the bar and people have said, well, it means he's a stalker or it means that he's realised he's similar to Martha. \"I've seen about seven different interpretations of that and I like that because I ultimately want my people to take what they want from my work.\"\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond -

The woman, who the Mirror has chosen not to name or identify via photographs, claims the controversial broadcaster \"triggered\" her emotions during their sit-down for his YouTube channel - and then branded him a \"bully\" and a \"twerp\".\n\nThe law graduate, who claims to be the woman accused in Richard Gadd's drama series, said yes to the star because she wanted to air her side of the story. But she denies suggestions she is cashing in - and said she earned just a few hundred pounds from her trip to London, where she spoke openly about being outed as the comedian's alleged stalker.\n\nJust hours before her interview goes online this evening, she told her connections on Facebook: \"Piers is a twerp. But we [already] know this. You will see in my interview I'll let the [interview] speak for itself. Piers is a bully, we all know that. He triggers emotions. But this interview will get more views. By far most of his other interviews with all misogynist men he often defends Andrew Tate Donald Trump.\"\n\nPiers Morgan was a 'twerp' according to the woman who claims to be the real-life Martha\n\nNow the woman told the Daily Record how she was unhappy with the questions that Piers put to her and described her interview as a \"sparring match\". She said: \"There was a heavy emphasis from Piers Morgan on Gadd and the emails I am supposed to have sent. I have my own thoughts on it that I'd like to keep to myself but I wouldn't say I was happy. It was very rapid to try to trip me up. He did it fast paced to catch me off guard.\n\n\"Piers kept saying to me 'are you sure you haven't sent this guy 41,000 emails and phone calls?'. A lot of the interview, for a good 10 minutes, he kept coming back to this. I said, 'Look, Even if I had sent some emails, it doesn't mean I'm guilty of the rest of the stuff. As I said, in order to bill something as a true story, it's got to be pretty much 100% true. It seemed to me that I was set up. I feel a bit used.\"\n\nSince the show hit the streaming service, the 'real Martha' said she is considering legal action\n\nThe chilling drama series centres on struggling comedian Donny Dunn's (Gadd) strange and layered relationship with a woman named Martha (Jessica Gunning), whose initially friendly demeanor unravels as she begins to stalk Donny relentlessly. During the course of multiple years, Martha sends Donny more than 41,000 emails, 744 tweets, 100 pages of letters and 350 hours of voicemails.\n\nFollowing its release last month, Baby Reindeer became a streaming sensation and is on course to be one of the Netflix's most-watched shows.

I have heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences.\"\n\nShe added: \"I haven't watched any of it... I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic.\n\n\"Some of the death threats have been really terrible online, people phoning me up.

It has been acclaimed by everyone from Stephen King to Cardi B.\n\nMorgan has been widely criticised on social media for pressing ahead with the interview, which has been dubbed as \"completely irresponsible broadcasting\" and \"trauma porn\".\n\nViewers of the series have raised concerns about Harvey's mental health and whether there has been any duty of care towards her.\n\nGadd received over 40,000 emails, 740 tweets, 350 hours of voicemail, 100 pages of letters and 45 Facebook messages in the five years after he first handed a woman a cup of tea.\n\nWhen asked if she had sent any messages to Gadd in her interview with Piers Morgan Harvey said she \"had not sent him anything\". She added that \"there may have been a couple of emails\" and denied that she had sent him any texts or Facebook messages.\n\nHe first turned his experiences into a one-man show Baby Reindeer, a reference to the nickname his stalker gave him.\n\nThe show won an award at the Edinburgh Fringe and played in London's Bush Theatre in 2019, also winning an Olivier award.\n\nIt was due to transfer to the West End but never opened due to the coronavirus pandemic.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laurence Olivier Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardi_B", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardi B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bush Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duty of care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West End theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh Festival Fringe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/1693949aafe44212536aab398f801bfe", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-18", "textStart": 2008, "textEnd": 2016}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

It is based on Richard's real life experience.\n\nRichard has opened up about filming episode four, in which his character is sexually assaulted by a male TV writer who takes struggling comedian Donny under his wing.\n\nHe told Variety: 'We did close the set, but I was looking over and you'd see the props guys wiping tears from their eyes as they would be putting the props back how they should be.'\n\nRichard Gadd has revealed there were tears shed on the set of Baby Reindeer during filming of some of the show's most harrowing scenes\n\nRichard has opened up about filming episode four, in which his character is sexually assaulted\n\n'The show was based in such a trauma that everyone on set felt at times it was a huge, weighty thing. And it's why I think everyone had such respect for everything. I was blessed with this amazing team who kind of felt it with me in a lot of ways.'\n\nIn the same interview, Jessica told how Richard works with We Are Survivors, a non-profit organisation that supports male victims of rape and sexual abuse.\n\nThe organisation has reportedly experienced a 200% increase in people looking for support, with 60% of them citing Baby Reindeer as the reason they reached out.\n\nJessica said of the show: 'It's not an easy, buttoned-up story. Everything doesn't get tied up at the end. I think it's messy, like life is. Their dynamic is complicated and he's really honest about that. That's so refreshing to see.'\n\nRichard said making the show with Netflix, based on two critically acclaimed shows he wrote and performed at the Edinburgh Fringe festival, was cathartic and helped him come to terms with what happened earlier in his life.\n\n'If people see it they will know almost everything about me. They might judge, they might not agree, and that innately comes with some degree of anxiety, but that's what I signed up for,' he told The Times.\n\nHe pitched the show to Netflix after combining two critically acclaimed Edinburgh Fringe shows, Baby Reindeer and Monkey See, Monkey Do, which addressed his stalking and sexual assault respectively.\n\nOver a period of four-and-a-half years, the actor said he received 41,071 emails , 744 tweets, letters totalling 106 pages and 350 hours of voicemail messages. Richard told the Times police did not take his concerns seriously despite his worries about how far the real-life Martha might go in her twisted pursuits.\n\nHe said: 'We did close the set, but I was looking over and you'd see the props guys wiping tears from their eyes as they would be putting the props back how they should be'\n\nThe Netflix show, which follows Richard's character Donny as he is stalked by a woman named Martha, played by Jessica Gunning, has become a global hit since its release\n\nHe now says he is less likely to trust people after his adverse experiences with both men and women.\n\nRichard concluded: 'I used to enter situations with such abandonment, never thinking ahead and throwing my trust into people, and I got burnt. Now getting close to people can be hard.'\n\nBaby Reindeer has proven a surprise smash for Netflix, having been viewed more than 60 million times in the first month.\n\nRichard claimed he went to great lengths to conceal the identity of the woman who stalked him in real life.\n\nIn the series, after Richard meets his stalker at the bar, things soon descend into chaos.\n\nThe chilling real-life drama was inspired by the ordeal suffered by Scottish creator and leading man Richard Gadd at the hands of 'Martha' (played by Jessica Gunning, right)\n\nRichard was a struggling stand-up comic working behind the bar at a pub in London\n\nIt sees him being regularly followed at home and work, and tracked on Facebook using three fake accounts.\n\nHe told The Times: 'At first everyone at the pub thought it was funny that I had an admirer. Then she started to invade my life, following me, turning up at my gigs, waiting outside my house, sending thousands of voicemails and emails.'\n\nHe said it was 'years' before the police eventually took his complaints seriously - and six years before they finally intervened - something which prolonged the agony for everyone involved including his relatives.\n\nThe police told him at the time that unless his stalker became physically violent, there was little they could do to resolve the issue.\n\nHe has said he still finds it hard to trust people and has had 'every therapy going'.\n\nHe added that the years of being stalked have left him with something 'like PTSD'. For the Netflix role, he lost weight to match his 10-and-a-half stone 'neurotic' self at the height of his own stalking nightmare.\n\nGadd has revealed he first encountered 'Martha' when he was working in a pub and offered her a cup of tea because she was crying\n\nRichard said he's currently single and 'is more cautious' of people because of the campaign of terror that Martha inflicted, saying: 'It takes me a long time to trust them. Before, I entered situations with such abandonment and I got burnt.'\n\nHowever, performing a version of what happened to him has enabled him to have 'ownership' of the trauma. Gadd earned a Fringe award for his stage show, also called Baby Reindeer, in 2019.\n\nSpeaking to the Telegraph in 2019 about the one-man show that he wrote after the ordeal, which is currently on at London's Bush theatre, he said: 'It was debilitating beyond belief.\n\n'I'd listen to her voicemails and just feel my eyes welling up. They were tears of frustration.

The Scottish comedian, 34, says show's runaway success means he is now unable to walk the streets.\n\nHe expected the show to sit as 'a little cult artistic gem' when it first aired, only to wake up and find people camping in his garde. Baby Reindeer is set to be the most popular Netflix show of all time, reports the Daily Record.\n\nGadd, who plays himself in the seven-part series, said: \"I really believed in this show, but it really felt like one day it went on the platform and the next day there were people camping in my garden.\n\nREAD MORE: Residents react as 'Baby Reindeer star moves to Skelmersdale'\n\n\"And it was, like, crazy. I never expected it to sort of blow up like this. I believed it would be successful, but I didn't expect overnight. I don't even like to use this word, 'fame'. Suddenly I couldn't really walk down the street any more.\"\n\nIn his first major interview since the show made him an overnight success, Gadd said he 'always believed in the show and really loved it and thought it would sit as a little cult, artistic gem on the Netflix platform maybe'. He added: \"But then, overnight, it was crazy. It felt like I woke up one day and everyone was watching it.\"\n\nGadd and his co-stars Jessica Gunning and Nava Mau headed to the US this week to take part in a Screen Actors Guild discussion panel and attended an Emmys for your consideration screening of Baby Reindeer at West Hollywood's DGA Theater Complex on Sunset Blvd, Hollywood.\n\nThe series has been submitted as best limited series along with Gadd for best actor and best writing. Gadd, who plays stalking victim Donny Dunn in Baby Reindeer, previously starred in the 2022 mini-series Wedding Season.\n\nHe revealed he lost five stone to star in Baby Reindeer. He said: \"I'd just shot this TV series called Wedding Season. No one watched it, but I played this villain in it. I was about 16 stone when I did that. I was really really massive.\"\n\n\"I had tattoos and a weird haircut and all this stuff. Then Baby Reindeer, going out in that sort of post-drugs sort of fuelled, abuse-fuelled life. When I look back on my life in that period of time I was rake-thin so I really wanted to go back and feel that fragile in my body and feel emotionally fragile.\n\n\"So I went from 96kg down to 68. It was about a third of my body weight in the end. I was still writing the show and it was quite self-punishing. It was very much indicative of a very sort of troubled period in my life. I really wanted to go back there.\n\n\"We did closed sets, but I was looking over and you'd see the props guys wiping tears from their eyes. The show was based on such a trauma that everyone on set felt it at times.\"\n\nThe series is an adaptation of Gadd's one-man Edinburgh Fringe show. It has drawn controversy over the ease with which internet sleuths were able to identify the real life Martha.\n\n\"I remember when I was getting stalked, it was relentless and felt like it was everywhere and I felt like my life wasn't really functioning,\" Gadd added. \"I still had these unbelievable pangs of feeling sorry for her.\n\n\"I never saw someone who was a villain. I saw someone who was lost, by the system really. I saw someone who needed help and wasn't getting it.\"\n\nAnother major storyline involves Gadd being raped by a powerful male TV producer. Gadd said he is proud to have shed a light on the issue, with a spike in victims seeking help from charities including the Suzy Lamplaugh Trust.\n\nGadd said: \"It's amazing. All stalking and abuse charities are on the up. But the main sexual abuse charity for men in Britain is called We Are Survivors and they're up 200 per cent in terms of referrals - and 53pc cite Baby Reindeer as the reason why.\n\n\"And then the work of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust. That's like the legacy that I want the show to have really.\"\n\nHe also admits it was difficult finding a balance between the true story and the needs of a compelling drama.\n\nGadd said: \"I never wanted to, kind of lie. I always had to constantly check myself to be like, does this feel truthful to me and to my experience all the way through? If it didn't, I would have to bring it back. But it was a tightrope.\n\n\"It was a constant process between what works for a TV show and not selling out on your own story, and that continued all the way from writing all the way to filming and all the way through the editing process in finding that right balance. I think we did in the end, but it was a hell of a process.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_holt@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "James Holt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Complex Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directors_Guild_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Directors Guild of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Boulevard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunset Boulevard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screen Actors Guild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Hollywood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Hollywood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Hollywood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh Festival Fringe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/article29141413.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_capturepng.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

However, who is not at all happy with all this fuss.

He is also host of the daily What to Watch podcast and weekly video series, as well as The Awardist podcast. Gerrad also cohosts EW's live Oscars, Emmys, SAG, and Grammys red carpet shows, and he has appeared on Good Morning America, The Talk, Access Hollywood, Extra!, and other talk shows, delivering the latest news on pop culture and entertainment.\n\nRichard Gadd and Jessica Gunning are in disbelief.\n\n\"It's been crazy,\" Gadd, the creator and star of the limited series Baby Reindeer, says on The Awardist podcast of the past few weeks since the show's debut on Netflix. \"I always believed in the show and I always thought it would be maybe a critical cult success, but I don't think I expected it to blow up in the way that it has.\"\n\nGunning is just as amazed. \"I think I knew it'd be a pretty special thing to be part of when I first read it, but I never, ever in my wildest dreams thought it would be this big,\" she says.\n\nSince its debut on April 11, the series -- based on Gadd's own experiences of being stalked by a woman who happened upon the bar where he worked, as well as being sexually assaulted by a TV producer who had become a mentor-like figure to him -- has spent the past three weeks at No. 1 on the streaming platform.\n\nGadd plays a fictionalized version of himself named Donny Dunn. A struggling comedian, he bartends at a pub where a depressed and broke Martha Scott, played by a magnetic Gunning, wanders into one day. His ability to make her laugh becomes anything but funny when she begins stalking him, turning up daily to the pub, following him home, sending more than 41,000 emails and hundreds of texts, and more.\n\nYears prior, we see how Donny was groomed and sexually assaulted by a TV producer, here named Darrien O'Connor (played by Tom Goodman-Hill), who takes him under his wing.\n\nGadd originally shared his story in a one-man show; he then wrote the series and also stars, reliving the traumas of his life. But he says he never considered someone else playing this version of himself.\n\n\"I was always willing to go down that road. I would never cast myself to the detriment of a project. I think there's been projects -- I'm not going to name any names or something -- where I think people have cast themselves in roles to the detriment of the project, and it's just felt like a vehicle for them to do an acting turn or something like this,\" Gadd tells EW. \"But I felt that it added a layer of intrigue to the show, the fact that I had been through things and then playing them out on screen. I thought it would be an interesting discussion point, which it has proved to be, and I thought it added a layer of almost art to the show.\"\n\nCheck out more from EW's The Awardist, featuring exclusive interviews, analysis, and our podcast diving into all the highlights from the year's best in TV.\n\nA discussion point, indeed. With millions of eyes on the series, interest -- understandably, inevitably -- has turned to viewers' desire to know the real identity of the people at the center of his story. As he has maintained since the series debuted, Gadd says that isn't the point. (Gunning says she doesn't \"know anything about the real person\" and \"no one's been in touch with me.\") Even with some very convincing proof pointing to one specific woman, who is now doing interviews about the series, Gadd holds firm on protecting the identities of the real Martha and Darrien.\n\n\"I've gone about telling this story how I want to tell it. How I heal myself and my journey is up to me, really. I think it's a dark society that puts pressure on victims -- survivors -- of sexual abuse, to sort of do anything with it. Their job is to do what's right for them at the time,\" Gadd says. \"I want Baby Reindeer to be enjoyed as a piece of work. I got a great deal of catharsis from doing shows like [the one-man show] Monkey See Monkey Do and shows like Baby Reindeer and putting both those live shows into the series that we now know as Baby Reindeer. I got a great deal of healing from that. And I am not going to ever name the real-life people behind this show, and I don't think the pressure should be on survivors to out their abusers -- the pressure should be on the abusers to stop abusing.\"\n\nAs Donny's stalker, Gunning is captivating in her ability to be sheepish or flirty one minute and angry and obsessive the next. It's a gem of a role on paper -- \"It's the best thing I've ever read,\" Gunning admits -- and, while complicated and daunting, also one to play.\n\n\"I don't think there has been a character like Martha really written before, with so many sides to her, so complicated and truthfully told, so nuanced, and not black and white, not your kind of average stalker story at all,\" she says. \"That's what was so exciting about the project.\"\n\nGiven the enormous success of the series, one might assume that Netflix would be hungry for more. Audiences, it seems, would come along for the ride. But by all accounts, Gadd is done with this chapter of his life.\n\n\"I'm 99.9 percent sure that Baby Reindeer is done,\" he says. \"It's got this full circle element to it -- the way he meets Martha, the way it finishes. I think it's a limited series. It captures that moment in my life [from] the moment it kind of began up to the moment it ended. But season 2 would be some sort of fictional jump-off point of some kind. Baby Reindeer has been received with such global love and affection, and I think a lot of that stems from the authenticity of everything, and I wouldn't want to just do a second season for the sake of it and start placing these characters inside moments and stuff that I couldn't recognize in myself and in my own life. And I worry that the authenticity would leak out of the screen.\"\n\nListen to the Awardist podcast below for more from Gadd and Gunning, as they look back on the episodes they couldn't wait to get filmed and behind them, why Gadd wishes this is a show he was able to watch when he was younger, how they found moments of levity on the set, and more.", "source": {"uri": "ew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning,_New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gunning, New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gunning, New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Television producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_series_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limited series (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_(U.S._TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Access (U.S. TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martha Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screen Actors Guild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talk show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talk_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Talk (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cult following"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Goodman-Hill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Goodman-Hill"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/ob2fyKOu0M1TxLQ3naivh3WgXls=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1082x339:1084x341)/Baby-Reindeer-050824-4a1fa08798b349859a13230fe9925e85.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 1052, "textEnd": 1060}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

As you know, it's the fog of war...\"\n\nMorgan pressed further: \"You've got exact numbers for the Hamas terrorists you've killed, why wouldn't you know how many civilians you've killed?\"\n\nHyman replied: \"Because obviously, our focus is to go after the Hamas terrorists...\"\n\nMorgan interjected: \"But hang on, that does imply that you're putting a bigger premium on killing Hamas terrorists in terms of numbers and accountability, than you are innocent civilians - that can't be right, surely?\n\n\"If you know exactly how many Hamas terrorists you've killed, you must know how many civilians you've killed, otherwise you're prioritising the lives of terrorists over innocent people.\"\n\nAfter a five-minute clip of the longer interview was shared to social media, viewers have praised the \"exemplary\" display of journalism:\n\nThis, however, was soon contrasted by the news that, on Thursday's edition of his programme, he would be interviewing Fiona Harvey, who he described as the \"real-life Martha\" who inspired the character in the Netflix series, Baby Reindeer.\n\nWritten by and starring Richard Gadd, and drawing from his real-life experience (it's also based on a stage play of the same name), the limited series follows a comedian who is stalked by a woman named 'Martha' after offering her a free cup of tea at a bar he works at.\n\nFollowing Morgan's announcement of the interview on social media, people have slammed the \"world exclusive\" as \"irresponsible\":\n\nThe upcoming interview is despite Gadd issuing a statement on social media last month urging internet sleuths not to speculate on the real-life identities of those featured in the series - not just Martha (played by Jessica Gunning), but also a TV executive named 'Darrien' (played by Tom Goodman-Hill) who groomed and sexually assaulted Gadd.\n\nHe said: \"People I love, have worked with, and admire (including Sean Foley) are unfairly caught up in speculation.

Meanwhile, others said it was appropriate to allow her to share her alleged version of events, which Morgan acknowledged he'd never know the full truth about.\n\nThe woman was identified as Fiona Harvey, 58 - quickly noting she was a year younger than Morgan during the interview - as Morgan disclaimed Harvey gave permission to use her identity and was entitled to her right of reply.\n\nHarvey said she felt \"forced\" into the limelight as the internet tracked her down and \"sent her death threats.\" She said she appeared on Morgan's show as he is a \"veteran broadcaster\" and felt like Morgan would give her a \"fair hearing.\"\n\nHere are 12 things we learnt from the interview:\n\nWhen asked whether she had watched any of the Netflix hit, Harvey responded she hadn't.\n\nShe said it has taken over \"enough of [her] life,\" and she finds the show \"obscene,\" \"horrifying\" and \"misogynistic.\"\n\nHarvey said she discovered Baby Reindeer was about her when she heard about Gadd's play around five years ago but was baffled, as she claims she had only met him less than a handful of times.\n\n\"I don't know him,\" she told Morgan, adding: \"I probably should have possibly injuncted at that stage.\"\n\nHarvey claimed the alleged ordeal never started over a free cup of tea as depicted in Baby Reindeer.\n\n\"[Gadd] didn't offer me a cup of tea, nobody gets anything for free in the Holy Arms,\" she told Morgan.\n\nShe claimed she was visiting the pub for a meal and \"a drink of lemonade.\"\n\n\"I was very, very hungry,\" she added. \"I'm diabetic so very hungry.\"\n\nHarvey claimed Gadd interrupted a conversation between her and another barman, which she called \"rude.\"\n\n\"He seemed to be obsessed with me from that moment onwards,\" she alleged.\n\n\"I had a toy reindeer, and he shaved his head, that bit is true,\" she told Morgan. \"And there were reindeers in the shops - it was Christmas time or something.\"\n\nShe went on to say the reindeer comments were intended to be a \"joke\".\n\nClaims suggest that Harvey bombarded Gadd with an overwhelming amount of messages and voicemails.\n\n\"That's simply not true,\" Harvey hit back, despite Netflix saying the details are \"the real ones,\" according to Morgan.\n\n\"If somebody was sending someone 41,000 emails a day, how many would they be sending a day? Lots,\" Harvey said.\n\n\"Absolutely not, none of that's true,\" she claimed, alleging: \"I don't think I sent him anything.\"\n\nShe added that there may have been \"a few emails,\" that were simply \"jokey banter emails.\"\n\nMorgan highlighted that there were tweets online, to which Harvey claimed there were only 14-18 tweets because they \"were all friends.\"\n\nShe later rectified her comments saying there was \"one letter\" after seeing Gadd's interview in a newspaper where he opened up about his abuse.\n\nWhen quizzed on how Netflix had that information, Harvey claimed Gadd \"probably made it up himself.\"\n\nMorgan pressed Harvey on whether she'd be happy for someone to check her computer, to which she said: \"Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, you know, yeah.\"\n\nMorgan brought up the infamous 'sent from my iPhone reference' from Baby Reindeer.\n\n\"I don't really understand that,\" Harvey said. \"I'm not technology wizz kid of the year. I wasn't doing that either.\"\n\nMorgan highlighted that accusing people of lying is \"pretty defamatory.\"\n\n\"When you make such an emphatic denial of the central point of the story, you're basically accusing both him but also Netflix of lying about it,\" he said.\n\nHarvey responded: \"I am... It's not defamatory if it's true.\"\n\nMorgan highlighted how easy it would be for authorities to track down the alleged emails and communications if the matter goes to court.\n\nWhen asked whether she'd be prepared to do that, Harvey said \"Yes, because I didn't write him the emails.\"\n\nMorgan asked who she thought sent the emails, to which she claimed Gadd \"probably made them up himself.\"\n\nShe also said she would \"like to see Netflix's evidence for that.\"\n\nThe journalist said the actress resembled Harvey, to which she hit back: \"Do you think so? That's hardly flattering.\"\n\nShe later claimed she had never been to jail or been charged with a criminal offence.\n\n\"That's completely false, and I don't think the actress sounds like me,\" she added.\n\nAfter saying she got the impression Gadd was \"all out for himself\" and \"wanted to control that bar,\" she claimed to Morgan she had only known him for \"two or three months at maximum.\"\n\n\"I should've never gone in that bar,\" she laughed.\n\n\"He only worked there on certain days,\" she continued.\n\nShe admitted to having four to six email addresses at one point: \"It's easier. Some for utilities, some for your close friends whatever.\"\n\nMorgan suggested that was \"a lot\" and that he didn't know many people with several email addresses.\n\n\"Is it?\" Harvey quipped. \"Well, you don't know many people then.\"\n\nShe also confessed to having four phones: \"I like keeping people on separate phones as well. Maybe that makes me a maniac or a stalker or something, but if you've got somebody on about your electricity bill or somebody on about some work or something, it's nice to keep it separate.\"\n\nHarvey said she was never in love with Gadd, but claimed he asked her to sleep with him when he had \"a big green spot on his face,\" to which she allegedly responded: \"No, I'm sorry.

It is an attempt to project an image of stability and normalcy in contrast to her current life.\n\n\"Signing off her emails with 'Sent from my iPhone' despite not owning one may serve as a symbolic link to her former status.\"\n\nDannielle noted that the small detail could be rooted in a desire to preserve her 'previous identity'.\n\n\"This small but deliberate act of deception may reflect her deep-seated need to preserve her previous identity, which has been shattered by her imprisonment,\" she adds.\n\n\"This insistence on a fictional narrative showcases the psychological complexities of coping with downfall. It also demonstrates how individuals might go to great lengths to retain some semblance of their former selves in the face of drastic life changes.\n\n\"Martha's story is a raw illustration of the human desire for esteem and the lengths to which someone might go to maintain an illusion of who they once were.\"\n\nThe interview will feature on Piers Morgan Uncensored at 8pm.", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LADbible"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LADbible_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LADbible Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/bltcd74acc1d0a99f3a/bltc160b35a2b138962/663d08d79468675f9ddb1e53/Why-Martha-put-sent-from-my-iphone-at-the-end-of-every-email.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 16, "textEnd": 21}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

And if it didn't, I would have to bring it back.\"\n\nWhile appearing at the panel earlier this week, Gadd also revealed how he never saw Martha's character as a \"villain\" but rather \"someone who needed help\".\n\nMeanwhile, the woman claiming to be the inspiration behind Martha's character has done her first TV interview, which will air on Piers Morgan Uncensored today at 8pm BST.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_berry@nme.com", "name": "Alex Berry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobiography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autobiography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directors_Guild_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Directors Guild of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Celebrity_Homemakers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Celebrity Homemakers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Rape", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Rape", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Richard-Gadd-baby-reindeer.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Fiona is allegedly the woman who stalked comedian Richard Gadd for months on end, leading to him creating the series that has become a massive hit on the streamer.\n\nDespite Gadd publicly pleading with his fans not to try to figure out who the people in his story were, the internet had already deduced that Fiona Harvey was the culprit thanks to tweets resurfacing from her past. In the tweets from 2014, she asks Gadd if he received her emails or if she is using the wrong address. In another, she urges people to go and see his show citing that he has a 'fantastic ass.' Another still shows her telling the comedian that her 'curtains need hanging badly' in reference to a sexual innuendo Gadd once reportedly made.\n\nRELATED:\n\nAt first, Fiona took to her Facebook page to deny that she was the subject of the series but has since written numerous posts accusing Gadd of being the one who stalked her and claiming that he \"would do anything for fame.\" She is now set to tell her side of the story to Morgan who revealed the news in social posts that sparked mixed responses.\n\nOn Instagram, the host posted a video that echoes the opening title sequence of Baby Reindeer, with a typed message promoting Fiona's appearance. The promo even includes Martha's signature 'sent from my ihpone' - mimicking the way she would often spell the sign-off incorrectly.\n\nA great scoop or morally corrupt?\n\n\"Exploiting an already clearly vulnerable and potentially mentally ill person for views and when it was explicitly explained they wanted to protect her from the public eye?\" one person questioned.\n\n\"This feels wrong on sooo many levels,\" another said.\n\n\"This woman clearly has mental health issues,\" added another. \"She's a vulnerable person. Shouldn't be exploited like this for clicks and views.\"\n\nAnother wrote, \"Disgusting; you're giving a person who nearly ruined someone else's life a platform?? For a few views?? Desperate and disgusting.\"\n\n\"Monetizing with a mental [sic] ill person with several restriction orders sick... you should be ashamed,\" someone else scathingly wrote.\n\nOthers were more forgiving, with one viewer writing, \"Great scoop, always two sides to a story\", while another said \"The biggest get.\"\n\n\"Piers is about to break the internet with this interview,\" another predicted.\n\n'Clearly unethical'\n\nThe reactions were equally divided on X where Piers posted a different promo for the interview in which he asks \"Is she a psycho stalker?\" along with a photo of himself with Fiona.\n\n\"This woman is mentally ill,\" one person wrote under the post. \"This is irresponsible.\"\n\nSaid another, \"This is exploitation of a person who is in a vulnerable position. Clearly unethical.\"\n\n\"This guy has absolutely no shame!\" someone else said.\n\n'Nothing short of exploitative'\n\nMany others shared their concerns for Fiona's mental well-being and the imminent threat of her being trolled and abused following the interview, accusing Piers of exploiting her for his own gain.\n\n\"This feels so grim and exploitative, even for you,\" someone scolded.\n\n\"Exploiting another person with mental health issues, top work Piers,\" another wrote along with the eye roll emoji.\n\n\"From everything I've read and seen about this lady, interviewing her in public is nothing short of exploitative,\" someone else wrote. \"I hope your team has some checks and balances in place ahead of broadcast and, at the very least, provides some professional aftercare.\"\n\nSaid another still \"Just a way to exploit someone who clearly has or had mental health issues. Anyway to make a bit of money. Id mention morals but we all know you lack them!\"\n\nFiona Harvey says she has received death threats\n\nPiers' followers concerns about Fiona's safety are valid given that she has previously revealed that she has received death threats since Baby Reindeer premiered.\n\nSHOP:\n\n\"I've had death threats from richard gadd supporters on here this week,\" she wrote on her Facebook several weeks ago. \"I've had vile stalking and abusive threats. I know nothing about richard gadd apart from His sorry little life story I listened to on a sophie hagan podcast he did with her when baby reindeer came out.\"\n\nFiona has mentioned an upcoming TV interview in several of her recent Facebook posts, apparently in reference to her appearance on Piers Morgan Uncensored.\n\n\"Just to let you know I won't be commenting on anything to do with baby reindeer the show until After I have don e this TV appearance next week,\" she writes. \"I've still got a lot to say obviously. It is an exclusive. Commenting on here is time consuming. I have a great many other things to do and am Running behind due to this baby reindeer circus. I've not made a penny from it. I've been abused terribly and intimidated. I hope you'll tune in t o the real Story on TV.

I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions. And this is just complete nonsense.\"\n\nHarvey claims to be setting the record straight after being unmasked by fans of the hit Netflix show.\n\nAt the start of each episode it states 'This is a True Story'.\n\nBut Harvey added: \"We've had no apologies from Netflix or him, nothing. I mean, for someone who says he feels sorry for me, I've had no apology.\n\n\"My character seems to have smashed up a bar, sexually assaulted him in a canal, been to prison. There are a number of other allegations, and... That's not true.\"\n\nHarvey said Gadd, who also stars in the drama series, was \"making money out of untrue facts\".\n\nAnd she has vowed to sue the show's makers after being thrust into the spotlight and suffering online abuse.\n\nDuring the interview, she denied ever being at his home, contacting his parents or sending thousands of texts and email messages.\n\nDuring the much-anticipated hour-long show, she also admits owning four mobile phones and a string of different email addresses.\n\nOn being 'outed' within hours as the 'real-life Martha' online, she said: \"On the internet, sleuths tracked me down and hounded me and gave me death threats. So it wasn't really a choice. I was forced into this situation.\"\n\nAsked if she had watched the drama, she replied: \"Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff... I haven't watched any of it.\"\n\n\"You're not curious to?\" Morgan added.\n\n\"No, I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic.\n\n\"Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up.\n\n\"You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nSaying that she had only met Gadd two or three times, she said she first heard about the Netflix show two weeks ago.\n\nShe said the interest in her was: \"Absolutely horrendous. Absolutely horrendous. I couldn't believe he'd done that. And so long after the first meeting, you know, we're talking 10, 12 years ago. Really horrendous.\"\n\nHarvey added: \"I just generally think he's got extreme psychiatric problems... It's a work of fiction.\n\n\"It's a work of hyperbole, as I've always said. And there are two true facts in that. His name is Richard Gadd, and he works as a jobbing barman on benefits, in the Hawley Arms. And we met, two or three times...\"\n\nMorgan asked if it was true Gadd had offered her a free cup of tea after she walked into the pub where he was working, she replied: \"No, that's not correct. He didn't offer me a cup of tea...\n\n\"I was in for a meal with, a drink of lemonade, and I was very, very hungry. I'm diabetic, so, very hungry. So that's true.\"\n\nMorgan said: \"And did you talk to him?\"\n\nHarvey said: \"And he interrupted a conversation... he said, 'Oh, you're Scottish', and basically commandeered the conversation. You know, I was talking to somebody. It's pretty rich. Interrupt. So he seemed to be obsessed with me from that moment onwards.\"\n\nOn whether she said he looked like a 'baby reindeer' toy she had as a child, she added: \"I had a toy reindeer and he'd shaved his head, that bit is true, and there were reindeer in the shops because it was Christmas time or something. It was a joke. So I have inadvertently penned the name of the show.\"\n\nShe also confirmed banter in the pub had been common, like talking about hanging curtains. \"This was a Hawley Arms joke about curtains and a lot of sexual innuendo,\" she said.\n\nHarvey denied Gadd had ever been caught peeping in her window, adding: \"False... I didn't see him at my house. I think it would be impossible to look through a window... That categorically didn't happen.\"\n\nPressed on the 41,000 emails, 350 hours of voice messages, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages, and 106 letters she is alleged to have sent him, she retorted: \"That's simply not true. If somebody was sending somebody 41,000 emails or something, they'd be doing how many a day? Lots.\"\n\nMorgan replied: \"Well, it'd be obsessive.\" Harvey responded: \"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. No. It's...\"\n\nShe went on to say they had a couple of email exchanges, resulting in about 10 emails sent by her.\n\nShe said it was \"jokey banter\", but she never sent Facebook or text messages - though then admitted she did send around 18 tweets.\n\nHarvey went on to admit she had sent him one letter. Pressed on who had sent him all the correspondence, she said: \"I have no idea. I think he's probably made it up himself.\"\n\nShe added she would be happy for someone to look at her computer.\n\nOn whether she ever heckled Gadd at a comedy show, she said: \"I think I went to one. It was a long, long time [ago].\"\n\nAnd asked if she ever attacked one of the comedian's girlfriends during a jealous rage, she said: \"No, I don't think he had a girlfriend.\n\n\"No, I have never been to his house or attacked any girlfriend or anything like that.\"\n\nWhen quizzed on the scenes showing Martha sitting for hours at a bus stop and whether she ever did that, she replied: \"No, I don't know, I don't know where he lived. No. Absolutely no...\n\n\"This is a fictional character. Hyperbole, exaggeration. This is a fiction. It's based on his imagination.\"\n\nHarvey also denied ever contacting his parents.\n\nAfter watching a clip of the series, showing Martha pleading guilty to intimidating Richard's character Donny and being sentenced to nine months prison time, Piers asked if she had ever been to prison or been charged, she replied \"no\" to both questions.\n\n\"That's completely false. And I don't think the actress sounds like me.\n\n\"I think the actress is from Glasgow, I think, but I'm not sure... I'm from the Central belt [of Scotland],\" she continued.\n\nA Netflix executive had claimed producers took every precaution to protect any real life inspirations for characters on the series.\n\nSpeaking in parliament, policy chief Benjamin King said that Netflix and Clerkenwell Films - who made the show - took \"every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story\".\n\nMr King said Netflix needed to balance protecting identities with upholding the \"veracity and authenticity\" of the show.\n\n\"We didn't want to anonymise that or make it generic to the point where it was no longer his story because that would undermine the intent behind the show,\" the senior public policy director said.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's obviously very difficult to control what viewers do, particularly in a world where everything is amplified by social media.\n\n\"I personally wouldn't be comfortable with a world in which we decided it was better that Richard was silenced and not allowed to tell the story.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harry_goodwin@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Harry Goodwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ryan_merrifield@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Ryan Merrifield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Outing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberbullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/22dcb42d-06ce-466a-9eca-cff72ba3fc6f.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

He's also been accused of propositioning trans actresses who he was lining up for work.\n\nBut if Richard Gadd feels entitled to make millions airing his side of the story, and make very serious allegations about Fiona Harvey in the process, then she is surely entitled to respond and defend herself?\n\nAs for who is exploiting whom, I'll leave that to the court of public opinion to decide.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "piers_morgan@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Piers Morgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_streamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online streamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerkenwell_Films", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clerkenwell Films"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nanotechnology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duty of care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crop-24027129.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Get a life, get a proper job. I am horrified at what you've done.\"\n\nShe also said she has not watched the show, but added, \"I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nBased on events from Gadd's life, the show (now streaming, with nearly 60 million viewers tuning in for its first month) follows Donny (Gadd), a struggling comedian who meets Martha (Jessica Gunning) while he's working as a bartender. When he shows her a moment of kindness, that backfires, and she turns into an obsessed stalker -- doing acts such as sending him over 41,000 emails.\n\nOn whether she was in love with Gadd, she replied: \"I gave him the brush off.\"\n\n\"I said no I'm sorry, I'm not interested. He asked me to sleep with him,\" she claimed. \"And I said, 'I've got a boyfriend'. I gave him the brush off big time, I think, you know, subtly so. But the bottom line is.. No, I don't fancy little boys without jobs. That sounds awful. That sounds really, really callous. But, you know.\"\n\nHarvey added that she's recently been in a five-year relationship with a lawyer.\n\n\"I don't want to drag him in. He thinks this is horrendous. All of my lawyer friends do. All of my professional friends do. Other people do. People are being really sympathetic,\" she continued to Morgan. \"People I don't know are saying things like, 'Are you getting hounded in the street?' You know, people are being really, really nice, anyone who does know about this.\"\n\nGadd, meanwhile, has told Variety that the show is \"all emotionally 100% true\" and \"borrowed\" from instances that happened to him and other people that he knows. But, he added, the show is not a direct translation of what happened in his real life stalker situation.\n\n\"You can't do the exact truth, for both legal and artistic reasons...\"\n\nHarvey told Morgan that the show's depiction of events is, \"Completely untrue. Very, very defamatory to me, very career damaging. And I wanted to rebut that completely on this show. I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions, interdicts. This is just complete nonsense.\"\n\nShe also said that no one from Netflix contacted her.\n\nGadd never named Harvey or confirmed that she is the real Martha, but he described his unnamed stalker as \"quite an idiosyncratic person\" in an interview with GQ.\n\n\"We've gone to such great lengths to disguise her to the point that I don't think she would recognize herself,\" he said. \"What's been borrowed is an emotional truth, not a fact-by-fact profile of someone.\"\n\nNevertheless, Harvey further said about Gadd, \"I think he's psychotic.

Very, very defamatory to me, very career-damaging. And I wanted to rebut that completely on this show. I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions. And this is just complete nonsense.\"\n\nSpeaking during a compelling \"Uncensored\" special Fiona Harvey sets the record straight after being unmasked by fans of the hit Netflix show -- which tells the story of writer/comedian Richard Gadd and his stalker, Martha. At the start of each episode it states \"This is a True Story.\"\n\nBut Fiona adds: \"We've had no apologies from Netflix or him, nothing. I mean, for someone who says he feels sorry for me, I've had no apology. My character seems to have smashed up a bar, sexually assaulted him in a canal, been to prison. There are a number of other allegations, and... That's not true.\"\n\nThe 58-year-old said Gadd, who also stars in the drama series, was \"making money out of untrue facts.\" And has vowed to sue the show's makers after being thrust into the spotlight and suffering online abuse.\n\nDuring the interview, she denied ever being at his home, contacting his parents or sending thousands of texts and emails messages. During the much-anticipated hour-long show, she also admits owning four mobile phones and a string of different email addresses. The law graduate also claims to be in a five-year relationship with a lawyer.\n\nFor the full interview go to https://www.youtube.com/PiersMorganUncensored.\n\nOn being \"outed\" within hours as the \"real-life Martha\" online, she said: \"On the internet, sleuths tracked me down and hounded me and gave me death threats. So it wasn't really a choice. I was forced into this situation.\"\n\nAsked if she had watched the drama, she replied: \"Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff... I haven't watched any of it.\"\n\n\"You're not curious, too?\" Piers added.\n\n\"No, I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nSaying that she had only met Gadd two or three times, she said she first heard about the Netflix show two weeks ago. She said the interest in her was: \"Absolutely horrendous. Absolutely horrendous. I couldn't believe he'd done that. And so long after the first meeting, you know, we're talking 10, 12 years ago, Really horrendous.\"\n\nFiona added: \"I just generally think he's got extreme psychiatric problems... It's a work of fiction. It's a work of hyperbole, as I've always said. And there are two true facts in that. His name is Richard Gadd, and he works as a jobbing barman on benefits, in the Hawley Arms. And we met, two or three times...\"\n\nPiers asked if it was true Gadd had offered her a free cup of tea after she walked into the pub where he was working, she replied: \"No, that's not correct. He didn't offer me a cup of tea... I was in for a meal with, a drink of lemonade, and I was very, very hungry. I'm diabetic, so, very hungry. So that's true.\"\n\nPiers: \"And did you talk to him?\"\n\nFiona: \"And he interrupted a conversation... he said, 'Oh, you're Scottish', and basically commandeered the conversation. You know, I was talking to somebody. It's pretty rich. Interrupt. So he seemed to be obsessed with me from that moment onwards.\"\n\nOn whether she said he looked like a 'baby reindeer' toy she had as a child, she added: \"I had a toy reindeer and he'd shaved his head, that bit is true, and there were reindeers in the shops because it was Christmas time or something. It was a joke. So I have inadvertently penned the name of the show.\"\n\nShe also confirmed she banter in the pub had been common, like talking about hanging curtains. \"This was a Hawley Arms joke about about curtains and a lot of sexual innuendo,\" she said.\n\nFiona denied Gadd had ever been caught peeping in her window, adding: \"False... I didn't see him at my house. I think it would be impossible to look through a window... That categorically didn't happen.\"\n\nPressed on the 41,000 emails, 350 hours of voice messages, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages, and 106 letters she is alleged to have sent him, she retorted: \"That's simply not true. If somebody was sending somebody 41,000 emails or something, they'd be doing how many a day? Lots.\"\n\nFiona: \"Now, none of that's true. I don't think I sent him anything... No, I think there may have been a couple of emails exchanging, but that was it. Just jokey banter emails.\"\n\nFiona: \"I may have done years and years ago... No, it wasn't numerous. It's about 18 tweets.\"\n\nOn the subject of the emails, she also went on to say: \"There are not 41,000 emails. That's over a year.\n\nShe went on to admit she had sent him one letter. Pressed on who had sent him all the correspondence, she said: \"I have no idea. I think he's probably made it up himself,\" she said.\"\n\nShe added she would be happy for someone to look at her computer.\n\nOn whether she ever heckled Gadd at a comedy show, she said: \"I think I went to one. It was a long, long time.\"\n\nOn whether she ever attacked one of the comedian's girlfriends during a jealous rage, she said: \"No, I don't think he had a girlfriend. I think he's, say, homosexual. But no, I have never been to his house or attacked any girlfriend or anything like that.\"\n\nAsked about the scenes showing Martha sitting for hours at a bus stop and whether she ever did that, she replied: \"No, I don't know, I don't know where he lived. No. Absolutely no... This is a fictional character. Hyperbole, exaggeration. This is a fiction. It's based on his imagination.\"\n\nFiona also denied ever contacting his parents.\n\nAfter watching a clip of the series, showing Martha pleading guilty to intimidating Richard's character Donny and being sentenced to nine months prison time, Piers asked if she had ever been to prison or been charged, she replied \"no\" to both questions.\n\n\"That's completely false. And I don't think the actress sounds like me. I mean, people compare me to Lorraine Kelly, but I look nothing like Lorraine Kelly. We all happen to have dark hair and we're Scottish, you know. I think the actress is from Glasgow, I think, but I'm not sure... I'm from the Central belt [of Scotland].,\" she continued.\n\nAsked again if the nine month prison sentence in the drama is based on reality, she said: \"That's completely untrue. Very, very defamatory to me, very career damaging. And I wanted to rebut that completely on this show. I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions, interdicts. This is just complete nonsense.\"\n\nOn whether Netflix had ever contacted her, she said: \"No. No one's contacted me. Never.\"\n\nWatching another clip of Gadd speaking recently on \"Lorraine,\" she added he was \"milking it for all it's worth.\"\n\nAsked what she feels now about the comedian, she said: \"I think he's psychotic. And I think that anyone going along, being in that play and doing this to somebody, I find that I find the behaviour outrageous.\"\n\nOn whether she believes the comedian \"felt sorry for her\", she replied: \"No, I never got that impression at all. I got the impression that he was all out for himself. Wanted to, sort of control that bar. Very, very inarticulate, very full of himself. I should never have gone in that bar.\"\n\nPiers added: \"Richard Gadd said he didn't see you as a villain, but as somebody who is unwell and needs help.\"\n\nFiona responded: \"Yeah, well, he maybe he should look a bit closer to home, to himself as someone who needs help... Yes, I think he always was. Whether there was an alleged rape or whether that rape was real or conceived in his mind, I think that would make him more unwell...\"\n\nShe added: \"I mean, for someone who says he feels sorry for me, I've had no apology. And I have this Martha character seems to have smashed up a bar, sexually assaulted him in a canal, been to prison. There are a number of other allegations, and... That's not true.\"\n\nLater she explained she had supported him online, urging people to watch his earlier comedy show, saying: \"We were trying to encourage him... I didn't think he was a complete psychopath who was going to attack me in this way.\"\n\nOn her childhood, she said she had a \"standard Scottish\" upbringing in the \"Scottish countryside\" and has a sister and her mother is still alive. Her parents divorced when she was nine and she hasn't spoken to her mum about the drama. \"That may seem strange, but I don't want to worry her,\" she added.\n\nAsked about previous \"inappropriate behaviour\" when working for a legal firm in Scotland, she said she had been head-hunted due to her employment law credentials. She said no order or hearing was made against her in the aftermath.\n\nSpeaking about her love-life, she said she was in a five-year relationship with a lawyer. She said: \"I don't want to drag him in. He thinks this is horrendous. All of my lawyer friends do. All of my professional friends do. Other people do. People are being really sympathetic. People I don't know are saying things like, 'Are you getting hounded in the street?' You know, people are being really, really nice, anyone who does know about this.\"\n\nPushed again on whether she had left voicemails or sent strings of messages, she said the only explanation for the voice messages must be that she had been taped in the pub while speaking.\n\nFiona: \"Yeah, I doubt it. I mean. Unless he was taping me... He could have been taping me in the Hawley Arms though. I've not contacted him.\"\n\nPiers: \"But if he's got 350 voicemails.. these are on his phone\"\n\nFiona: \"It doesn't matter whether they're on a phone, tablet, whatever they're on, I've not contacted him\n\nPiers: \"But I'm curious. Why would there even be a possibility of him having that number of voice messages from you?\"\n\nFiona: \"Because he's crazy and wants to make this up. I mean, I've not phoned the guy. I don't have his number.\n\n\"The only explanation for having a voicemail from me would be [from] taping me in the Hawley Arms. That's the only place we've ever met.\"\n\nShe went on: \"Yeah. I mean, my point is, though, even if that were true, I didn't lunge at him across the bar. I didn't a sexual assault him in a canal. I didn't go to jail.\"\n\nFiona: \"They are lying. Yes. Okay. Yeah. In effect, he is lying and they are lying. And in order for a dramatisation to be true, it's got to be. You know, the only defence is are Veritas. I'm telling the truth. Or, the whole drama needs to be true. They have billed it as a 'true story'. So has he. And it's not. It's blatantly not. Even if the email thing was true, the rest is not.\"\n\nOn what message she had for Richard Gadd if he was watching, she said: \"Leave me alone, please. Get a life, get a proper job. I am horrified at what you've done. \"\n\nOn whether she would be taking legal action following the series, she replied: \"Absolutely. Against both him and Netflix.\n\nAdmitting she wrote him one letter. Fiona said: \"Yeah. I'm sorry I haven't sent that guy 106 letters.\"\n\nOn whether she still had the same email address, she replied: \"I had six at one point.\n\nPiers: \"Why?\"\n\nFiona: \"Because I like to keep people on different phones and different emails.\"\n\nPiers: \"Six different names.\"\n\nFiona: \"Maybe four. I think it's 4 to 6. Yeah, it's just easier, it's easier. So you have some for your utilities, some for close friends, whatever. Yeah.\"\n\nFiona: \"You don't know many people then, and I know, I know people with four or six email addresses.\"\n\nShe revealed she also has four different phones, explaining: \"Yeah. Two broke. They were very, very old. One was brand new and broke. And it's still to be returned to the shop. I like keeping people on separate phones as well. And maybe that makes me a maniac or a stalker or something. But if you've got somebody on about your electricity bill or somebody on about some work or something, it's nice to keep it separate, you know? So, I didn't do that in Scotland. Didn't have to. But the volume of calls down here.\"\n\nGrilled on whether the writer was ever her friend, she said: \"No. No. Staff asked me that as well. No, I don't think so\", adding the pair had shared \"Scottish banter\" in the pub.\n\nOn whether she was ever in love with him, she responded: \"Piers. Is that a serious question? No... I gave him the brush off. He asked me to sleep, with him with a big green spot in his face one day. I said no I'm sorry, I'm not interested. He asked me to sleep with him. He said, 'would I like my curtains fixed'? And I laughed and he said, that's a euphemism. You want me to come home with you? And I said, 'I've got a boyfriend'. I gave him the brush off big time, I think, you know, subtly so. But the bottom line is.. No, I don't fancy little boys without jobs. That sounds awful. That sounds really, really callous. But, you know.\"\n\nFiona then asks Piers how much she thinks Gadd has made out of the hit Netflix show, he says it could be \"several millions\". \"I think he's done bloody well out of defaming me... He's making money out of untrue facts. He's been the ultimate misogynist.\"\n\nWith reports of a potential second series, Fiona added she might write her own book. Claiming to have a law degree and a photographic memory, she also said she would think about taking a lie-detector test to prove her words.\n\nTo watch the full interview, go to the Piers Morgan Uncensored channel on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/PiersMorganUncensored.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lorraine Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Psychosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voicemail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voicemail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbole", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyperbole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberbullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/newspress-collage-qtbkjey2v-1715278909537.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1715264531&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

A psychologist explains why true crime turns us into armchair detectives.", "body": "By clicking \"Sign Up\", you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You can opt-out at any time.\n\nNetflix's \"Baby Reindeer\" gripped audiences with the story of Donny Dunn, an aspiring comedian who is stalked by a woman after he shows her a moment of kindness in the pub where he works.\n\nThe series, which is based on the real-life experiences of its writer and lead actor, Richard Gadd, was met with rave reviews for its honest depiction of stalking and abuse, earning a 98% score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nIt's ironic, then, that viewers responded to a show about the psychological trauma of stalking by becoming armchair detectives as they tried to find both his real-life stalker and abuser, whose identities the show's makers said they tried to conceal.\n\nAccording to Google Trends, among the top searches related to \"Baby Reindeer\" since the show was released in April were \"Baby Reindeer real Martha\" and the name of the woman fans think the stalker character is based on, as well as the identity of the man who abused Gadd.\n\nThe fervor with which viewers were trying to hunt the pair down led a woman, who claimed to be the real Martha Scott, to consider legal action against Netflix and Gadd. The unnamed woman told the Daily Mail last month that she has received \"death threats and abuse from Richard Gadd supporters.\"\n\nShe said: \"I'm the victim. He's written a bloody show about me.\"\n\nSince then, broadcaster Piers Morgan has interviewed a woman named Fiona Harvey -- who appears to be the same person the Daily Mail spoke to -- promising to \"set the record straight.\" The interview will air on Thursday.\n\nTikTok sleuths also harassed Sean Foley, a British writer, comedian, and actor whom Gadd had worked with in the past, accusing him of being the star's abuser. Foley was forced to go to the police, and Gadd defended him, asking people not to speculate about the real identities of the people in the show.\n\nThis isn't the first time the public has reacted to true crime series and even ongoing police investigations in this way.\n\nIn January 2023, for example, social media was rife with speculation after British woman Nicola Bulley went missing in suspicious circumstances, with some even trespassing on private property as they tried to investigate her disappearance.\n\nThe Mirror reported Lancashire's Police and Crime Commissioner Andrew Snowden said the force \"lost control of the narrative\" because of conspiracy theorists. The authorities even issued dispersal notices to members of the public trying to stage their own investigations in February 2023.\n\nDr. Ruth Tully, a UK-based forensic psychologist who specializes in assessing and treating sexual and violent offenders, told Business Insider that true crime blurs the line between entertainment and real life, with audiences consuming the content in the same way they'd watch a soap opera or a drama.\n\nThat's further complicated by some true crime audiences thinking they are helping to bring about justice by becoming armchair detectives.\n\nTully said: \"It can be extremely harmful, and I think it's easy to forget that because we are understandably engaged and wrapped up in what is an interesting storyline, an interesting case, and I think it's driven from a good place. People don't like injustice, and it's good to act on injustice in many circumstances.\"\n\nGorging on true crime can also be a way for some audiences, particularly women, to learn how to stay safe, according to Tulley.\n\n\"The theory is that through understanding perpetrator's behaviors and also victim behaviors, there's a principle that we might be better able to keep ourselves safe because we feel that we understand criminal behavior better. So that's one principle,\" she said.\n\nIn a piece published by The Guardian, titled \"Why do women love true crime so much?\" journalist Nancy Jo Sales suggested: \"Women who date in the digital age have become online detectives to keep true crimes from happening to them.\"\n\nFor those with less honorable motives, Tully said that the separation between real life and social media makes the transition to armchair detective and harasser easier, especially when people can easily make fake accounts.\n\n\"What we do tend to find is with social media, people do feel like there's an element of anonymity because they might not have the true profile up, for example. So they feel that there'll be no consequences, and this might not be an active consideration at the time,\" she said.\n\n\"This isn't in-the-moment thinking. They don't necessarily think these things through like, 'Oh wow, they're not going to catch me' because it feels safer to them,\" she added.\n\nAccording to a 2023 study published in the European Journal of Criminal Policy and Research on anonymous online harassment faced by influencers, harassers find strength in numbers. Numerous people harassing an individual \"can lead to a diffusion of responsibility and moral disengagement among the harassers,\" its authors wrote.\n\nThis raises the question of whether streaming services and TV networks are doing enough to protect those involved in true crime content. How they would do this remains unclear.\n\nIn the case of \"Baby Reindeer,\" Gadd said the team changed the characters enough to protect their real-life counterparts, but viewers were still able to find social media posts from a woman who fitted Martha's description.\n\nIt's unclear what steps Netflix took to protect the identity of those depicted in the show, including whether they contacted the stalker.\n\nAt a UK parliamentary hearing on Wednesday about British film and TV, Netflix policy chief Benjamin King said that the streamer took \"every reasonable precaution\" to disguise the identities of the real people involved.\n\nHowever, he did not take responsibility for the harassment that took place after subscribers watched the show.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's obviously very difficult to control what viewers do, particularly in a world where everything is amplified by social media,\" King said.\n\nNetflix previously came under fire for depicting the family of Errol Lindsay, one of Jeffrey Dahmer's victims, in the 2023 series \"Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.\" Lindsay's sister, Rita Isbell, criticized Netflix in an essay for Business Insider for not consulting with her or her family.\n\n\"I was never contacted about the show. I feel like Netflix should've asked if we mind or how we felt about making it. They didn't ask me anything. They just did it,\" she wrote at the time.\n\nBut regardless of how Netflix handles working with the real people involved in its true crime content, the responsibility to not harass people online over lies with the audience themselves, Tully said.\n\n\"It's a common sense decision that to track someone down and hound them might be harmful,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eammon_jacobs@businessinsider.com", "name": "Eammon Jacobs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Trends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google Trends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terms of service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotten Tomatoes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_Police_and_Crime_Commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire Police and Crime Commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forensic psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward Snowden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Dahmer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/663cd395b4abc992e8c738f2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

The scene takes place at Darrien's flat, where Donny has been lured in for a drug-taking session under the pretence of working together, which would have been a major step in his comedy career.\n\nThe harrowing scene takes place in the fourth episode and sees Donny being repeatedly abused by the comic writer.\n\nRichard revealed that this scene caused members of the production team to cry as they watched the upsetting and graphic ordeal play out.\n\n'We did close the set,' the actor began, meaning only a limited crew who were necessary were present.\n\n'But I was looking over and you'd see the props guys wiping tears from their eyes as they would be putting the props back how they should be.'\n\nSpeaking at the DGA Theater Complex for Netflix's FYC screening and panel for the series, Richard added that the performance was 'weighty' and was proud to be working with such a sensitive team.\n\n'The show was based in such a trauma that everyone on set felt at times it was a huge, weighty thing.\n\n'And it's why I think everyone had such respect for everything. I was blessed with this amazing team who kind of felt it with me in a lot of ways,' he said, via The Independent.\n\nWhen talking about the truth in the series he said that he would check in with himself regularly and make sure it felt honest.\n\n'I never wanted to kind of lie, I always had to constantly check myself to be like, \"Does this feel truthful to me to my experience all the way through?\" And if it didn't, I would have to bring it back.'\n\nJessica Gunning, who plays Martha in the series also spoke about the honest portrayal of events in the series, adding that the 'messy ending' was reflective of real life.\n\n'It's not an easy, buttoned-up story,' the actress said at the panel. 'Everything doesn't get tied up at the end. I think it's messy, like life is.'\n\n'Their dynamic is complicated and he's really honest about that. That's so refreshing to see. The response to it is shown that audiences are really hungry for that. Hungry for honest, messy storytelling.'\n\nSince the release of the series, internet sleuths have tried to track down the real Martha and Darrien from the series.\n\nRichard warned fans: 'People I love, have worked with, and admire (including Sean Foley) are unfairly getting caught up in speculation.\n\n'Please don't speculate on who the real-life people could be. That's not the point of our show,' he said on social media.\n\nDespite the comic's pleas, a police investigation has now been launched after a comedy writer was wrongly accused of being the abuser in the series.\n\nFollowing speculation about the real people who inspired the character in the series, Piers Morgan is set to interview the 'Real Martha', a woman named Fiona Harvey.\n\nAhead of the release of the pre-recorded interview, Fiona has said she was 'used' by Piers Morgan.\n\nFiona claimed she was paid only \u00a3250 for the interview, which is set to be released on Thursday night.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Is Bodkin a real place?

It's a work of hyperbole, as I've always said.\n\n\"And and there are two true facts in that. His name is Richard Gad, and he worked as a jobbing barman on benefits, in the Holy Arms.\n\n\"And we met two, three times.\"\n\nHarvey claims to be setting the record straight after being unmasked by fans of the hit Netflix show.\n\nAt the start of each episode it states 'This is a True Story'.\n\nHarvey said Gadd, who also stars in the drama series, was \"making money out of untrue facts\".\n\nDuring the interview, she denied ever being at his home, contacting his parents or sending thousands of texts and email messages.\n\nOn being 'outed' within hours as the 'real-life Martha' online, she said: \"On the internet, sleuths tracked me down and hounded me and gave me death threats. So it wasn't really a choice. I was forced into this situation.\"\n\nAsked if she had watched the drama, she replied: \"Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff... I haven't watched any of it.\"\n\n\"You're not curious to?\" Morgan added.\n\n\"No, I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic.\n\n\"Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up.\n\n\"You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.\"\n\nSaying that she had only met Gadd two or three times, she said she first heard about the Netflix show two weeks ago.\n\nShe said the interest in her was: \"Absolutely horrendous. Absolutely horrendous. I couldn't believe he'd done that. And so long after the first meeting, you know, we're talking 10, 12 years ago. Really horrendous.\"\n\nHarvey added: \"I just generally think he's got extreme psychiatric problems... It's a work of fiction.\n\n\"It's a work of hyperbole, as I've always said. And there are two true facts in that. His name is Richard Gadd, and he works as a jobbing barman on benefits, in the Hawley Arms. And we met, two or three times...\"\n\nMorgan asked if it was true Gadd had offered her a free cup of tea after she walked into the pub where he was working, she replied: \"No, that's not correct. He didn't offer me a cup of tea...\n\n\"I was in for a meal with, a drink of lemonade, and I was very, very hungry. I'm diabetic, so, very hungry. So that's true.\"\n\nMorgan said: \"And did you talk to him?\"\n\nHarvey said: \"And he interrupted a conversation... he said, 'Oh, you're Scottish', and basically commandeered the conversation. You know, I was talking to somebody. It's pretty rich. Interrupt. So he seemed to be obsessed with me from that moment onwards.\"\n\nOn whether she said he looked like a 'baby reindeer' toy she had as a child, she added: \"I had a toy reindeer and he'd shaved his head, that bit is true, and there were reindeer in the shops because it was Christmas time or something. It was a joke. So I have inadvertently penned the name of the show.\"\n\nShe also confirmed banter in the pub had been common, like talking about hanging curtains. \"This was a Hawley Arms joke about curtains and a lot of sexual innuendo,\" she said.\n\nHarvey denied Gadd had ever been caught peeping in her window, adding: \"False... I didn't see him at my house. I think it would be impossible to look through a window... That categorically didn't happen.\"\n\nPressed on the 41,000 emails, 350 hours of voice messages, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages, and 106 letters she is alleged to have sent him, she retorted: \"That's simply not true. If somebody was sending somebody 41,000 emails or something, they'd be doing how many a day? Lots.\"\n\nMorgan replied: \"Well, it'd be obsessive.\" Harvey responded: \"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. No. It's...\"\n\nShe went on to say they had a couple of email exchanges, resulting in about 10 emails sent by her.\n\nShe said it was \"jokey banter\", but she never sent Facebook or text messages - though then admitted she did send around 18 tweets.\n\nA Netflix executive had claimed producers took every precaution to protect any real life inspirations for characters on the series.\n\nSpeaking in parliament, policy chief Benjamin King said that Netflix and Clerkenwell Films - who made the show - took \"every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story\".\n\nMr King said Netflix needed to balance protecting identities with upholding the \"veracity and authenticity\" of the show.\n\n\"We didn't want to anonymise that or make it generic to the point where it was no longer his story because that would undermine the intent behind the show,\" the senior public policy director said.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's obviously very difficult to control what viewers do, particularly in a world where everything is amplified by social media.\n\n\"I personally wouldn't be comfortable with a world in which we decided it was better that Richard was silenced and not allowed to tell the story.\"", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_merrifield@the-sun.com", "name": "Ryan Merrifield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Outing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbole", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyperbole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/05/newspress-collage-y1jsx5qpw-1715279469858.jpg?1715267611&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

It's a crazy hit among the audience and fans seem to be not getting enough of it. There are all sorts of speculations around the show and fans have even tried to find the real-life Martha and other characters that were shown. If you are also one of the people who have been hit by the Baby Reindeer fever and want some more thematically similar shows to binge, here's a list for you. The shows mentioned here are not exactly similar to Baby Reindeer in every aspect, but the themes of trauma, abuse, and mental health issues are the primary themes of these shows as well.\n\nBeef, created by Sung Jin released in 2023 on Netflix. The show was well received, both by the audience and by the critics. It focuses on Amy (Ali Wong) and Danny (Steven Yeun), two strangers who get caught in a road rage incident that brings ultimate chaos to their lives. Amy and Danny are portrayed here as very different individuals having extremely different lives. Amy is successful and rich whereas Danny keeps struggling with his finances and his desire to build his parents a home and make them proud. However, when the road rage incident happens, the thin line of difference between them starts to blur and it becomes evident that maybe they are not so different after all. These two characters get obsessed with each other, planning and plotting their next moves to bring the other one down. They cannot let go, much like Martha and Donny in Baby Reindeer. The theme of stalking and obsession here has been dealt with in a completely different way than in Baby Reindeer but the loop of self-sabotaging tendencies and the irreparable effect of abuse on an individual remain very much the same.\n\nCreated by Raphael Bob-Waksberg, Bojack Horseman aired on Netflix from 2014-2020. Though the show is often referred to as a sitcom, it is anything but that. Sure, it does have its moments of humor, but that's generally dark and self-decrepitating. The show tells the story of Bojack Horseman, a half horse half human male character who used to be famous in the 90s but is now jobless and sits in his mansion basking in the glory of his bygone years. It sounds harmless and simple enough but as the show progresses, the audience understands that there is nothing simple in the show. All the characters, including Bojack (Will Arnett) and the main side characters are extremely complicated with their own lives continuously spiraling out of control. Be it Princess Caroline (Amy Sedaris) or Diane (Alison Brie) or Todd (Aaron Paul), each of them have their own history of abuse and trauma. And then comes the titular character, Bojack, whose whole life is a series of unfortunate events, which he brought upon himself. Like Donny in Baby Reindeer, Bojack here also cannot escape his past and continuously keeps falling into a pattern of substance abuse and self-sabotaging tendencies. Though not entirely focused on stalking, Bojack Horseman can be a good watch after Baby Reindeer because of the similarity of themes that the two shows deal with.\n\nAfter the release of Baby Reindeer, an X user mentioned that the show was like Fleabag but for the guys. Such an observation is not completely wrong. Created by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag follows the central character by the same name and how she constantly messes up her life simply because she doesn't know how to deal with the trauma that she has. Fleabag, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge herself, loses her best friend because of a mistake she makes and that sends her down a spiral, which seems difficult to escape. She has a boyfriend, but the relationship is not satisfying, and they constantly keep breaking and patching up. Fleabag is clearly in control of the relationship and her unresolved issues often make her an emotional abuser of her boyfriend. She sleeps around, not knowing what she wants to do with her life. Much like the central character of Baby Reindeer, Fleabag seems to be lost and stuck in a loop. The common themes of mental health and the inescapable cycle of trauma make Fleabag a worthy watch after Baby Reindeer.\n\nWritten and created by Michaela Coel, I May Destroy You can be a great watch after Baby Reindeer. The protagonist here, played by Michaela herself, is a writer who is struggling with a bad writer's block. To clear her mind and have some fun, she goes out with her friends one night in London. However, what she realizes later is that on that night she was drugged and sexually taken advantage of. This realization jeopardizes her life and makes it difficult for her to move forward. Michaela herself stated in Edinburgh International Television Festival that she is a sexual assault survivor much like Richard Gadd does in Baby Reindeer. The horrors of surviving a sexual assault and then getting back to everyday life have been brilliantly dealt with in the show and is bound to remind one of Baby Reindeer.\n\nThe final one on this list is an out-and-out stalker show though the writing quality of You doesn't match up to Baby Reindeer. Based on Caroline Kepnes' books, You follows Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley), a bookshop manager who has a tendency to get obsessed with beautiful women and ultimately murder them. Developed by Sera Gamble and Greg Berlanti, You deals with the theme of obsessed love head-on but minus the seriousness of Baby Reindeer. Despite some fundamental flaws in the writing, the show is quite enjoyable because of its themes of stalking, serial killing, and the over-the-top twists.\n\nThese shows, though not all of them are precisely similar to Baby Reindeer, can give you a good insight into the world of trauma, abuse, and mental health and how those themes are dealt with in popular culture.", "source": {"uri":

Martha is violently abusive to Teru, and also transphobic. Actress Nava Mau who plays Teri in Baby reindeer has now opened up about how she prepared for such a scene, considering how hard it must be for a trans woman to have to go through that even when acting.\n\nSpeaking at the LA Baby Reindeer screening that happened this week when the cast had a Q&A after, Nava Mau was asked how she prepared for the scene where Teri gets attacked by Martha. \"I got to create the emotional landscape of that scene here when working with an acting coach. And we really built that whole structure up that I was gonna get knocked over, so when I'm on the floor I can look at the pieces and I know what they all are.\n\n\"So it was the relationship with Donny, it was what Martha was actually saying. it was the public humiliation - which ties to the backstory of Teri's family that I had to keep in my mind. I did the emotional work in LA, so that when I went to London I got to do the technical work.\n\n\"We actually met for the first time, me and Jessica, when we did the stunt training. And it was so much fun. It was like 'nice to meet you, now she's straddling me!' That was the perfect way for us to meet because it allowed us to build trust, practice consent and just get really comfortable with each other so we could go as far as we needed to go.\n\n\"So we did. I've said this before, but I really remember so clearly in the makeup trailer after we finished and Jess came up to me and she said 'I'm sorry'. I think we need that.

Maybe he didn't realise Baby Reindeer, his limited series for Netflix inspired by his own stalking, would cause such a stir. That he could smudge the facts of his traumas just enough to protect the people involved. Perhaps he thought better of us. The success of Gadd's series has been startling; strong reviews and word-of-mouth praise have made it an international hit, and it remains at number one on the streamer's UK chart more than four weeks after its release. The last three of those weeks, though, have seen the show careen into its inevitable second act. The armchair detectives have arrived.\n\nThe seven-episode series concluded with a nine-month prison sentence and a restraining order for Gadd's stalker, his aspiring stand-up Donny looking on as Martha (Jessica Gunning), the woman who'd terrorised him and his loved ones for four years, was led away in handcuffs, her face wan with guilt. Whether this actually happened has been kept deliberately vague.\n\nGadd has always declined to speak of the real Martha's present-day whereabouts, and how her harassment campaign came to an end. While doing press for Baby Reindeer - as well as his earlier one-man show at the Edinburgh Fringe about his experiences - he has only ever said that the stalking ended.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gunning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Gunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restraining order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stand-up comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh Festival Fringe"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/23/14/baby%20reindeer%203.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Over its seven episodes, the show delves into themes of stalking and sexual assault.\n\nJessica looked stunning in a floor-length turquoise blue dress with elbow-length sleeves, her brown hair cascading over her shoulders.\n\nRichard was dapper in a grey fitted suit paired with a crisp white shirt underneath. He completed his look with a neat short haircut and black dress shoes.\n\nNava turned heads in a striking red leather ensemble consisting of an ankle-length skirt and a button-up long-sleeve jacket. A matching tie and purse perfectly finished off her look.\n\nMeanwhile, the woman who claims to be the inspiration behind the \"real life Martha\" appeared on a Piers Morgan special of Uncensored on Thursday 9 May. She's been stirring up quite the buzz on social media, insisting that the character in the show is modelled after her life.\n\nTaking to Facebook, she's been airing her views on the series and has even dropped hints about penning her own book.\n\nAt the end of the interview with Piers, he asked her if she wanted to issue a message to Richard, who created Baby Reindeer.\n\nShe spoke directly to the camera and said: \"Leave me alone, please. Get a life, get a proper job. I am horrified at what you've done.\"\n\nThe woman also shared that she hasn't tuned into the Netflix series.

Fantastic ass.\"\n\n\"It was a joke,\" Ms Harvey fired back.\n\nMore to come...\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West Australian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Now (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-14613634/ca2785cce41b98daa541d136e7d99eba2bc43708-16x9-x1y0w2446h1376.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 452988327, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 191, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 191}}}

Given that it was based on the real-life experiences of creator Richard Gadd, it seemed inevitable that amateur internet sleuths would soon be trying to find the woman who inspired the depiction of his fictional stalker.\n\nAnd if they found her, surely she would relish the attention that being a central character in a major \u00adinternational TV show would bring? Oh no, we were told, that's not going to happen, we've taken steps to protect her anonymity. But tonight, a woman who claims to be the basis for Martha gave her side of the story to Piers Morgan's YouTube series, Uncensored.\n\nShe told him that almost everything about the series, which starts with the words \"this is a true story\", was a lie. Branding Richard as \"psychotic\" and the \"ultimate misogynist\", she insisted that virtually every aspect of the series he'd written was \"completely untrue\" - including that she'd been to prison for stalking.\n\nNow viewers will have to decide what they believe. The woman flatly denies sending thousands of texts and email messages, and claimed the drama had been: \"Very, very defamatory to me, very career-damaging.\" Claiming she'd received death threats from viewers as far away as the US, she insisted: \"I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions. This is complete nonsense.\"\n\nViewers took to social media to try to find the 'real-life' Martha Scott after watching the show\n\nAnd the self-proclaimed real-life Martha - who the Mirror has chosen not to name - said she was \"forced\" to reveal her identity in order to defend herself. \"On the internet, sleuths tracked me down and hounded me and gave me death threats,\" she said. \"So it wasn't really a choice. I was forced into this situation.\"\n\nThe news that she was going to give the TV interview sparked a huge \u00adreaction from the many millions of UK viewers who've watched the chart-topping seven-part series. Some thought it was only fair that she got the chance to do so, while others found the whole idea \u00ad\"exploitative\" and argued that someone who has grappled with serious mental health issues should not be given that sort of platform.\n\nNetflix has said that the emails and messages which appear on-screen in the show were the actual ones sent to Richard by his stalker over a period of four years - 41,071 emails, 744 tweets, 46 Facebook messages, letters running to 106 pages and 350 hours of phone messages.\n\nBut speaking to Piers, the woman insisted she'd only sent him \"a couple of emails\" containing \"banter\". Pressed on who might be behind all the other messages, she said: \"I have no idea.\" She then claimed Richard had made them up and that she'd turned down his sexual advances. The self-proclaimed \"Martha\" did admit to owning four mobile phones and having up to six email addresses, which Piers pointed out was extremely odd.\n\nAsked if she planned to take legal action, she replied: \"Absolutely. Against both him and Netflix.\" But with no money to back her legal plans, she intends to represent herself. Richard, 34, portrays Martha as clever, having described her as being a woman whose \"only skill greater than her ability to harass was her ability to evade the law\".\n\nNetflix is now coming under fire after the woman's claim to have been identified as Martha. Richard himself plays Donny, a version of himself, while The Outlaws star Jessica Gunning portrays his stalker and Tom Goodman-Hill takes the role of Derrien, a TV executive who groomed and then raped him.\n\nSo did Netflix and the producers made enough effort to try and protect the anonymity of the woman who inspired Martha, given that the story revolves around her and that she had no input into the series? At the show's media launch in April, executives felt sure that the woman who harassed Richard for many years was unlikely to come out of the woodwork.\n\nShe didn't make an \u00adappearance after he turned his stalking and sexual assault horror into an award-winning Edinburgh play, they reasoned, so we don't think that she will give us any trouble now. It seems that they simply did not foresee this scenario. One executive producer from Clerkenwell Films revealed there was an exclusion order in place which prevented Richard's harasser from making contact with him - meaning she would be arrested if she turned up at the launch in London's Soho.\n\nThe show was written by and starred Richard Gadd\n\nAnd she insisted there was no chance of viewers rumbling fictional Martha Scott's real identity because they had been at pains to digitally airbrush her out of existence. Asked how much the stalker knew about the series ahead of it dropping on Netflix last month, the TV exec said it was unclear. \"We don't know because we're not allowed contact,\" she explained. \"And if you Google anything on here, it won't come up with her on the internet with her real name and what really happened. Everything is disguised.\n\n\"We've made sure and Netflix's legal team has made sure. Anything that could lead back to her has gone.\" She said any decision for the stalker to unveil her own identity and put herself forward for interviews was \"out of our control\". \"Obviously, we were really aware when we took on this story that there were implications in that respect,\" she explained. \"We're making a show with real people involved, so we've taken an extreme amount of care that they couldn't be identified and we've taken an extreme amount of care that they are presented with understanding.\"\n\nIn the series, Martha is indeed portrayed sympathetically at times, with Richard taking responsibility for mistakes he made. The Baby Reindeer producer added: \"What we tried really hard to do was make sure that Martha was portrayed in a way where she's not the baddie and Richard's not the goodie.\"\n\nBut despite the measures taken, and a plea from Richard himself, one woman says she has been unmasked and is considering legal action. As for the predatory male TV executive, one innocent man has already had to be defended by Richard, who urged: \"Please don't speculate on who the real-life people could be. That's not the point of our show.\" It may not have been, but it does seem like an inevitable consequence.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and

Given that it was based on the real-life experiences of creator Richard Gadd, it seemed inevitable that amateur internet sleuths would soon be trying to find the woman who inspired the depiction of his fictional stalker.\n\nAnd if they found her, surely she would relish the attention that being a central character in a major \u00adinternational TV show would bring? Oh no, we were told, that's not going to happen, we've taken steps to protect her anonymity. But tonight, a woman who claims to be the basis for Martha gave her side of the story to Piers Morgan's YouTube series, Uncensored.\n\nShe told him that almost everything about the series, which starts with the words \"this is a true story\", was a lie. Branding Richard as \"psychotic\" and the \"ultimate misogynist\", she insisted that virtually every aspect of the series he'd written was \"completely untrue\" - including that she'd been to prison for stalking.\n\nNow viewers will have to decide what they believe. The woman flatly denies sending thousands of texts and email messages, and claimed the drama had been: \"Very, very defamatory to me, very career-damaging.\" Claiming she'd received death threats from viewers as far away as the US, she insisted: \"I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions. This is complete nonsense.\"\n\nViewers took to social media to try to find the 'real-life' Martha Scott after watching the show\n\nAnd the self-proclaimed real-life Martha - who the Mirror has chosen not to name - said she was \"forced\" to reveal her identity in order to defend herself. \"On the internet, sleuths tracked me down and hounded me and gave me death threats,\" she said. \"So it wasn't really a choice. I was forced into this situation.\"\n\nThe news that she was going to give the TV interview sparked a huge \u00adreaction from the many millions of UK viewers who've watched the chart-topping seven-part series. Some thought it was only fair that she got the chance to do so, while others found the whole idea \u00ad\"exploitative\" and argued that someone who has grappled with serious mental health issues should not be given that sort of platform.\n\nNetflix has said that the emails and messages which appear on-screen in the show were the actual ones sent to Richard by his stalker over a period of four years - 41,071 emails, 744 tweets, 46 Facebook messages, letters running to 106 pages and 350 hours of phone messages.\n\nBut speaking to Piers, the woman insisted she'd only sent him \"a couple of emails\" containing \"banter\". Pressed on who might be behind all the other messages, she said: \"I have no idea.\" She then claimed Richard had made them up and that she'd turned down his sexual advances. The self-proclaimed \"Martha\" did admit to owning four mobile phones and having up to six email addresses, which Piers pointed out was extremely odd.\n\nAsked if she planned to take legal action, she replied: \"Absolutely. Against both him and Netflix.\" But with no money to back her legal plans, she intends to represent herself. Richard, 34, portrays Martha as clever, having described her as being a woman whose \"only skill greater than her ability to harass was her ability to evade the law\".\n\nNetflix is now coming under fire after the woman's claim to have been identified as Martha. Richard himself plays Donny, a version of himself, while The Outlaws star Jessica Gunning portrays his stalker and Tom Goodman-Hill takes the role of Derrien, a TV executive who groomed and then raped him.\n\nSo did Netflix and the producers made enough effort to try and protect the anonymity of the woman who inspired Martha, given that the story revolves around her and that she had no input into the series? At the show's media launch in April, executives felt sure that the woman who harassed Richard for many years was unlikely to come out of the woodwork.\n\nShe didn't make an \u00adappearance after he turned his stalking and sexual assault horror into an award-winning Edinburgh play, they reasoned, so we don't think that she will give us any trouble now. It seems that they simply did not foresee this scenario. One executive producer from Clerkenwell Films revealed there was an exclusion order in place which prevented Richard's harasser from making contact with him - meaning she would be arrested if she turned up at the launch in London's Soho.\n\nThe show was written by and starred Richard Gadd\n\nAnd she insisted there was no chance of viewers rumbling fictional Martha Scott's real identity because they had been at pains to digitally airbrush her out of existence. Asked how much the stalker knew about the series ahead of it dropping on Netflix last month, the TV exec said it was unclear. \"We don't know because we're not allowed contact,\" she explained. \"And if you Google anything on here, it won't come up with her on the internet with her real name and what really happened. Everything is disguised.\n\n\"We've made sure and Netflix's legal team has made sure. Anything that could lead back to her has gone.\" She said any decision for the stalker to unveil her own identity and put herself forward for interviews was \"out of our control\". \"Obviously, we were really aware when we took on this story that there were implications in that respect,\" she explained. \"We're making a show with real people involved, so we've taken an extreme amount of care that they couldn't be identified and we've taken an extreme amount of care that they are presented with understanding.\"\n\nIn the series, Martha is indeed portrayed sympathetically at times, with Richard taking responsibility for mistakes he made. The Baby Reindeer producer added: \"What we tried really hard to do was make sure that Martha was portrayed in a way where she's not the baddie and Richard's not the goodie.\"\n\nBut despite the measures taken, and a plea from Richard himself, one woman says she has been unmasked and is considering legal action. As for the predatory male TV executive, one innocent man has already had to be defended by Richard, who urged: \"Please don't speculate on who the real-life people could be. That's not the point of our show.\" It may not have been, but it does seem like an inevitable consequence.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and

Piers Morgan's interview with the Scottish lawyer who has identified herself as the woman behind the stalker character in the series was none of those things.\n\nGoing out on Morgan's YouTube channel, the 60-minute conversation was less a sparring match between Morgan and Fiona Harvey than a dreary question-and-answer session. The host lacked his usually pugilistic chutzpah and had the washed out pallor of someone who'd been up all night bingeing Netflix.\n\nStill, he was keen to get to the bottom of the Baby Reindeer mystery. Its writer and star, Richard Gadd, has said the stalking incidents depicted in the show were inspired by true events. So was Fiona guilty of the compulsive behaviour engaged in by her onscreen lookalike Martha?\n\nShe shook her head firmly. Harvey, 58, described Baby Reindeer as \"taking over her life\" and made it clear that she did not hold Gadd in high regard.\n\nMorgan drilled into the details, and this was where the conversation became strictly for Baby Reindeer obsessives. Like Martha, Harvey was a lawyer from Scotland who had encountered Gadd in a pub in Camden in London. And yes, she had come up with the phrase \"Baby Reindeer\", as claimed by the series.\n\nBut she was emphatically not a stalker. Did she send Gadd 41,000 emails - as alleged in one episode? \"Absolutely not. I don't think I've sent him anything,\" she said. \"A couple of emails, jokey banter emails.\"\n\nThe host insisted that he wasn't trying to trip Harvey up or pin her to her collar. He said that the ease with which she had been tracked down by viewers who cross-referenced public tweets she had sent Gadd with the timeline in which the story takes place showed that Netflix had failed in its duty of care toward her. As an experienced journalist, he would have worked out her identity after 10 minutes.\n\nMorgan's YouTube set was a weird mix of US-style cable news bombast - all those glittering backgrounds, that big desk - and breakfast TV production values. To the right of Morgan's large head, viewers could write messages: they helpfully added comments such as \"OMG!\" and \"hurry up\".\n\nBut Morgan didn't hurry up. Instead, he politely but firmly grilled Harvey about her legal education in Scotland and the precise number of email accounts she operated - it used to be between \"four and six\" and no, she didn't think that unusual .\n\nGadd has taken to social media to ask people to stop trying to work out the identity of the individual who inspired Baby Reindeer. Harvey had already denied that she had committed any of the acts we see perpetuated on screen. \"This is all made up and hyperbole,\" she said in an interview with Daily Record. \"There are no restraining orders, injunctions or interdicts anywhere. There's just no way. I've not had the police at my door about any of these things.\"\n\nThere was a cheesy moment at the end when he asked her to look into the camera and speak to the audience directly. However, she had already made her feelings known when Morgan asked her if she was challenging Gadd to share evidence about stalking. She had a straightforward answer: \"I'm challenging him to leave me alone\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restraining order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_cable_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States cable news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SXyqKVDImiPq8iGRQ8aOnA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/5f6ffbb5dbf88c1c744398eb421a12b9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551540", "eventUri": "eng-9551540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 452992010, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 208, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 208}}}

There may have been a couple of emails, jokey banter, but that is it.'\n\nAsked if she had a message for Richard Gadd if he was watching, she said: 'Leave me alone, please. Get a life, get a proper job. I am horrified at what you've done.'\n\nShe said she would 'absolutely' be taking legal action against him and Netflix.\n\nShe admitted tweeting him 18 times, sending fewer than ten emails and sending him one letter but denied messaging him on Facebook.\n\nBaby Reindeer, the extraordinary hit Netflix drama, has been viewed more than 60 million times in the past month\n\nThe chilling real-life drama was inspired by the ordeal suffered by Scottish creator and leading man Richard Gadd at the hands of 'Martha' (played by Jessica Gunning, right)\n\nThe clip of the interview sees Morgan grilling the alleged stalker on everything from her views on Richard Gadd to whether she has ever been to prison\n\nShe said she would happily open up her accounts to prove this.\n\nShe also refused leaving him voicemails.\n\nShe denied ever being charged with an offence or going to jail, as the show suggests the character Martha does.\n\nShe added: 'I think he's probably made it up himself.'\n\n'Why now, why didn't he go to the police at the time?'\n\nShe said: 'I think anyone going along and doing this to anybody - I find the behaviour outrageous.'\n\nAsked if she had watched the drama, she replied: 'Not at all. I've heard about the court scene, about the jail sentences and all this sort of stuff... I haven't watched any of it.'\n\n'You're not curious, too?' Morgan asked.\n\nShe replied: 'No, I think I'd be sick. It's taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic.\n\nBaby Reindeer delves into Richard's harrowing real-life stalking ordeal and brutal sexual abuse as he plays a fictionalised version of himself called Donny Dunn (pictured)\n\nRichard Gadd and Jessica Gunning attended a photo call for a screening in LA on Tuesday\n\n'Some of the death threats have been really terrible online. People phoning me up. You know, it's been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't give credence to something like that and it's not really my kind of drama.'\n\nFiona Harvey's denials\n\nPiers asked if it was true Gadd had offered her a free cup of tea after she walked into the pub where he was working, she replied: 'No, that's not correct.'\n\nOn whether she said he looked like a 'baby reindeer' toy she had as a child, she added: 'I had a toy reindeer and he'd shaved his head, that bit is true, and there were reindeers in the shops because it was Christmas time or something. It was a joke.'\n\nShe confirmed she banter in the pub had been common, like talking about hanging curtains. 'This was a Hawley Arms joke about about curtains and a lot of sexual innuendo,' she said.\n\nFiona denied Gadd had ever been caught peeping in her window, adding: 'False... I didn't see him at my house. I think it would be impossible to look through a window... That categorically didn't happen.'\n\nPressed on the 41,000 emails, 350 hours of voice messages, 744 tweets, 48 Facebook messages, and 106 letters she is alleged to have sent him, she retorted: 'That's simply not true. There may have been a couple of emails exchanging, but that was it. Just jokey banter emails.'\n\nShe denied sending texts or Facebook messages but admitted sending hom 'about 18 tweets'.\n\nShe said she had sent him 'less than ten' emails.\n\nOn whether she ever heckled Gadd at a comedy show, she said: 'No.'\n\nOn whether she ever attacked one of the comedian's girlfriends during a jealous rage, she said: 'No, I don't think he had a girlfriend. But no, I have never been to his house or attacked any girlfriend or anything like that.'\n\nAsked about the scenes showing Martha sitting for hours at a bus stop and whether she ever did that, she replied: 'No. Absolutely no... This is a fictional character. Hyperbole, exaggeration. This is a fiction. It's based on his imagination.' Fiona also denied ever contacting his parents.\n\nAfter watching a clip of the series, showing Martha pleading guilty to intimidating Richard's character Donny and being sentenced to nine months prison time, Piers asked if she had ever been to prison or been charged, she replied 'no' to both questions.\n\nAsked again if the nine month prison sentence in the drama is based on reality, she said: 'That's completely untrue. Very, very defamatory to me, very career damaging. And I wanted to rebut that completely on this show. I'm not a stalker. I've not been to jail, I've not got injunctions, interdicts. This is just complete nonsense.'\n\nOn whether Netflix had ever contacted her, she said: 'No. No one's contacted me. Never.'\n\nOn whether she believes the comedian 'felt sorry for her', she replied: 'No, I never got that impression at all. I got the impression that he was all out for himself.'\n\nAsked about previous 'inappropriate behaviour' when working for a legal firm in Scotland, she said she had been headhunted due to her employment law credentials. She said no order or hearing was made against her in the aftermath.\n\nPushed again on whether she had left voicemails or sent strings of messages, she said the only explanation for the voice messages must be that she had been taped in the pub while speaking.\n\nOn whether she was ever in love with him, she said 'no, I don't fancy little boys without jobs'.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said the interest in her was 'absolutely horrendous'.\n\nShe said: 'I couldn't believe he'd done that. And so long after the first meeting, you know, we're talking 10, 12 years ago, really horrendous.'\n\nSpeaking about her childhood, she said it was a 'standard Scottish upbringing' in the 'countryside'.\n\nShe said she was 'impoverished' but had a 'middle class upbringing' along with her sister.\n\nMs Harvey said: 'My mother worked incredibly hard. My parents got divorced when I was nine but she worked like a Trojan.'\n\nThe 58-year-old also revealed she was in a five-year relationship with a male lawyer.\n\nMorgan has already faced a backlash from mental health campaigners and survivors of stalking over his 'irresponsible' decision to interview the woman.\n\nToday, the alleged stalker hit out at Morgan, saying she felt she had been 'set up' during her appearance on his show.\n\nBefore the t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the celebrity interviewer even aired, the woman went on the offensive, saying she is 'not happy' and felt she was being 'set up' by the interviewer.\n\nDescribing the 30-minute grilling as a 'sparring match', the alleged female stalker has accused Morgan of trying to 'trip her up' with his questions.\n\n'Piers kept saying to me ''are you sure you haven't sent this guy 41,000 emails and phone calls?''.\n\n'A lot of the interview, for a good 10 minutes, he kept coming back to this,' she told the Daily Record.\n\n'I said, ''Look, even if I had sent some emails, it doesn't mean I'm guilty of the rest of the stuff''.\n\n'As I said, in order to bill something as a ''true story'', it's got to be pretty much 100 per cent true.'\n\nShe added: 'It seemed to me that I was set up. I feel a bit used.'\n\nThe Piers Morgan Uncensored special is airing on the broadcaster's YouTube channel, which has 2.58million subscribers.\n\nThe woman will be looking to 'set the record straight' as she breaks her silence following Baby Reindeer's global success, the preview said.\n\nBefore her big interview, she paid a visit to celebrity hairdresser John Hala - who has styled the barnets of A-listers Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sigourney Weaver, Elle MacPherson and Kate Moss - at his salon in London's Canary Wharf.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Record, she claimed she was paid \u00a3250 for the interview and had turned down requests from the likes of This Morning to talk about Baby Reindeer.\n\nThe chilling real-life drama was inspired by the ordeal suffered by Scottish creator and leading man Richard Gadd - who is called Donny Dunn in the show.\n\nWorking as a struggling stand-up comic, Dunn first meets his stalker after he offered 'a crying stranger a cup of tea' while he was working at a bar in London.\n\nThings rapidly turn sinister, with the series claiming 'Martha' bombarded the 34-year-old from Fife with more than 41,000 emails.\n\nShe also sent him hundreds of tweets and and flooded his phone with hours of voicemails over an alleged four-year campaign of terror.\n\nPosting ahead of the show, Morgan said: 'The real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer breaks cover and gives me her first TV interview about the smash hit Netflix show.'\n\nHe added: 'Is she a psycho stalker? Find out on Piers Morgan Uncensored.'\n\nBaby Reindeer has proven a surprise smash for Netflix, having been viewed more than 60 million times in the first month.\n\nRiding on the show's phenomenal success, the cast were pictured attending a swanky screening in Los Angeles on Wednesday.\n\nRichard Gadd and Jessica Gunning - who plays Martha - beamed as they posed arm in arm and joined Nava Mau and others for a Q and A on stage.\n\nThe actress looked worlds away from her role as Martha and had a glamorous Hollywood makeover as they took to the stage\n\nOver four and a half years, Gadd says he received 41,071 emails, 744 tweets, letters totalling 106 pages and 350 hours of voicemail messages from the older woman, whom he calls Martha in the show\n\nHowever, the show's runaway success has been far from a joy for the 'real-life' Martha, who claimed she had been left a 'victim' by its surprise popularity.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Mail+ last month, the woman insisted she was not a stalker and said: 'He's using Baby Reindeer to stalk me now.\n\n'I'm the victim. He's written a bloody show about me.'\n\nShe accused Gadd of having 'main character syndrome' and claimed she had faced 'bullying' as a result of the show and was now considering legal action against him.\n\n'He always thinks he's at the centre of things.\n\n'I'm not writing shows about him or promoting them in the media, am I?\n\n'If he wanted me to be properly anonymous, he could have done so. Gadd should leave me alone,' she added.\n\nGadd claimed he went to great lengths to conceal the identity of the woman who stalked him in real life.\n\nDespite the comic begging fans not to search for the real 'Martha', internet sleuths went on to claim she was the inspiration for the character.\n\nIn the series, after Gadd meets his stalker at the bar, things soon descend into chaos.\n\nIt sees him being regularly followed at home and work, and tracked on Facebook using three fake accounts.\n\nRichard Gadd was a struggling stand-up comic working behind the bar at a pub in London\n\nHe told The Times: 'At first everyone at the pub thought it was funny that I had an admirer. Then she started to invade my life, following me, turning up at my gigs, waiting outside my house, sending thousands of voicemails and emails.'\n\nIt developed to terrifying lengths as the crazed fan got closer to her obsession - including her turning up at his gigs, his workplace and bombarding him with messages.\n\nThe actor and comedian was subjected to a campaign of obsession by the woman, known as Martha, that manifested in 41,071 emails, 744 tweets, 106 pages of letters and a staggering 350 hours of voicemail.\n\nHe says it was 'years' before the police eventually took his complaints seriously - and six years before they finally intervened - something which prolonged the agony for everyone involved including his relatives.\n\nThe police told him at the time that unless his stalker became physically violent, there was little they could do to resolve the issue.\n\nHe has said he still finds it hard to trust people and has had 'every therapy going'.\n\nGadd has revealed he first encountered 'Martha' when he was working in a pub and offered her a cup of tea because she was crying\n\nHe added that the years of being stalked have left him with something 'like PTSD'. For the Netflix role, he lost weight to match his 10-and-a-half stone 'neurotic' self at the height of his own stalking nightmare.\n\nGadd says he's currently single and 'is more cautious' of people because of the campaign of terror that Martha inflicted, saying: 'It takes me a long time to trust them. Before, I entered situations with such abandonment and I got burnt.'\n\nHowever, performing a version of what happened to him has enabled him to have 'ownership' of the trauma. Gadd earned a Fringe award for his show, also called Baby Reindeer, in 2019.\n\nSpeaking to the Telegraph in 2019 about the one-man show that he wrote after the ordeal, which is currently on at London's Bush theatre, he said: 'It was debilitating beyond belief.\n\n'I'd listen to her voicemails and just feel my eyes welling up. They were tears of frustration. Proper brain-heavy stress.'\n\nMailOnline has approached Piers Morgan, Gadd and Netflix for comment.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

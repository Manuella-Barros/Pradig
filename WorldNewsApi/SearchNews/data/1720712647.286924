A spokesman added: \u201cThe marble tile was torn from its mount at the Heritage Centre on Harbour Road and smashed. Anyone who witnessed the damage being caused or who may have other information regarding this crime is asked to contact police on 101, quoting reference 481 09/06/24.\u201d The Wartime NI website has extensive details of the role Paddy played during and before D-Day. After being trained by John McMullan, a local pigeon fancier from Carnlough, Paddy started working for the RAF at Ballykelly, Co Derry where he took part in Air-Sea Rescue missions. The site adds: \u201cHis speed and skill impressed the military and he was soon on his way to RAF Hurn, Dorset, England for his greatest mission. The military used many pigeons as messengers. On 8th June 1944, Paddy was seconded to the United States First Army to take part in a secret mission codenamed U2.\u201d That mission involved carrying encrypted information about the Allied invasion back the 230 miles from Normandy to the loft at RAF Hurn. Paddy did it in a record 4 hours and 50 minutes. The site adds: \u201cThat\u2019s an average speed of 56 miles per hour. This was the fastest time recorded by any of the racing pigeons in service during Operation OVERLORD. The journey was a perilous one. As well as the usual aerial threats of wartime, a number of hawks in the hands of German units had the sole purpose of taking down Paddy and his comrades.\u201d For all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "summary": "Paddy the pigeon carried encrypted messages from Normandy to RAF base in 1944", "url": "https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/co-antrim-memorial-pigeon-awarded-29322656", "image": "https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/article29322639.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Pigeonjfif.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:17:19", "author": "Maurice Fitzmaurice", "authors": ["Maurice Fitzmaurice"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.025}

Jake Cronenworth's surprise bunt further narrowed Arizona's lead, but Manny Machado's subsequent strikeout left the Padres still trailing by a run going into the eighth inning.\n\nStill down by one run, Ha-Seong Kim revived the Padres with a game-tying RBI double in the bottom of the eighth. The comeback momentum was not enough to defeat the Diamondbacks, who won in 10 innings.\n\nArizona scored three runs en route to a 7-5 victory, resetting the score to where it stood in the seventh. Donovan Solano gave fans one last glimmer of hope when he brought Cronenworth home, keeping the bases with no outs, but the Padres ultimately failed to capitalize on the opportunity.\n\nThe Diamondbacks recorded three straight outs. It was San Diego's first loss in extra innings this season.\n\n\"We fight until the last pitch,\" Cronenworth said, via MLB.com. \"We're putting ourselves in a position to win the game.

Despite surrendering a five-run lead in the ninth inning, Jurickson Profar's game-tying home run and Manny Machado's subsequent walk-off homer clinched a thrilling comeback victory in front of a record-breaking crowd at Petco Park.\n\nThe Padres also pulled off a comeback victory in their previous homestand against the Washington Nationals. Marking the second time in franchise history and the first time since 1969, San Diego rallied for four runs in the 10th inning after being down by three runs in extra innings.\n\nAlthough the Padres ultimately fell short on Saturday, they once again displayed their resilience by battling back from a three-run deficit.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bunt (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurickson_Profar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurickson Profar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Solano", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Solano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petco_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petco Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1853,h_1042,x_0,y_37/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/inside_the_padres/01j26xdf8d6c356ege73.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723258", "eventUri": "eng-9723258", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

If they are to continue to be the playoff contender they are at present, he won't make many more in 2024.\n\nIf any. And almost certainly, he is finished for now.\n\nThe reality is the Padres don't absolutely need a fifth starter for another 12 games.\n\nThat doesn't mean they won't use a fifth starter again a few days before that. But because of the All-Star break and another off-day after their first post-break series, they can wait until July 27 at Baltimore to employ a fifth starter.\n\nBy then, the trade deadline will be three days away and the Padres could already have added a starter.\n\nWith three more off-days between July 29 and Aug. 5, they conceivably could have to use a fifth starter just twice between now and Aug. 11.\n\nBy then, Joe Musgrove could be back. And maybe Yu Darvish too.\n\nThey do not want to use Michael King, who has already set a career high in innings pitched, every five days right now. If they did, Mazur would not have pitched last night. They would like to give King a breather over the next month. So they will almost certainly use five starters at least a few times.\n\nBut the Padres know Mazur cannot be given any more time to figure out at the major league level in a pennant race how to throw strikes -- and throw them somewhere other than the middle of the zone -- more consistently.\n\nAsked what a No.5 starter should be expected to do, Mike Shildt explained, \"Just generally -- I mean, no absolutes for your (fifth) guy -- you just want to be able to make sure that they're going to be able to give innings and keep you in games.\"\n\nMazur, who allowed five runs in 4\u2154 innings last night, has not been alone among Padres starting pitchers in burying his team early.\n\nLast night was the 16th time this season a Padres starter has allowed four or more runs in the first three innings of a game. But Mazur has been the culprit three times. And last night was the fourth time he has allowed at least three runs while failing to finish five innings.\n\nThe Padres might make two moves today to bring up relievers. Even if Mazur had thrown a complete game last night, he would likely have been optioned so the Padres could fortify the bullpen. And reliever Wandy Peralta departed last night's game in the ninth inning with what Shildt called a mild adductor strain.\n\nBut the Padres have four hits in each of their past two games. And Sunday's game was started by Ryne Nelson, who they had beat up pretty good in many previous meetings and who brought a 5.42 ERA into that game.\n\n\"Yeah, I can't live in the past with Nelson, man,\" Shildt said when the two-game run of impotence was broached after last night's game. \"If we're gonna live in the past, let's appreciate the good offense prior to that.\"\n\nWe have been appreciating that. Like, virtually every day for weeks.\n\nYou want to talk about the past? Here you go:\n\nThe Padres have not had an at-bat with a runner in scoring position in their past two games. That's right, at-bat. Not a single one.\n\nIt is the first time that has happened to a Padres team since 1974.\n\nKyle Higashioka's home run in the eighth inning last night gave him a career-high 11 for the season.\n\nHe hit 10 home runs each of the past three seasons.\n\nEven more remarkable than his total number of homers is that Higashioka has hit 10 of them in his past 69 at-bats.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the Padres make the pieces fit when Xander Bogaerts returns, which will likely come Friday against the Braves.\n\nYou can read in Jeff Sanders' game preview (here) about the work Bogaerts did yesterday at Petco Park, as well as his thoughts on his progress. Also in that story, Shildt confirms what we already could surmise -- that Jake Cronenworth will slide back over to first base while Bogaerts returns and plays second.\n\nThat will move Luis Arraez, who has filled in at first, back to being the primary designated hitter.\n\nThat is all pretty straightforward.\n\nThe conundrum involves how the Padres get at-bats for Donovan Solano, who was 1-for-3 last night and is batting .287/.347/.401 this season.\n\nThey have too many days off over the next month to be giving regulars much rest.\n\nSaid Shildt: \"There is going to be some real productive player that's not going to be in the lineup to start the game. And then, figure out the best spot for them to be used when situations arise.\"\n\nArraez saw nine pitches while going 0-for-4 last night.\n\nQuick outs are an increasingly frequent occurrence for the Padres' lead-off batter.\n\nArraez is batting .241 over the past month (since June 9) and seeing just 3.28 pitches per plate appearances, second-fewest in the majors among the 116 batters with at least 100 plate appearances in that span.\n\nHe was batting an MLB-best .337 on June 8 and was averaging 3.64 pitches per plate appearance to that point.\n\nArraez is batting .309 on the season with a .342 on-base percentage. That latter number is down 51 points from last season and 37 points from his career OBP entering 2024. He has walked just three times in 115 plate appearances over the past month.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors":

The Padres have a 49-44 record and currently occupy the second spot in the NL wildcard race. Part of their improved success this year is the belief the team has in themselves. While they no longer have some of the superstars they did last season in Josh Hader and Juan Soto, this team appears to be more aligned in what they can do.\n\nPadres first baseman Jake Cronenworth epitomizes this belief, saying that the team believes they can win any game on any night.\n\n\"It feels like we're in it no matter what,\" Cronenworth said, via MLB.com's AJ Cassavell. \"It's one quality at-bat away. Then it's the next guy, then the next guy. We stack those on top of each other. I think we've done it so much this year that we know we can do it. It's a belief in the group that that's possible every night.\"\n\nThe Padres almost put this mentality back into action again on Saturday, when they came near a walk-off win over the Arizona Diamondbacks in extra innings. They managed to push the game into extra innings, but couldn't match the Diamondbacks' 10th inning performance, even when they had the bases loaded. This one fell short, but overall, the Padres have 22 comeback wins on the season.\n\nThis belief has come through in other ways and let the team garner wins and even series wins against teams that are better or higher ranked than them, like the Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia Phillies, and the Atlanta Braves.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cronenworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cronenworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hader", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4464,h_2511,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_padres/01j27016rytbytzsq3bf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723258", "eventUri": "eng-9723258", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

They led the National League in runs per game during that stretch. They were a season-high six games above .500 and ranked second in the major leagues in batting average.\n\nAn extra-innings loss followed, in which they scored five runs and had 14 hits.\n\nIn the three games since, they have scored nine runs and have 14 hits.\n\nThey also had Monday off between a series loss to the Diamondbacks and being swept by the Diamondbacks. They are off Thursday before beginning a three-game series against the Braves.\n\nNo team played more games than the Padres (88) through June. No team has more days off (nine) in July.\n\nThey got far better pitching Wednesday than they generally had the previous few games. But a gaffe in the field and stagnation at the plate rendered that moot.\n\nThe Mariners got their first run Wednesday before they got their first hit.\n\nWith one out in the second inning, King walked Cal Raleigh, who stole second base on the pitch that struck out Ty France and scored when Jorge Polanco's routine grounder went through first baseman Luis Arraez's legs.\n\nThe Padres appeared on the verge of at least tying the game in the bottom of the second when they got three one-out singles.\n\nThey had not had a runner in scoring position in two consecutive days for just the second time in franchise history and first time in 50 years. They ended that drought with three hits achieved in a manner they would like to define their approach this season.\n\nAll three hits came with two strikes and two were to the opposite field - Donovan Solano's ground through the right side, left-handed-hitting Jackson Merrill's line drive to left field and David Peralta's pulled grounder through the right side.\n\nThat loaded the bases, as the 36-year-old Solano was held at third on Peralta's hit, which was fielded in shallow right field by Luke Raley.\n\nSolano essentially had no choice but to tag up on Ha-Seong Kim's fly ball to shallow center field. It did not go well for the Padres, as Julio Rodriguez caught and threw to the plate, where Raleigh tagged out Solano.\n\nThe Mariners were able to turn three singles into a run in the fourth inning.\n\nThe inning began with Raley lining the first pitch from King up the middle for a single. King struck out the next two batters before singles by France and Polanco brought around Raley to make it 2-0.\n\nKing finished six innings without further damage. Adri\u00e1n Morej\u00f3n got the first two outs of the seventh, and Jeremiah Estrada stranded two runners to end that inning and worked a scoreless eighth.\n\nBut the Padres got just a lead-off single from Jake Cronenworth in the fourth and a one-out single by Jurickson Profar in the sixth.\n\nThey threatened again in the eighth, when Sullivan walked and Arraez singled with two outs against Ryne Stanek before Mariners closer Andres Mu\u00f1oz struck out Profar.\n\nAfter Robert Suarez worked a scoreless top of the ninth, the Padres began their half of the last inning with Cronenworth and Manny Machado drawing walks. Donovan Solano's groundout to shortstop moved Cronenworth and pinch-runner Bryce Johnson into scoring position.\n\nBut the game ended on a strikeout by Merrill and soft lineout up the middle by Peralta.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_acee@sandiegouniontribune.com", "name": "Kevin Acee",

For the first time since 2005, Petco Park sold out every game of a series against the Diamondbacks.\n\nAs Kevin Acee of the San Diego-Union Tribune noted, it likely helped that Petco Park threw a \"Star Wars\"-themed weekend, and even had a fireworks show one day, but the stadium still managed to sell out all three games.\n\nWhile the Padres and Diamondbacks are National League West division rivals, the rivalry hasn't proven to be as strong as the Padres' rivalry with the Los Angeles Dodgers, which has prompted more sellouts over the years. With both the Padres and Diamondbacks reaching the National League Championship Series the last two years, there could simply be more fan interest in the teams at the moment.\n\nThe Padres, of course, did not play well for the most part in front of the home crowd. They lost two of their games, including a brutal 9-1 loss to the Diamondbacks in the final game of the series. The Padres also lost to Arizona 7-5 the day prior.\n\nTheir best game of the series was the first game, when they defeated the Diamondbacks 10-8 on Friday in large part due to a great day from the lineup. A four-hit game from Manny Machado and a three-RBI game from rookie Jackson Merrill set up a late win.\n\nThis sellout continues the trend of good home attendance for the Padres all season. Petco Park ranks second in total attendance this season and fourth in average fans at the ballpark per game, typically bringing in 39,978 fans each home game.\n\nThe Padres will continue their home-stand with two more home series before the All-Star Break, as they host the Seattle Mariners and Atlanta Braves.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petco_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petco Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballpark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Drinking_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Drinking Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_7464,h_4198,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_padres/01j2ccnr34htnnh87ydm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723258", "eventUri": "eng-9723258", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

All three singles came with two strikes, and two were to the opposite field. First, Donovan Solano grounded a ball the other way through the right side, then left-handed-hitting Jackson Merrill hit a line drive to left field and David Peralta pulled a grounder through the right side.\n\nBut that led to nothing when Ha-Seong Kim's fly ball to shallow center field resulted in Solano being thrown out at the plate.\n\nA ninth-inning rally also produced nothing when the same three players who singled in the second all made outs after Jake Cronenworth and Manny Machado began the inning with walks.\n\n\"I know what everyone expects us to do,\" Profar said. \"We expect it from ourselves -- to take off. It hasn't (happened) yet. We just have to keep pushing. Today, we could have done a little bit better.\"\n\nHe was particularly perturbed at himself.\n\n\"I had an at-bat I wish I could get back,\" he said, referring to his strikeout to end the eighth inning with runners at second and third.\n\nIt was the kind of situation in which Profar (and others) have come through often enough that, even having lost four straight games, the Padres are 49-47 and in possession of the final National League wild-card spot.\n\nProfar leads the major leagues with a .517 average in late-and-close situations, is sixth in the majors with a .361 average with runners in scoring position and has a team-high seven game-tying RBIs and team-high nine game-deciding RBIs. But he failed this time, chasing three sliders from Mariners closer Andres Mu\u00f1oz well below the zone.\n\n\"I expect to do better,\" Profar said. \"I went out of my zone. Normally, I don't do that. I did it. That's a pretty good slider, and he has 100 (mph) in the tank. So it's a pretty tough at-bat. But in that situation, I need to do better.\"\n\nThe Padres have won two games in which they got six hits. They have won two games in which they got fewer than six hits. It is possible. But to do so, it takes big hits or hits in big situations.\n\nAll but one Padres starter reached base at least once yesterday. But all were stranded there, as the Padres were 1-for-6 with runners in scoring position and did not have any extra-base hits.\n\n\"If we want to (take off), we need to capitalize on situations over and over and over again,\" Profar said. \"We do, but limited times. We need to find a way to do it all the time, because we have the talent in here to do it all the time.\"\n\nYou can read (here) about the Padres' fourth consecutive loss.\n\nMichael King's first half is done. He will have at least eight days (and probably more) off before his next start.\n\nYesterday was his 19th start of the season, the same number he had in his career before this season. His six innings yesterday gave him 111 for the year, 6\u2153 more than he threw last season in what was then a career high. His average fastball velocity was up 1 mph yesterday.\n\n\"Body feels great,\" he said. \"Happy with that. I think I've worked well with the trainers and strength coaches to keep my body prepared for however many innings it's going to be. But first half was decent. Still a lot to learn, but making strides every time.\"\n\nHere is a look at the strides King has made:\n\nJoe Musgrove made 15 throws off the front slope of the mound on Wednesday, another step in his progression toward a return to the Padres' starting rotation.\n\n\"It's coming out great, and the movements are good,\" he said.\n\nMusgrove, who said he is working at about \"80-85 percent\" intensity, has not pitched since May 26 due to elbow issues that include a bone spur that was causing discomfort and inflammation.

Mandatory Credit: Raymond Carlin III-USA TODAY Sports / Raymond Carlin III-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe San Diego Padres will give the ball to Michael King in the second game of their two-game series against the Seattle Mariners, looking to avenge Tuesday's 8-3 loss.\n\nThe Padres have been struggling on the pitching side, allowing seven runs or more in four consecutive games. Their lineup has been arguably worse, with four hits in each of the last two games. At least Wednesday's starter, Michael King, has been solid recently, with a 3.51 ERA and just one earned run allowed in three of his last four starts. Bryce Miller will start for Seattle, coming in with a 3.84 ERA and a 1.08 WHIP.

With the Mariners only up two runs, it meant that the next three hitters would come to the plate as the winning run.\n\nMu\u00f1oz got Donovan Solano to ground out to J.P. Crawford for the first out, but both runner moved up 90 feet, meaning the tying run was in scoring position at second. He struck out rookie Jackson Merrill on a nasty slider in the dirt for the second out.\n\nWhen veteran hitter David Peralta was able to fight off back-to-back two-strike pitches and then get enough of a slider to send a soft line drive to center, the announced crowd of 39,611 roared at the possibility of game-tying bloop single.\n\nBut as the late-afternoon shadows started to cover Petco Park on Wednesday, Crawford got a perfect read on a ball that grew more catchable as it traveled, making an easy catch to close out a 2-0 victory over the Padres.\n\nIt gave Seattle a sweep of the now-traditional two-game interleague series between the two \"natural rivals,\" and ended a stretch of six consecutive series lost.\n\nIt was Mu\u00f1oz's ninth multi-inning appearance this season and his sixth save of more than three outs.\n\n\"I think something weird about today is I didn't have that same energy in my second inning,\" Mu\u00f1oz said. \"That is something that never happened to me before. Probably that was why I was a little bit off in the second inning. In the first inning, I had that energy going because I had two men on base and I had to get it done.\"\n\nMu\u00f1oz found the energy after the two walks in the ninth and made the adjustment.\n\n\"The adrenaline just kicked up,\" Mu\u00f1oz said. \"Obviously, you don't want to wait for that to happen, but it happened today. I'm going to work on it to make sure it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nManager Scott Servais got Tayler Saucedo and Trent Thornton both up and warming after Mu\u00f1oz walked the first two batters, hoping he wouldn't have to use them.\n\n\"Andres Mu\u00f1oz has been incredible,\" Servais said. \"... It's a shame he's not on the All-Star team. I certainly hope he gets added to it because the number of four-out and five-out saves that he has gotten us this year, it's just been a difference maker. He was a little bit on the edge and didn't have great command there early, but he found it and that's what you have to do in those spots.\"\n\nThe Mariners got a strong start from Bryce Miller, who found some success away from T-Mobile Park. All of the offense was provided by Jorge Polanco - yes, Jorge Polanco, who drove in both runs in the game.\n\nMiller came into the game with a 2-4 record and 6.28 ERA in eight road starts. But knowing that the Padres were going to swing early and put the ball in play, he delivered strikes early in counts to take advantage of their aggressiveness.\n\n\"I thought we would have to pitch extremely well to win this series and we did exactly that,\" Servais said. \"Hats off to Bryce Miller. He really executed his game plan today.\"\n\nHe pitched six scoreless innings, allowing five hits with no walks and one strikeout. That lone strikeout came against the final hitter of his outing, when he fired a 96-mph fastball past Jake Cronenworth to the end the sixth.\n\n\"I would have been upset if I had zero strikeouts, but I can deal with one I guess,\" he said with a chuckle. \"One is better than zero. I don't know if I've had a game with just one strikeout, but we won, so I'll take it.\"\n\nAfter watching Logan Gilbert's outing in person on Tuesday, Miller went and re-watched it on his iPad at the team hotel, noticing that quality strikes early would lead to soft contact. He allowed only one ball in play with an exit velocity of more than 100 mph.\n\nIn the second inning, he allowed three consecutive singles to load the bases with one out. When Ha-Seong Kim hit a fly ball to center field, it looked as if the Padres might pick up their first run.\n\nBut Julio Rodriguez was able to get into a primed position to make a throw home after making the catch. He delivered a strong and accurate throw, Cal Raleigh made a clean grab on the two-hopper and applied the tag on Donovan Solano for the third out.\n\n\"That play Julio made was really a shot in the arm,\" Servais said.\n\nThe Mariners grabbed a 1-0 lead in the second inning. Raleigh worked a walk off Padres starter Michael King and then stole second base. That extra base loomed large when Luis Arraez misplayed a ground ball off the bat of Polanco, allowing Raleigh to score.\n\nPolanco got credit for an RBI in the fourth inning when he smacked a crisp two-out single to right-center in the fourth inning, scoring Luke Raley from second. The veteran infielder had four hits in the two-game series while also drawing two walks.\n\n\"He's starting to gain some confidence,\" Servais said. \"We talked about making some adjustments, and going about it a little bit differently and he is, and he started to get some results. The quality of at-bats is improving.\"\n\nBOX SCORE", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_divish@theolympian.com", "name": "Ryan Divish", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Mu\u00f1oz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ground out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Peralta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Peralta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Seattle improved to 51-43 on the year win the win.\n\nBryce Miller went six innings for the Mariners, allowing no walks and one strikeout. He improved his record to 7-6.\n\n\"It was big,\" Miller said in a postgame interview Wednesday. \"Kind of a weird game. I was just throwing it in there and they were putting it on the ground. I'll take that. Anytime I can throw good, give us a chance to win, I'll take it.\"\n\nThe Twitter account @MarinerMuse had the perfect summation for Miller's outing, calling it \"one of the weirdest starts a Mariners pitcher has had all year.\"\n\nMiller's stats didn't necessarily jump off the page, but he did have a few clutch moments that don't show up on the box score.\n\nMiller's lone strikeout came against the last batter he faced. His final pitch was a 96 mile per hour four-seamer in the bottom of the sixth that got Jake Cronenworth to chase and left one runner stranded.\n\nMiller also didn't blink in a bases-loaded situation in the bottom of the second. It helped that his defense was there to back him up.\n\nJulio Rodriguez caught a Ha-Seong Kim fly out in shallow center field and gunned it to home, where Cal Raleigh tagged out Donovan Solano for the 8-2 double play.\n\nOnce Miller's day was done, the Seattle bullpen made sure his start didn't go to waste.\n\nFirst, Austin Voth came in and the Padres in order in the bottom of the seventh. In the bottom of the eighth, San Diego threatened but came up empty.\n\nRyne Stanek helped to generate two quick outs but let up a walk and a single. Andres Munoz entered the game and struck out Jurickson Profar swinging and the Padres left two stranded.\n\nIn the bottom of the ninth, Munoz allowed the first two men to reach via the walk. After a mound visit, San Diego grounded out, struck out, and lined out to leave the game-tying runs on second and third. Munoz earned his 15th save of the year for his 1.1 innings pitched. He has an ERA of 1.45.\n\nOffensively, Seattle's two runs were pretty cut-and-dry. Raleigh scored on a fielding error in the top of the second and Jorge Polanco hit an RBI single in the top of the fourth.\n\nSeattle snapped its six-series series loss streak with its two wins against the Padres. It will continue its California road trip with a four-game series against the Los Angeles Angels starting at 6:38 p.m. PT on Thursday in Anaheim, Calif.\n\nMARINERS MAKE CRUCIAL ROSTER MOVES: The Seattle Mariners made some crucial roster decisions, placing outfielder Dominic Canzone on the 10-day injured list on Wednesday.

But in the late afternoon shadows filling Petco Park, J.P. Crawford got a perfect read on the soft looping liner to center off the bat of David Peralta, making an easy catch on a ball that seemed disastrous off the bat to close Seattle's 2-0 victory over the Padres.\n\nThe victory gave Seattle a sweep in the two-game series, ending a stretch of seven consecutive series lost.\n\nThe ninth inning featured more drama than anticipated when closer Andres Munoz, who had cleaned up a mess in the eighth inning, created his own issues in the ninth, walking the first two batters he faced before retiring the next three.\n\nThe Mariners got a solid start from Bryce Miller, who found some success away from T-Mobile Park. And all of the offense was provided by Jorge Polanco, yes, Jorge Polanco, who drove in both runs in the game.\n\nMiller pitched six scoreless innings, allowing five hits with no walks and one strikeout. That lone strikeout came in the final hitter of his outing, when he fired a 96-mph fastball past Jake Cronenworth to the end the sixth.\n\nMiller got plenty of help from his defense.\n\nIn the second inning, he allowed three consecutive singles to load the bases with one out. When Ha-Seong Kim hit a fly ball to center field, it looked as if the Padres might pick up their first run.\n\nBut Julio Rodriguez was able to get into a primed position to make a throw home after making the catch.

He threw 80 pitches, 54 of which were strikes, in the performance. The Padres put the ball in play, but generally the Mariners were able to make plays behind Miller.\n\nThe Padres had a scoring opportunity off Miller in the second inning but Julio Rodriguez erased a baserunner with an 8-2 double play to end a threat.\n\nMiller is now 7-7 on the season with a 3.63 ERA. After making his debut a year ago, Miller has now thrown 109.0 innings this year. He will be off until after the All-Star break. If the Mariners want to use him in relief on Sunday, they could probably throw him for an inning, but that seems unlikely at this point.\n\nMiller has struck out 98 batters in those 109.0 innings. He's now 15-14 for his career.\n\nThe Mariners are 51-43 after winning two straight games. They'll take on the Los Angeles Angels for a four-game series beginning on Thursday night in Anaheim.\n\nThe M's remain 2.0 games ahead of the Astros in the division.\n\nMARINERS PODCAST DROPS: The first episode of the \"Refuse to Lose\" podcast is out!

They held a 5 1/2-game lead in pursuit of the National League's second (and then-final) wild card. They fielded a roster that included five All-Stars.\n\nAnd that afternoon, when right-hander Chris Paddack strained his left oblique during a bullpen session, they watched it all begin to crumble. Fernando Tatis Jr. would re-dislocate his left shoulder hours later, but Paddack's injury -- which occurred soon after the Padres balked at the price of trading for a starting pitcher -- helped trigger the implosion of an entire unit.\n\nAfter the trade deadline, the Padres opted for several bullpen games and gave starts to Jake Arrieta, Vince Velasquez and then-rookie Ryan Weathers. That trio combined for an 11.57 ERA. With veterans Joe Musgrove, Yu Darvish and Blake Snell attempting to prop up a shorthanded rotation, the pitching staff as a whole produced a 5.17 ERA. San Diego finished 18-38 and 11 games out of the postseason picture.\n\nWednesday, the Padres woke up with a 1 1/2-game lead over the New York Mets for the National League's third wild card. They featured five newly selected All-Stars and an offense that has performed substantially better than the 2021 version. The San Diego rotation was fronted by Dylan Cease, who was acquired in March by a front office that absorbed lessons from multiple second-half meltdowns.\n\nAnd hours later, the Padres absorbed a fourth consecutive defeat while continuing to grapple with their most glaring problem. Michael King threw well in a 2-0 loss to the pitching-rich Seattle Mariners, but the former reliever also moved six innings closer to an uncertain limit.\n\nBefore the game, San Diego optioned struggling rookie starter Adam Mazur to Triple A and recalled Logan Gillaspie to form a temporary nine-man bullpen ahead of the All-Star break. Around the same time, Musgrove played catch off a mound in preparation for a bullpen session around the middle of next week.\n\nIf Musgrove makes it there without any setbacks, it would be his first bullpen in more than a month. Musgrove was shut down in early June after the discovery of a bone bruise and bone spur in his throwing elbow. Now, he is aiming to return from the injured list the first or second week of August.\n\nRegardless of whether such a plan comes to fruition, time will soon reveal the state of a post-deadline staff. The Padres might have needed additions weeks ago -- Musgrove and Darvish have not pitched since late May, and the bullpen has an ERA above 5.00 in the same span -- but a relative lack of supply and the weeks left on the clock remain obvious deterrents in mid-July. Under A.J. Preller, perhaps the most aggressive general manager in the sport, no one inside San Diego's clubhouse feels a pressing need to lobby the front office the way Brandon Nimmo recently lobbied the Mets' brass.\n\n\"A.J. knows what we need. I think we have a pretty good level of communication with him,\" Musgrove said. \"I don't feel like anybody in here is going out there begging and pleading for players. ... You can't start asking and begging for things and then not get it and now the whole mindset of the clubhouse has changed. We're preparing as if this is what we have and we're moving forward, and anything we get from here on is an addition. We're going to get myself back, we're going to get (Xander Bogaerts) back, we're going to get (Tatis) back. So, in a way, it feels like we're winning the deadline already, having all these guys coming back and adding that power to an efficient lineup already, getting a few more good arms in there.\"\n\nBogaerts, the veteran infielder, could return this weekend from a fractured shoulder. The Padres hope Tatis can return before September from a stress reaction in his right femur. Adding multiple good arms poses a more complicated task for a team that is reluctant to discuss top prospects Ethan Salas and Leodalis De Vries in trade talks (and no longer has much other premium talent to peddle).\n\nThe Padres are roughly $12 million from a luxury-tax threshold they do not plan on exceeding. They could gain a decent amount of financial flexibility to apply toward their pitching needs if Darvish, who is on the restricted list attending to a family matter, does not return this season. (Teams are not required to pay players on the restricted list. Before he went on it, Darvish was still owed about $7 million in 2024.) Club officials are hopeful that Darvish does return this year, but they and other Padres players do not know if he definitely will. Musgrove, who said he recently texted with Darvish, has sought to respect the privacy of a beloved teammate.\n\n\"Yeah, uncertain on where Darvish is going to be in a few months,\" Musgrove said. \"It's hard to make a decision now.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the Padres have regular decisions to make with at least one key pitcher. King will be carefully monitored through the end of his first full season as a major-league starter. Two years after fracturing his throwing elbow, he is up to an MLB-career-high 111 innings. (He tallied 104 2/3 last season with the New York Yankees.) San Diego's four off days this month and the All-Star break allow the team to build in occasional additional rest for King. He received it Tuesday, following an off day, with Mazur starting instead.\n\nMazur surrendered five runs in 4 2/3 innings in an 8-3 loss to the Mariners. His big-league ERA, through seven outings, sits at 7.84. That he had been deemed the readiest starting pitching prospect from the farm system is more reason Preller must acquire rotation help by the end of the month. But the Padres also must prioritize the health of King, the headliner of their return for Juan Soto. So, they gave at least one more start to a rookie who clearly is not ready.\n\nKing perhaps can provide another 50 or so innings this season. The Padres do not have a set target. As he did with former reliever Seth Lugo last season, pitching coach Ruben Niebla has tracked King's mechanics with the help of Hawk-Eye technology and sought to limit the number of \"stressful\" innings King throws in any start. King, meanwhile, has noticed that Lugo is now flourishing with the Kansas City Royals as a first-time All-Star.\n\n\"I think it's a very good guideline to follow,\" said King, who has pitched to a 3.41 ERA. (Lugo, who now leads all qualifying starters with a 2.21 ERA, produced a 3.57 mark last season.) \"Just seeing a guy that I feel like has always had starter stuff, seeing the success as a full-time starter is reassuring.\"\n\n\"Lugo did miss some starts (in 2023) with a calf (injury),\" Niebla said. \"So where it ends up, I don't know. But paying attention to it, what we do know is that we need to get Michael (to stay) healthy and be at his best in September and October.\"\n\nLugo ended last season with a career-high 146 1/3 innings. While there are no restrictions on Cease, one of the majors' more durable starters over the past several years, the Padres may need a larger number from Matt Waldron. The rookie is up to 99 2/3 innings after totaling 133 2/3 last season between the majors and the minors. It could help that he has shouldered a starter's workload throughout his professional career. It also could help that almost 40 percent of his pitches have been knuckleballs.\n\nStill, the Padres will exercise some caution with a young major leaguer who has emerged as one of their more effective starters.\n\n\"He throws it hard,\" Niebla said. \"There's some above 80. You throw a knuckleball above 80, it's going to tax you. Absolutely.\"\n\nLess than three weeks before the trade deadline, the rotation has been propped up by Waldron, King and Cease, although Cease has struggled to the tune of a 5.88 ERA over his past 11 outings. Relief help remains an urgent need, but it could all become moot if the Padres do not acquire a starter. Two might be preferable. The lessons of 2021 continue to resonate.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dennis_lin@nytimes.com", "name": "Dennis Lin",

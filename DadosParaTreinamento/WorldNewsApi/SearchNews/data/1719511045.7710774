Minaj has posted a stream of comments and missives on X since the arrest and claimed to have \u201csooooooooo much video evidence. You wouldn\u2019t believe it if I told you,\u201d before noting that, \u201cI\u2019ll have the lawyers & GOD take it from here tho.\u201d Minaj, 41, had been set to perform in Manchester\u2019s Co-op Live Arena on Saturday as part of her \u201cPink Friday 2\u201d tour but was forced to postpone after being held by by Dutch authorities on allegations she was carrying drugs. She had earlier shared the name of her Manchester hotel in a post on X, and invited fans to see her. \u201cI\u2019m going on the balcony so if you\u2019re outside I\u2019ll be able to see you & I may come downstairs. I\u2019ll be out there for about an hour. Rlly (really) wanted to at least get to see you,\u201d the \u201cBang Bang\u201d singer wrote. She also wrote thanked fans \u201cwho prayed for me today\u2026May you be blessed beyond your imagination.\u201d Minaj noted that she had been held in a jail cell for \u201c5-6 hours,\u201d and her plane didn\u2019t \u201ctake off for another 20 minutes once I boarded. The flight was 50 mins.\u201d Hours before the cancellation was announced, Minaj live-streamed herself being told by police in Amsterdam that she was under arrest for allegedly \u201ccarrying drugs.\u201d In the video, an officer is shown telling Minaj that she needed to stop recording and enter a police vehicle. However she refused and asked to speak to her lawyer. Eventually she calmly entered the car. In another video, an official told Minaj that all her luggage needed to be searched on the suspicion that she was carrying more drugs. \u201cnow they said they found weed & that another group of ppl have to come here to weigh the pre-rolls. Keep in mind they took my bags without consent,\u201d she wrote Saturday morning on X. \u201cMy security has already advised them those pre-rolls belong to him. Oh yea & the pilot wants me to take my ig post down.\u201d Minaj noted the irony of being allegedly carrying marijuana in a country where it\u2019s legal. This is Amsterdam btw, where weed is legal,\u201d she wrote. The \u201cQueen of Rap\u201d suggested that her old management company may have been behind the arrest. \u201cAll b/c I fired mngmnt who I found out for years were adding on 30-50K on my jet & pocketing it,\u201d she alleged. \u201cI fired a tour mngr recently who was doing the same thing & mad he got the boot. Their goal is to make me late, & to pocket 40K.\u201d Authorities in Amsterdam confirmed via X Saturday afternoon that Minaj had been released after being booked \u201con suspicion of exporting soft drugs\u201d and fined. Minaj also retweeted posts about singer Ari Lennox who was arrested at Amsterdam Airport in 2021 after authorities claimed she was \u201cfull of emotions\u201d and arrested for disturbing public order. \u201cShe was \u201cfull of emotions\u201d. She was arrested b/c she was full of emotions in AmsterDAM,\u201d Minaj wrote. \u201cHmmmmm interesting. I didn\u2019t know this was a \u201cthing\u201d there.\u201d The Barbie World\u201d hitmaker then compared Lennox to Sandra Bland, a black woman who was found hanged in a jail cell in Texas, three days after being arrested during a traffic stop. \u201cWho spoke up for her? Could\u2019ve easily been another Sandra Bland incident. I\u2019m so happy she made it out alive & well.\u201d Minaj is set to play in Manchester on Thursday, May 30.", "summary": "\u201cThank you to everyone who prayed for me today.

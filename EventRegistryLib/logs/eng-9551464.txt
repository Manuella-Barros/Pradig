Reddit users recently took to the platform to give their views on the place, dubbing it one of the \"most hated\" American cities out there.\n\n\"Fresno seemed like a real dump,\" wrote one aggrieved ex-visitor.\n\nREAD MORE: Zombie addicts writhe around in city where drugs are rife but you can't drink in public\n\nThere's lots of quality news coming out of the US.\n\n\"I was in California back in 2011 with a couple of friends,\" said another. \"We drove through Fresno and stopped there for fuel. I could feel the meth in the air. Not just any meth, but hot meth. Worth it once for the novelty, but never again.\"\n\nAnother chimed: \"Luckily I haven't been there too many times, but when I have it legitimately feels like a post-apocalyptic city to me for some reason. It just oozes despair.\"\n\nAnd the facts seem to support these claims made online. According to the data website Neighbourhood Scout, the crime rate in Fresno stands at 4,314 crimes per 100,000 residents - making it almost double the national average. Violent crime was well over twice higher than the average in the US.\n\nYouTube road-tripper Joey Evans said when he visited Fresno that \"it is pretty bad here - they need to work on that\" when referring to the crime rate. However, when walking through one of the city's parks he admitted: \"Downtown is beautiful. It's clean, there aren't homeless people and it feels safe here because it's crawling with police.\"\n\nOn the whole, Evans' account of Fresno was relatively positive and his fans backed this up in the comment section below.\n\nOne particularly relieved local wrote: \"Being a long time resident, I was afraid to open this. You are right, Fresno gets bashed a lot. Thank you for showing what a nice place it is.\"\n\nAnother agreed: \"Fresno isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be. I was there for a week on a business trip and it was an okay city. Nothing spectacular but some decent food, nice architecture, and certainly better than some other cities in the valley.\"\n\nFresno is still, however, one of the central hubs for the Hell's Angels biker gang, the notorious criminal outfit known for horrific violence and drug trafficking.\n\nIn Fresno, the gang has been known to murder its own members while forcing victims to have a face tattoo.\n\n\"The Hells Angels followed a malicious code of conduct, encouraging the beating, maiming, and even killing of anyone who dared to cross their criminal enterprise,\" noted US Attorney Ismail Ramsey in a Department of Justice statement last year.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_mcghie@dailystar.co.uk",

Harris said transparency laws say the city -- if it has to redact any information -- must make a reasonable effort to redact only the sensitive parts and not large swaths.\n\n\"There are sections titled 'Narrative,' and then there are big gray boxes blocking everything,\" she said.\n\nFresno City Attorney Andrew Janz expressed his confidence in the redacted material, saying a judge recently ruled in Fresno's favor in a case involving the use of Tasers and redacted records.\n\n\"The city of Fresno will continue to abide by all laws regarding the production of public documents, including those related to our use of K-9s,\" he said. \"Moreover, the city of Fresno will continue to defend the use of less-than-lethal tools at our disposal.\"\n\nFresno K-9 bite records and police use-of-force\n\nAcross the state, police use-of-force with K-9 dogs are used most commonly on people of color, people experiencing a mental health episode and often people who pose no danger to the police, the ACLU report found.\n\nFor example, Bakersfield released documents that showed that of the people bit by police dogs, Black and Latino people made up 89% despite being just 59% of the population.\n\nOfficers also do not have control of the dogs, who bite innocent bystanders or do not release a bite when commanded, according to the report.\n\nThe report cites a few incidents in Fresno that made news, including the October 2021 incident when a dog named Odin attacked an officer, who was hospitalized. While being transported months later to be euthanized on Jan. 4, 2022, Odin bit another officer before that officer shot the dog to death.", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Fresno Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thaddeus_miller@fresnobee.com", "name": "Thaddeus Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno_County_Superior_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fresno County Superior Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fresno Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney\u2013client_privilege", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney\u2013client privilege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Use of force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Odin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euthanasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic and Latino Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakersfield,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bakersfield, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bakersfield, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://www.fresnobee.com/latest-news/ozf89m/picture276025131/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/IMG_5869.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551464", "eventUri": "eng-9551464", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

(KSEE/KGPE) - Officials with the City of Fresno announced on Wednesday that a majority of the city's most prolific taggers have been arrested.\n\nThe city states the accomplishment comes with the integration of the Fresno Police Department's Graffiti Abatement Team, which was put into action on Feb. 20. In 2024, the team responded to over 34,000 service requests for graffiti, resulting in 97,000 pieces of graffiti being removed.\n\n\"This comprehensive and coordinated approach is intended to identify, arrest, and prosecute the most prolific graffiti vandals within our city and to be able to hold them accountable not only from arresting them, making sure they get jail time, and restitution paying back the victims of this crime,\" said Mayor of Fresno Jerry Dyer.\n\nPictured below are images provided by Fresno PD of the prolific taggers and arrests followed by who they identify as wanted felony suspects:\n\nAs a result of the operation, Fresno Police Chief Paco Balderrama says 19 suspects have been identified and charges have been filed. He adds four suspects are outstanding.\n\n\"[The task force] has looked through over 7,200 different taggings and they have put together the ones that we identified as prolific taggers,\" Balderrama said.\n\nThe mayor adds that of the 57 search warrants authored and served by police, seven firearms were seized as well as an illegal marijuana farm.\n\nDyer says those arrested comprised of suspects who caused \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" of damage to the city, both public and private properties.\n\n\"There's a theme here. If you're going to tag in our city, this task force will identify you, arrest you, and prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law,\" said Dyer.\n\nAnyone who finds graffiti within the City of Fresno can report it through the FresGO App or by calling 311.", "source": {"uri": "yourcentralvalley.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "YourCentralValley.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isaiah_varela@yourcentralvalley.com", "name": "Isaiah Varela", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGPE", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KGPE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fresno Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Dyer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Dyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2024/05/Graffiti-Abatement-Team-00.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551464", "eventUri": "eng-9551464", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-20", "textStart": 309, "textEnd": 316}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

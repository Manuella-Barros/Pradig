She loves the experience of seeing all the booths and also playing here for a while in the park. We\u2019re local and we like to patronize things here. It\u2019s exciting to see this many people come together for an initiative like this.\u201d The 12th annual Aurora GreenFest at the Prisco Community Center and McCullough Park featured exhibits and vendors all aimed at showing ways to enhance sustainability as well as create a more energy-efficient, less wasteful lifestyle. Exhibitors included solar panel and window companies, environmental groups, food producers and others making crafts from recycled materials. Phillips Park Zoo was a new addition this year at the fest, which organizers said \u201cwas a way to appreciate the environment with animals.\u201d District 4 Kane County Board member Mavis Bates again helped organize Saturday\u2019s event. \u201cWe started this in 2010 and took a couple of years off because of COVID but otherwise we\u2019ve been standing tall the whole time,\u201d Bates said. \u201cThe goal of this from the beginning was to make people more environmentally conscious. We usually get about 1,000 people and honestly as I\u2019m walking around in the grocery store people will ask, \u2018Oh Mavis, are you doing the GreenFest again?\u2019 They remember it and appreciate it.\u201d Bates said that \u201cpeople in the Fox Valley have grown more environmentally conscious\u201d and that the fest itself \u201chas been a guiding light in sustainability of the environment and habitat preservation and stopping climate change.\u201d \u201cPeople are more aware of the environment and protecting out native species. When you drive down the street and see more and more solar panels on houses, I think we can take some credit for people growing more environmentally aware,\u201d she said of the fest. Bates added there has always been a strong recycling message at GreenFest \u201cincluding awareness and education.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019ve done a lot. Our theme this year is \u2018Electrify Your Life\u2019 and one of the ways to stop climate change is to evolve and using more electricity in your house than gas,\u201d she said. At the fest, Martin Belovicz of Arlington Heights said that, as a member of the Fox Valley Vehicle Association, \u201cI drive electric cars and it\u2019s something that, after 250,000 miles, I don\u2019t regret.\u201d \u201cI like that there is an effort to get people more environmentally conscious. I think this is an ever-growing thing and people are seeing benefits,\u201d he said. Antonio Aguirre of Aurora likewise came to the event and said \u201cit\u2019s good to inform people about how to go green. That way they can stay energy efficient.\u201d \u201cPeople can save energy for the planet. As far as green stuff I try to recycle and water less to save on that. One day, I\u2019d love to own an electric car. I love electric stuff,\u201d Aguirre said. \u201cAs far as the city of Aurora, I think they are trying to be more energy-conscious with all the roof projects and solar panels. I think that\u2019s pretty good.\u201d David Sharos is a freelance reporter for The Beacon-News.", "summary": "The 12th annual Aurora GreenFest at the Prisco Community Center and McCullough Park featured exhibits and vendors all aimed at showing ways to enhance sustainability as well as create a more energy-efficient, less wasteful lifestyle.", "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/06/09/greenfest-in-aurora-puts-focus-on-helping-the-environment/", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ABN-L-GREENFEST-0609-01-e1717868547924.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:00:57", "author": "David Sharos", "authors": ["David Sharos"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.437}

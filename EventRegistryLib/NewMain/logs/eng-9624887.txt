The Russian leader has used the annual forum as a showcase for touting Russia's development and seeking investors.\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin warned Germany on Wednesday that the use of its weapons by Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia would mark a \"dangerous step,\" and he said Moscow could in turn provide long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets.\n\nSuch action by the West will further undermine international security and could lead to \"very serious problems.\" he said.\n\n\"That would mark their direct involvement in the war against the Russian Federation, and we reserve the right to act the same way,\" Putin added.\n\nBecause using such Western weapons for striking Russian territory involves military personnel of the respective countries controlling the missiles and selecting targets, Putin said, Moscow could take \"asymmetrical\" steps. That could include giving such weapons to others to target facilities of respective countries elsewhere in the world, he added.\n\n\"If they consider it possible to deliver such weapons to the combat zone to launch strikes on our territory and create problems for us, why don't we have the right to supply weapons of the same type to some regions of the world where they can be used to launch strikes on sensitive facilities of the countries that do it to Russia?\" he said.\n\n\"We will think about it,\" he said\n\nGermany joined the United States recently in authorizing Ukraine to hit some targets on Russian soil with the long-range weapons they are supplying to Kyiv. The deliveries of German tanks to Ukraine came as a shock to many in Russia, he said.\n\n\"Now if they use missiles to strike facilities on the Russian territory, it will completely ruin Russian-German relations,\" he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Western official and a U.S. senator said Ukraine has used U.S. weapons to strike inside Russia under newly approved guidance from President Joe Biden. It allows American arms to be used for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The official was not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTaking questions from international journalists for the first time since his inauguration last month to a fifth term, Putin also said nothing will change in terms of Russia-U.S. relations regardless of whether Biden or Donald Trump wins the American presidential election in November.\n\n\"We will work with any president the American people elect,\" Putin said, speaking on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\n\n\"I say absolutely sincerely, I wouldn't say that we believe that after the election something will change on the Russian track in the American politics,\" he added. \"We don't think so. We think nothing that serious will happen.\"\n\nPutin also said Trump's felony conviction at his hush money trial last week was the result of \"the use of the court system as part of the internal political struggle.\"\n\nThe Russian leader faced questions on various topics from senior news leaders of international news agencies, including The Associated Press, although the over two years of fighting in Ukraine dominated the session.\n\nAsked about Russian military losses, Putin said that no country would reveal that information during hostilities but claimed without providing details that Ukraine's casualties are five times greater than Russia's.\n\nHe also said Ukraine has more than 1,300 Russian troops in captivity, while more than 6,400 Ukrainian soldiers are being held in Russia.\n\nThe claims could not be independently verified.\n\nPutin has used the annual forum as a showcase for touting Russia's development and seeking investors. While meetings with journalists were part of previous sessions, he has not taken questions from Western journalists at the St. Petersburg event since sending troops to Ukraine.\n\nLast year, journalists from countries that Russia regards as unfriendly -- including the U.S., the U.K. and the European Union -- were not invited, and Western officials and investors also steered clear of the

(Alexander Zholobov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)ST.

His remarks came after he warned Germany that the use of its weapons by Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia would mark a \"dangerous step.\"\u009d THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) - Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Germany on Wednesday that the use of its weapons by Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia would mark a \"dangerous step\" and ruin relations between Berlin and Moscow. Germany joined the United States recently in authorizing Ukraine to hit some targets on Russian soil with the long-range weapons they are supplying to Kyiv. The deliveries of German tanks to Ukraine came as a shock to many in Russia, he said. \"Now if they use missiles to strike facilities on the Russian territory it will completely ruin Russian-German relations,\"\u009d he said. On Wednesday, a Western official and a U.S. senator said Ukraine has used U.S. weapons to strike inside Russia under newly approved guidance from President Joe Biden. It allows American arms to be used for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The official was not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. Taking questions from international journalists for the first time since his inauguration last month to a fifth term, Putin also said nothing will change in terms of Russia-U.S. relations regardless of whether Biden or Donald Trump wins the American presidential election in November. \"We will work with any president the American people elect,\"\u009d Putin said, speaking on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. \"I say absolutely sincerely, I wouldn't say that we believe that after the election something will change on the Russian track in the American politics,\"\u009d he added. \"We don't think so. We think nothing that serious will happen.\"\u009d Putin also said Trump's felony conviction at his hush money trial last week was the result of \"the use of the court system as part of the internal political struggle.\"\u009d The Russian leader faced questions on a wide range of topics from senior news leaders of international news agencies, including The Associated Press, although the over two years of fighting in Ukraine dominated the session. Asked about Russian military losses, Putin said that no country would reveal that information during hostilities but claimed without providing details that Ukraine's casualties are five times greater than Russia's. He also said Ukraine has more than 1,300 Russian troops in captivity, while more than 6,400 Ukrainian soldiers are being held in Russia. The claims could not be independently verified. Putin has used the annual forum as a showcase for touting Russia's development and seeking investors. While meetings with journalists were part of previous sessions, he has not taken questions from Western journalists at the St. Petersburg event since sending troops to Ukraine. Last year, journalists from countries that Russia regards as unfriendly - including the U.S., the U.K. and the European Union - were not invited, and Western officials and investors also steered clear of the session after wide-ranging sanctions were imposed on Moscow over Ukraine. - - Associated Press writer Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com",

Vladimir Putin warned on Wednesday that Russia could provide long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets in response to NATO allies allowing Ukraine to use their weapons to attack Russian territory.\n\nPutin also reaffirmed Moscow's readiness to use nuclear weapons if it sees a threat to its sovereignty.\n\nThe latest actions by the West will further undermine international security and could lead to very serious problems, he said, taking questions from international journalists, something that has become extremely rare since Moscow sent troops to Ukraine.\n\nThis would mark their direct involvement in the war against the Russian Federation, and we reserve the right to act in the same way, Putin added.\n\nUnited States and Germany recently authorized Ukraine to strike some targets on Russian soil with the long-range weapons it is supplying to Kiev.\n\nWednesday, a Western official and a US senator said that Ukraine has used American weapons to strike inside Russia under the newly adopted guidelines by President Joe Biden allowing the use of US weapons for limited defense purposes Kharkiv, the second largest city of Ukraine. The official was not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nPutin asserted that the use of some Western-supplied weapons involves those countries' military personnel controlling the missiles and selecting targets, and therefore he said Moscow could take asymmetric steps elsewhere in the world.

If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible to use all the means at our disposal.\n\nEven Russian battlefield nuclear weapons are far more powerful than those used by the US against Japan in World War II, Putin said.\n\nSpeaking to senior news executives from international news agencies, including the Associated Press, for more than three hours, Putin also said nothing will change about Russia-US relations regardless of whether Biden or Donald Trump wins the election. US presidential election in November.\n\nWe will work with whatever president the American people choose, Putin said.\n\nI say absolutely honestly, I would not say that we believe that after the election something will change in the Russian way in American politics, he added. We don't think so. We think that nothing serious will happen.\n\nPutin also said Trump's felony conviction in his hush money trial last week was the result of \"using the court system as part of political infighting.\n\nThe Russian leader faced questions on a variety of topics, although more than two years of fighting in Ukraine dominated the session.\n\nPutin claimed the West had options to end the fighting in Ukraine but failed to act on them, citing a letter he allegedly once wrote to Biden in which he said hostilities could end within two or three months if Washington stopped the supply of weapons to Kiev.\n\nAsked about Russian military casualties, Putin said no country would reveal that information during hostilities, but claimed without elaborating that Ukraine's casualties are five times greater than Russia's.\n\nHe also said Ukraine has more than 1,300 Russian troops in captivity, while more than 6,400 Ukrainian soldiers are being held in Russia.\n\nThe claims could not be independently verified, and some Western estimates put Russia's losses far higher than Ukraine's.\n\nAsked by the AP about the case of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Putin said the US is taking vigorous steps to secure his release. Gershkovich was jailed over a year ago while on a reporting trip and charged with espionage. The journalist, his employer and the US have denied the charges and Washington has declared him wrongly arrested.\n\nPutin said that any such publication is not decided through the mass media, but through a measured, calm and professional approach.\n\nAnd they should certainly only be established on the basis of reciprocity, he added, hinting at a possible prisoner exchange.\n\nPutin has used it St. Petersburg Forum as a showcase for advertising Russia's development and seeking investors. The meeting with journalists took place at Gazprom's new global headquarters, an 81-story needle-shaped skyscraper overlooking the Gulf of Finland.\n\nWhile meetings with reporters were part of previous hearings, he has not taken questions from Western reporters at the St. Petersburg event since sending troops to Ukraine.\n\nLast year, journalists from countries Russia considers unfriendly, including the US, UK and European Union, were not invited, and Western officials and investors also walked out of the session after broad sanctions were imposed on Moscow over Ukraine.

The official was not authorised to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nPutin claimed that using some Western-supplied weapons involves military personnel of those countries controlling the missiles and selecting targets, and therefore he said Moscow could take \"asymmetrical\" steps elsewhere in the world. The US military said it does not control the missiles it provides to Ukraine or the targets.\n\n\"If they consider it possible to deliver such weapons to the combat zone to launch strikes on our territory and create problems for us, why don't we have the right to supply weapons of the same type to some regions of the world where they can be used to launch strikes on sensitive facilities of the countries that do it to Russia?\" he said.\n\n\"We will think about it,\" he told the journalists on the sidelines of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\n\nAsked whether Russia could resort to using nuclear arms, Putin said the conditions for utilising that arsenal are clearly spelled out in Moscow's security doctrine.\n\n\"For some reason, they believe in the West that Russia will never use it,\" he said.\n\n\"Look at what is written there,\" he said of Russia's nuclear doctrine. \"If somebody's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible to use all means at our disposal.\"\n\nEven Russia's battlefield nuclear weapons are much more powerful than what the US used against Japan in World War II, Putin said.\n\nSpeaking to senior news leaders of international news agencies, including The Associated Press, for more than three hours, Putin also said nothing will change in terms of Russia-US relations regardless of whether Biden or Donald Trump wins the American presidential election in November.\n\n\"We will work with any president the American people elect,\" Putin said.\n\n\"I say absolutely sincerely, I wouldn't say that we believe that after the election something will change on the Russian track in the American politics,\" he added. \"We don't think so. We think nothing that serious will happen.\"\n\nPutin also said Trump's felony conviction at his hush money trial last week was the result of \"the use of the court system as part of the internal political struggle.\"\n\nThe Russian leader faced questions on various topics, although the more than two years of fighting in Ukraine dominated the session.\n\nPutin claimed the West had opportunities to end the fighting in Ukraine but did not act on them, citing a letter he once supposedly wrote to Biden that said hostilities could end in two or three months if Washington stopped supplying Kyiv with weapons.\n\nAsked about Russian military losses, Putin said that no country would reveal that information during hostilities but claimed without providing details that Ukraine's casualties are five times greater than Russia's.\n\nHe also said Ukraine has more than 1,300 Russian troops in captivity, while more than 6,400 Ukrainian soldiers are being held in Russia.\n\nThe claims could not be independently verified and some Western estimates put Russia's losses much higher than Ukraine's.\n\nAsked by AP about the case of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Putin said the US is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release. Gershkovich was jailed over a year ago while on a reporting trip and charged with espionage. The journalist, his employer and the US have denied the allegations, and Washington has declared him to be wrongfully detained.\n\nPutin said that any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm and professional approach.\"\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added, an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nPutin has used the St. Petersburg forum as a showcase for touting Russia's development and seeking investors. The meeting with journalists took place in Gazprom's new global headquarters, a needle-shaped 81-story skyscraper overlooking the Gulf of Finland.\n\nWhile meetings with journalists were part of previous sessions, he has not taken questions from Western journalists at the St. Petersburg event since sending troops to Ukraine.\n\nLast year, journalists from countries that Russia regards as unfriendly -- including the US, the UK and the European Union -- were not invited, and Western officials and investors also steered clear of the session after wide-ranging sanctions were imposed on Moscow over Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki",

PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Germany on Wednesday that the use of its weapons by Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia would mark a \"dangerous step\" and ruin relations between Berlin and Moscow.\n\nGermany joined the United States recently in authorizing Ukraine to hit some targets on Russian soil with the long-range weapons they are supplying to Kyiv.\n\nThe deliveries of German tanks to Ukraine came as a shock to many in Russia, he said.\n\n\"Now if they use missiles to strike facilities on the Russian territory it will completely ruin Russian-German relations,\" he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Western official and a U.S. senator said Ukraine has used U.S. weapons to strike inside Russia under newly approved guidance from President Joe Biden. It allows American arms to be used for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The official was not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTaking questions from international journalists for the first time since his inauguration last month to a fifth term, Putin also said nothing will change in terms of Russia-U.S. relations regardless of whether Biden or Donald Trump wins the American presidential election in November.\n\n\"We will work with any president the American people elect,\" Putin said, speaking on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\n\n\"I say absolutely sincerely, I wouldn't say that we believe that after the election something will change on the Russian track in the American politics,\" he added. \"We don't think so.

In general, this is a path to very serious problems,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin did not give specifics of where he was considering delivering such missiles.\n\nPresident Joe Biden authorized Kyiv to launch some U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from striking Russia with ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron, during a visit to Kyiv on May 3, told Reuters Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by Britain to strike targets inside Russia, and it was up to Kyiv whether to do so.\n\nNUCLEAR RISK\n\nSpeaking to journalists for more than three hours at the newly built 81-floor Gazprom tower ahead of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin touched on subjects from the war in Gaza to the upcoming U.S. election.\n\n\"No one in the United States is interested in Ukraine, they are interested in the greatness of the United States, which is fighting not for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, but for its own greatness.\"\n\nPutin said Russia did not care who the next U.S. president was but said the U.S. court system was clearly being used in a political battle against Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\"They are burning themselves from the inside, their state, their political system ... It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump, especially in court on charges that were formed on the basis of events that happened years ago, without direct proof, is simply using the judicial system in an internal political struggle,\" said Putin.\n\nMore than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two, Putin is increasingly talking of the risk of a global conflict as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nWhen asked about the risk of nuclear war, Putin said Russia's nuclear doctrine allowed the use of such weapons.\n\n\"For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,\" Putin said when asked by Reuters about the risk of nuclear escalation over Ukraine during more than three hours of questioning.\n\n\"We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.\"\n\nRussia's published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat.\"\n\nNATO ATTACK?\n\nPutin casts the conflict in Ukraine as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine.\n\nPutin said the West refused to speak about the causes of the war - which he said started in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution. Putin cast it as a U.S.-backed coup.\n\nThe West describes the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and has vowed to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces.\n\nUkraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from the areas of Ukraine they control and which Moscow now considers to be parts of Russia.\n\nWestern leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia's warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia but have repeatedly warned Putin might attack a member of NATO, the world's most powerful military alliance.\n\nBoth Putin and Biden have said that a direct conflict between Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, and U.S.-led NATO would be a step towards World War Three.\n\n\"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You're only hurting yourself with this, you know?\" Putin said.\n\n\"They thought that Russia wanted to attack NATO. Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know? Total rubbish.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "guy_faulconbridge@newsmax.com", "name": "Guy Faulconbridge", "type": "author",

He emphasized Russia's nuclear capabilities and criticized NATO's stance on the conflict.Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he could deploy conventional missiles within striking distance of the United States and its European allies if they allowed Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia with long-range Western weapons.\n\nPutin, in his first face-to-face meeting with senior editors of international news agencies since the war in Ukraine began, said the West was wrong to assume Russia would never use nuclear weapons, and said the Kremlin's nuclear doctrine should not be taken lightly.\n\nWhen asked about NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg's calls to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike Russian territory, Putin differentiated between different missiles but warned allowing Kyiv to strike Russia with ever more powerful weapons was a serious escalation that was drawing the West towards a war with Russia.\n\nRussia's response, the 71-year-old Kremlin chief said, would be to shoot down the Western missiles, and specifically mentioned U.S. ATACMS, and British and French missile systems.\n\nPutin also said Moscow was considering deploying similar high-technology, long-range missiles close enough to strike the states that allowed Ukraine to strike Russian territory with such missiles.\n\n\"If we see that these countries are being drawn into a war against the Russian Federation, then we reserve the right to act in the same way. In general, this is a path to very serious problems,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin did not give specifics of where he was considering delivering such missiles.\n\nPresident Joe Biden authorized Kyiv to launch some U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from striking Russia with ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron, during a visit to Kyiv on May 3, told Reuters Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by Britain to strike targets inside Russia, and it was up to Kyiv whether to do so.\n\nNUCLEAR RISK\n\nSpeaking to journalists for more than three hours at the newly built 81-floor Gazprom tower ahead of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin touched on subjects from the war in Gaza to the upcoming U.S. election.\n\n\"No one in the United States is interested in Ukraine, they are interested in the greatness of the United States, which is fighting not for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, but for its own greatness.\"\n\nPutin said Russia did not care who the next U.S. president was but said the U.S. court system was clearly being used in a political battle against Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\"They are burning themselves from the inside, their state, their political system ... It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump, especially in court on charges that were formed on the basis of events that happened years ago, without direct proof, is simply using the judicial system in an internal political struggle,\" said Putin.\n\nMore than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two, Putin is increasingly talking of the risk of a global conflict as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nWhen asked about the risk of nuclear war, Putin said Russia's nuclear doctrine allowed the use of such weapons.\n\n\"For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,\" Putin said when asked by Reuters about the risk of nuclear escalation over Ukraine during more than three hours of questioning.\n\n\"We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.\"\n\nRussia's published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat.\"\n\nNATO ATTACK?\n\nPutin casts the conflict in Ukraine as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine.\n\nPutin said the West refused to speak about the causes of the war - which he said started in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution. Putin cast it as a U.S.-backed coup.\n\nThe West describes the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and has vowed to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces.\n\nUkraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from the areas of Ukraine they control and which Moscow now considers to be parts of Russia.\n\nWestern leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia's warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia but have repeatedly warned Putin might attack a member of NATO, the world's most powerful military alliance.\n\nBoth Putin and Biden have said that a direct conflict between Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, and U.S.-led NATO would be a step towards World War Three.\n\n\"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You're only hurting yourself with this, you know?\" Putin said.\n\n\"They thought that Russia wanted to attack NATO. Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know? Total rubbish.\"", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type":

The deliveries of German tanks to Ukraine came as a shock to many in Russia, he said.\n\n\u201cNow if they use missiles to strike facilities on the Russian territory, it will completely ruin Russian-German relations,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Western official and a US senator said Ukraine has used American weapons to strike inside Russia under newly approved guidance from US President Joe Biden.\n\nIt allows American arms to be used for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city. The official was not authorised to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTaking questions from international journalists for the first time since his inauguration last month to a fifth term, Putin also said nothing will change in terms of Russia-US relations regardless of whether Biden or Donald Trump wins the American presidential election in November.\n\n\u201cWe will work with any president the American people elect,\u201d Putin said, speaking on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum.\n\n\u201cI say absolutely sincerely, I wouldn\u2019t say that we believe that after the election something will change on the Russian track in the American politics,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t think so.

While meetings with journalists were part of previous sessions, he has not taken questions from Western journalists at the St. Petersburg event since sending troops to Ukraine.\n\nLast year, journalists from countries that Russia regards as unfriendly \u2013 including the US, the UK and the European Union \u2013 were not invited, and Western officials and investors also steered clear of the session after wide-ranging sanctions were imposed on Moscow over Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saint Petersburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Petersburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/02/03/Clean-thumb.jpg?itok=Tn3qc6XJ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624887", "eventUri": "eng-9624887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

NUCLEAR RISK\n\nSpeaking to journalists for more than three hours at the newly built 81-floor Gazprom tower ahead of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin touched on subjects from the war in Gaza to the upcoming U.S. election. \"No one in the United States is interested in Ukraine, they are interested in the greatness of the United States, which is fighting not for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, but for its own greatness.\"\n\nPutin said Russia did not care who the next U.S. president was but said the U.S. court system was clearly being used in a political battle against Republican nominee Donald Trump. \"They are burning themselves from the inside, their state, their political system ... It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump, especially in court on charges that were formed on the basis of events that happened years ago, without direct proof, is simply using the judicial system in an internal political struggle,\" said Putin.\n\nMore than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two, Putin is increasingly talking of the risk of a global conflict as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine. When asked about the risk of nuclear war, Putin said Russia's nuclear doctrine allowed the use of such weapons.\n\n\"For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,\" Putin said when asked by Reuters about the risk of nuclear escalation over Ukraine during more than three hours of questioning. \"We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.\"\n\nRussia's published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat.\" NATO ATTACK?\n\nPutin casts the conflict in Ukraine as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine. Putin said the West refused to speak about the causes of the war - which he said started in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution. Putin cast it as a U.S.-backed coup.\n\nThe West describes the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and has vowed to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces. Ukraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from the areas of Ukraine they control and which Moscow now considers to be parts of Russia.\n\nWestern leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia's warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia but have repeatedly warned Putin might attack a member of NATO, the world's most powerful military alliance. Both Putin and Biden have said that a direct conflict between Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, and U.S.-led NATO would be a step towards World War Three.\n\n\"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You're only hurting yourself with this, you know?\" Putin said. \"They thought that Russia wanted to attack NATO. Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know? Total rubbish.\" (Additional reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Andrew Osborn and Lincoln Feast.)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

The official was not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nPutin claimed that using some Western-supplied weapons involves military personnel of those countries controlling the missiles and selecting targets, and therefore he said Moscow could take \"asymmetrical\" steps elsewhere in the world. The U.S. military said it does not control the missiles it provides to Ukraine or the targets.\n\n\"If they consider it possible to deliver such weapons to the combat zone to launch strikes on our territory and create problems for us, why don't we have the right to supply weapons of the same type to some regions of the world where they can be used to launch strikes on sensitive facilities of the countries that do it to Russia?\" he said.\n\n\"We will think about it,\" he told the journalists on the sidelines of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\n\nAsked whether Russia could resort to using nuclear arms, Putin said the conditions for utilizing that arsenal are clearly spelled out in Moscow's security doctrine.\n\n\"For some reason, they believe in the West that Russia will never use it,\" he said.\n\n\"Look at what is written there,\" he said of Russia's nuclear doctrine. \"If somebody's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible to use all means at our disposal.\"\n\nEven Russia's battlefield nuclear weapons are much more powerful than what the U.S. used against Japan in World War II, Putin said.\n\nSpeaking to senior news leaders of international news agencies, including The Associated Press, for more than three hours, Putin also said nothing will change in terms of Russia-U.S. relations regardless of whether Biden or Donald Trump wins the American presidential election in November.\n\n\"We will work with any president the American people elect,\" Putin said.\n\n\"I say absolutely sincerely, I wouldn't say that we believe that after the election something will change on the Russian track in the American politics,\" he added. \"We don't think so. We think nothing that serious will happen.\"\n\nPutin also said Trump's felony conviction at his hush money trial last week was the result of \"the use of the court system as part of the internal political struggle.\"\n\nThe Russian leader faced questions on various topics, although the more than two years of fighting in Ukraine dominated the session.\n\nPutin claimed the West had opportunities to end the fighting in Ukraine but did not act on them, citing a letter he once supposedly wrote to Biden that said hostilities could end in two or three months if Washington stopped supplying Kyiv with weapons.\n\nAsked about Russian military losses, Putin said that no country would reveal that information during hostilities but claimed without providing details that Ukraine's casualties are five times greater than Russia's.\n\nHe also said Ukraine has more than 1,300 Russian troops in captivity, while more than 6,400 Ukrainian soldiers are being held in Russia.\n\nThe claims could not be independently verified and some Western estimates put Russia's losses much higher than Ukraine's.\n\nAsked by AP about the case of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Putin said the U.S. is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release. Gershkovich was jailed over a year ago while on a reporting trip and charged with espionage. The journalist, his employer and the U.S. have denied the allegations, and Washington has declared him to be wrongfully detained.\n\nPutin said that any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm and professional approach.\"\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added, an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nPutin has used the St. Petersburg forum as a showcase for touting Russia's development and seeking investors. The meeting with journalists took place in Gazprom's new global headquarters, a needle-shaped 81-story skyscraper overlooking the Gulf of Finland.\n\nWhile meetings with journalists were part of previous sessions, he has not taken questions from Western journalists at the St. Petersburg event since sending troops to Ukraine.\n\nLast year, journalists from countries that Russia regards as unfriendly -- including the U.S., the U.K. and the European Union -- were not invited, and Western officials and investors also steered clear of the session after wide-ranging sanctions were imposed on Moscow over Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type":

In general, this is a path to very serious problems,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin did not give specifics of where he was considering delivering such missiles.\n\nPresident Joe Biden authorized Kyiv to launch some U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from striking Russia with ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron, during a visit to Kyiv on May 3, told Reuters Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by Britain to strike targets inside Russia, and it was up to Kyiv whether to do so.\n\nNUCLEAR RISK\n\nSpeaking to journalists for more than three hours at the newly built 81-floor Gazprom tower ahead of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin touched on subjects from the war in Gaza to the upcoming U.S. election.\n\n\"No one in the United States is interested in Ukraine, they are interested in the greatness of the United States, which is fighting not for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, but for its own greatness.\"\n\nPutin said Russia did not care who the next U.S. president was but said the U.S. court system was clearly being used in a political battle against Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\"They are burning themselves from the inside, their state, their political system ...

In general, this is a path to very serious problems,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin did not give specifics of where he was considering delivering such missiles.\n\nPresident Joe Biden authorized Kyiv to launch some U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from striking Russia with ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron, during a visit to Kyiv on May 3, told Reuters Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by Britain to strike targets inside Russia, and it was up to Kyiv whether to do so.\n\nNUCLEAR RISK\n\nSpeaking to journalists for more than three hours at the newly built 81-floor Gazprom tower ahead of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin touched on subjects from the war in Gaza to the upcoming U.S. election.\n\n\"No one in the United States is interested in Ukraine, they are interested in the greatness of the United States, which is fighting not for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, but for its own greatness.\"\n\nPutin said Russia did not care who the next U.S. president was but said the U.S. court system was clearly being used in a political battle against Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\"They are burning themselves from the inside, their state, their political system ... It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump, especially in court on charges that were formed on the basis of events that happened years ago, without direct proof, is simply using the judicial system in an internal political struggle,\" said Putin.\n\nMore than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two, Putin is increasingly talking of the risk of a global conflict as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nWhen asked about the risk of nuclear war, Putin said Russia's nuclear doctrine allowed the use of such weapons.\n\n\"For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,\" Putin said when asked by Reuters about the risk of nuclear escalation over Ukraine during more than three hours of questioning.\n\n\"We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.\"\n\nRussia's published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat.\"\n\nNATO ATTACK?\n\nPutin casts the conflict in Ukraine as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine.\n\nPutin said the West refused to speak about the causes of the war - which he said started in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution. Putin cast it as a U.S.-backed coup.\n\nThe West describes the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and has vowed to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces.\n\nUkraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from the areas of Ukraine they control and which Moscow now considers to be parts of Russia.\n\nWestern leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia's warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia but have repeatedly warned Putin might attack a member of NATO, the world's most powerful military alliance.\n\nBoth Putin and Biden have said that a direct conflict between Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, and U.S.-led NATO would be a step towards World War Three.\n\n\"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy.

The official was not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nPutin claimed that using some Western-supplied weapons involves military personnel of those countries controlling the missiles and selecting targets, and therefore he said Moscow could take \"asymmetrical\" steps elsewhere in the world. The U.S. military said it does not control the missiles it provides to Ukraine or the targets.\n\n\"If they consider it possible to deliver such weapons to the combat zone to launch strikes on our territory and create problems for us, why don't we have the right to supply weapons of the same type to some regions of the world where they can be used to launch strikes on sensitive facilities of the countries that do it to Russia?\" he said.\n\n\"We will think about it,\" he told the journalists on the sidelines of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\n\nAsked whether Russia could resort to using nuclear arms, Putin said the conditions for utilizing that arsenal are clearly spelled out in Moscow's security doctrine.\n\n\"For some reason, they believe in the West that Russia will never use it,\" he said.\n\n\"Look at what is written there,\" he said of Russia's nuclear doctrine. \"If somebody's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible to use all means at our disposal.\"\n\nEven Russia's battlefield nuclear weapons are much more powerful than what the U.S. used against Japan in World War II, Putin said.\n\nSpeaking to senior news leaders of international news agencies, including The Associated Press, for more than three hours, Putin also said nothing will change in terms of Russia-U.S. relations regardless of whether Biden or Donald Trump wins the American presidential election in November.\n\n\"We will work with any president the American people elect,\" Putin said.\n\n\"I say absolutely sincerely, I wouldn't say that we believe that after the election something will change on the Russian track in the American politics,\" he added. \"We don't think so. We think nothing that serious will happen.\"\n\nPutin also said Trump's felony conviction at his hush money trial last week was the result of \"the use of the court system as part of the internal political struggle.\"\n\nThe Russian leader faced questions on various topics, although the more than two years of fighting in Ukraine dominated the session.\n\nPutin claimed the West had opportunities to end the fighting in Ukraine but did not act on them, citing a letter he once supposedly wrote to Biden that said hostilities could end in two or three months if Washington stopped supplying Kyiv with weapons.\n\nAsked about Russian military losses, Putin said that no country would reveal that information during hostilities but claimed without providing details that Ukraine's casualties are five times greater than Russia's.\n\nHe also said Ukraine has more than 1,300 Russian troops in captivity, while more than 6,400 Ukrainian soldiers are being held in Russia.\n\nThe claims could not be independently verified and some Western estimates put Russia's losses much higher than Ukraine's.\n\nAsked by AP about the case of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Putin said the U.S. is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release. Gershkovich was jailed over a year ago while on a reporting trip and charged with espionage. The journalist, his employer and the U.S. have denied the allegations, and Washington has declared him to be wrongfully detained.\n\nPutin said that any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm and professional approach.\"\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added, an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nPutin has used the St. Petersburg forum as a showcase for touting Russia's development and seeking investors. The meeting with journalists took place in Gazprom's new global headquarters, a needle-shaped 81-story skyscraper overlooking the Gulf of Finland.\n\nWhile meetings with journalists were part of previous sessions, he has not taken questions from Western journalists at the St. Petersburg event since sending troops to Ukraine.\n\nLast year, journalists from countries that Russia regards as unfriendly -- including the U.S., the U.K. and the European Union -- were not invited, and Western officials and investors also steered clear of the session after wide-ranging sanctions were imposed on Moscow over Ukraine.\n\nMilestone Alert!

(Alexander Zholobov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) - Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Germany on Wednesday that the use of its weapons by Ukraine to strike targets in Russia would mark a \"dangerous step\" and ruin relations between Berlin and Moscow. Germany joined the United States recently in authorizing Ukraine to hit some targets on Russian soil with the long-range weapons they are supplying to Kyiv. The deliveries of German tanks to Ukraine came as a shock to many in Russia, he said. \"Now if they use missiles to strike facilities on the Russian territory it will completely ruin Russian-German relations,\"\u009d he said. Taking questions from international journalists for the first time since his inauguration last month to a fifth term, Putin also said nothing will change in terms of Russia-U.S. relations regardless of whether Joe Biden or Donald Trump wins the American presidential election in November. \"We will work with any president the American people elect,\"\u009d Putin said, speaking on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. \"I say absolutely sincerely, I wouldn't say that we believe that after the election something will change on the Russian track in the American politics,\"\u009d he added. \"We don't think so. We think nothing that serious will happen.\"\u009d Putin also said Trump's felony conviction at his hush money trial last week was the result of \"the use of the court system as part of the internal political struggle.\"\u009d The Russian leader faced questions from senior news leaders of international news agencies, including The Associated Press. Putin has used the annual forum as a showcase for touting Russia's development and seeking investors. While meetings with journalists were part of previous sessions, he has not taken questions from Western journalists at the St. Petersburg event since sending troops to Ukraine. Last year, journalists from countries that Russia regards as unfriendly - including the U.S., the U.K. and the European Union - were not invited, and Western officials and investors also steered clear of the session after wide-ranging sanctions were imposed on Moscow over Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

While meetings with journalists were part of previous sessions, he has not taken questions from Western journalists at the St. Petersburg event since sending troops to Ukraine.\n\nLast year, journalists from countries that Russia regards as unfriendly -- including the U.S., the U.K. and the European Union -- were not invited, and Western officials and investors also steered clear of the session after wide-ranging sanctions were imposed on Moscow over Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "oneidadispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneida Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@oneidadispatch.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saint Petersburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Petersburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_International_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg International Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.oneidadispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Russia_Putin_68250.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624887", "eventUri": "eng-9624887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

In a recent discussion with international editors, he emphasized the increasing risk of nuclear war and criticized the West's handling of the Ukraine conflict.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he could deploy conventional missiles within striking distance of the United States and its European allies if they allowed Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia with long-range Western weapons. Putin, in his first face-to-face meeting with senior editors of international news agencies since the war in Ukraine began, said the West was wrong to assume Russia would never use nuclear weapons, and said the Kremlin's nuclear doctrine should not be taken lightly.\n\nWhen asked about NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg's calls to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike Russian territory, Putin differentiated between different missiles but warned allowing Kyiv to strike Russia with ever more powerful weapons was a serious escalation that was drawing the West towards a war with Russia. Russia's response, the 71-year-old Kremlin chief said, would be to shoot down the Western missiles, and specifically mentioned U.S. ATACMS, and British and French missile systems.\n\nPutin also said Moscow was considering deploying similar high-technology, long-range missiles close enough to strike the states that allowed Ukraine to strike Russian territory with such missiles. \"If we see that these countries are being drawn into a war against the Russian Federation, then we reserve the right to act in the same way. In general, this is a path to very serious problems,\" Putin said.\n\nHe spoke to journalists for more than three hours at the newly built 81-floor Gazprom tower ahead of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Putin did not give specifics of where he was considering delivering such missiles.\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and the Kremlin has repeatedly warned the risk of a global war is rising. President Joe Biden authorized Kyiv to launch some U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from striking Russia with ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron, during a visit to Kyiv on May 3, told Reuters Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by Britain to strike targets inside Russia, and it was up to Kyiv whether to do so. NUCLEAR RISK\n\nMore than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two, Putin is increasingly talking of the risk of a global conflict as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine. When asked about the risk of nuclear war, Putin said Russia's nuclear doctrine allowed the use of such weapons.\n\n\"For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,\" Putin said when asked by Reuters about the risk of nuclear escalation over Ukraine during more than three hours of questioning. \"We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.\"\n\nRussia's published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat.\" Putin dismissed Western assertions that Russia has employed nuclear sabre rattling and pointed out the U.S. was the only country to have used nuclear weapons in war - attacking the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nNATO ATTACK? Putin casts the war as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine.\n\nPutin said the West refused to speak about the causes of the war - which he said started in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution. Putin cast it as a U.S.-backed coup. The West describes the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and has vowed to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces.\n\nUkraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from the areas of Ukraine they control and which Moscow now considers to be parts of Russia. Western leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia's warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia but have repeatedly warned Putin might attack a member of NATO, the world's most powerful military alliance.\n\nBoth Putin and Biden have said that a direct conflict between Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, and U.S.-led NATO would be a step towards World War Three. \"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You're only hurting yourself with this, you know?\" Putin said.\n\n\"They thought that Russia wanted to attack NATO. Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know? Total rubbish.\" (Additional reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Andrew Osborn and Lincoln Feast.)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

The official was not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nPutin claimed that using some Western-supplied weapons involves military personnel of those countries controlling the missiles and selecting targets, and therefore he said Moscow could take \"asymmetrical\" steps elsewhere in the world. The US military said it does not control the missiles it provides to Ukraine or the targets.\n\n\"If they consider it possible to deliver such weapons to the combat zone to launch strikes on our territory and create problems for us, why don't we have the right to supply weapons of the same type to some regions of the world where they can be used to launch strikes on sensitive facilities of the countries that do it to Russia?\" he said.\n\n\"We will think about it,\" he told the journalists on the sidelines of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\n\nAsked whether Russia could resort to using nuclear arms, Putin said the conditions for utilizing that arsenal are clearly spelled out in Moscow's security doctrine.\n\n\"For some reason, they believe in the West that Russia will never use it,\" he said.\n\n\"Look at what is written there,\" he said of Russia's nuclear doctrine. \"If somebody's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible to use all means at our disposal.\"\n\nEven Russia's battlefield nuclear weapons are much more powerful than what the United States used against Japan in World War II, Putin said.\n\nSpeaking to senior news leaders of international news agencies for more than three hours, Putin also said nothing will change in terms of Russia-US relations regardless of whether Biden or Donald Trump wins the American presidential election in November.\n\n\"We will work with any president the American people elect,\" Putin said.\n\n\"I say absolutely sincerely, I wouldn't say that we believe that after the election something will change on the Russian track in the American politics,\" he added. \"We don't think so.

Gershkovich was jailed more than a year ago while on a reporting trip and charged with espionage. The journalist, his employer, and the United States have denied the allegations, and Washington has declared him to be wrongfully detained.\n\nPutin said that any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm, and professional approach.\"\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added, an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nPutin has used the St. Petersburg forum as a showcase for touting Russia's development and seeking investors.

In general, this is a path to very serious problems,\" Putin said.\n\nHe spoke to journalists for more than three hours at the newly built 81-floor Gazprom tower ahead of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\n\nPutin did not give specifics of where he was considering delivering such missiles.\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and the Kremlin has repeatedly warned the risk of a global war is rising.\n\nPresident Joe Biden authorized Kyiv to launch some U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from striking Russia with ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron, during a visit to Kyiv on May 3, told Reuters Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by Britain to strike targets inside Russia, and it was up to Kyiv whether to do so.\n\nNUCLEAR RISK\n\nMore than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two, Putin is increasingly talking of the risk of a global conflict as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nWhen asked about the risk of nuclear war, Putin said Russia's nuclear doctrine allowed the use of such weapons.\n\n\"For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,\" Putin said when asked by Reuters about the risk of nuclear escalation over Ukraine during more than three hours of questioning.\n\n\"We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.\"\n\nRussia's published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat.\"\n\nPutin dismissed Western assertions that Russia has employed nuclear sabre rattling and pointed out the U.S. was the only country to have used nuclear weapons in war - attacking the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nNATO ATTACK?\n\nPutin casts the war as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine.\n\nPutin said the West refused to speak about the causes of the war - which he said started in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution. Putin cast it as a U.S.-backed coup.\n\nThe West describes the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and has vowed to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces.\n\nUkraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from the areas of Ukraine they control and which Moscow now considers to be parts of Russia.\n\nWestern leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia's warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia but have repeatedly warned Putin might attack a member of NATO, the world's most powerful military alliance.\n\nBoth Putin and Biden have said that a direct conflict between Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, and U.S.-led NATO would be a step towards World War Three.\n\n\"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You're only hurting yourself with this, you know?\" Putin said.\n\n\"They thought that Russia wanted to attack NATO. Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know? Total rubbish.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Andrew Osborn and Lincoln Feast.)", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"},

We will think about it,\" he told reporters.\n\nBut the 71-year-old Kremlin chief dismissed as \"bollocks\" suggestions Russia planned to attack NATO members.\n\n\"There is no need to look for some imperial ambitions of ours. There are none,\" he said.\n\nPutin warned that Western arms deliveries to Ukraine were \"a very negative step,\" saying that donors were \"controlling\" the weapons.\n\nThe Russian leader singled out Germany for particular criticism, saying that when the first German-supplied tanks \"appeared on Ukrainian soil, it provoked a moral and ethical shock in Russia\" because of the legacy of World War II.\n\nReferring to German authorities, he said: \"When they say that there will be more missiles which will hit targets on Russian territory, this definitively destroys Russian-German relations.\"\n\nSitting opposite representatives from news outlets including AFP, Putin repeated that his country \"did not start the war against Ukraine,\" instead blaming a pro-Western revolution in 2014.\n\n\"Everyone thinks that Russia started the war in Ukraine. I would like to emphasize that nobody in the West, in Europe, wants to remember how this tragedy started,\" Putin said.\n\nHe declined to give the number of Russia's battlefield losses in the more than two-year conflict, saying only that Ukraine's were five times higher.\n\n\"I can tell you that as a rule, no one talks about it,\" Putin rebuffed, when asked why Russia had not yet disclosed a figure.\n\n\"If we talk about irrecoverable losses, the ratio is one to five,\" he said.\n\nThe issue of military casualties is extremely sensitive in Russia, where all criticism of the conflict is banned and \"spreading false information\" about the army carries a maximum 15 year jail sentence.\n\nWhen asked about the killing of AFP video journalist Arman Soldin in Ukraine last year, likely as a result of Russian rocket fire, Putin indicated Moscow was ready to help investigate.\n\n\"We will do everything in our power,\" he said.\n\n\"We are ready to do this work. I do not know how it could be done in practice since this person died in a warzone.\"\n\nPutin was also probed about what a victory for former US President Donald Trump or incumbent Joe Biden would mean for US-Russia relations -- an issue the Russian leader shrugged off.\n\n\"By and large there's no difference,\" he said.\n\nHowever he called Trump's recent criminal charges for business fraud politically motivated, arguing his conviction \"burned\" the idea that Washington was a leading democracy.\n\n\"It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump... is simply the utilization of the judicial system during an internal political struggle,\" Putin said.\n\n\"Their supposed leadership in the sphere of democracy is being burned to the ground,\" the Russian leader added.\n\nTrump became the first former US head of state ever convicted of a crime last week after a New York jury found him guilty of 34 felony charges in a hush money case.\n\nTrump, who faces an election in November that could see him return to the White House, has praised Putin as a \"smart guy.\"\n\nPutin also said Russia and the United States were in \"constant contact\" over a possible prisoner exchange that would free jailed US journalist Evan Gershkovich who was arrested on espionage charges last year.\n\n\"The relevant services in the US and Russia are in constant contact with one another and of course they will decide only on the basis of reciprocity,\" Putin said.", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.\"\n\nRussia's published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat.\"\n\nPutin dismissed Western assertions that Russia has employed nuclear sabre rattling and pointed out that the United States was the only country to have used nuclear weapons in war - attacking the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nMISSILES\n\nPutin warned that Western decisions to allow Ukraine to use ever more powerful Western missiles to strike into Russian territory was a serious escalation, and said that such weapons would have to be guided by Western systems and personnel.\n\nPresident Joe Biden authorized Kyiv to launch U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia, but Washington still prohibits Kyiv from striking Russia with ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons.\n\nAsked about the Western decisions, Putin differentiated between different weapons but said that the use of ATACMS or British Storm Shadow missiles against Russia could lead to a tougher response from Moscow.\n\n\"We will improve our air defence systems and destroy them,\" Putin said.\n\n\"Secondly, we are thinking that if someone thinks it possible to send such weapons to a war zone to strike our territory and create problems for us, then why do we not have the right to send our weapons of the same class to those regions of the world where strikes can be made on sensitive facilities of the countries that do this against Russia. That is to say, the response can be asymmetric.\"\n\n\"If we see that these countries are being drawn into a war against the Russian Federation, then we reserve the right to act in the same way. In general, this is a path to very serious problems.\"\n\nPutin casts the war as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine.\n\nPutin said the West refused to speak about the causes of the war - which he said started in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution. Putin cast it as a coup backed by the United States.\n\nThe West dismisses Putin's analysis of the conflict, and casts the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and has vowed to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces.\n\nUkraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from the areas of Ukraine they control - and which Russia now considers to be parts of Russia.\n\nMore than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two, Russia's leader is increasingly talking of the risk of a global war as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nWestern leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia's warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, but have repeatedly warned that Putin might attack a member of NATO, the world's most powerful military alliance led by the United States.\n\nBoth Putin and Biden have said that a direct conflict between Russia and NATO would be a step towards World War Three.\n\n\"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You're only hurting yourself with this, you know?\" Putin said.\n\n\"They thought that Russia wanted to attack NATO. Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know? Total rubbish.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Andrew Osborn)", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We will think about it,\" he told reporters.\n\nBut the 71-year-old Kremlin chief dismissed as \"bollocks\" suggestions Russia planned to attack NATO members.\n\n\"There is no need to look for some imperial ambitions of ours. There are none,\" he said.\n\nPutin warned that Western arms deliveries to Ukraine were \"a very negative step\", saying that donors were \"controlling\" the weapons.\n\nThe Russian leader singled out Germany for particular criticism, saying that when the first German-supplied tanks \"appeared on Ukrainian soil, it provoked a moral and ethical shock in Russia\" because of the legacy of World War II.\n\nReferring to German authorities, he said: \"When they say that there will be more missiles which will hit targets on Russian territory, this definitively destroys Russian-German relations.\"\n\n- 'Irrecoverable losses' -\n\nSitting opposite representatives from news outlets including AFP, Putin repeated that his country \"did not start the war against Ukraine\", instead blaming a pro-Western revolution in 2014.\n\n\"Everyone thinks that Russia started the war in Ukraine. I would like to emphasise that nobody in the West, in Europe, wants to remember how this tragedy started,\" Putin said.\n\nHe declined to give the number of Russia's battlefield losses in the more than two-year conflict, saying only that Ukraine's were five times higher.\n\nPutin told the media outlets Russia had no \"imperial\" ambitions\n\n\"I can tell you that as a rule, no one talks about it,\" Putin rebuffed, when asked why Russia had not yet disclosed a figure.\n\n\"If we talk about irrecoverable losses, the ratio is one to five,\" he said.\n\nThe issue of military casualties is extremely sensitive in Russia, where all criticism of the conflict is banned and \"spreading false information\" about the army carries a maximum 15 year jail sentence.\n\nWhen asked about the killing of AFP video journalist Arman Soldin in Ukraine last year, likely as a result of Russian rocket fire, Putin indicated Moscow was ready to help investigate.\n\n\"We will do everything in our power,\" he said.\n\n\"We are ready to do this work. I do not know how it could be done in practice since this person died in a warzone.\"\n\n- 'Burned to the ground' -\n\nPutin was also probed about what a victory for former US President Donald Trump or incumbent Joe Biden would mean for US-Russia relations -- an issue the Russian leader shrugged off.\n\n\"By and large there's no difference,\" he said.\n\nHowever he called Trump's recent criminal charges for business fraud politically motivated, arguing his conviction \"burned\" the idea that Washington was a leading democracy.\n\n\"It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump... is simply the utilisation of the judicial system during an internal political struggle,\" Putin said.\n\nRussia has criticised Western arms supplies to Ukraine, arguing they only 'prolong' the conflict\n\n\"Their supposed leadership in the sphere of democracy is being burned to the ground,\" the Russian leader added.\n\nTrump became the first former US head of state ever convicted of a crime last week after a New York jury found him guilty of 34 felony charges in a hush money case.\n\nTrump, who faces an election in November that could see him return to the White House, has praised Putin as a \"smart guy\".\n\nPutin also said Russia and the United States were in \"constant contact\" over a possible prisoner exchange that would free jailed US journalist Evan Gershkovich who was arrested on espionage charges last year.\n\n\"The relevant services in the US and Russia are in constant contact with one another and of course they will decide only on the basis of reciprocity,\" Putin said.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type":

If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.\"\n\nRussia's published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat.\"\n\nPutin dismissed Western assertions that Russia has employed nuclear sabre rattling and pointed out that the United States was the only country to have used nuclear weapons in war - attacking the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nMISSILES\n\nPutin warned that Western decisions to allow Ukraine to use ever more powerful Western missiles to strike into Russian territory was a serious escalation, and said that such weapons would have to be guided by Western systems and personnel.\n\nPresident Joe Biden authorized Kyiv to launch U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia, but Washington still prohibits Kyiv from striking Russia with ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons.\n\nAsked about the Western decisions, Putin differentiated between different weapons but said that the use of ATACMS or British Storm Shadow missiles against Russia could lead to a tougher response from Moscow.\n\n\"We will improve our air defence systems and destroy them,\" Putin said.\n\n\"Secondly, we are thinking that if someone thinks it possible to send such weapons to a war zone to strike our territory and create problems for us, then why do we not have the right to send our weapons of the same class to those regions of the world where strikes can be made on sensitive facilities of the countries that do this against Russia. That is to say, the response can be asymmetric.\"\n\n\"If we see that these countries are being drawn into a war against the Russian Federation, then we reserve the right to act in the same way. In general, this is a path to very serious problems.\"\n\nPutin casts the war as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine.\n\nPutin said the West refused to speak about the causes of the war - which he said started in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution. Putin cast it as a coup backed by the United States.\n\nThe West dismisses Putin's analysis of the conflict, and casts the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and has vowed to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces.\n\nUkraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from the areas of Ukraine they control - and which Russia now considers to be parts of Russia.\n\nMore than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two, Russia's leader is increasingly talking of the risk of a global war as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nWestern leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia's warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, but have repeatedly warned that Putin might attack a member of NATO, the world's most powerful military alliance led by the United States.\n\nBoth Putin and Biden have said that a direct conflict between Russia and NATO would be a step towards World War Three.\n\n\"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You're only hurting yourself with this, you know?\" Putin said.\n\n\"They thought that Russia wanted to attack NATO. Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know?

We will think about it,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"Delivering arms to a war zone is always bad. Even more so if those who are delivering are not just delivering weapons but also controlling them. This is a very serious and very dangerous step,\" Putin said.\n\nThe Russian leader singled out Germany, saying that when the first German-supplied tanks \"appeared on Ukrainian soil, it provoked a moral and ethical shock in Russia\" because of the legacy of World War II.\n\nReferring to German authorities, he said: \"When they say that there will be more missiles which will hit targets on Russian territory, this definitively destroys Russian-German relations.\"\n\nSitting opposite representatives from news outlets including AFP, Putin repeated that his country \"did not start the war against Ukraine\", instead blaming a pro-Western revolution in 2014.\n\n\"Everyone thinks that Russia started the war in Ukraine. I would like to emphasize that nobody in the West, in Europe, wants to remember how this tragedy started,\" Putin said.\n\nHe declined to give the number of Russia's battlefield losses in the more than two-year conflict, saying only that Ukraine's were five times higher.\n\n\"I can tell you that as a rule, no one talks about it,\" Putin said, when asked why Russia had not yet disclosed a figure. \"If we talk about irrecoverable losses, the ratio is one to five.\"\n\nThe issue of military casualties is extremely sensitive in Russia, where all criticism of the conflict is banned and \"spreading false information\" about the army carries a maximum 15 year jail sentence.\n\nWhen asked about the killing of AFP video journalist Arman Soldin in Ukraine last year, likely as a result of Russian rocket fire, Putin indicated Moscow was ready to help investigate.\n\n\"We will do everything in our power,\" he said. \"We are ready to do this work. I do not know how it could be done in practice since this person died in a war zone.\"\n\nPutin was also asked about what a victory for former U.S. President Donald Trump or incumbent Joe Biden would mean for U.S.-Russia relations -- an issue the Russian leader shrugged off.\n\n\"By and large there's no difference,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he called Trump's recent criminal charges for business fraud politically motivated, arguing his conviction \"burned\" the idea that Washington was a leading democracy.\n\n\"It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump... is simply the utilization of the judicial system during an internal political struggle,\" Putin said.\n\n\"Their supposed leadership in the sphere of democracy is being burned to the ground,\" the Russian leader added.\n\nTrump became the first former U.S. head of state ever convicted of a crime last week after a New York jury found him guilty of 34 felony charges in a hush money case.\n\nTrump, who faces an election in November that could see him return to the White House, has praised Putin as a \"smart guy\".\n\nPutin also said Russia and the United States were in \"constant contact\" over a possible prisoner exchange that would free jailed U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich who was arrested on espionage charges last year.\n\n\"The relevant services in the U.S. and Russia are in constant contact with one another and of course they will decide only on the basis of reciprocity,\" Putin said.\n\n\u00a9 2024 AFP", "source": {"uri": "japantoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Japan Today"},

He warned against escalating arms supplies to Ukraine, hinting at possible asymmetric responses and noting the significant risks of global conflict.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that the West was wrong to assume that Moscow would never use nuclear weapons and said that he was considering deploying conventional missiles in striking distance of the United States and its allies.\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis - and the Kremlin has repeatedly warned that the risk of a global war is rising. Putin, speaking face-to-face to senior editors of\n\ninternational news agencies for the first time since the war in Ukraine began, dismissed Western claims that Russia could attack NATO as \"stupid\", citing the military strength of the alliance.\n\nBut when asked about the risk of nuclear war, the 71-year-old Kremlin chief said that Russia's nuclear doctrine did allow the use of such weapons if the country's territorial integrity or sovereignty was threatened. \"For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,\" Putin said when asked by Reuters about the risk of nuclear escalation over Ukraine during more than three hours of questioning.\n\n\"We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.\" Russia's published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat.\"\n\nPutin dismissed Western assertions that Russia has employed nuclear sabre rattling and pointed out that the United States was the only country to have used nuclear weapons in war - attacking the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. MISSILES\n\nPutin warned that Western decisions to allow Ukraine to use ever more powerful Western missiles to strike into Russian territory was a serious escalation, and said that such weapons would have to be guided by Western systems and personnel. President Joe Biden authorized Kyiv\n\nto launch U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia, but Washington still prohibits Kyiv from striking Russia with ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons. Asked about the Western decisions, Putin differentiated between different weapons but said that the use of ATACMS or British Storm Shadow missiles against Russia could lead to a tougher response from Moscow.\n\n\"We will improve our air defence systems and destroy them,\" Putin said. \"Secondly, we are thinking that if someone thinks it possible to send such weapons to a war zone to strike our territory and create problems for us, then why do we not have the right to send our weapons of the same class to those regions of the world where strikes can be made on sensitive facilities of the countries that do this against Russia. That is to say, the response can be asymmetric.\"\n\n\"If we see that these countries are being drawn into a war against the Russian Federation, then we reserve the right to act in the same way. In general, this is a path to very serious problems.\" Putin casts the war as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine.\n\nPutin said the West refused to speak about the causes of the war - which he said started in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution. Putin cast it as a coup backed by the United States. The West dismisses Putin's analysis of the conflict, and casts the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and has vowed to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces.\n\nUkraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from the areas of Ukraine they control - and which Russia now considers to be parts of Russia. More than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two, Russia's leader is increasingly talking of the risk of a global war as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nWestern leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia's warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, but have repeatedly warned that Putin might attack a member of NATO, the world's most powerful military alliance led by the United States. Both Putin and Biden have said that a direct conflict between Russia and NATO would be a step towards World War Three.\n\n\"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You're only hurting yourself with this, you know?\" Putin said. \"They thought that Russia wanted to attack NATO. Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know? Total rubbish.\" (Additional reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Andrew Osborn)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

We will think about it,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"Delivering arms to a warzone is always bad. Even more so if those who are delivering are not just delivering weapons but also controlling them. This is a very serious and very dangerous step,\" Putin said.\n\nThe Russian leader singled out Germany, saying that when the first German-supplied tanks \"appeared on Ukrainian soil, it provoked a moral and ethical shock in Russia\" because of the legacy of World War II.\n\nReferring to German authorities, he said: \"When they say that there will be more missiles which will hit targets on Russian territory, this definitively destroys Russian-German relations.\"\n\nSitting opposite representatives from news outlets including AFP, Putin repeated that his country \"did not start the war against Ukraine\", instead blaming a pro-Western revolution in 2014.\n\n\"Everyone thinks that Russia started the war in Ukraine. I would like to emphasise that nobody in the West, in Europe, wants to remember how this tragedy started,\" Putin said.\n\nHe declined to give the number of Russia\u00b4s battlefield losses in the more than two-year conflict, saying only that Ukraine\u00b4s were five times higher.\n\n\"I can tell you that as a rule, no one talks about it,\" Putin said, when asked why Russia had not yet disclosed a figure. \"If we talk about irrecoverable losses, the ratio is one to five,\" he said.\n\nThe issue of military casualties is extremely sensitive in Russia, where all criticism of the conflict is banned and \"spreading false information\" about the army carries a maximum 15 year jail sentence.\n\nWhen asked about the killing of AFP video journalist Arman Soldin in Ukraine last year, likely as a result of Russian rocket fire, Putin indicated Moscow was ready to help investigate.\n\n\"We will do everything in our power,\" he said.\n\n\"We are ready to do this work. I do not know how it could be done in practice since this person died in a warzone.\"\n\nPutin was also probed about what a victory for former US President Donald Trump or incumbent Joe Biden would mean for US-Russia relations -- an issue the Russian leader shrugged off. \"By and large there\u00b4s no difference,\" he said.\n\nHowever he called Trump\u00b4s recent criminal charges for business fraud politically motivated, arguing his conviction \"burned\" the idea that Washington was a leading democracy.\n\n\"It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump... is simply the utilisation of the judicial system during an internal political struggle,\" Putin said. \"Their supposed leadership in the sphere of democracy is being burned to the ground,\" the Russian leader added.\n\nPutin also said Russia and the United States were in \"constant contact\" over a possible prisoner exchange that would free jailed US journalist Evan Gershkovich who was arrested on espionage charges last year.\n\n\"The relevant services in the US and Russia are in constant contact with one another and of course they will decide only on the basis of reciprocity,\" Putin said.",

In general, this is a path to very serious problems.\"\n\nPutin casts the war as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine.\n\nPutin said the West refused to speak about the causes of the war - which he said started in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution. Putin cast it as a coup backed by the United States.\n\nThe West dismisses Putin's analysis of the conflict, and casts the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and has vowed to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces.\n\nUkraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from the areas of Ukraine they control - and which Russia now considers to be parts of Russia.\n\nMore than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two, Russia's leader is increasingly talking of the risk of a global war as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nWestern leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia's warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, but have repeatedly warned that Putin might attack a member of NATO, the world's most powerful military alliance led by the United States.\n\nBoth Putin and Biden have said that a direct conflict between Russia and NATO would be a step towards World War Three.\n\n\"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You're only hurting yourself with this, you know?\" Putin said.\n\n\"They thought that Russia wanted to attack NATO. Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know? Total rubbish.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Andrew Osborn)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

utilisation of the judicial system during an internal political struggle,\" Putin said.\n\n\"Their supposed leadership in the sphere of democracy is being burned to the ground,\" the Russian leader

election in November that could see him return to the White House, has praised Putin as a \"smart guy\".\n\nPutin also said Russia and the United States were in \"constant contact\" over a possible

We will think about it,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"Delivering arms to a warzone is always bad. Even more so if those who are delivering are not just delivering weapons but also controlling them. This is a very serious and very dangerous step,\" Putin said.\n\nThe Russian leader singled out Germany, saying that when the first German-supplied tanks \"appeared on Ukrainian soil, it provoked a moral and ethical shock in Russia\" because of the legacy of World War II.\n\nReferring to German authorities, he said: \"When they say that there will be more missiles which will hit targets on Russian territory, this definitively destroys Russian-German relations.\"\n\n- 'Irrecoverable losses' -\n\nSitting opposite representatives from news outlets including AFP, Putin repeated that his country \"did not start the war against Ukraine\", instead blaming a pro-Western revolution in 2014.\n\n\"Everyone thinks that Russia started the war in Ukraine. I would like to emphasise that nobody in the West, in Europe, wants to remember how this tragedy started,\" Putin said.\n\nHe declined to give the number of Russia's battlefield losses in the more than two-year conflict, saying only that Ukraine's were five times higher.\n\n\"I can tell you that as a rule, no one talks about it,\" Putin said, when asked why Russia had not yet disclosed a figure.\n\n\"If we talk about irrecoverable losses, the ratio is one to five,\" he said.\n\nThe issue of military casualties is extremely sensitive in Russia, where all criticism of the conflict is banned and \"spreading false information\" about the army carries a maximum 15 year jail sentence.\n\nWhen asked about the killing of AFP video journalist Arman Soldin in Ukraine last year, likely as a result of Russian rocket fire, Putin indicated Moscow was ready to help investigate.\n\n\"We will do everything in our power,\" he said.\n\n\"We are ready to do this work. I do not know how it could be done in practice since this person died in a warzone.\"\n\n- 'Burned to the ground' -\n\nPutin was also probed about what a victory for former US President Donald Trump or incumbent Joe Biden would mean for US-Russia relations -- an issue the Russian leader shrugged off.\n\n\"By and large there's no difference,\" he said.\n\nHowever he called Trump's recent criminal charges for business fraud politically motivated, arguing his conviction \"burned\" the idea that Washington was a leading democracy.\n\n\"It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump... is simply the utilisation of the judicial system during an internal political struggle,\" Putin said.\n\n\"Their supposed leadership in the sphere of democracy is being burned to the ground,\" the Russian leader added.\n\nTrump became the first former US head of state ever convicted of a crime last week after a New York jury found him guilty of 34 felony charges in a hush money case.\n\nTrump, who faces an election in November that could see him return to the White House, has praised Putin as a \"smart guy\".\n\nPutin also said Russia and the United States were in \"constant contact\" over a possible prisoner exchange that would free jailed US journalist Evan Gershkovich who was arrested on espionage charges last year.\n\n\"The relevant services in the US and Russia are in constant contact with one another and of course they will decide only on the basis of reciprocity,\" Putin said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

Germany announced a similar change in policy shortly afterward.\n\nThe changes followed pleas from Ukraine to allow its forces to defend itself against attacks originating from Russian territory, and after pressure from some European leaders.\n\nRussia in recent weeks has stepped up strikes on civilian targets in the northeastern region of Kharkiv and in the eastern region of Donetsk.\n\nPutin warned that Western arms deliveries to Ukraine were \"a very dangerous step,\" especially if donors are \"controlling\" use of the weapons.\n\nHe specifically warned Germany, saying that talk of it sending missiles capable of hitting targets on Russian territory \"definitively destroys Russian-German relations.\"\n\nOn the use of nuclear weapons, Putin cited Russia's nuclear doctrine, which says if Russia's sovereignty and territorial integrity is threatened \"we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal.\"\n\nPutin also reiterated his claim that Russia \"did not start the war,\" blaming a pro-Western revolution in 2014.\n\nPutin has falsely claimed that months of massive and mostly peaceful protests that began in 2013 and lasted into early 2014 on Kyiv's Maidan Square were a U.S.-backed coup.

This is a very serious and very dangerous step,\" Putin said.\n\nThe Russian leader singled out Germany, saying that when the first German-supplied tanks \"appeared on Ukrainian soil, it provoked a moral and ethical shock in Russia\" because of the legacy of World War II.\n\nReferring to German authorities, he said: \"When they say that there will be more missiles which will hit targets on Russian territory, this definitively destroys Russian-German relations.\"\n\n- 'Irrecoverable losses' -\n\nSitting opposite representatives from news outlets including AFP, Putin repeated that his country \"did not start the war against Ukraine\", instead blaming a pro-Western revolution in 2014.\n\n\"Everyone thinks that Russia started the war in Ukraine. I would like to emphasise that nobody in the West, in Europe, wants to remember how this tragedy started,\" Putin said.\n\nHe declined to give the number of Russia's battlefield losses in the more than two-year conflict, saying only that Ukraine's were five times higher.\n\n\"I can tell you that as a rule, no one talks about it,\" Putin said, when asked why Russia had not yet disclosed a figure.\n\n\"If we talk about irrecoverable losses, the ratio is one to five,\" he said.\n\nThe issue of military casualties is extremely sensitive in Russia, where all criticism of the conflict is banned and \"spreading false information\" about the army carries a maximum 15 year jail sentence.\n\nMore from this section be Well: Information to keep your feet looking and feeling good this summer Very Early Menopause Could Raise Odds for Breast, Ovarian Cancers Lok Sabha Election Results 2024: BJP Workers Celebrate At Headquarters In Delhi | Exclusive Video\n\nWhen asked about the killing of AFP video journalist Arman Soldin in Ukraine last year, likely as a result of Russian rocket fire, Putin indicated Moscow was ready to help investigate.\n\n\"We will do everything in our power,\" he said.\n\n\"We are ready to do this work. I do not know how it could be done in practice since this person died in a warzone.\"\n\n- 'Burned to the ground' -\n\nPutin was also probed about what a victory for former US President Donald Trump or incumbent Joe Biden would mean for US-Russia relations -- an issue the Russian leader shrugged off.\n\n\"By and large there's no difference,\" he said.\n\nHowever he called Trump's recent criminal charges for business fraud politically motivated, arguing his conviction \"burned\" the idea that Washington was a leading democracy.\n\n\"It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump... is simply the utilisation of the judicial system during an internal political struggle,\" Putin said.\n\n\"Their supposed leadership in the sphere of democracy is being burned to the ground,\" the Russian leader added.\n\nTrump became the first former US head of state ever convicted of a crime last week after a New York jury found him guilty of 34 felony charges in a hush money case.\n\nTrump, who faces an election in November that could see him return to the White House, has praised Putin as a \"smart guy\".\n\nPutin also said Russia and the United States were in \"constant contact\" over a possible prisoner exchange that would free jailed US journalist Evan Gershkovich who was arrested on espionage charges last year.\n\n\"The relevant services in the US and Russia are in constant contact with one another and of course they will decide only on the basis of reciprocity,\" Putin said.\n\nbur-kat/rox", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Look what it says. If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.\"\n\nPutin also took the opportunity once again to brush aside fears that Russia could attack countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n\n\"You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You're only hurting yourself with this, you know?\" Putin said at the news conference.\n\nArticle 5 of the treaty establishes that an attack against one country in the organisation is considered an attack against all members.\n\nPutin has repeatedly dismissed the idea of launching an attack on NATO, despite tensions with its member states.\n\nBut Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told CBS News earlier this year that Putin's \"aggression\" could reach Europe, prompting a NATO response. And in April, Germany's top military leader said \"an attack against NATO soil could be possible\" in five to eight years.\n\nStill, Putin reiterated his stance on Wednesday. \"They thought that Russia wanted to attack NATO,\" he said. \"Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know? Total rubbish.\"\n\nHowever, Putin also hinted at the possibility of heightened tensions - and even \"asymmetrical\" military steps - if Western countries like Germany and the United States were to supply Ukraine with weapons used on Russian soil.\n\nHe explained that the use of certain weapons, including the use of advanced missile technology, would be tantamount to participation in Russia's war with Ukraine.\n\n\"That would mark their direct involvement in the war against the Russian Federation, and we reserve the right to act the same way,\" he said.\n\n\"If they consider it possible to deliver such weapons to the combat zone to launch strikes on our territory and create problems for us, why don't we have the right to supply weapons of the same type to some regions of the world where they can be used to launch strikes on sensitive facilities of the countries that do it to Russia?\"\n\nHis remarks came after Germany decided in January to supply Leopard 2A6 battle tanks to Ukraine. And last month, both Germany and the US agreed to allow Ukraine to use certain missiles to hit targets inside Russia.\n\nThe Associated Press reported earlier on Wednesday that Ukraine has indeed used US weapons to strike within Russia, though Washington restricts which arms can be used.\n\nAdvanced weapons like the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and other long-range missiles remain off-limits.\n\nAsked about the prospect of a wider range of Western missiles being approved for Ukraine's use in Russia, Putin was defiant: \"We will improve our air defence systems and destroy them.\"", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki",

We will think about it,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"Delivering arms to a warzone is always bad. Even more so if those who are delivering are not just delivering weapons but also controlling them. This is a very serious and very dangerous step,\" Putin said.\n\nThe Russian leader singled out Germany, saying that when the first German-supplied tanks \"appeared on Ukrainian soil, it provoked a moral and ethical shock in Russia\" because of the legacy of World War II.\n\nReferring to German authorities, he said: \"When they say that there will be more missiles which will hit targets on Russian territory, this definitively destroys Russian-German relations.\"\n\n- 'Irrecoverable losses' -\n\nSitting opposite representatives from news outlets including AFP, Putin repeated that his country \"did not start the war against Ukraine\", instead blaming a pro-Western revolution in 2014.\n\n\"Everyone thinks that Russia started the war in Ukraine. I would like to emphasise that nobody in the West, in Europe, wants to remember how this tragedy started,\" Putin said.\n\nHe declined to give the number of Russia's battlefield losses in the more than two-year conflict, saying only that Ukraine's were five times higher.\n\n\"I can tell you that as a rule, no one talks about it,\" Putin said, when asked why Russia had not yet disclosed a figure.\n\n\"If we talk about irrecoverable losses, the ratio is one to five,\" he said.\n\nThe issue of military casualties is extremely sensitive in Russia, where all criticism of the conflict is banned and \"spreading false information\" about the army carries a maximum 15 year jail sentence.\n\nWhen asked about the killing of AFP video journalist Arman Soldin in Ukraine last year, likely as a result of Russian rocket fire, Putin indicated Moscow was ready to help investigate.\n\n\"We will do everything in our power,\" he said.\n\n\"We are ready to do this work. I do not know how it could be done in practice since this person died in a warzone.\"\n\n- 'Burned to the ground' -\n\nPutin was also probed about what a victory for former US President Donald Trump or incumbent Joe Biden would mean for US-Russia relations -- an issue the Russian leader shrugged off.\n\n\"By and large there's no difference,\" he said.\n\nHowever he called Trump's recent criminal charges for business fraud politically motivated, arguing his conviction \"burned\" the idea that Washington was a leading democracy.\n\n\"It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump... is simply the utilisation of the judicial system during an internal political struggle,\" Putin said.\n\n\"Their supposed leadership in the sphere of democracy is being burned to the ground,\" the Russian leader added.\n\nTrump became the first former US head of state ever convicted of a crime last week after a New York jury found him guilty of 34 felony charges in a hush money case.\n\nTrump, who faces an election in November that could see him return to the White House, has praised Putin as a \"smart guy\".\n\nPutin also said Russia and the United States were in \"constant contact\" over a possible prisoner exchange that would free jailed US journalist Evan Gershkovich who was arrested on espionage charges last year.\n\n\"The relevant services in the US and Russia are in constant contact with one another and of course they will decide only on the basis of reciprocity,\" Putin said.\n\nbur-kat/rox\n\nMore from this section\n\nMontana US Sen.

In general, this is a path to very serious problems,\" Putin said.\n\nHe spoke to journalists for more than three hours at the newly built 81-floor Gazprom tower ahead of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\n\nPutin did not give specifics of where he was considering delivering such missiles.\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and the Kremlin has repeatedly warned the risk of a global war is rising.\n\nUS President Joe Biden authorised Kyiv to launch some US-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from striking Russia with ATACMS, which have a range of up to 300km, and other long-range US-supplied weapons.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron, during a visit to Kyiv on May 3, told Reuters Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by Britain to strike targets inside Russia, and it was up to Kyiv whether to do so.\n\nMore than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War II, Putin is increasingly talking of the risk of a global conflict as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nWhen asked about the risk of nuclear war, Putin said Russia's nuclear doctrine allowed the use of such weapons.\n\n\"For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,\" Putin said when asked by Reuters about the risk of nuclear escalation over Ukraine during more than three hours of questioning.\n\n\"We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.\"\n\nRussia's published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat.\"\n\nPutin dismissed Western assertions that Russia has employed nuclear sabre rattling and pointed out the US was the only country to have used nuclear weapons in war - attacking the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type":

In April it was reported that US long-range ballistic missiles had already been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory.\n\nDespite his remarks on Wednesday, Mr Putin angrily insisted it was \"absolute nonsense\" to suggest Russia wanted to attack Nato, telling a journalist: \"Don't form an image of Russia as an enemy. You are only hurting yourselves with this, do you understand? You have made up that Russia wants to attack Nato. Have you completely lost your mind? Are you as thick as this table?\"\n\nAnd he insisted that Russia \"does not care\" who wins the upcoming US election - claiming that Moscow believes \"nothing serious\" will change in Washington's policy towards Russia regardless of whether either Joe Biden or Donald Trump is re-elected.\n\nBut he conceded it was \"hard to say\" whether a second Trump presidency could change the situation in Ukraine, adding: \"I can't make a definite conclusion as to whether something will change or not. One has to look at the priorities of the future administration.\n\n\"No one in the United States is interested in Ukraine, they are interested in the greatness of the United States, which is fighting not for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, but for its own greatness. But if the future administration will change its goal-setting vector ... then something may change.\"\n\nSpeaking as Alexei Navalny ally Ilya Yashin lost an appeal against his bogus designation as a \"foreign agent\", the Russian president remarked on Mr Trump's recent hush money conviction by claiming the US was \"burning themselves from the inside, their state, their political system\".\n\nHe added: \"It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump, especially in court on charges that were formed on the basis of events that happened years ago, without direct proof, is simply using the judicial system in an internal political struggle.\"\n\nAsked about Russia's detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich - one of many journalists to fall foul of Moscow's brutal crackdown on information in the wake of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Mr Putin said: \"I know that the United States administration is indeed taking vigorous steps for his release.\n\n\"But such issues are not resolved through the media. They love a quiet, peaceful, professional approach and dialogue between intelligence agencies. Of course, they should only be resolved on the basis of reciprocity.

I would like to emphasise that nobody in the West, in Europe, wants to remember how this tragedy started,\" Putin said.\n\nHe declined to give the number of Russia's battlefield losses in the more than two-year conflict, saying only that Ukraine's were five times higher.\n\n\"I can tell you that as a rule, no one talks about it,\" Putin said, when asked why Russia had not yet disclosed a figure.\n\n\"If we talk about irrecoverable losses, the ratio is one to five,\" he said.\n\nThe issue of military casualties is extremely sensitive in Russia, where all criticism of the conflict is banned and \"spreading false information\" about the army carries a maximum 15 year jail sentence.\n\nWhen asked about the killing of AFP video journalist Arman Soldin in Ukraine last year, likely as a result of Russian rocket fire, Putin indicated Moscow was ready to help investigate.\n\n\"We will do everything in our power,\" he said.\n\n\"We are ready to do this work. I do not know how it could be done in practice since this person died in a warzone.\"\n\nPutin was also probed about what a victory for former US President Donald Trump or incumbent Joe Biden would mean for US-Russia relations -- an issue the Russian leader shrugged off.\n\n\"By and large there's no difference,\" he said.\n\nHowever he called Trump's recent criminal charges for business fraud politically motivated, arguing his conviction \"burned\" the idea that Washington was a leading democracy.\n\n\"It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump... is simply the utilisation of the judicial system during an internal political struggle,\" Putin said.\n\n\"Their supposed leadership in the sphere of democracy is being burned to the ground,\" the Russian leader added.\n\nTrump became the first former US head of state ever convicted of a crime last week after a New York jury found him guilty of 34 felony charges in a hush money case.\n\nTrump, who faces an election in November that could see him return to the White House, has praised Putin as a \"smart guy\".\n\nPutin also said Russia and the United States were in \"constant contact\" over a possible prisoner exchange that would free jailed US journalist Evan Gershkovich who was arrested on espionage charges last year.\n\n\"The relevant services in the US and Russia are in constant contact with one another and of course they will decide only on the basis of reciprocity,\" Putin said.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

In April it was reported that US long-range ballistic missiles had already been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory.\n\nDespite his remarks on Wednesday, Mr Putin angrily insisted it was \"absolute nonsense\" to suggest Russia wanted to attack Nato, telling a journalist: \"Don't form an image of Russia as an enemy. You are only hurting yourselves with this, do you understand? You have made up that Russia wants to attack Nato. Have you completely lost your mind? Are you as thick as this table?\"\n\nAnd he insisted that Russia \"does not care\" who wins the upcoming US election - claiming that Moscow believes \"nothing serious\" will change in Washington's policy towards Russia regardless of whether either Joe Biden or Donald Trump is re-elected.\n\nBut he conceded it was \"hard to say\" whether a second Trump presidency could change the situation in Ukraine, adding: \"I can't make a definite conclusion as to whether something will change or not. One has to look at the priorities of the future administration.\n\n\"No one in the United States is interested in Ukraine, they are interested in the greatness of the United States, which is fighting not for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, but for its own greatness. But if the future administration will change its goal-setting vector ... then something may change.\"\n\nSpeaking as Alexei Navalny ally Ilya Yashin lost an appeal against his bogus designation as a \"foreign agent\", the Russian president remarked on Mr Trump's recent hush money conviction by claiming the US was \"burning themselves from the inside, their state, their political system\".\n\nHe added: \"It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump, especially in court on charges that were formed on the basis of events that happened years ago, without direct proof, is simply using the judicial system in an internal political struggle.\"\n\nAsked about Russia's detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich - one of many journalists to fall foul of Moscow's brutal crackdown on information in the wake of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Mr Putin said: \"I know that the United States administration is indeed taking vigorous steps for his release.\n\n\"But such issues are not resolved through the media. They love a quiet, peaceful, professional approach and dialogue between intelligence agencies. Of course, they should only be resolved on the basis of reciprocity. The relevant US and Russian agencies are in contact with each other on this issue.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [],

Will he?\n\nFor the first time since President Joe Biden gave them permission to do so, Ukrainian soldiers have fired an American-supplied weapon at a target inside Russia. Will Russian President Vladimir Putin respond by escalating or widening the war? Probably not. If any officials fear he might, they aren't saying so.\n\nYet until now, Biden had forbidden Ukraine from taking this step out of concern that doing so might cross a \"red line,\" pushing Putin to launch missiles against a NATO country's territory or even to fire off a tactical nuclear weapon.\n\nWhy did Biden let go of his worries? Was he wise to do so? If he was, should he have dropped them long ago? Does Putin really have any \"red lines,\" or is he -- has he always been -- bluffing? Have Biden and other Western leaders been too cautious? Should they now drop all restrictions and let the Ukrainians fire away at will with everything they've got?\n\nIt should first be clarified that Biden's order does not give Ukrainians carte blanche. It doesn't allow them to fire Western-supplied weapons at any and all targets inside Russia. Rather, it lets them do so only at sites from which Russia has launched missiles into northeastern Ukraine, mainly in and around Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city.\n\nFor some time now, Ukraine has been firing its own weapons, mainly drones, at targets inside Russia. Biden has denied any association with those strikes, neither condemning nor condoning them. However, few would dispute Ukraine's right to return fire against missiles launched against its territory from inside Russia. So, what's the distinction? Why has it been permissible (or at least not-impermissible) for Ukraine to hit Russia with its own weapons -- but not to do so with weapons supplied by the U.S. or other NATO countries?\n\nFrom the start of this war (at least from when the U.S. started to send Ukraine billions of dollars' worth of weapons in response to Putin's invasion in February 2024), Biden has drawn a very solid red line against sending American or NATO armed forces to fight the war directly. Doing so, he said several times, would mean the start of World War III -- and, vital as it was to help Ukraine stave off Russian aggression, it wasn't vital enough to risk a global conflict quite that cataclysmic.\n\nFrom that moment of Biden's commitment to aid Ukraine with caveats, Western leaders, advisers, and commentators debated, publicly and behind closed doors, just how large those caveats should be. Exactly where were Putin's putative \"red lines\"? Inserting U.S. troops (boots on the ground or pilots in the air) would clearly cross those lines, would mark a declaration of war -- but what other forms of intervention might also set Putin off? For a while, Biden and other Western leaders refused to send Ukraine the most modern tanks or advanced fighter planes or long-range missiles -- concerned that Putin would see even these acts as NATO involvement in the war and respond accordingly. Gradually, these limits were relaxed or dropped -- first came the tanks, then the planes (a few of them anyway), then the long-range missiles (at first with strict limits on how they could be used, then those limits were relaxed as well).\n\nWhatever history's verdict may turn out to be, Biden and the other Western leaders had reasons to impose those limits at the time. Putin was threatening to respond to these acts of escalation by launching tactical nuclear weapons. His army held exercises rehearsing their use. Maybe he was bluffing, but nobody could be sure. Launching nukes would be crazy and self-destructive, but who could tell whether that was enough to deter Putin? (Many, including me, doubted he would invade all of Ukraine, in part because it too seemed crazy and self-destructive.) That's the thing about nuclear deterrence: It works both ways. (Russia is deterred from attacking us, but we're also deterred from doing things that might seem like an attack on Russia's vital interests.)\n\nIn any case, the strategic situation has now changed. When Biden and other leaders first put limits on what kinds of weapons to send Ukraine, or on how Ukraine should use them, the concern was that Putin might widen or escalate the war if it seemed that Ukraine was about to win. (There were times in the war's first year, after Ukraine repelled the Russian invaders and pushed them back, when people thought this might be possible.)\n\nNow, however, the concern is that without these more advanced weapons and more permissive rules about using them, Ukraine might lose. In other words, there are now competing risks -- the risk that letting Ukraine fire NATO-supplied weapons into Russia might spur Russia to step up the violence versus the risk that not letting them fire the weapons might allow Russia to win, with all the resulting geopolitical calamities.\n\nAs has been widely reported, until the House of Representatives finally passed the spending bill for more military aid in April, Ukraine was running short of artillery shells, air-defense missiles, even basic ammunition. (I was recently told by a military adviser to NATO that at one point, for a couple of weeks, Ukraine's army had no stockpiles in reserves; it had only the shells stored on the front lines.) Even now, as the bullets and shells are flowing in once again, Ukraine has very few weapons that have the range to reach -- and thus neutralize -- firing positions inside Russia.\n\nAt this moment, the first risk, the risk that motivated the restrictive policy until recently, is no longer compelling. One might imagine Putin launching missiles against Poland (as a transit point for NATO weapons into Ukraine) or firing off a few tactical nukes (to shock and awe the West into halting the war before it careened out of control) if he thought he was about to lose. But it's hard to imagine him taking such extreme action if Russian troops were merely losing the slight, steady momentum they'd been gaining in the past few months and the war were settling back into a grinding stalemate. (This is the most that Biden's new relaxed rules would allow Ukraine to accomplish -- to hobble Russia's offensive capabilities and buy some time.)\n\nFinally, there is America's 2024 presidential election to consider. If Donald Trump wins back the White House, Putin stands to rake home all the chips. Trump told Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n (so Orb\u00e1n subsequently said) that his plan to end the war quickly was to cut off all aid to Ukraine -- in other words, to let Putin win. However, if Putin has meanwhile attacked a NATO country (spurring all the other NATO members to respond under the treaty's Article 5, which says an attack on one is an attack on all) or fired off nuclear weapons (breaking the \"nuclear taboo\" in place since 1945), then even Trump might have a hard time letting that man in the Kremlin have his way.\n\nThere have been moments when a president's allergy to escalation has been salutary -- and other moments when it has been lamentable. In 1962, John F. Kennedy rejected the Joint Chiefs' plan (which almost all of his advisers supported) to attack the Soviet missiles in Cuba and invade the island, in part because he thought the Soviets would respond by grabbing West Berlin. Instead, he negotiated a secret mutual withdrawal of Soviet missiles from Cuba and U.S. missiles from Turkey. A good thing, since, as we later learned, some of those Soviet missiles were loaded with nuclear warheads and 40,000 Soviet troops were hidden on the island to stave off a possible U.S. invasion. JFK's reticence may well have prevented WWIII.\n\nBy contrast, in 2014, Barack Obama rejected the urgings by his advisers (including Vice President Joe Biden) to send Ukraine anti-tank missiles after Putin annexed Crimea and made his first incursion into eastern Ukraine -- because, as Obama put it in a National Security Council meeting, Ukraine mattered more to Russia than it did to us, so Russia would match anything we did militarily, plus some. It is possible that Putin thought he could get away with invading all of Ukraine in 2022 because he got away with invading a chunk of it in 2014. If some of Russia's earlier invaders had been \"sent home in body bags,\" as Veep Biden and others said was necessary at the time, would Putin have later altered his risk-benefit calculus?\n\nHistory seems clear in the rearview mirror. Sometimes, though, the events aren't at all clear as they're unfolding. It wasn't clear at the time whether Kennedy was right in not attacking the Soviet missiles, or whether Obama was right in not sending anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. (The top advisers to both presidents thought at the time that they were wrong.)\n\nBiden's restrictions of the past two years may be seen as too much, or just right, with the passage of time. Right now, though, we're living in a rare moment when the decision to relax those restrictions seems to be an unequivocally good idea: when the benefits of doing so are high and the risks of dangerous escalation -- while not zero -- are very low.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fred_kaplan@slate.com", "name": "Fred Kaplan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declaration of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deterrence theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tank_guided_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-tank guided missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cuban Missile Crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Hungary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Hungary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

(Alexander Zholobov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that nothing will change in terms of Russia-U.S. relations regardless of whether Joe Biden or Donald Trump wins the American presidential election in November. \"We will work with any president the American people elect,\"\u009d Putin said, responding to questions from international journalists on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. \"I say absolutely sincerely, I wouldn't say that we believe that after the election something will change on the Russian track in the American politics,\"\u009d he added. \"We don't think so. We think nothing that serious will happen.\"\u009d Trump's felony conviction at his hush money trial last week was the result of \"political infighting,\"\u009d Putin added. The Russian leader faced questions for the first time since his inauguration to a fifth term from senior news leaders of international news agencies, including The Associated Press.

He said he replied, \"If you want to stop the hostilities in Ukraine, stop supplying the weapons. Then, in two to three months, everything will be over.\"\n\nPutin made his comments as escalating Western military aid to Ukraine threatens to widen the conflict. US lawmakers approved an additional $61 billion in aid to Kiev in April, after Biden's administration had burned through $113 billion in previously passed spending bills. Putin suggested that as the US and its allies give Kiev long-range munitions targeting Russian territory, Moscow could respond by supplying similar weaponry to foreign parties that might use them to strike Ukraine's backers.\n\nWashington is Ukraine's largest Western supplier, by far. Biden is seeking reelection later this year in a race with Republican challenger Donald Trump, who has pledged to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict within 24 hours by forcing leaders of both countries to the bargaining table.\n\nAsked how a Trump victory in November might affect US policy in Ukraine, Putin said it would depend on whether the new administration prioritizes the interests of its own people, rather than the destructive forces of \"global liberalism.\"\n\n\"If they are guided by national interests, then there may be some changes in foreign policy in relation to Russia and in relation to the conflict in Ukraine,\" Putin said.\n\nHowever, the Russian president added that US leaders aren't driven by real concern over Ukraine's fate. \"No one is interested in Ukraine in the United States,\" he told journalists. \"They are interested in the greatness of the United States. They are not fighting for Ukraine; they are fighting for their leadership in the world. They do not want Russia to be successful, to prevail, because they think it will be damaging for the leadership of the United States.\"\n\nOnly if the next administration in Washington abandons such a framework and instead seeks to strengthen the US will there be a chance for major policy changes, Putin said. \"It all depends, in our view, on the moods that prevail in society.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_International_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg International Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Petersburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Petersburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/rtc1717625631.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624887", "eventUri": "eng-9624887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to reconsider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend

international law Ukraine can and should attack Russia.\n\nWith foreign minister Espen Barth Eide even saying Norway would allow them to hit parts of Russia as part of their self defence.\n\nIt comes as Putin threatened all-out war earlier this week if Ukraine was to use weapons supplied by the West.\n\nHe singled out Nato allies saying \"constant escalation can lead to serious

He said he replied, \"If you want to stop the hostilities in Ukraine, stop supplying the weapons. Then, in two to three months, everything will be over.\"\n\nPutin made his comments as escalating Western military aid to Ukraine threatens to widen the conflict. US lawmakers approved an additional $61 billion in aid to Kiev in April, after Biden's administration had burned through $113 billion in previously passed spending bills. Putin suggested that as the US and its allies give Kiev long-range munitions targeting Russian territory, Moscow could respond by supplying similar weaponry to foreign parties that might use them to strike Ukraine's backers.\n\nWashington is Ukraine's largest Western supplier, by far. Biden is seeking reelection later this year in a race with Republican challenger Donald Trump, who has pledged to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict within 24 hours by forcing leaders of both countries to the bargaining table.\n\nAsked how a Trump victory in November might affect US policy in Ukraine, Putin said it would depend on whether the new administration prioritizes the interests of its own people, rather than the destructive forces of \"global liberalism.\"\n\n\"If they are guided by national interests, then there may be some changes in foreign policy in relation to Russia and in relation to the conflict in Ukraine,\" Putin said.\n\nHowever, the Russian president added that US leaders aren't driven by real concern over Ukraine's fate. \"No one is interested in Ukraine in the United States,\" he told journalists. \"They are interested in the greatness of the United States. They are not fighting for Ukraine; they are fighting for their leadership in the world. They do not want Russia to be successful, to prevail, because they think it will be damaging for the leadership of the United States.\"\n\nOnly if the next administration in Washington abandons such a framework and instead seeks to strengthen the US will there be a chance for major policy changes, Putin said. \"It all depends, in our view, on the moods that prevail in society.\"", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rt@rt.com", "name": "RT", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_International_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg International Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Post-Soviet states"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RT (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Petersburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Petersburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.06/article/6660d92485f54069ed3e965f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624887", "eventUri": "eng-9624887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

U.S. weapons stockpiles, especially regarding air defense and finite offensive capabilities such as Army Tactical Missile Systems, must also be closely monitored to avoid depletion. This is a key concern vis-a-vis the growing risk of war with China.\n\nStill, contrary to the Kremlin's propaganda, allowing Ukraine to use Western weapons against Russian military targets does not cross Russian red lines. It does not do so for the same two reasons that allowed NATO to avoid direct war with the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\n\nFirst, Russian President Vladimir Putin knows he and not the West sparked the current escalation. Putin did so by launching an offensive against Ukraine's northeastern bastion city of Kharkiv. Seizing Kharkiv, Russian forces would be only 250 miles from Kyiv as the crow flies. In addition, it was Putin, not the West, who launched a sabotage campaign to blow up factories, warehouses, and military targets on NATO soil. Top line: Russia's clamor against Western escalation is unserious beyond its desire to spread fear among Western voters and bolster Russian popular support for the bloody war effort.\n\nSecond, bearing relevance to Russian nuclear brinkmanship, Putin recognizes that NATO has superior means of actually getting its nuclear warheads onto Russian targets. That is the key measure of deterrence even if Russia has more nuclear warheads in total. Yes, Russia has a number of nominally more advanced hypersonic delivery systems in service, but they are broadly untested and have been found wanting when used in conventional strikes in Ukraine.\n\nToo few Western countries appear to understand that Russia's red lines have not been crossed. Ironically, however, in so desperately, publicly, and relentlessly begging Putin to believe that they do not seek escalation, they risk encouraging Putin's belief that he can escalate unilaterally to his own advantage. The Biden administration offers the most important example of this.\n\nWhile now allowing Ukraine to use some U.S. weapons against military targets inside Russia, President Joe Biden says Ukraine can use U.S. weapons only against Russian-located targets that pose a current and imminent threat to forces surrounding Kharkiv. Ukraine still cannot use the most effective ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles inside Russia. This restriction prevents Ukrainian strikes from maximizing their potential to evade Russian air and electronic warfare defenses and quickly destroy targets of opportunity.\n\nOther European powers have adopted the same restrictions. Germany's Olaf Scholz has knelt to Russian intimidation and still won't give Ukraine the Taurus missile. He's also limiting Ukraine's use of German weapons to Kharkiv-related targets. When asked whether Ukraine could launch attacks at targets just over the Russian border from southeastern Ukraine, the German defense minister lied by saying those attacks couldn't be effective.\n\nThen there's France. Undercutting his recent leadership in support of Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron has said Ukraine can use French weapons only against Russian combat forces launching attacks on Kharkiv. This will play to enduring Western perceptions that Macron is an ultimately unreliable security partner. And Belgium, one of NATO's most egregious freeloaders, says the F-16s it provides won't be able to operate in Russian airspace.\n\nNot everyone is so unduly hesitant. Poland and the Baltics place no restrictions on their weapon supplies. Similarly, Denmark and the Netherlands have offered positive signals that their F-16 fighter jets will be employable by Ukraine with few restrictions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe problem is that when matched to their make-it-up-on-the-go weapons restrictions, the ad infinitum public attestations by Western leaders against escalation actually risk encouraging Putin's further escalation. The British-Baltic-Polish approach is better. It reflects an understanding of Russian psychology and the reciprocal Western interest in adopting policies that broadcast both strategic clarity and strategic resolution. The Russians see weakness as bloodied prey in the water, a salivating prospect for further attack. But as in the Cold War, they respect strength designed to counterforce their own aggression.\n\nExcluding elements of Russian nuclear command and control (to include the Russian political leadership), Ukraine should thus be allowed to use Western weapons against military targets supporting Russia's war effort.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington

Deliveries from Poland, Canada, and Finland are no longer subject to conditions, and last week, the US lifted its ban on the use of US weapons to attack targets on Russian territory, albeit only for the region around Kharkiv. Germany then followed suit. How will this affect the course of the war?\n\nEurope facing a bloody summer\n\nDe Volkskrant says allowing Kyiv to attack Russia is the right course of action:\n\n\"Ukraine must be given the opportunity to defend itself, not only to protect the people of Kharkiv, but also to stop Russia from advancing further. In the interests of European security, Russia must not be rewarded for its aggression. It is wise of the US to attach conditions to the deployment of its weapons. ... In this way the escalation will be limited to some degree, because the weapons will be used for self-defence. Despite all the uncertainty, however, one thing is unfortunately clear: Europe is in for a gruelling and bloody summer.\"\n\n\"The Ukrainians are fighting for their country and their freedom and should continue to receive support from their Western allies. Under international law Ukraine has the right to defend itself against Russian attacks, and it will now be able to respond by striking Russian territory. Giving Ukraine permission to use weapons against targets on enemy territory is a decision made by each individual Nato state that has supplied those weapons, and 'does not make the allies part of the conflict', as Stoltenberg has said. ... The problem is that the other side may not see things the same way.\"\n\nBad for Scholz's credibility\n\nHandelsblatt sees the German chancellor in a tough position:\n\n\"Scholz has made the right decision - but is likely to pay a high price for it. Because at the very moment in which he is presenting himself as 'peace chancellor' in the European election campaign he has had to take a step which will give the Ukraine war a new quality. With this step he is providing the populists with an easy target and coming under pressure over the issue of arms deliveries again. Scholz has gambled away his credibility. Although he is sticking to his principles on the issue of the use of Western weapons on Russian soil he nonetheless comes across as unprincipled.\"\n\nMainly about diplomatic pressure\n\nAs long as Ukraine is dependent on Western arms it will not be able to act freely, blogger Alexandr Kochetkov writes on Facebook:\n\n\"Allowing the free use of Western weapons is a good thing. But this is still mainly about exerting diplomatic pressure on the aggressor. After all, permission to strike the territory of the wannabe empire means nothing if there is nothing with which to attack it. That is why our partners will remain in control of this sensitive process in any case. Until we start producing most of what we need for our security ourselves.\"\n\nDon't fall for the Kremlin's rhetoric\n\nRFI Rom\u00e2nia says Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons are not credible:\n\n\"Germany's Bild newspaper, which over the past few years has proven to be a good source for information about Russia's activities and among other things reported accurately on the preparations for the invasion in February 2022, now writes that the Ukrainian army has already used the Patriot system it received from Germany at least once to hit Russian targets attacking Ukraine. The reactions from Washington and Berlin have been furious. ... But if the reports are true, this also shows something else: namely that Russia, which has already been hit by Western weapons, has not reacted despite Vladimir Putin's rhetoric.\"\n\nDecisive for victory\n\nFor Ukraine, three key strategic goals are at stake here, explains Latvijas Av\u012bze:\n\n\"Firstly, the West's military industry needs to ramp up production and development. ... Secondly, it wants the auxiliary functions (supplies, hospitals, repairs) to be taken over by Western contingents. ... Thirdly, with the exception of nuclear weapons it wants all Western weapons to be allowed to be used on Russian territory. This also includes air-launched missiles capable of reaching targets up to 2,000 kilometres away. ... When the Russians see that their entire European territory is under attack and that they are losing military and economic assets worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars every day, the Russian elite will realise that something must be done to end this war.\"\n\n\"If Western weapons are used for attacks outside Ukraine, the countries that send them acquire the status of belligerents. This means that the country against which the weapons are directed can legitimately take military action against them. So far Moscow has not has not taken such action, because there was a tacit agreement that the weapons would not be used on Russian territory. If something changes or if Putin sees the risk of defeat, he could retaliate and drag the Western states into a war. So we're on a knife's edge. And the worst thing is that nobody is talking publicly about peace - nor even of a painful compromise.\"\n\nRed lines are absurd\n\nPostimees says there must be an end to the procrastinating:\n\n\"Russia would probably have lost the war in Ukraine long ago if the West had not drawn its 'red lines'. One by one, these restrictions have been lifted, but at the cost of lost time and the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. The situation can't escalate any further: Russia attacked Ukraine driven by imperialist ambitions, and it imposed no restrictions on itself - neither regarding the use of weapons which are prohibited by international conventions nor regarding attacks on civilian infrastructure.\"\n\nDon't be intimidated\n\nFor \u00daj Sz\u00f3, it's clear that Russia can only be pushed back using military means:\n\n\"Moscow threatened from the outset that there would be 'historic consequences' if the West dared to help Ukraine. ... Partly for this reason and partly because of the different political culture, Western countries have been very reluctant to provide Ukraine with resources. ... Putin can only be deterred by the use of force. And the serious threat of costly military strikes. If the West listens to Putin, this will not lead to the end of the war, only to Kyiv's capitulation.\"\n\nMoscow won't be targeted\n\nThe proposal should be viewed realistically, warns Corriere della Sera:\n\n\"It must be made clear that the aim is not to beat Russia 'into the ground'. Nobody would ever think of putting Moscow in the crosshairs and nobody would want to. It's about giving the Ukrainians the opportunity to attack the outposts - like the airbases along the border - that are giving Putin an increasing advantage. This is a green light that Zelensky has asked for on each of his trips and never received. Surely his forces won't be able to carry out the attacks by waving the sword of drones 'Made in Ukraine'.\"\n\nWe need nerves of steel\n\nBelgium is now also supplying F-16 fighter jets as part of a security agreement with Ukraine. But this poses certain risks, De Morgen warns:\n\n\"In the long term, we promise in the security agreement to bring Ukraine into the EU and Nato and to stand by it militarily - even 'in the event of new aggression'. The greater the military cooperation, the greater the likelihood that we will no longer just be watching from afar but also become involved with Belgian soldiers. ... Our society must reckon with us having to be heavily involved for at least a decade, contributing manpower, resources and above all nerves of steel in order to prevent a major escalation.\"\n\nWelcome help but no panacea\n\nThe use of Western weapons alone would not bring a significant change in the situation for Ukraine, Jutarnji list suspects:\n\n\"In the areas of Russia [that Western weapons could reach] there are hundreds of military objects, fuel depots, weapons depots, command posts, places for repair and logistical support, radar stations, barracks, at least 15 air bases and other key military infrastructure. ... Allowing Ukraine to use Western weapons in Russia would probably reduce the effectiveness of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, but it would not change the balance of power as long as Ukraine doesn't solve problems such as its shortage of ammunition and soldiers.\"\n\nEnough of the double standards!\n\nZeit Online criticises the West's unequal treatment of Ukraine and Israel:\n\n\"Ukraine must be allowed to attack Russian troops in those locations where they are preparing to advance. ... Ukraine has so far adhered to both the agreements with its Western supporters and to humanitarian international law. The same can no longer be said of Israel, however. For months the Netanyahu government has ignored the exhortations of its backers to do far more to improve the humanitarian situation. ... Israel's excessive warfare is also damaging to its Western supporters, who have stood by idly for too long. And the simultaneous fettering of the Ukrainians shows that the West is at risk of betraying its moral standards.\"\n\nThe red line: Kharkiv\n\nKharkiv's key role has fuelled this debate, writes Corriere della Sera:\n\n\"At the beginning of the invasion, former Russian President Medvedev threatened that Kharkiv would be the fifth region to be annexed. But the attack was repelled. Today, Ukrainians fear that Putin wants revenge for this debacle. The economic consequences would be more serious than the fall of Donetsk or Mariupol. The Kharkiv region is the third largest source (6.3 percent) of Ukraine's GDP after Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk and has the country's largest natural gas reserves ... Moscow's aim seems to be to make the city uninhabitable and force its citizens to leave in preparation for a new summer offensive.\"\n\nBiden holding back because of the election\n\nIf Washington is hesitant, it's not for fear of an expansion of the war, Censor.net contends:\n\n\"The White House does not fear any large-scale action by the Kremlin in response to its allowing Ukraine to fire on Novorossiysk or Sochi with American weapons, for example. No, it suspects that Putin, in keeping with his KGB habits, will try to carry out some nasty act of revenge with the help of foreign hands. ... For example that he could give money to some Iranian proxies and they would attack an American embassy or military base, causing US casualties. ... And that that could affect the election.\"\n\n\"It is likely that the US will agree to the use of weapons to attack military targets in Russia in the near future, which the Ukrainians have been demanding for a long time. A situation in which the Russian army could be hit directly in its command centres, communications, ammunition and weapons depots. ... Russia has already lost half a million military personnel who have been killed or wounded, as well as a lot of money from its budget, a third of which is being used to support the war. ... And there are many indications that Putin wants to freeze the war on the current front because he no longer has the means to continue it.\"\n\nNot carefully thought through\n\nT24 sees Europe drifting towards increased involvement in the war:\n\n\"Everything points to Europe being dragged step by step into the war. However, this is not a particularly determined or well-considered course. In fact, this drift is taking place as Europe loses its autonomy, succumbing to the growing pressure from Washington, to which it surrendered its foreign policy after the Second World War. It's as if Europe had awoken from hibernation only to find itself being mustered under calls of 'Come on, soldier, up you get'. ... There are signs that Nato forces are preparing for a major conflict with military manoeuvres and exercises in Europe. The Baltic states are being militarised.\"\n\nVictory on the battlefield unrealistic\n\nInstead of giving the green light for attacks on Russian territory, the Tages-Anzeiger calls for a realistic proposal for negotiations:\n\n\"Can this madness be stopped? ... No. Russia could end the war immediately if it wanted to. But Vladimir Putin can't and won't admit defeat, so he has his soldiers fight on with the aim of making the already largest country in the world even bigger. ... But one thing is clear: if we want this 'Russian madness' to stop, we must take a step towards the enemy. Because victory on the battlefield is unrealistic.\"", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I would like to emphasise that nobody in the West, in Europe, wants to remember how this tragedy started,\" Putin said.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 10}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624887", "eventUri": "eng-9624887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The Russian reaction to this landmark news has bordered on the hysterical, with a host of Kremlin officials and propagandists denouncing the West and vowing terrible revenge.\n\nPredictably, Vladimir Putin led the way, issuing yet more of the thinly-veiled nuclear threats that have become his trademark. Speaking in Tashkent, Putin warned European leaders of \"serious consequences,\" before reminding them of their own vulnerability. \"They should keep in mind that theirs are small and densely populated countries, which is a factor to reckon with before they start talking about striking deep into Russian territory,\" he commented.\n\nClose Putin ally and former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev's response featured an even more explicit nuclear threat. Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said it would be a \"fatal mistake\" for Western leaders to believe Russia was not ready to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine or individual NATO member states. \"This is, alas, not an attempt at intimidation or a nuclear bluff,\" he declared.\n\nRussia's use of nuclear blackmail is no longer particularly surprising, of course. Since the very first days of the Ukraine invasion, Putin has engaged in frequent bouts of nuclear saber-rattling as part of a broader Russian effort to establish so-called red lines and undermine Western support for Ukraine. Nevertheless, this latest example of nuclear bluster is worthy of closer attention as it inadvertently provides revealing insights into the political realities behind Putin's lofty imperial rhetoric of conquest and annexation.\n\nWith his chilling references to \"small and densely populated countries,\" Putin clearly hoped to intimidate his opponents and signal that the use of Western weapons on Russian territory is a major red line for the Kremlin. But according to Russia's own logic, this particular red line has already been crossed on hundreds of occasions. Since 2022, Ukraine has routinely used Western weapons throughout the occupied Ukrainian regions that Putin says are now part of Russia, without triggering any discernible escalation from Moscow. In Putin's new Russian Empire, it would seem, some places are more Russian than others.\n\nOfficially, at least, there is no ambiguity in Moscow over the status of the Ukrainian regions claimed by the Kremlin. According to the Russian Constitution, Ukraine's Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson provinces along with the Crimean peninsula are now all part of the Russian Federation. Russia proclaimed the \"return\" of Crimea in March 2014, just a few weeks after the lightning military takeover of the peninsula that marked the start of Russia's Ukraine invasion. More recently, Putin announced the \"annexation\" of four more Ukrainian provinces in a lavish September 2022 Kremlin ceremony.\n\nTechnically speaking, the five Ukrainian provinces subject to unilateral Russian \"annexation\" should all now enjoy the same protections as the rest of Putin's realm. In practice, however, it has long been apparent that Moscow has no intention of expanding its nuclear umbrella to cover these regions, or of even attempting to impose its red lines regarding the use of Western weapons.\n\nThe Battle of Kherson provides a particularly vivid demonstration of the credibility gap between Russian rhetoric and Russian reality. The only regional capital captured during the entire Russian invasion, Kherson was liberated in November 2022, less than two months after Putin had declared it to be \"Russian forever.\" Rather reach for his nuclear button, Putin responded to this embarrassing setback by ordering his defeated troops to quietly withdraw across the Dnipro River.\n\nThe evolving Battle of Crimea is perhaps even more revealing. For over ten years, Putin has insisted the occupied Ukrainian peninsula is now part of Russia, and has rejected all attempts to discuss its status. During this period, the seizure of Crimea has emerged as arguably the most important single element in modern Russia's national narrative; it has come to be seen as the greatest achievement of Putin's entire reign, and is widely regarded as a symbol of the country's return to the top table of international affairs. This official Russian reverence for Crimea initially persuaded many in the West to view the peninsula as off-limits, but failed to deter Ukraine.\n\nSince the early months of the war, Ukraine has been attacking Russian forces in Crimea with every available weapon, including those provided by the country's Western allies. Western-supplied missiles have played a central role in the Battle of Crimea, enabling Ukraine to methodically deplete Russian air defenses throughout the peninsula and sink numerous Russian warships. The most eye-catching attack of all came in September 2023, when Ukraine used Western cruise missiles to bomb and partially destroy the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol. If Kherson was an embarrassment for Putin, this was a very personal humiliation. Crucially, it did not lead to World War III. Instead, Putin withdrew most of his remaining warships from Crimea to the relative safety of Russian ports.\n\nThe obvious inconsistency in the Kremlin's public position regarding attacks on Russian soil has a number of practical implications for the further conduct of the war. It highlights the flexibility of Russia's red lines, and strengthens perceptions that Moscow is primarily seeking to exploit the West's own fear of escalation rather than establish any genuine boundaries.\n\nClearly, no responsible Western leader can afford to completely disregard the threat of nuclear war. At the same time, it is increasingly apparent that Russia's relentless nuclear saber-rattling is losing its potency. By engaging in regular nuclear threats that never lead to action, the Kremlin has weakened the entire concept of nuclear deterrence and left Russia looking toothless. Based on the experience of the past two years, it now seems safe to conclude that while carpet-bombing the Kremlin might force Putin into some kind of drastic response, targeted attacks on Russian military bases and firing positions across the border from Ukraine are highly unlikely to fuel any kind of major escalation.\n\nThe Kremlin's obvious reluctance to treat \"annexed\" regions of Ukraine as fully Russian directly contradicts Moscow's own efforts to portray the occupation of Ukrainian lands as irreversible. While Putin likes to compare himself to Peter the Great and boast of \"returning historically Russian lands,\" he is evidently in no hurry to grant his Ukrainian \"conquests\" the kind of unequivocal security commitments that are the ultimate marker of sovereignty. Indeed, after more than a decade, the hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens who have been shipped to occupied Crimea since 2014 will no doubt be wondering how much longer they must wait before the Kremlin finally considers them worthy of protection.\n\nFar from being set in stone, Russia's territorial ambitions in Ukraine are largely opportunist and will expand or contract based on the military situation. Putin and his colleagues often call on Ukraine to accept the \"new territorial realities\" created by the current front lines of the war, but their actions send an unmistakable signal that the future of the \"annexed\" Ukrainian regions is still very much up for debate. Meanwhile, the multiple retreats from \"historically Russian land\" conducted by Putin's invading army since 2022 suggest the chances of a nuclear apocalypse have been wildly exaggerated. This should help Kyiv's Western partners overcome their self-defeating fear of escalation, and encourage them to finally provide Ukraine with the tools, along with the free hand, to finish the job of defeating Russia.\n\nPeter Dickinson is editor of the Atlantic Council's UkraineAlert service.\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nImage: Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a press conference in Tashkent, Uzbekistan May 28, 2024.

Additionally, he pointed out that Trump's recent felony conviction resulted from 'internal political struggle' within the US.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_International_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg International Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/05_06_2024_23_01_15_8457935.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624887", "eventUri": "eng-9624887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Their hope was to embroil Russia in a forever war with Ukraine that would \"degrade\" Russia by bringing about the deaths of tens of thousands of Russian troops. By funneling U.S. weapons to Ukraine, another aim was to have Ukraine defeat Russia militarily in the hope that the Russian people or the Russian national-security establishment would oust Russian President Putin from power and replace him with a leader who would be subservient to the U.S. government.\n\nOf course, U.S. officials were simply repeating what they had accomplished back in 1979, when they provoked the Soviet Union into invading Afghanistan, with the aim of giving the Soviets their \"own Vietnam,\" meaning that tens of thousands of Russian soldiers would be killed in Afghanistan, just as 58,000 American soldiers were killed in Vietnam.\n\nOnce NATO provoked Russia into invading Ukraine, U.S. officials were confident that Russia would not attack any NATO country for furnishing weaponry to Ukraine. That's because the U.S. is supposedly obligated by its NATO agreement to come to the military defense of any NATO country that is attacked by some other nation. Thus, if Russia attacks, say, Poland for furnishing weapons to Ukraine to help Ukraine kill Russians, the U.S. would have to come to Poland's assistance by killing Russian soldiers.\n\nNeedless to say, there is large probability that a war between the United States and Russia would quickly escalate into a nuclear war. That's why U.S. officials were confident that they could wage a proxy war with Russia by simply using Ukrainian soldiers and furnishing them U.S. weaponry, without any concern that Russia would retaliate against any NATO country.\n\nThroughout the conflict, U.S. officials made it clear that no NATO weaponry could be used to strike inside Russia. The idea was that while Russia would tolerate the use of NATO weaponry to kill Russian soldiers inside Ukraine, it would never tolerate the U.S. proxy war to extend to inside Russia, where people would be killed and buildings and infrastructure destroyed by U.S. weapons.\n\nGiven that they are clearly losing their proxy war, it is increasingly clear that Pentagon officials are now considering changing course, especially after their humiliating defeat in Afghanistan. In the hopes of still prevailing against Russia, U.S. officials are now giving serious thought to permitting Ukraine to use U.S. weapons to wreak death and destruction inside Russia.\n\nA May 28 article in the Washington Post entitled, \"NATO Chief and European Allies Urge U.S. to Let Ukraine Strike Inside Russia,\" states:\n\nWashington is facing mounting pressure from NATO and several key European allies to lift restrictions and allow Ukraine to use the full force of U.S.-provided weapons to strike military targets inside Russia. The demands reflect new alarm in the West over Russian battlefield advances in recent days, including the seizure of several villages in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions and brutal bombings that have killed dozens of civilians.\n\nThe United States and other NATO allies, including Germany and Italy, have long refused to let Ukraine use their weapons to strike inside Russia's borders, fearing that such attacks could escalate the conflict. Senior Russian officials repeatedly have brandished Moscow's nuclear arsenal in response to suggestions of greater Western involvement in the war.\"\n\nNATO's parliamentary assembly, meanwhile, issued a declaration urging that the restrictions be lifted.\n\nMeanwhile, according to an article in the Guardian, Russian forces have started military drills near Ukraine simulating the use of tactical nuclear weapons in response to what Moscow deems threats from western officials about increased involvement in the conflict. Vladimir Putin ordered the drills earlier this month in a move Russian officials said was a warning to the west not to escalate tensions further.\n\nI have long stated that the worst mistake America has ever made was to convert the federal government to a national-security state. I hope it's a mistake that Americans will still be alive to correct before it's too late.", "source": {"uri": "lewrockwell.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lew Rockwell"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_g_hornberger@lewrockwell.com", "name": "Jacob G.

The exercise, which will be monitored by the U.S. military, will involve a \"handful\" of Russian ships and support vessels, the two officials said.\n\nIt's not the first time Russia has sent its ships to the Caribbean. This exercise, however, is taking place as Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested that Moscow could take \"asymmetrical steps\" elsewhere in the world in response to President Joe Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weapons to strike inside Russia to protect Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.\n\nThe officials, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not been announced publicly, said the exercise is \"certainly\" part of a broader Russian response to the U.S. support for Ukraine, but it also is an effort by Putin to show his navy is still capable of global power projection after losing several ships to Ukrainian strikes.\n\nUkrainian military officials said in March that Russia had lost one-third of its Black Sea fleet to Ukrainian strikes during the past two years of war.\n\nRussia did not notify the U.S. of the pending exercise, but the ships\u00b4 movements have been tracked by the U.S. Navy, the officials said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks to senior news leaders of international news agencies on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum at the Lakhta Center skyscraper, the headquarters of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Wednesday, June 5, 2024.

(Vladimir Astapkovich, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)\n\nDespite Russia not notifying the U.S. - which countries often do to avoid miscalculation - the officials said militaries all over the globe have the right to conduct exercises in international waters and do so regularly. For example, on Friday about 20 NATO countries including the U.S. will begin BALTOPS 24, a major naval and air exercise in the Baltic region near Russia.\n\nThe officials said they expect the Russian ships will remain in the region through the summer and will likely conduct similar, follow-up exercises in the Caribbean after this one concludes.\n\nThe officials said Congress was notified of the upcoming Russian exercises on Wednesday.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin listens to a journalist's question as he meets with senior news leaders of international news agencies on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum at the Lakhta Center skyscraper, the headquarters of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Wednesday, June 5, 2024.

English prosecutors claim that Russian agents set fire to a warehouse containing aid for Ukraine. Sweden is investigating alleged Russian-sponsored acts of sabotage. The Czech government accuses Moscow of sabotaging its railways.\n\nEstonia, meanwhile, has reportedly uncovered a host of Russian plots on its soil. Russian ships are suspected of targeting communications cables and wind farms in the North Sea. Now, Moscow may be involved in suspicious fires in Poland. The roster of allegations goes on and on.\n\nRussia naturally denies any culpability, but where there is this much smoke -- literal or figurative -- there is probably some fire. As Prime Minister Kaja Kallas of Estonia has said, Russia seems to be waging a \"shadow war\" against Europe -- a campaign meant to weaken Western support for Ukraine, or at least to punish European countries for providing it. In doing so, President Vladimir Putin is also giving a preview of the hyper-resentful, asymmetrically aggressive Russia that will emerge from the current war.\n\nMany European governments fear Putin is already envisioning new wars: Denmark's defense minister announced that Russia could attack one of NATO's European members within three to five years.\n\nDon't dismiss this scenario entirely. Putin is militarizing Russian society and raising defense production to record levels. If he doubted America's commitment to Europe he might be tempted to conduct a smash-and-grab attack, perhaps against the Baltic States, to show just how hollow the alliance had become. Short of that, however, a conventional Russian assault on Europe seems unlikely.\n\nPutin has had to mobilize so much manpower and material because his army has suffered such brutal attrition in Ukraine. So long as the U.S. remains committed to NATO, Putin knows that an attack on its members risks starting a war he would ultimately lose. More likely, then, is a thoroughly roguish, occasionally violent Russia -- but one that relies mainly on asymmetric tactics to weaken an alliance he cannot beat head-on.\n\nPutin certainly has the motive. He contends that the West is already waging a \"real war,\" meant to humiliate Russia and destroy his regime. He has accumulated vast reserves of animosity toward the countries that are helping Ukraine kill Russian troops.\n\nTo be clear: This isn't just some harassment campaign, some fit of geopolitical pique. These tactics erode Western countries' sovereignty and unsettle their politics.\n\nMost fundamentally, they demonstrate that NATO's defense guarantees can't necessarily stop Russia from perpetrating acts of aggression in Europe. And here, high-end capabilities bolster below-the-threshold tactics: Russia's nuclear arsenal, which Putin habitually brandishes, helps deter a more muscular Western response.\n\nNATO will have to continue rearming against an avowedly revisionist, highly mobilized Russia, if only to ensure that full-blown confrontation with the alliance remains a very bad bet. Yet it must also prepare for a long struggle in the shadows, in which a wounded Russia finds creative ways of harrying its foes. That sort of cold war will be challenging enough -- even if the West can keep its confrontation with Putin from turning hot.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Kozlov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Kozlov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sabotage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaja_Kallas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kaja Kallas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_states", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltic states"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Historical revisionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2024/06/7409330_web1_7364298-8b7eb8fc95ea454185ab24fbdad8fbad.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624887", "eventUri": "eng-9624887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 192, "textEnd": 198}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

He warned that such actions could lead to \"very serious problems\" and suggested that Russia might respond by providing long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets.\n\nWhat Happened: Putin's remarks were made at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, according to the Associated Press. The Russian leader's comments were in response to Germany's recent authorization for Ukraine to use long-range weapons supplied by Germany to strike certain Russian targets.\n\nPutin stated that the use of those weapons to strike Russia would equate to direct involvement in the war against Russia.\n\nPutin's statements come at a time of escalating tensions between Russia and the West over the conflict in Ukraine. He also addressed the issue of Russia-U.S. relations, stating that they would remain unchanged regardless of the outcome of the upcoming U.S. presidential election, the AP reports.\n\nWhy It Matters: The conflict in Ukraine has been a major point of contention between Russia and the West. The situation has also had global implications, with other nations being drawn into the conflict. For instance, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused China of aligning with Russia, which has cast a shadow over the prospects of an upcoming peace summit aimed at resolving the ongoing conflict.\n\nPutin's recent warning about potential weapon transfers to strike Western targets further underscores the gravity of the situation and the potential for it to escalate into a broader conflict involving other nations.\n\nRead Next: SpaceX Delays Starship's 4th Flight Test: Here's When The Launch Is Scheduled Now\n\nThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto: ID1974/Shutterstock.com.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_International_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg International Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEB660A4_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624887", "eventUri": "eng-9624887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

English prosecutors claim that Russian agents set fire to a warehouse containing aid for Ukraine. Sweden is investigating alleged Russian-sponsored acts of sabotage. The Czech government accuses Moscow of sabotaging its railways, as well.\n\nEstonia, meanwhile, has reportedly uncovered a host of Russian plots on its soil. Russian ships are suspected of targeting communications cables and wind farms in the North Sea. Now, Moscow may be involved in suspicious fires -- including one that engulfed a shopping center -- in Poland. The roster of allegations goes on and on.\n\nRussia naturally denies any culpability, but where there is this much smoke -- literal or figurative -- there is probably some fire. As Prime Minister Kaja Kallas of Estonia has said, Russia seems to be waging a \"shadow war\" against Europe -- a campaign meant to weaken Western support for Ukraine, or at least to punish European countries for providing it. In doing so, President Vladimir Putin is also giving a preview of the hyper-resentful, asymmetrically aggressive Russia that will emerge from the current war.\n\nNo matter what losses Moscow suffers in Ukraine, no matter where the front lines are when the fighting ends, Russia will still occupy one-eighth of the land on earth, and it will still be one of the most important geopolitical actors. Its behavior will shape the security environment in Europe and far beyond.\n\nMany European governments fear Putin is already envisioning new wars: Denmark's defense minister announced that Russia could attack one of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's European members within three to five years.\n\nDon't dismiss this scenario entirely. Putin is militarizing Russian society and raising defense production to record levels. If he doubted America's commitment to Europe -- perhaps because it had once again elected a president who continually derides NATO -- he might be tempted to conduct a smash-and-grab attack, perhaps against the Baltic States, to show just how hollow the alliance had become. Short of that, however, a conventional Russian assault on Europe seems unlikely.\n\nPutin has had to mobilize so much manpower and materiel because his army has suffered such brutal attrition in Ukraine. Even after this war ends, Russian forces will have to occupy whatever Ukrainian territory they still control. Moreover, so long as the U.S. remains committed to NATO, Putin knows that an attack on its members risks starting a war he would ultimately lose. More likely, then, is a thoroughly roguish, occasionally violent Russia -- but one that relies mainly on asymmetric tactics to weaken an alliance he cannot beat head-on.\n\nPutin certainly has the motive. He contends that the West is already waging a \"real war,\" meant to humiliate Russia and destroy his regime. He has used the current war to radicalize his country -- to purge it of liberal, moderate elements, to indoctrinate teenagers and even young children in extreme nationalism, to create a system geared toward confrontation with the outside world. He has accumulated vast reserves of animosity toward the countries that are helping Ukraine kill Russian troops. And he has many unconventional means of seeking revenge.\n\nRussia has long sponsored covert acts of destruction in Europe: As far back as 2014, Russian agents apparently sabotaged Czech ammunition dumps containing arms bound for Ukraine. His regime has cultivated criminals and radicals as proxies; it has weaponized migration by pushing refugees across the borders into Europe. It has used nominally civilian capabilities, such as fishing trawlers, to attack valuable undersea infrastructure.\n\nFor years, Moscow has also sponsored attempted coups and assassination plots in countries from Montenegro to Germany. At times, it has simply moved, or threatened to move, its land and sea borders with neighboring states. Add in Russia's well-honed political warfare capabilities -- influence operations, cyberattacks and other means of meddling -- and Putin has everything he needs for a low-intensity assault against the West.\n\nTo be clear: This isn't just some harassment campaign, some fit of geopolitical pique. These tactics erode Western countries' sovereignty and unsettle their politics.\n\nMost fundamentally, they demonstrate that NATO's defense guarantees can't necessarily stop Russia from perpetrating occasionally violent, if quasi-disguised, acts of aggression in Europe. And here, high-end capabilities bolster below-the-threshold tactics: Russia's nuclear arsenal, which Putin habitually brandishes, helps deter a more muscular Western response.\n\nTwo years ago, I wrote that Russia might become a \"Tehran on the Volga\" -- a weakened but increasingly militant regime that uses proxies and other non-traditional tools. If anything, this sort of Russia is now taking shape even more rapidly than I expected.\n\nNATO will have to continue rearming against an avowedly revisionist, highly mobilized Russia, if only to ensure that full-blown confrontation with the alliance remains a very bad bet. Yet it must also prepare for a long struggle in the shadows, in which a wounded Russia finds creative ways of harrying its foes. That sort of cold war will be challenging enough -- even if the West can keep its confrontation with Putin from turning hot.", "source": {"uri": "twincities.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twin

The two leaders pledged a \"new era\" for the Russia-China relationship, building on their \"no limits partnership\" struck just before Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. As Putin's first foreign trip since winning reelection in March, the visit showcased his and Russia's enduring stature amid the war in Ukraine.\n\nDespite Russia's 2024 election being marked by systemic repression of serious alternative parties and candidates and decades of brazen statements about Russia's \"managed\" democracy, Putin captured 87 percent of the vote from a record-high voter turnout. Even with some self-censorship and a slight drop in approval, the Russian public still largely backs the war, despite a largely static frontline, the severance of ties with Europe, declines in living standards, and the deaths and injuries of hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers. The staggering number of casualties is mirrored in Ukraine, a nation that Putin and many Russians consider a brotherly nation and the mother culture of Russia.\n\nIn contrast, U.S. domestic support for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraqbegan to decline markedly a couple of years after the conflicts began, and predictions of a collapse in Russian public support for the war emerged soon after it began. Yet although the costs of Russia's war in Ukraine continue to escalate and it appears far from conclusion, several reasons have compelled Russian citizens to continue supporting the war and the President who initiated it.\n\nOpposition to war in Russia faces unique challenges not encountered in the U.S., but convincing a population that war is unavoidable is essential for any government to sustain a war effort. The Kremlin has framed the nation's military actions as a noble fight to save ethnic Russians and Russian speakersin Ukraine from a fascist regime in Kyiv -- a narrative that resonates with many Russians and the country's history in World War II. Highlighting growing restrictions on the Russian language in Ukraine furthers this message, while Russia's excuse that they were answering cries for help in Ukraine echoes their 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia. Russian media also portrays their forces as minimizing civilian casualties, as Ukraine is accused of targeting civilians in Russia, and Ukraine's failure to hold scheduled elections in 2024 has been used to question President Zelensky's legitimacy.\n\nBy portraying Ukraine as the mother culture of Russia, Putin has cast the invasion through a historical and patriotic lens. The conflict is framed as an internal matter of reasserting Russian dominance over the ancestral homeland that birthed Russian language, religion, and political origins, against an illegitimate Ukrainian government that currently occupies the country. Russian nationalism can be rallied by invoking ethnic unity, territorial patrimony, and the need to rectify Ukraine's separation from Moscow, making it easier to dismiss Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\nRussia has also deflected its violations of the UN Charter against non-aggression by depicting itself as an aggrieved party, forced into war by the U.S.-led West and its vassal states, sentiment reflected in national polls, and supported by notable figures like Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico, who in January 2024 stated that Ukraine was under the complete control of Washington. On May 1, 2024, an exhibition of captured Western weapons, vehicles, and equipment since the start of the war opened in Moscow -- much like Kyiv's in May 2022 which showed captured Russian equipment. The Kremlin connects everything to the war -- including the recent attack by ISIS in Moscow. In contrast, the American public increasingly began to believe that U.S. leaders had misled them into the War on Terror, particularly the War in Iraq, which it felt could have been avoided.\n\nRussians' support for the war has manifested as the culmination of decades of \"patriotic mobilization\" that has taken place since Putin's first term. The cultivation of nationalist sentiment, pervasive across media, culture, and politics, has intensified significantly since the invasion. The Russian identity is increasingly intertwined with the existential need to protect Russians abroad, shield Russia from NATO, and bolster Russia's status as a great power.\n\nPreparing and instilling confidence in the Russian armed forces' ability to sustain a major conflict has been ongoing for decades. Russian forces engaged in counterinsurgency operations in Russia's restive region of Chechnya in the 2000s and supported a limited conflict in support of two restive regions in neighboring Georgia in 2008. Subsequently, Russian forces seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and supported a limited conflict in support of Ukraine's restive border region with Russia. In 2015, they launched a major military operation to rescue Syrian President Assad in 2015. With relative success in Syria, the significant escalation of Russia's conflict in Ukraine in 2022 did not come as a surprise. This contrasts with the perceived failures of Western military interventions in the 21st Century, causing domestic confidence in the U.S. military to decline as well as the scale of the military's operations.\n\nTo alleviate domestic concern stemming from severing Russia's historical connections with Europe, as well as distancing by other countries to comply with Western sanctions, Putin has embarked on a series of foreign trips to show Russia's resiliency. Visits to Belarus and other former Soviet states in Central Asia and the Caucasus have helped stabilize its regional influence. Visits to Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have served to demonstrate Russia's enduring influence in the Middle East, while Russia has also hosted dozens of foreign leaders from the Global South, as well as those of Hungary and Austria.\n\nHowever, Russia's ties with China form its most crucial bilateral relationship. Despite the power imbalance, Putin's May visit to China reaffirmed Moscow's strategic relationship with Beijing. Russia's capacity to confront the U.S. and collaborate with other major powers offers reassurance that has erased much of the pain of the geopolitical decline that accompanied the Soviet collapse.\n\nMoscow has also aimed to counter any moral superiority by the West in Ukraine by highlighting Washington's and Kyiv's support for Israel since October 7. Framing it as part of Russia's confrontation with the West for a new multipolar world order, the Kremlin hopes to legitimize its policies and broaden Russia's appeal to the Global South. Following the Nigerien government's expulsion of U.S. troops in May 2024 and the invitation of Russian forces, images of Russian troops entering the same airbase where U.S. military personnel were stationed further underscored Russia's assertive struggle with the West and wider geopolitical ambitions.\n\nFurthermore, Russian citizens have been shielded from the economic repercussions of the war through subsidized fuel, food, and other essential resources. Russia's substantial gold and foreign reserves have helped fund the war and prevented extended currency volatility, while the imposition of hefty penalties on foreign companies considering leaving Russia has deterred many Western firms from exiting or compelled them to pay significant costs.\n\nRussia's major economic partners, most importantly China and India, have helped maintain stability in Russia's exports and imports. Western sanctions have also by design not crippled the Russian economy, as preventing Russian resources from reaching global markets would cause prices to spike.\n\nMoreover, the Russian public has also been largely spared from devastation. Ukrainian attacks within Russia have mostly been limited to small flareups in border regions and attacks on energy and transport facilities, and Ukrainian forces are still restricted from using Western weapons. Sabotage attacks in Russia have also risen, but the situation is manageable.\n\nIn contrast to Ukrainian citizens, no Russian civilians have been forcefully committed to fight. The 2022 partial mobilization called up reservists, while recent changes to laws have meant Russia has been more easily able to offer generous contracts to annual conscripts soon after their training has concluded. Compared to the forced conscription videos in Ukraine, Russian media can claim it only uses volunteers and those already part of the armed forces.\n\nRussian soldiers who are injured, as well as the families of Russian soldiers who died in service, receive substantial compensation. Though payment is often delayed, the modest backgrounds of most Russian soldiers mean that these funds can be life-changing. The use of prisoners in particularly perilous military operations has also shielded regular Russian soldiers, with Ukraine only considering this practice earlier this year.\n\nNevertheless, tens of thousands of Russian soldiers have been killed and hundreds of thousands more seriously wounded. This tests the casualties hypothesis, which states that the public's willingness to remain engaged in a military intervention declines as casualties mount. The Soviet Union's 10-year war in Afghanistan saw 15,000 Soviet troops killed and eventually helped lead to the downfall of the country, while the deeply unpopular Iraq War saw 4,500 U.S. soldier deaths and saw the Bush administration's popularity decline considerably.\n\nUndoubtedly, the Russian government distorts official casualty figures. Yet it is crucial to contextualize Russia's losses in Ukraine within the context of recent history. The COVID-19 pandemic claimed more than 400,000 Russian lives, far surpassing the casualties in Ukraine.\n\nFurthermore, the Russian public's stomach in the face of such significant losses may be influenced by the large number of deaths of prominent Russians since the beginning of the war. Across Russian media, the war and its repercussions have shown that even the country's most influential individuals can be killed and have their assets stripped, contributing to a sense of collective sacrifice amid the conflict.\n\nAmid the chaos of the war, dozens of Russian oligarchs and political figureshave been killed in suspicious circumstances both in Russia and overseas, in a public settling of scores, opportunism, and punishment from the Kremlin for disobedience. A day after Russian forces entered Ukraine, the body of Alexander Tyulyakov, a senior executive of Gazprom's corporate security, was found hanging in his garage. Ravil Maganov, chairman of the board of Russia's oil giant Lukoil, allegedly fell out of a Moscow hospital window in September 2022. In December, businessman Vladimir Bidenov died of heart problems at the Hotel Sai International in India -- two days later his business associate and deputy in the Legislative Assembly of Vladimir Oblast, Pavel Antov, fell out of a window at the same hotel.\n\nWhile the deaths of oligarchs and politicians may offer some solace to ordinary Russian soldiers serving in Ukraine, there has also been a significant loss of high-ranking military officials. Some, like Lieutenant General Vladimir Sviridov, were also killed in suspicious circumstances. However, the necessity for high-ranking Russian military officials to remain near the frontlines, owing to a more top-down decision-making military structure and the risk of electronic eavesdropping by Ukrainian and Western advisors, contributes to their higher casualty rate.\n\nAlongside hundreds of other high-profile deaths, Russia has confirmed that seven general officers had been killed in Ukraine by 2024, with Ukraine claiming more than 14 had been killed by early 2023. The last time a U.S. general was killed in combat was in 2014 when an Afghan serviceman opened fire on NATO personnel in Kabul; prior to that, no American general had lost their life in combat since the Vietnam War. With this backdrop of sacrifice and solidarity among Russian elites, Russia's \"rally-'round-the-flag\" effect may sustain itself longer than expected.\n\nRussians appear to believe time and demographics are on their side. According to a March 2024 poll by Russia's Levada Center, after decades of emigration, the share of Russians expressing a desire to move abroad hit a record low, partly in response to many of those wanting to leave having already done so. Nevertheless, Finion, a Moscow-based relocation firm, stated that 40 to 45 percent of Russians who fled abroad had since returned, driven by factors such as cracking down on remote work, visa issues, reduced fears of conscription, and a general desire to return.\n\nAnd while tens of thousands of Russian soldiers have perished, along with thousands more ethnic Russians in occupied parts of Ukraine, millions of those living in those occupied territories have already been incorporated into the Russian Federation's pre-existing 144 million citizens. Conversely, Ukraine, with 37 million people before the war, has faced a population exodus compounding already challenging demographics.\n\nBy early 2024, the prevailing sentiment was that Russia had gained a fragile upper hand. Victory, though potentially pyrrhic, appears increasingly likely, if loosely defined, in Russia. Yet, as the conflict drags on, sustained by a Russian economy increasingly geared toward the war, the pursuit of victory may wane as casualties and other costs mount. The Kremlin's anxieties are now focused on Western nations, led by the UK, France, and Poland, allowing Ukraine to use Western weapons in Russia, which would further bring the war home to Russian civilians and internal infrastructure.\n\nWhile projecting an image of composure to the public, tensions are unquestionably simmering in the Kremlin. Estimates regarding Russia's capacity to sustain the war in its current state typically hover around two to three years. Yet unwavering support for Putin, coupled with the absence of viable alternatives, may extend his strong personal commitment to the war indefinitely. While Russia appears capable of and determined to continue the war, its uncertain future will continue to test the Russian public's tacit enthusiasm for it.\n\nPutin's willingness to continue the war is seen as something to exploit in the West. Western policymakers have witnessed Russia increasingly commit its domestic resources to the conflict, as well as recently shift from calling it a \"special military operation\" to a war. Steadily increasing Ukraine's technical capacity to fight a war of attrition will continue to wear down Russia's Soviet arsenal and deployment of arms abroad, demonstrating the feebleness of Russia's production and advanced weapons systems. By provoking a Russian defeat, it is hoped a second major convulsion across the former Soviet Union will further reduce Moscow's geopolitical influence. Russia's protracted military campaign and the West's strategy of prolonging the conflict through escalation management will keep exacting a catastrophic toll on Ukrainian lives and infrastructure.", "source": {"uri": "counterpunch.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Counter Punch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_p_ruehl@counterpunch.org", "name": "John P.

The remarks follow confirmation by a US senator and a western official that Ukraine has recently used US weapons to strike inside Russia.\n\nAlso read | US blasts China after Putin-Xi meet, says 'you can't have it both ways'\n\n\"We have no illusions in this regard,\" Putin said while repeating his earlier claims that Ukrainian troops might be using the weapons but the US and its allies are providing the intelligence and targeting information to Kyiv.\n\n\"Secondly, if someone deems it possible to supply such weapons to the war zone, to strike our territory... why shouldn't we supply similar weapons to those regions of the world, where they will be used against sensitive sites of these countries?\" the Russian president added.\n\n\"We can respond asymmetrically.

Is Biden using the \"lead from behind\" approach to Ukraine? Not quite. He's more likely pushing from behind.\n\nFrance is passing the U.S. by sending instructors to train Ukrainian troops on Ukrainian territory. The U.S. has ruled out a similar move for now. General Charles Brown, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, \"Right now, there are no plans to bring U.S. trainers into Ukraine. Once this conflict is over and we're in a better place, then I would suspect we would be able to bring trainers back in.\" But Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, has made public \"France's initiative to send instructors to Ukraine to train Ukrainian servicemen.\"\n\nReuters reports that three diplomatic sources said, \"The arrangements are very advanced and we could expect something next week,\" adding that an announcement could be made during Zelensky's upcoming visit to Paris.\n\nAnd France may not be in the lead. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas says, \"There are countries who are training soldiers on the ground already.\"\n\nAnd it is not just with troops, but also with restrictions on weapons that America's partners are passing it. Though the U.S. is now permitting Ukraine to use U.S. weapons to shoot at Russian troops massing just across the border in Russia, they are not yet permitting Ukraine to use American long-range missiles to strike deeper into Russian territory.\n\nBut Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen went even further, explaining that Ukraine is \"welcome to use what we have donated to Ukraine, also outside of Ukraine - that is, on Russian targets - if it is within international law.\"\n\nCanada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Melanie Joly, has now revealed that Canada has placed no restrictions on how weapons and equipment it sends to Ukraine are used. She also suggested that Canada supports allowing Ukraine to use Western weapons to hit inside Russia. \"We believe,\" she said, \"that we need to be forward-leaning on this question.\"\n\nMacron stated that France agrees with its NATO partners. \"We think that we should allow them to neutralize military sites where missiles are fired, from where... Ukraine is attacked,\" he said, adding that \"we should not allow them to touch other targets in Russia, and obviously civilian capacities.\"\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg expressed that all members of the alliance needed to follow the leads of Paris. \"The time has come for allies to consider whether they should lift some of the restrictions they have put on the use of weapons they have donated to Ukraine.\" He continued, \"Especially now when a lot of the fighting is going on in Kharkiv, close to the border, to deny Ukraine the possibility of using these weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory makes it very hard for them to defend themselves.\"\n\nThe U.K. may be the country that has gone the furthest. On May 2, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that \"Ukraine has that right\" to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. \"Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine,\" he said, \"you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it's defending itself.\"\n\nPerhaps most provocatively and most outpacing the United States, the Netherlands and Denmark have not only promised to send F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine but also promised to send them free of territorial restrictions. Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot said on May 31 that the Netherlands will not restrict its F-16 jets to Ukrainian airspace: \"If you have the right to self-defense, there are no borders for the use of weapons... This is a general principle.\" The previous day, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said that, though Ukraine would not have \"carte blanche... to use the F-16 to make arbitrary attacks into Russia,\" it would have permission to \"weaken the aggressor by taking military installations out onto Russian territory.\"\n\nDoes this suggest that America is leading from behind, being left behind, or something else? The aggressiveness of America's partners is likely less an independent policy than a policy that is consistent with American goals. It is extremely unlikely that Canada and Europe would chart such a bold path if the U.S. strongly opposed it.\n\nAnatol Lieven, director of the Eurasian Program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, suggested to me that \"the Europeans are testing the water.\" Lieven says that his sense is that \"the US is happy enough for some of the Europeans to get some way ahead of the pack, so as to test Russia's responses without (as yet) directly involving the US. If Russia fails to respond,\" he believes, \"that will embolden the Biden administration to follow suit.\"\n\nIt makes sense that the U.S. would use Europe to test Russia's red lines out of self-interest and because it is likely less dangerously provocative. The U.S. crossing a Russian red line may be perceived more seriously by Russia than if Canada or a European country crossed the same red line. It is far less clear why Europe would allow itself to be so used. Testing the waters, if it proves to be too provocative, could bring a response down on Europe.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has warned that British targets \"on Ukraine's territory and beyond its borders\" could be hit should Ukraine fire British long-range missiles into Russian territory as Cameron has said is permitted. On May 28, Putin warned, \"This constant escalation can lead to serious consequences.\" He asked, \"If these serious consequences occur in Europe, how will the United States behave, bearing in mind our parity in the field of strategic weapons? It's hard to say -- do they want a global conflict?\" In case the U.S. and Europe weren't listening, on June 3, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said, \"I would like to caution American officials against miscalculations which may have fatal consequences. For some unknown reason, they underestimate the seriousness of the rebuff they may receive.\" He urged them to treat Putin's \"very significant warning... with the utmost seriousness.\"\n\nAnd the danger may come not only from long-range missiles but also from troops on the ground. Lieven told me that he expects \"the Russians to do everything they can to locate and kill French trainers in Ukraine, in the hope of deterring others from following suit.\"\n\nSeveral of America's partners have passed the U.S. in the testing of Russian red lines. It is unlikely that the U.S. will be left behind by a newly independent Europe, and it is more likely that the European moves are consistent with the U.S. strategy. It may be clear how the U.S. hopes to benefit from leading from behind; it is less clear how Europe hopes to benefit by being out in front.", "source": {"uri": "original.antiwar.com", "dataType":

The two leaders pledged a \"new era\" for the Russia-China relationship, building on their \"no limits partnership\" struck just before Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. As Putin's first foreign trip since winning reelection in March, the visit showcased his and Russia's enduring stature amid the war in Ukraine.\n\nDespite Russia's 2024 election being marked by systemic repression of serious alternative parties and candidates and decades of brazen statements about Russia's \"managed\" democracy, Putin captured 87 percent of the vote from a record-high voter turnout. Even with some self-censorship and a slight drop in approval, the Russian public still largely backs the war, despite a largely static frontline, the severance of ties with Europe, declines in living standards, and the deaths and injuries of hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers. The staggering number of casualties is mirrored in Ukraine, a nation that Putin and many Russians consider a brotherly nation and the mother culture of Russia.\n\nIn contrast, U.S. domestic support for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began to decline markedly a couple of years after the conflicts began, and predictions of a collapse in Russian public support for the war emerged soon after it began. Yet although the costs of Russia's war in Ukraine continue to escalate and it appears far from conclusion, several reasons have compelled Russian citizens to continue supporting the war and the President who initiated it.\n\nOpposition to war in Russia faces unique challenges not encountered in the U.S., but convincing a population that war is unavoidable is essential for any government to sustain a war effort. The Kremlin has framed the nation's military actions as a noble fight to save ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine from a fascist regime in Kyiv -- a narrative that resonates with many Russians and the country's history in World War II. Highlighting growing restrictions on the Russian language in Ukraine furthers this message, while Russia's excuse that they were answering cries for help in Ukraine echoes their 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia. Russian media also portrays their forces as minimizing civilian casualties, as Ukraine is accused of targeting civilians in Russia, and Ukraine's failure to hold scheduled elections in 2024 has been used to question President Zelensky's legitimacy.\n\nBy portraying Ukraine as the mother culture of Russia, Putin has cast the invasion through a historical and patriotic lens. The conflict is framed as an internal matter of reasserting Russian dominance over the ancestral homeland that birthed Russian language, religion, and political origins, against an illegitimate Ukrainian government that currently occupies the country. Russian nationalism can be rallied by invoking ethnic unity, territorial patrimony, and the need to rectify Ukraine's separation from Moscow, making it easier to dismiss Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\nRussia has also deflected its violations of the UN Charter against non-aggression by depicting itself as an aggrieved party, forced into war by the U.S.-led West and its vassal states, sentiment reflected in national polls, and supported by notable figures like Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico, who in January 2024 stated that Ukraine was under the complete control of Washington. On May 1, 2024, an exhibition of captured Western weapons, vehicles, and equipment since the start of the war opened in Moscow -- much like Kyiv's in May 2022 which showed captured Russian equipment. The Kremlin connects everything to the war -- including the recent attack by ISIS in Moscow. In contrast, the American public increasingly began to believe that U.S. leaders had misled them into the War on Terror, particularly the War in Iraq, which it felt could have been avoided.\n\nRussians' support for the war has manifested as the culmination of decades of \"patriotic mobilization\" that has taken place since Putin's first term. The cultivation of nationalist sentiment, pervasive across media, culture, and politics, has intensified significantly since the invasion. The Russian identity is increasingly intertwined with the existential need to protect Russians abroad, shield Russia from NATO, and bolster Russia's status as a great power.\n\nPreparing and instilling confidence in the Russian armed forces' ability to sustain a major conflict has been ongoing for decades. Russian forces engaged in counterinsurgency operations in Russia's restive region of Chechnya in the 2000s and supported a limited conflict in support of two restive regions in neighboring Georgia in 2008. Subsequently, Russian forces seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and supported a limited conflict in support of Ukraine's restive border region with Russia. In 2015, they launched a major military operation to rescue Syrian President Assad in 2015. With relative success in Syria, the significant escalation of Russia's conflict in Ukraine in 2022 did not come as a surprise. This contrasts with the perceived failures of Western military interventions in the 21st Century, causing domestic confidence in the U.S. military.\n\nBy John P. Ruehl\n\nAuthor Bio: John P.

And though I warned that it was too early to be confident about any predictions, they have held up reasonably well.\n\nWhen Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he envisaged a quick seizure of the capital, Kyiv, and a change of government - much like what the Soviets did in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. But the war is still raging, and no one knows when or how it will end.\n\nIf one sees the conflict as Ukraine's \"war of independence,\" rather than focusing too much on borders, the Ukrainians are already victorious. Putin had denied that Ukraine was a separate nation, but his behaviour has only strengthened Ukrainian national identity.\n\nWhat else have we learned? First, old and new weapons complement each other. Despite the early success of anti-tank weapons in the defence of Kyiv, I warned - correctly - that proclamations about the end of the tank era might prove premature as the battle moved from the northern suburbs to Ukraine's eastern plains. However, I did not anticipate the effectiveness of drones as anti-tank and anti-ship weapons, nor did I expect that Ukraine could drive the Russian navy from the western half of the Black Sea. (Artillery and mines also have played a major role as the conflict has settled into World War I-style trench warfare.)\n\nSecond, nuclear deterrence works, but it depends on relative stakes more than capabilities. The West has been deterred, but only up to a point. Putin's nuclear threat has kept NATO governments from sending troops (though not equipment) to Ukraine. But the reason is not that Russia has superior nuclear capabilities; rather, it is that Putin has designated Ukraine a vital national interest for Russia, whereas Western governments have not. Meanwhile, Putin's nuclear sabre-rattling has not prevented the West from extending the range of the weapons it provides to Ukraine; and the West, so far, has deterred Putin from attacking any NATO countries.\n\nThird, economic interdependence does not prevent war. Some German policymakers assumed that cutting trade ties with Russia would be so costly that neither party would allow for open hostilities. But while economic interdependence can raise the costs of war, it does not necessarily prevent it. More to the point, an uneven economic interdependence can be weaponised by the less dependent party.\n\nFourth, sanctions can raise costs, but they do not determine outcomes in the short term. Recall that CIA Director William Burns met with Putin in November 2021 and warned, to no avail, of impending sanctions should Russia invade. Putin probably doubted that the West could maintain global unity on sanctions, and he was right. Oil is a fungible commodity, and many countries - not least India - are more than happy to import discounted Russian oil transported by an irregular fleet of tankers.\n\nNonetheless, as I anticipated two years ago, China's concerns about getting entangled in secondary sanctions do seem to have set some limits on its support for Russia. While China has provided important \"dual-use technology\" (suitable for either military or civilian purposes), it has abstained from sending weapons. Given this mixed picture, it will be some time before we can fully judge the long-term effect of sanctions on Russia.\n\nFifth, information warfare makes a difference. Modern wars are not only about whose army wins; they are also about whose story wins. The careful disclosure by the United States of intelligence revealing Russia's invasion plans proved effective in debunking the narrative that Putin wanted Europeans to believe, and it contributed greatly to Western solidarity when the invasion occurred as predicted. Equally, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has done an extraordinary job of promoting his country's story in the West.\n\nSixth, both hard and soft power matter. While hard, coercive power trumps the soft power of attraction in the near term, soft power still counts for a lot. Putin failed the soft-power test early on. The sheer barbarism of Russian forces in Ukraine led Germany finally to cancel the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline - an outcome that years of US pressure had failed to bring about. Zelensky, by contrast, has been relying on soft power from the start. Using his skills as an actor to present an attractive portrait of Ukraine, he not only won Western sympathy, but also secured deliveries of the military equipment that underwrites hard power.\n\nSeventh, cyber capability is not a silver bullet. Russia had used cyber weapons to meddle with Ukraine's power grid since at least 2015, and many analysts predicted that a cyber blitz against Ukraine's infrastructure and government would make any invasion a fait accompli. But while there have been many (reported) cyberattacks during the war, none has proved decisive. When the Ukrainians' Viasat network was hacked, they started communicating through Starlink's many small satellites. With training and battlefield experience, Ukrainian cyber defence and offence have only improved.\n\nAnother lesson, then, is that once a war has begun, kinetic weapons provide greater timeliness, precision, and damage assessment for commanders than cyber weapons do. That said, electronic warfare can still interfere with the linkages that are essential to the use of drones.\n\nFinally, war is unpredictable. The most important lesson from the Ukraine war remains one of the oldest. Two years ago, many expected a quick Russian victory; and just one year ago, there were great expectations of a triumphant Ukrainian summer offensive. But as Shakespeare wrote more than four centuries ago, it is dangerous for a leader to \"cry 'Havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war.\"\n\nThe promise of a short war is seductive. Putin certainly never expected to be bogged down indefinitely. He has managed to sell his war of attrition to the Russian people as a \"great patriotic\" struggle against the West. But the dogs he has unleashed could still turn around and bite him.\n\nJoseph S.

(Putin was quoted by the AFP, whose reporters were part of the video call.)\n\nOther topics were covered during the call, including the felony convictions of former US President Donald Trump on hush money paid to a porn star. Putin, like Trump, attempted to frame the US legal system as corrupt, even though the twice-impeached and many-times indicted real-estate heir was unanimously convicted on all 34 counts by a jury of 12 people selected by both the defense and prosecution.\n\n\"It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump... is simply the utilization of the judicial system during an internal political struggle,\" said the autocrat, who in both in theory and practice could never be impeached nor indicted. \"Their supposed leadership in the sphere of democracy is being burned to the ground,\" Putin said.\n\nAn AFP reporter also asked Putin if Russia had imperial ambitions in Ukraine and elsewhere, pointing out the Soviet and Russian imperial flags at the St Petersburg venue (the headquarters of the country's largest energy producer, Gazprom) where the president sat for the interview.\n\n\"There is no need to look for some imperial ambitions of ours.

Those limits will remain in place indefinitely in every region, 24 hours a day.\n\nRussian strikes have now destroyed more than half of Ukraine's power-generating capabilities.\n\nUkrenergo said that

Historically, the forum has been Putin's stage for promoting Russia's progress and attracting international investors.

English prosecutors claim that Russian agents set fire to a warehouse containing aid for Ukraine. Sweden is investigating alleged Russian-sponsored acts of sabotage. The Czech government accuses Moscow of sabotaging its railways, as well.\n\nEstonia, meanwhile, has reportedly uncovered a host of Russian plots on its soil. Russian ships are suspected of targeting communications cables and wind farms in the North Sea. Now, Moscow may be involved in suspicious fires -- including one that engulfed a shopping center -- in Poland. The roster of allegations goes on and on.\n\nRussia naturally denies any culpability, but where there is this much smoke, there is probably some fire. As Prime Minister Kaja Kallas of Estonia has said, Russia seems to be waging a \"shadow war\" against Europe -- a campaign meant to weaken Western support for Ukraine, or at least to punish European countries for providing it. In doing so, President Vladimir Putin is also giving a preview of the hyper-resentful, asymmetrically aggressive Russia that will emerge from the current war.\n\nNo matter what losses Moscow suffers in Ukraine, no matter where the front lines are when the fighting ends, Russia will still occupy one-eighth of the land on earth, and it will still be one of the most important geopolitical actors. Its behavior will shape the security environment in Europe and far beyond.\n\nMany European governments fear Putin is already envisioning new wars: Denmark's defense minister announced that Russia could attack one of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's European members within three to five years.\n\nDon't dismiss this scenario entirely. Putin is militarizing Russian society and raising defense production to record levels. If he doubted America's commitment to Europe -- perhaps because it had once again elected a president who continually derides NATO -- he might be tempted to conduct a smash-and-grab attack, perhaps against the Baltic States, to show just how hollow the alliance had become. Short of that, however, a conventional Russian assault on Europe seems unlikely.\n\nPutin has had to mobilize so much manpower and materiel because his army has suffered such brutal attrition in Ukraine. Even after this war ends, Russian forces will have to occupy whatever Ukrainian territory they still control. Moreover, so long as the U.S. remains committed to NATO, Putin knows that an attack on its members risks starting a war he would ultimately lose. More likely, then, is a thoroughly roguish, occasionally violent Russia -- but one that relies mainly on asymmetric tactics to weaken an alliance he cannot beat head-on.\n\nTo be clear: This isn't just some harassment campaign, some fit of geopolitical pique. These tactics erode Western countries' sovereignty and unsettle their politics.\n\nMost fundamentally, they demonstrate that NATO's defense guarantees can't necessarily stop Russia from perpetrating occasionally violent, if quasi-disguised, acts of aggression in Europe. High-end capabilities bolster below-the-threshold tactics: Russia's nuclear arsenal, which Putin habitually brandishes, helps deter a more muscular Western response.\n\nTwo years ago, I wrote that Russia might become a \"Tehran on the Volga\" -- a weakened but increasingly militant regime that uses proxies and other non-traditional tools. If anything, this sort of Russia is now taking shape even more rapidly than I expected.\n\nNATO will have to continue rearming against an avowedly revisionist, highly mobilized Russia, if only to ensure that full-blown confrontation with the alliance remains a very bad bet. Yet it must also prepare for a long struggle in which a wounded Russia finds creative ways of harrying its foes.

The story has since changed.\n\nA month after Russia entered the civil war in Ukraine in February 2022, both President Joe Biden and the Pentagon were pushing back against aggressive, neocon voices in Congress and the State Dept. who were itching for direct military confrontation with Moscow. Biden and the brass were realists, warning that conflict with Russia could lead to a Third World War.\n\nAs a Caitlin Johnstone column published earlier today on Consortium News indicates, that caution has been dangerously tossed to the wind as the West widely acknowledges Ukraine is losing the war. It is an unacceptable outcome politically ruinous for European and American leaders. By allowing their Ukrainian proxies to use Western weapons to strike Russian territory Western politicians are threatening us all merely to save their political careers.\n\nIt \"draws Biden even deeper into a war in which Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly raised the prospect of a nuclear strike,\" said The Washington Post.\n\nCN Editor-in-Chief Joe Lauria wrote the following piece in March 2022 explaining how the White House and the Pentagon were previously restraining recklessness in Washington. That was then and this is now. It shows how unthinkably far we've come in this conflict.\n\nThe Pentagon has been engaged in a consequential battle with the U.S. State Department and the Congress to prevent a direct military confrontation with Russia, which could unleash the most unimaginable horror of war.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is caught in the middle of the fray. So far he is siding with the Defense Department, saying there cannot be any kind of NATO no-fly zone over Ukraine fighting Russian aircraft because \"that's called World War III, okay? Let's get it straight here, guys. We will not fight the third world war in Ukraine.\"\n\n\"President Biden's been clear that U.S. troops won't fight Russia in Ukraine, and if you establish a no-fly zone, certainly in order to enforce that no-fly zone, you'll have to engage Russian aircraft. And again, that would put us at war with Russia,\" said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin earlier this month. (The administration plan is to bring down the Russian government through a ground insurgency and economic war, not a direct military one.)\n\nBut pressure on the White House from some members of Congress and especially the press corps is unrelenting to recklessly bring NATO directly into the war.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken who initially said NATO had given a \"green light\" to send planes from Poland to Ukraine had to back down and now opposes any no-fly zone involving NATO.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also supported the Polish planes scheme, which was shot down by the Pentagon because it \"could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,\" according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, hailed as a virtual superhero in Western media, has vacillated between openness to negotiating a peace settlement with Russia and calling for NATO, again on Friday, to \"close the skies\" above Ukraine. To save his country he appears willing to risk endangering the entire world.\n\nMeanwhile, Western corporate media, depending almost exclusively on Ukrainian sources, report that Russia is losing the war, with its military offensive \"stalled,\" and in frustration has deliberately targeted civilians and flattened cities.\n\nBiden has bought into this part of the story, calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"war criminal.\" He has also said that Russia is planning a \"false flag\" chemical attack to pin on Ukraine.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the Pentagon took the bold step of leaking two stories to reporters that contradict those tales. \"Russia's conduct in the brutal war tells a different story than the widely accepted view that Vladimir Putin is intent on demolishing Ukraine and inflicting maximum civilian damage -- and it reveals the Russian leader's strategic balancing act,\" reported Newsweek in an article entitled, \"Putin's Bombers Could Devastate Ukraine But He's Holding Back. Here's Why.\"\n\nThe piece quotes an unnamed analyst at the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) saying, \"The heart of Kyiv has barely been touched. And almost all of the long-range strikes have been aimed at military targets.\"\n\nA retired U.S. Air Force officer now working as an analyst for a Pentagon contractor, added: \"We need to understand Russia's actual conduct. If we merely convince ourselves that Russia is bombing indiscriminately, or [that] it is failing to inflict more harm because its personnel are not up to the task or because it is technically inept, then we are not seeing the real conflict.\"\n\nThe article says:\n\n\"As of the past weekend, in 24 days of conflict, Russia has flown some 1,400 strike sorties and delivered almost 1,000 missiles (by contrast, the United States flew more sorties and delivered more weapons in the first day of the 2003 Iraq war). ...\n\nA proportion of those strikes have damaged and destroyed civilian structures and killed and injured innocent civilians, but the level of death and destruction is low compared to Russia's capacity.\n\n'I know it's hard ... to swallow that the carnage and destruction could be much worse than it is,' says the DIA analyst. 'But that's what the facts show. This suggests to me, at least, that Putin is not intentionally attacking civilians, that perhaps he is mindful that he needs to limit damage in order to leave an out for negotiations.'\"\n\nA second retired U.S. Air Force officer says:\n\n\"I'm frustrated by the current narrative -- that Russia is intentionally targeting civilians, that it is demolishing cities, and that Putin doesn't care. Such a distorted view stands in the way of finding an end before true disaster hits or the war spreads to the rest of Europe. I know that the news keeps repeating that Putin is targeting civilians, but there is no evidence that Russia is intentionally doing so. In fact, I'd say that Russian could be killing thousands more civilians if it wanted to.\"\n\nThese Pentagon sources confirm what Putin and the Russian Ministry of Defense have been saying all along: that instead of being \"stalled,\" Russia is executing a methodical war plan to encircle cities, opening humanitarian corridors for civilians, leaving civilian infrastructure like water, electricity, telephony and internet intact, and trying to avoid as many civilian casualties as possible.\n\nUntil these Pentagon leaks it was difficult to confirm that Russia was entirely telling the truth and that corporate media were publishing fables cooked up by Ukraine's publicity machine.\n\nNo Evidence of Chemicals\n\nThe Pentagon's mettle will be tested if there is a chemical weapons attack in Ukraine. Biden has said Russia would pay a \"severe price\" but who the perpetrator would be might be murky. Whoever might be behind such an attack, the calls for direct military action are sure to increase in the U.S. media, the Congress and perhaps internally at the State Dept.\n\nThe second mainstream article directly undermines Biden's dramatic warning. Reuters reported: \"The United States has not yet seen any concrete indications of an imminent Russian chemical or biological weapons attack in Ukraine but is closely monitoring streams of intelligence for them, a senior U.S. defense official said.\"\n\nIt quoted the Pentagon official as saying, \"There's no indication that there's something imminent in that regard right now.\" Neither The New York Times nor The Washington Post published the Reuters article, which appeared in the more obscure U.S. News and World Report.\n\nNever let the facts get in the way of a good story -- even if it could lead to the most devastating consequences in history.\n\nUPDATED to add details of Blinken and Pelosi's support for NATO jets from Poland entering the war and the Pentagon's move to stop it; additional quotes from a second retired Air Force officer in the Newsweek story and the challenge to the Pentagon to keep NATO out of the war if there is a chemical weapons attack.", "source":

He called for strikes on military targets in NATO nations in response to recent decisions by some member states to authorize Ukraine to use donated weapons to attack targets inside Russia.\n\n\"In addition, since we realize that the task is set and is ongoing, there is no plan B; the destruction of Russia, it means we must create all conditions for inflicting colossal damage to the manpower and equipment of NATO troops stationed anywhere in the world,\" Solovyov said.\n\n\"This means we must support all proxy movements, supplying them with everything they need, no matter where in the world they are located,\" he added.\n\nRussia must \"cause so much trouble for these countries that they have the least amount of attention and time to work with us,\" Solovyov said.\n\n\"Military plants and warehouses throughout NATO territory should be blown up if they produce and house equipment designed to strike Russia,\" he added. \"You want World War III?

This is because he occupies a prominent place on Vladimir Putin's blacklist and considers himself to be \"the most radical of his opponents.\" Back in 2005 -- after being the number one chess player in the world for two decades -- he retired from the competition to fight the Russian leader. He now chairs the Human Rights Foundation and the Renew Democracy Initiative (RDI), while continuing to publish books and attend conferences. Kasparov, who has visited 104 countries, has lived in New York City since 2013. This is where he received EL PA\u00cdS.\n\nOnce known as the Ogre of Baku -- due to the terror that the Azerbaijan-born Kasparov caused among his rivals on the board -- his voice sounds firm and powerful, even when he speaks about the threats to his life. He only breaks a little when he has to talk about his strong-willed mother, who died on Christmas Day in 2020. He wasn't able to attend her funeral in Moscow.\n\nQuestion. By 2012, the three most popular leaders of the opposition to Putin were Boris Nemtsov (killed in 2015), Alexei Navalny (who was poisoned, imprisoned and died four months ago under unexplained circumstances) and you. Putin has placed you on his list of \"terrorists and extremists.\" Could you be the next victim?\n\nAnswer. Maybe yes, maybe not. Who knows? They consider me an enemy of the state... and I am. Now, being included on that list is another sign. But I don't want to think about it, because it doesn't change my beliefs. Many of my friends or fellow fighters are dead or imprisoned. Most of us are in exile. Nemtsov and Navalny are the best known, but the list is very long. The irony is that we haven't done anything related to terrorism, but those who are pursuing us are well-known terrorists or thieves. But this is the situation in 2024: war is called peace. And there will be no solution so long as Putin remains in power. It's very difficult for me to answer these types of questions, especially when my wife is in front of me. But I think about how many Ukrainians have died from Russian bombs and I realize that my position is much better.\n\nQ. But how do you live with that fear of being murdered?\n\nA. I don't think about it, I don't panic. I can't do anything except minimize the risks, because I don't want to betray my principles and my friends, especially the dead ones. I take safety measures; I travel much less than before. I don't go to countries where I know I would be in serious danger and I protect myself a lot in others. For example, I would never go to Vienna, London, Dubai, Hungary [or] Turkey without very strict safety measures, because there are many Russian agents in those places. There are barely a dozen [countries that] I can trust with any degree of confidence. But there's no way I'm going to stop doing what I've been doing for so many years. Also, I can't show weakness, because that's not a good sign for a leader.\n\nQ. In 2008, you were already living your life while surrounded by bodyguards.\n\nA. Yes. In reality, that protection is useless when the state wants to kill you. But during that period -- which I call \"vegetarian\" -- the danger wasn't that [the government] would kill me, but rather [that they would deploy] other kinds of violence, which I prevented [by having bodyguards]. In 2007, I was arrested. In February of 2013, I decided to leave. When I was already traveling abroad and was called as a witness in a trial, Nemtsov warned me not to return, because my life was in danger. I listened to him. Unfortunately, he was too proud to follow his own advice and he was murdered.\n\nQ. You once said: \"I can't stand the prospect of my children living in a dictatorship disguised as democracy.\" The situation is much worse today than back then. Do you still hope to return to a democratic Russia one day?\n\nA. To begin with, the two children from my last marriage live in a free country: the USA. And I do maintain the hope of returning to a democratic Russia. That process may take a year or two, or more... but I believe that it will happen. For this, it's essential that everyone understands that the war will continue as long as Putin is in power, because Putin means war, with a damaged and deceptive economy, because it's based on printing money and spending it on war. And it's especially important that people understand this in Europe.\n\nBy the way, I'm very struck by the fact that Portugal is the country with the most people opposed to Putin. But what they understand in Germany is that they must prepare for another war, instead of trying to win this one. Certainly, if Ukraine doesn't defeat Russia in this war, there will be another, because Putin cannot stop and has already hinted as much. It may be against Moldova or the Baltic countries, but war is what keeps him alive. And he's willing to cross all red lines.\n\nQ. Is Russia still an empire?\n\nA. Yes, it's the last real empire, because China doesn't really act like one. And that's an added reason to want Russia to lose the war, because it's likely that it will then cease to be an empire and have a place among democratic countries.\n\nQ. It's difficult for non-Russians to accept how big Russia is, from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok. How much reliable information about Putin or the invasion of Ukraine do citizens living deep in Russia receive?\n\nA. I don't believe in that argument of associating the persistence of war with ignorance. Now, we cannot know for certain, because the polls aren't reliable [regarding] what percentage of the Russian population is now in favor of war. At first, it was very high... but now, I don't think it exceeds 30%, especially in big cities. And Putin has been careful to recruit many people from depressed areas, as well as prisoners. Few [recruits have come] from Moscow until now. But when he has no choice but to do so, public opinion can easily turn against him.\n\nPutin successfully sold the concept that the war was Russia against the West. And the West has made the big mistake of treating all Russians equally, whether or not they're in favor of the war and Putin. There are people who have fought against Putin all their lives and who are now treated by Western countries as if they're criminals. That's why I'm proposing to create a kind of Russian Taiwan: that is, those Russian citizens who have demonstrated against the war and Putin -- those in favor of Crimea being Ukraine -- will be protected and supported. If that idea works, it will help isolate Putin and cause many talented people to abandon him. Surely we would have done it during World War II with the German scientists. So, why don't we do it now, with the Russians? The problem is that many politicians -- not those in the Baltic countries or Poland, who see the threat as being very close -- don't look beyond the next four years. And they want to play it safe, without assuming that winning the war means defeating Russia and Putin, with decisive and short-term actions.\n\nQ. Is there any truth in that clich\u00e9 that many Russians need a tsar, a strongman in charge of the country?\n\nA. This idea that entire nations can be dumbed down to be governed by their beloved leader doesn't stand up to historical analysis. Look at Korea, divided for 70 years: the North is as you say, but the South is a very advanced democracy. Or in the old Germany, East and West. Or in China and Taiwan.\n\nWhat history tells us is that countries with a greater democratic tradition, such as the Anglo-Saxon or Scandinavian ones, function better. But no country is prevented from having authentic democratic institutions. Support for Putin is largely passive: war is war, what can we do? And furthermore, the war machine benefits the elite. It's true that sanctions may prevent them from enjoying their mansions in Paris or Marbella, but they've already found some ways to live very well. And it's true that Putin is still the strongman for them. Therefore, since we're talking about a fascist dictatorship, we cannot expect the elites to rebel. Today, in Russia, you can be jailed for a tweet. If we look at other wars in history, the only way to weaken Putin's position is for the population to think that they can lose the war.\n\nQ. In 2016, you said: \"Putin is a strong leader in the same way that arsenic is a strong drink.\" Do you want to update that sentence with everything that has happened since then?\n\nA. He updates it himself with his actions. The facts make it clear that leaders like Putin are poison to the world. He needs blood and more blood, like a drug, and he will never stop seeking it.\n\nQ. In an interview you gave on Spanish TV at the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, you said that we shouldn't fear the potential use of nuclear weapons by Putin, because to press that button, Putin's finger isn't enough: at least two other people's fingers are necessary. But, knowing Putin, how confident can we be that he won't force those two people to push the button?\n\nA. I still think that the nuclear risk is very low, although it will never be zero. I think the main fear of the U.S. -- of the Biden administration -- isn't that. [Their fear] is that Putin loses the war and Russia falls into even worse hands... which would also mean the rise of China as a great power. That's why their help to Ukraine is so timid.\n\nRegarding nuclear weapons, there are two types. The strategic ones (large missiles) and the tactical ones. As for the former, I believe that the risk of Putin using them is almost zero, because a large part of the ones he has are very old and because of the terrible consequences for Russia that this would have. As for tactical ones, in fact, it's not easy to convince several people in the Russian high command to make a decision that involves such tremendous risk, because the U.S. response would be immediate and very harsh. And [nukes] can also be used to destroy many tanks, but perhaps not to win the war. The functioning of the Russian mafia isn't based on loyalty until death, but on loyalty in exchange for benefits. That general who must press the button will think of his family and his assets before doing so. It's one thing to kill for one's country, but quite another to die for it.\n\nQ. But you maintain that this game cannot end in a draw.\n\nA. Exactly. I believe that the plan for Ukraine must be liberation, reparation and justice. They're the elements of a strategy that consists of Ukraine winning and Russia losing. To achieve that, Western countries have more than enough weapons and resources. The combined GDP of NATO countries is 25:1 compared to that of Russia, Iran and North Korea combined, excluding China. But the current situation of investment in the war is very far from that proportion. In fact, it favors Russia. Correcting that by sending Ukraine, for example, some of the 12,000 tanks that the U.S. has in its warehouses would achieve liberation.\n\nAs for justice, it's very important that there be a list of all Russian war criminals to scare and divide the Russian bureaucracy. It's one thing to be labeled a thief or gangster, quite another to be identified as a war criminal. For example, the mayor of Moscow is a thief, but not a war criminal. Perhaps he can be negotiated with. But we need a strategy. And today, we don't have one.\n\nQ. In any case, what Europe does could be decisive, given the prospect of Trump being re-elected.\n\nA. I totally agree. Europe has enough resources. And NATO still exists. Therefore, it must be active. All military experts agree that a joint action by the northeastern countries (Finland, Sweden, the Baltic countries, Poland, etc) would be enough to win the war.\n\nQ. In your book Winter is Coming (2015), you predicted the misfortunes that have occurred over the last decade and warned about how dangerous Putin is. If you were to write an updated version now, what would be your new warnings or predictions?\n\nA. I'm a born optimist, as you well know. I believe democracy will survive, but the question is the price we will pay. If you asked me a year ago, I would have had more confidence in the victory of Ukraine and the transformation of Russia. Now, I still think [democracy will survive]... but the price will be higher.\n\nPutin's regime is a cancer. And you can't negotiate with cancer: you have to cut it. Right now, there's a struggle in the world -- not only in Ukraine and Russia -- between freedom and tyranny. And I fear that things are going to get worse before they get better. For example, Europeans don't realize that the consequences of this war are everywhere. For example, [Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro wouldn't have dared to claim Essequibo if he weren't inspired by Putin and saw signs of weakness in Europe and the U.S. And in Africa, the influence of Russia and China is greatly increasing. Let's not forget that a good part of the raw material for our cell phones is there.\n\nMore people can die in one hour in Sudan than in Gaza. And no one talks about this problematic global situation. I am, of course, in favor of fighting climate change, which can end everything in 100 years. But what are we doing to fix today's problems? In short, I still trust that democracy will prevail, but at a very high price.\n\nQ. Putin, Netanyahu, Trump, Biden, Xi Jinping... who is the best chess player?\n\nA. In general, the comparison of today's politicians with chess players makes me uncomfortable, because in most cases it's insulting. Putin has always been a poker player, with his ability to bluff. He has nothing to do with chess, where 100% of the information is available [for each player] to make a decision. And Trump is the same: he doesn't believe in the same values as you and me. While the U.S. is a solid democracy, Trump's lack of attachment to the law is obvious. Biden doesn't count for me, because he can barely talk or walk. Netanyahu is a morality dealer who doesn't care about the price. He was democratically elected, but now he needs war to survive. The most complicated case to analyze is Xi Jinping. He's a dictator, without a doubt... but at least he has a strategy. While I don't like him at all, that brings him closer to a chess player.\n\nQ. Teachers today have a big problem: what to teach with the guarantee that it will be useful 10 years from now, in a world that's changing at rapid speed. But knowing how to think will still be useful. And chess teaches us how to think.\n\nA. Indeed, traditional teaching methods -- such as reading books or accumulating information -- no longer work, because that information can become obsolete in a matter of days, or you can become saturated by excessive information. Chess can be a critical thinking tool, an algorithm to select the really important information, analyze it and create your own opinion. Ultimately, it's about moving from what to how. Chess isn't a magic solution, but it serves, for example, for children to understand that each action is connected to others and has its consequences, as well as the relative value of each piece in a position. Very few games can offer that algorithm in the way that chess can.\n\nQ. Artificial intelligence is also one of your favorite fields of research. Do you think that it can put an end to chess as a sport, due to the ease of cheating with the help of very powerful computers?\n\nA. First of all, this danger isn't only for chess. It's a global threat, even in much more important fields. If we stick to chess -- in addition to the actual cheating -- there's a growing paranoia of thinking that everyone cheats. Regarding elite tournaments, I think there are technological and other measures, such as delaying the broadcast of games over the internet, [or ensuring that some games] are strictly live, to prevent that. It's true that solutions for massive tournaments will be more difficult. Now, if we're being pragmatic, every time there's a cheating scandal, the number of fans increases...\n\nIn any case, the contribution of computing and artificial intelligence to chess is much more positive than negative. For example, it's fantastic that my defeat to the Deep Blue computer in 1997 was exploited by IBM for important advances in science. Or that today, [Google] DeepMind has made enormous advances in biology, thanks to what it learned with its chess and Go programs.\n\nQ. How do you feel when someone says that Magnus Carlsen of Norway is the best player in history?\n\nA. I don't argue about that because it's very subjective. [I don't know] how much my 20 consecutive years as number one in the world are valued. Also, Magnus himself doesn't say that.\n\nQ. In December of 1985, a month-and-a-half after you became the youngest world champion in history, at the age of 22, EL PA\u00cdS did a profile about you. Your mother said: \"Always being number one is very hard. Therefore, living for the pleasure of living is something that neither my son nor I understand.\"\n\nA. She maintained that formula until her final days. And the truth is that it worked very well for me. Her life revolved around me... that's why it was so tragic that, when she died [on December 25, 2020], I couldn't be there [due to the risk of being detained]. All she wanted at that moment was to die next to me.\n\nWith age, living with two children -- and being in constant contact with my daughter -- I've become less harsh. I seek to have some free time for my family. Most of my time is spent fighting Putin and improving democracy in the U.S. through my organization, RDI. I also train young chess talents. And I give lectures on various topics, including artificial intelligence. My life is full of struggle, but in a world as turbulent as the current one, my refuge is my family.\n\nQ. Are you a reasonably happy person?\n\nA. In general, yes, because, in addition to my family stability, I see that some of the actions that I undertake or support to help Ukraine are successful, such as the recent decision made by the U.S. Congress (Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S. weapons on parts of Russian territory). I clearly see the path I must follow, although I know it's dangerous, and what I must do. And I also know what things I do well.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leontxo_garcia@english.elpais.com", "name": "Leontxo

U.S. and NATO support for Ukraine in the war with Russia has been one long failure, but that hasn't stopped them from escalating the war with new weapons and tactics.\n\nRussia has met the escalation with its own escalation every step of the way. At what point do rational leaders in the West (if there are any left) pause, consider that the war is lost in Ukraine, deescalate and seek a treaty to end the war?\n\nThere's no sign of that yet. In fact, all of the signs point to further escalation, which is a sure path to nuclear war. What good has escalation accomplished?\n\nThe West supplied Ukraine with HIMARS precision-guided artillery, but that largely failed because the Russians quickly learned how to jam the GPS guidance systems, so the missiles went off course.\n\nThat doesn't mean the Russians shoot down or jam every HIMARS rocket Ukraine launches. Some will always get through. But overall, their effectiveness has been limited compared with expectations.\n\nThe U.S. and NATO also supplied Ukraine with Abrams, Leopard and Challenger tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles that have been left burning on the battlefield. They also require intensive maintenance Ukraine can't necessarily provide, and are often unsuited for the battlefield conditions in Ukraine. Many Ukrainian soldiers have actually expressed a preference for Russian-made equipment over NATO's.\n\nNot Wonder Weapons\n\nMeanwhile, the Patriot anti-missiles systems cannot shoot down Russian hypersonic missiles and have been destroyed one-by-one at a cost of $1 billion each. F-16s are the next wonder weapon promised. But Russia fields the most sophisticated air defense system in the world. Many planes will be shot down by Russian S-400 anti-aircraft batteries and other systems.\n\nThese planes are also old, obsolete models from NATO inventories at the end of their service lives. And they can't even be flown by Ukrainian pilots since they barely read English (the training manuals and maintenance manuals are all in English) and have not had enough time to train.\n\nIt takes about two years to become a competent F-16 fighter pilot; the Ukrainians have barely had six months to learn. F-16s are also unsuited for the often rugged airfield conditions in Ukraine (they require pristine runways so debris doesn't get sucked into their engines on takeoff).\n\nThey can be operated from NATO bases but that opens another can of worms.\n\nNATO's Latest Harebrained Scheme\n\nWhat's the next harebrained scheme from NATO? Here's the latest example. The U.S. and its allies have green-lighted missile attacks deep inside Russia using U.S.-made ATACMS ballistic missiles with a range of up to 190 miles.\n\nThese attacks have hit civilian targets such as the Russian city of Belgorod and critical military targets such as the Russian nuclear missile radar warning arrays. Both types of attacks are prompting a severe Russian response, including the final destruction of the entire Ukrainian power grid.\n\nThe attack on Russia's early warning system is particularly provocative. Ukraine used U.K.-supplied drones to strike this radar system used by Russia to detect incoming nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia already adhere to what's called the \"launch on warning\" doctrine. This means that if you detect incoming nuclear missiles, you don't wait for them to hit their targets.\n\nInstead, you launch your counterattack as soon as you detect the missiles. When it comes to nuclear war, it's use it or lose it.\n\nThat puts the world on a hair trigger. Hitting a radar facility that's part of a nuclear defense creates a blind spot in that defense and makes the hair trigger even more sensitive and launch prone.\n\nAnd while Ukraine may have technically launched the missiles into Russia, it could not have done so without precise targeting data provided by the U.S. and its NATO allies. How do you think the U.S. would react if Mexico attacked U.S. targets using targeting data provided by Russia? It would directly implicate Russia and hold it responsible.\n\nHere's another question: Why would Ukraine attack this radar system at all? Ukraine doesn't have nuclear missiles so it has no reason to compromise Russia's nuclear defenses. The radar has no impact on the ground war in Ukraine. It wasn't an airfield or ammo depot or any other militarily relevant target.\n\nThis plan is just another example of dangerous escalation by the U.S. and NATO and moves the world one step closer to nuclear war. Ukraine is all too happy to comply.\n\n\"Don't Worry!\"\n\nProponents of escalation dismiss these concerns, saying we've already crossed multiple \"red lines\" and Russia hasn't directly retaliated against us. Maybe against Ukraine, but not us. We can therefore go ahead and cross another red line, the Russians won't do anything.\n\nFirst off, that just provides more evidence that Vladimir Putin isn't some bloodthirsty maniac who can't be deterred. He obviously can be, and clearly recognizes the dangers of escalation. He doesn't want war with the U.S. and NATO. Why would he?\n\nSecondly, and more importantly, NATO's arming and equipping of Ukraine was never a red line for Russia. Western observers simply assumed that providing HIMARS, ATACMSs and tanks would be red lines for Russia. But Russia never specifically said they were. They warned about the overall threat of escalation, but these weren't specific red lines.\n\nBut direct attacks on Russian soil are a different matter. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin himself have issued specific warnings about NATO facilitation of attacks within Russia itself. That's the difference. Here's what Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, had to say:\n\nRussia regards all long-range weapons used by Ukraine as already being directly controlled by servicemen from NATO countries. This is no military assistance, this is participation in a war against us. And such actions could well become a casus belli. Nobody today can rule out the conflict's transition to its final stage.\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to understand what he means by the conflict's \"final stage.\" Now, Medvedev often issues provocative statements. But listen to the comments of Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov. It's about as strongly worded as a diplomatic statement can get:\n\nI would like to warn American leaders against miscalculations that could have fatal consequences. For unknown reasons, they underestimate the seriousness of the rebuff they may receive.\n\nExcept the reasons aren't unknown. It's because the West is led by incompetent and reckless people who don't know what they're doing. They don't understand that they're playing with fire.\n\nHow Nuclear War Starts\n\nI began studying nuclear war fighting in 1969 and have continued my studies for decades, which includes all the leading thinkers about nuclear war. While the experts disagree in certain respects, they all agree on one thing:\n\nThe most likely path to nuclear war is escalation. No one wakes up and says, \"Nice day for a nuclear war. Let's start one.\"\n\nInstead, war will be the result of a process of one side raising the stakes, the other side responding in kind and escalating further and so on in successive rounds until one party is backed into a corner and has no choice but to use nuclear weapons in an existential response.\n\nIronically, in that situation, the party that is less threatened may actually start the nuclear war in order to get the first-strike advantage. The result is annihilation: not just World War III, but possibly the end of most human life on Earth. Those that survive would probably wish they hadn't.\n\nThis is incomprehensible. Ukraine is trying to drag the U.S. directly into the war with U.S. boots on the ground. Events may not get that far.\n\nWe may be destroyed in a nuclear World War III if this reckless escalation continues. Will anyone stop it?", "source": {"uri": "dailyreckoning.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Reckoning"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rickards@dailyreckoning.com", "name": "James Rickards",

At the same time there has been doubt that he would ever resort to using a nuclear weapon against a NATO country as it appear to lead to an armageddon scenario where all countries involved would be wiped into oblivion.\n\nBut Yuri Felshtinsky, author of Blowing up Russia with Alexander Litvinenko, who was later assassinated by the Kremlin regime, told The Mirror that Putin does have a plan to defeat Europe using nuclear warfare that he could use if he doesn't get his way in Ukraine.\n\nHe sees Putin as bidding to create a \"new world order\" and he could try to bring it about with a nuclear strike from Belarus and not Russia which would be \"suicidal\". Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko is a close ally of Putin and his country has provided logistical support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While Belarus has sent no troops it did allow for Russian forces to enter Ukraine from the country during the initial offensive in February 2022.\n\n\"Putin considers this war to be a permanent war for a new world order. This may seem extreme, but it is not,\" said Mr Felshtinsky. \"Lenin was fighting for the world revolution. Trotsky was fighting for the permanent revolution. Stalin was taking one country after another and was stopped in Eastern Europe only because Americans created nuclear weapons first.\n\n\"The Soviet government was increasing its world domination by creating 'socialist system' states in Asia, Africa, and even Cuba, right near the USA's nose. So, Putin is not original. The difference is that he is proclaiming that Russia can win a nuclear war.\n\n\"To use nuclear weapons to strike against the USA from the territory of Russia would be suicidal. To use it from the territory of Belarus to strike against Eastern Europe might be seen as a tactical move that guarantees capitulation of Europe and victory over the USA, since this scenario might happen only if the USA capitulates to Donald Trump first.\"\n\nMr Felshtinsky has talked about Russia having a strong and sophisticated spy network which is involved in subversive activity across Europe. He feels part of this activity is to gauge how the UK would react to a nuclear strike by Belarus.\n\n\"Yes, but also to gauge what the UK's reaction would be if a tactical nuclear missile were launched from Belarus against Poland or Lithuania or one of the Baltic states were invaded\" he said. \"However, since Britain has a history of fighting alone against an enemy from 1939 to 1941 it understands the situation in which Ukraine is now much better than France or Germany and is willing to help Ukraine even if the USA under Trump's pressure withdraws from the involvement into European affairs - what we should expect to happen if Trump wins elections in November of 2024.\"\n\nAnd of the level of espionage by Russia, he added: \"They are involved in subversive activity all over Europe and this activity increased with the war in Ukraine since from the point of view of the Russian government they are fighting not against the Ukraine but against NATO countries.\"\n\nPutin was in Belarus on a two-day trip last week which is believed to have focused on security and exercises with tactical nuclear weapons. It is believed that Belarus will take part in the exercises with Putin quoted as saying before the meeting: \"Part of this is the direct participation of our Belarusian friends and colleagues in the military sphere in these events.\"\n\nMaj Gen Pavel Muraveyka, who was appointed as chief of Belarus' General Staff and as first deputy defence minister, is known for publicly threatening neighbouring NATO members Poland and Lithuania. In October 2023, he said that Belarus could seize the so-called Suwalki Gap -- a sparsely populated stretch of land running about 60 miles along the Polish-Lithuanian border. It links Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia with the rest of the NATO alliance and separates Belarus from Kaliningrad, a heavily militarized Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea that has no land connection to Russia.\n\nMilitary analysts in the West have long viewed the Suwalki Gap as a potential flashpoint in any confrontation between Russia and NATO. They worry that Russia might try to seize the gap and cut off the three Baltic states from Poland and other NATO nations.\n\n\"Muraveiko's appointment is an open challenge to the West and a desire to show Putin Minsk's complete loyalty and willingness to maintain a strategic partnership with Russia,\" said Belarusian analyst Valery Karbalevich. \"The deployment of Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus does not leave Lukashenko a strategic choice, turns him into a hostage of the Kremlin and firmly binds Minsk to Moscow's policies.\"\n\nBoth Russia and Belarus began military drills involving tactical nuclear weapons earlier this month. Moscow said its drills, announced publicly for the first time on May 6, were a response to statements by Western officials signalling possibly deeper involvement in the war in Ukraine. Belarus launched its manoeuvres involving missiles and warplanes capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons on May 7; Russia's exercises began this week.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk",

The first year was largely defined by the Russian army's highly public missteps, from gas-less tanks stranded on the roadside to Russian soldiers redeploying to the Donbas after a failed push to take Kyiv. Then came Ukraine's swift September 2022 counteroffensive in Kharkiv. The Ukrainians were riding high in November 2022, so much so that US intelligence agencies picked up chatter that Russian generals were talking about the use of tactical nuclear warheads. The situation, however, has deteriorated for the Ukrainians ever since.\n\nThe capture of Kherson in November 2022 was the high-water mark of Ukraine's progress. Since then, the battlefield situation has slowly rebounded to Russia's advantage. Moscow has regained more territory over the last two months than Ukraine did during its entire counteroffensive last year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is frustrated by Russia's current operations in Kharkiv, leading Washington to loosen its ban on using US-supplied weapons to hit targets inside Russia. All of this leads to the inevitable question: At what point should Ukraine shift its strategy from total military victory toward a good-enough peace?\n\nFor many, even talking about the possibility of a diplomatic settlement with Russia is blasphemy. Russia, after all, is the aggressor, invading a sovereign neighbor and committing countless atrocities in the process. Its president, Vladimir Putin, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes. Ukraine is the victim, the logic goes, and forcing it to sit down at the same table with its victimizer leaves a sour taste in our mouths. All of that may be true to a degree. International politics, though, isn't a morality contest -- it's at times an ugly, highly competitive slugfest between states where the ideal is rarely attainable.\n\nTo date, Zelensky has been adamant: Ukraine will only negotiate with Russia after it withdraws its troops from every inch of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which has been under Russian occupation for more than a decade. Zelensky's 10-point peace plan, which demands a total Russian military withdrawal, Russian compensation for war damage and war crime prosecutions for Russian soldiers, is in effect a surrender document for Moscow. Zelensky will reiterate those same terms this month, when dozens of countries assemble in Switzerland for a so-called peace summit.\n\nYet that plan, although desirable, is simply not credible. In fact, given the current state of the war, as well as Putin's willingness to sacrifice Russia's future to maintain the roughly 20% of Ukrainian territory his forces now occupy, Zelensky's position is downright delusional. This is one of the worst-kept secrets in international relations, one the Biden administration likely recognizes behind the scenes. The White House, of course, is highly unlikely to state this obvious fact openly. First, doing so would cause extreme strain between Washington and Kyiv at a time when both are working to hold Ukraine's defensive lines. Second, the US would be embarrassing Zelensky by in essence calling his peace proposal a fool's errand. And the impact on morale within the Ukrainian army could be significant -- who would risk their life for a draw?\n\nBut none of these considerations outweigh the facts on and off the battlefield -- and whether we like it or not, those facts now favor Russia. While Russia's casualties are steep -- the UK Ministry of Defense estimates that 465,000 Russians have been killed or wounded thus far -- the Russian government is preparing for a war that could last for years. Putin is consistently throwing bodies into the fight -- approximately 30,000 Russians are joining the ranks every month -- and is providing lucrative bonuses and benefits to entice more young men to join. Despite stringent US and European Union sanctions, Russia has managed to redirect its crude to the east (mainly to China and India), garnering tens of billions of dollars for the treasury. The Russian economy is sustaining the war effort just as the war is sustaining the Russian economy.\n\nUkraine, like Russia, doesn't have unlimited resources. But unlike Russia, it has less of pretty much everything -- less fighting-aged men, less artillery shells available and less wealth to spend on a war that continues to churn with no end in sight. The Ukrainian army is stretched along a 600-mile frontline that has only gotten longer after Russia's latest push into Kharkiv, forcing Kyiv to redirect troops that would otherwise be reinforcing the line in the Donbas.\n\nMeanwhile, Zelensky remains hesitant to call a general mobilisation to give soldiers fighting at the front continuously for the last two years the time to rest, lest it spur political turmoil in Kyiv or further shrink the Ukrainian workforce.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that Zelensky should wave the white flag. Nothing is inevitable in war; the side that makes territorial gains this week could very well be retreating the next. The $61 billion infusion of new US aid to Ukraine is just starting to pour in, and the Ukrainians will want to see whether the latest tranche will enable them to recover lost ground. Any diplomatic settlement will also depend on Putin -- if the Russian president refuses to actually compromise, then there won't be much for Ukraine to talk about. But it's long past time for observers of this war and US policymakers who are involved in it to drop their delusions about total military victory. Like most wars in history, this one will end through a diplomatic process with which none of the sides will be particularly enamored. The only question is how exhausted Ukraine and Russia need to become to finally negotiate seriously.", "source": {"uri": "gulftoday.ae", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Gulf Today"}, "authors": [],

Credit: Ukraine's General Staff\n\nRussia has concentrated around 550,000 occupiers in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine and near the border, a source in the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense told LIGA.net.\n\nEarlier, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said that Russia is deploying more manpower and equipment to the front. The minister stated that Russia had around 500,000 troops positioned in Ukraine and near its borders, with plans to increase this number by an additional 200,000-300,000.\n\nUmerov once again called on Western partners to supply more weapons, as the country needs more firepower, including long-range missiles. He said Ukraine was grateful for the military aid and weapons provided by its allies, but only half of the promised equipment arrived on time, which benefited Russia in its new offensive on Kharkiv Oblast.\n\nSources told LIGA that the current number of Russian forces is up to 520,000 soldiers. Paramilitary units fighting on Moscow's side aren't included in this number.\n\nThe source noted that 32,000 members of the Russian National Guard, the Federal Security Service, and other security forces who perform law enforcement duties are serving in the temporarily occupied territories.\n\nAt the same time, on 24 February 2022, the day when Russia commenced its war on Ukraine, the number of Russian invaders who entered Ukraine was estimated at up to 180,000 soldiers. In November 2023, there were more than 400,000 occupiers on Ukrainian territory.\n\nMeanwhile, a new study showed that 49 % of German citizens support allowing Ukrainian attacks with Western weapons on targets inside Russia, while 44 % oppose the idea.\n\nGermans divided over permitting Ukraine to strike targets in Russia, poll finds\n\nGermany was hesitant to permit Ukraine to strike inside Russia, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saying he saw no reason to expand the zone where Ukraine could employ German military aid. Later, he stated that Ukraine had a right \"under international law\" to defend itself against attacks on Kharkiv over the Russian border.", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euromaidan Press"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olena_mukhina@euromaidanpress.com", "name": "Olena Mukhina", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRU_(Russian_Federation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GRU (Russian Federation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian-occupied_territories_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_(military)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Staff (military)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_of_Russia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Guard of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Security Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramilitary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olaf Scholz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/We_Are_The_99_Percent", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/We Are The 99 Percent", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://euromaidanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ukrainian-soldiers.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624887", "eventUri": "eng-9624887", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Russia has since labelled South Korea as one of the \"unfriendly\" nations.\n\n\"Just like in our relations with Italy, we do not see any Russophobic stance when working with the South Korean government. Neither are there any weapons supplies to the conflict zone. We highly appreciate that,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin also said he is aware that the United States is approaching South Korea to look for weapons to send to Ukraine and he is watching the situation closely.\n\n\"Today, unfortunately, certain problems have been created in many areas of our cooperation, which is a pity ... But this is not our choice. It is the choice of the Korean leadership. The channel is open on our side, and we are ready,\" he said.\n\nPutin also said that Moscow expects its relations with Seoul will preserve, at least partially, to be restored to the previous depth in the future, according to Russia's Sputnik news agency.\n\nOn North Korea, Putin reaffirmed his commitment to strengthening relations with Pyongyang.\n\n\"As for relations with North Korea ... our neighbours, we will develop relations, whether someone likes it or not,\" he said.\n\nRelations between Pyongyang and Moscow have significantly strengthened since September's summit between Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Putin has been considering paying a reciprocal visit to the North.\n\nPutin said the North Korean nuclear issue will be resolved when Pyongyang is no longer threatened.\n\n\"They are being threatened, and they respond.

But what exactly are those lessons, and how exactly will world leaders turn that commitment into reality?\n\nThat nebulous pledge to prevent history from repeating itself has become starkly concrete as Russian forces seek to subjugate Ukraine in the first major land war in Europe since World War II.\n\nAnd in a remarkable twist, history also echoes in the possibly next president of the United States, Donald Trump, who has revived the term \"America First,\" used in the 1930s and '40s by Americans who wanted the US to stand back, even as Hitler launched a war to conquer Europe.\n\nAs he foreshadows potentially drastic changes in the US approach to Europe's defense and to the war in Ukraine, Trump is raising \"existential\" anxiety among US allies.\n\nIn France this week, Biden will join some 25 prime ministers and presidents -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend; Russia's Vladimir Putin has not been invited -- marking the occasion. Biden will then travel to Paris for a state visit.\n\nDuring his time in France, he will speak \"about the importance of defending freedom and democracy,\" and discuss \"a wide range of global challenges.\"\n\nTopping the agenda: how to help Ukraine.\n\nThe host, French President Emmanuel Macron, has emerged as one of the most outspoken advocates of upgrading support for Kyiv, contrasting with Biden's assertive but more cautious approach.\n\nMacron's transformation has been remarkable. In the weeks leading up to Russia's unprovoked full-scale invasion of its neighbor, he traveled to Moscow, meeting with Putin at his colossally long Covid-19-distancing table, in search of a way to prevent the conflagration.\n\nThose who thought Macron was being too deferential to the Russian dictator had extra reason to cringe when, months after Russian forces crossed into Ukraine, Macron declared that \"we must not humiliate Russia.\" And all as Russia's plan to score a swift victory was unraveling and Biden was reaffirming his unwavering support for Kyiv.\n\nIn the intervening years, Macron's stance has hardened as his view of the risk Russia poses to Europe and the West has darkened. In April, he warned, \"Our Europe is mortal; it can die,\" partly as a result of Russia's aggression.\n\nEarlier this year, he jolted Europeans when he declared that nothing can be ruled out, not even sending Western troops to Ukraine, adding \"We will do anything we can to prevent Russia from winning.\"\n\nGermany rejected the idea, as did others. But apparently Macron was doing more than trying to stiffen allies' spines.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, this week, with Biden and Zelensky in France, Macron will announce that European troops will, in fact, soon go to Ukraine.\n\nOne of the most pressing decisions faced by Ukraine's backers now is how much freedom to give Kyiv to strike Russian targets with the weapons they provide.\n\nThe dilemma embodies one of the two fears driving Western support. On one hand, Europe and the United States fear that if Russia wins, Putin will continue pushing to conquer territories that belonged not just to the Soviet Union but also to the Russian Empire.\n\nThat's a concern searingly underscored by the lessons of World War II, when Hitler was allowed to slice off a piece of Czechoslovakia, then moved into Poland and barreled across Europe until he was finally stopped.\n\nThe worry is palpable among Russia's neighbors and is one of the reasons Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has told his people to prepare, calling this time a \"prewar era.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the fear is that giving Ukraine carte blanche to strike at Russia risks escalating the conflict into one between nuclear-armed Russia and nuclear-armed NATO, perhaps World War III.\n\nCan the war be contained and Russia defeated?\n\nZelensky has been imploring Kyiv's friends to let Ukraine use their arms to strike inside Russia. While allies discussed the issue, Russian forces, facing little risk, struck a department store in Kharkiv, not far from the Russian border, killing 18 people.\n\n\"Please give us the permission\" to use the weapons for preventing those attacks, Zelensky implored allies. He won't use them without permission, for fear of losing Western support.\n\nThe West remains divided on the issue. Biden has loosened some of the restrictions. Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz want them loosened even more, though still restricted. Finland and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg say Ukraine's friends are forcing it to fight with one hand tied behind its back.\n\nThe D-Day anniversary meetings are sure to include discussions about how to stop Russia, and the question of whether Russia, if facing a more empowered Ukraine, would really face off directly with the West, as Putin threatens.\n\nAs they gaze on the once blood-drenched beaches of Normandy, world leaders should consider the lessons of World War II, and how to apply them today.\n\nAmerica Firsters helped persuade the United States to stay out of combat in Europe until the war came to the US at Pearl Harbor. Eventually, 16.4 million Americans served in the military during World War II, more than 10% of the population. Some 29,000 Americans died in the Normandy invasion, in a war that engulfed 50 countries, a catastrophe that would kill more than 70 million people, one of every 30 people who were alive when it started.\n\nThe conflicts are not the same; the ideologies and the leaders are different. And yet, the beaches of Normandy resonate with the lessons of that terrible history; world leaders should listen closely.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

TASS-Yonhap\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday he highly appreciates South Korea's position not to directly supply weapons to Ukraine, and that Moscow is ready to restore relations with Seoul.\n\nPutin made the remark during a meeting with representatives of leading international news agencies, including Yonhap News Agency, which was held on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\n\nThe remark drew attention in that Putin, who began his fifth term as president last month, showed a positive attitude toward South Korea and openly talked about the possibility of improving relations with Seoul.\n\nRelations between the two countries have chilled since Seoul joined a U.S.-led move to impose sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Russia has since labeled South Korea as one of the unfriendly nations.\n\n\"Just like in our relations with Italy, we do not see any Russophobic stance when working with the South Korean government. Neither are there any weapons supplies to the conflict zone. We highly appreciate that,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin also said he is aware that the United States is approaching South Korea to look for weapons to send to Ukraine and he is watching the situation closely.\n\n\"Today, unfortunately, certain problems have been created in many areas of our cooperation, which is a pity ... But this is not our choice. It is the choice of the Korean leadership. The channel is open on our side, and we are ready,\" he said.\n\nPutin also said that Moscow expects its relations with Seoul will preserve, at least partially, to be restored to the previous depth in the future, according to Russia's Sputnik news agency.\n\nOn North Korea, Putin reaffirmed his commitment to strengthening relations with Pyongyang.\n\n\"As for relations with North Korea ... our neighbors, we will develop relations, whether someone likes it or not,\" he said.\n\nRelations between Pyongyang and Moscow have significantly strengthened since September's summit between Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Putin has been considering paying a reciprocal visit to the North.\n\nPutin said the North Korean nuclear issue will be resolved when Pyongyang is no longer threatened.\n\n\"They are being threatened, and they respond. Without threats, I think, the nuclear issue will gradually be resolved. But they are facing threats all the time. What else can they do?\" Putin said, according to TASS news agency.\n\nWednesday's meeting with international news agencies, organized by TASS, took place for the first time since 2021, when the meeting was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRepresentatives of 16 international news agencies took part in the meeting, including Park Sang-hyun, executive director of digital media at Yonhap News Agency.

He responded, according to a transcript of the interview:\n\nPeace looks like making sure Russia never, never, never, never occupies Ukraine. That's what peace looks like. And it doesn't mean NATO, they are part of NATO. It means we have a relationship with them like we do with other countries, where we supply weapons so they can defend themselves in the future. But it is not, if you notice, I was the one when -- and you guys did report it at TIME -- the one that I was saying that I am not prepared to support the NATOization of Ukraine.\n\nBiden's non-answer on the endgame in Ukraine comes as he has escalated U.S. involvement in the war.\n\nWATCH -- Dem Rep.

When the reporter asked him if there was a danger that NATO is on a slippery slope to war with Russia, Biden responded that war would happen \"if we don't do something about Ukraine,\" but did not say what that \"something\" was.\n\nBiden also bragged about publicizing U.S. intelligence on Russia's plans to invade Ukraine shortly before Russian forces did so in February 2022, even though the action did not stop Russian forces from invading, and despite the Biden administration doing little for months as Russian forces gathered at the Ukrainian border.\n\nBiden said, \"The reason why I cleared the intelligence so we can release the information we knew that he was going to attack, was to let the world know we were still in charge. We still know what's going on.\"\n\nWATCH -- Top House Intel.

The exercise, which will be monitored by the U.S. military, will involve a \"handful\" of Russian ships and support vessels, the two officials said.\n\nIt's not the first time Russia has sent its ships to the Caribbean. This exercise, however, is taking place as Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested that Moscow could take \"asymmetrical steps\" elsewhere in the world in response to President Joe Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weapons to strike inside Russia to protect Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.\n\nThe officials, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not been announced publicly, said the exercise is \"certainly\" part of a broader Russian response to the U.S. support for Ukraine, but it also is an effort by Putin to show his navy is still capable of global power projection after losing several ships to Ukrainian strikes.\n\nUkrainian military officials said in March that Russia had lost one-third of its Black Sea fleet to Ukrainian strikes during the past two years of war.\n\nRussia did not notify the U.S. of the pending exercise, but the ships' movements have been tracked by the U.S. Navy, the officials said.\n\nDespite Russia not notifying the U.S. -- which countries often do to avoid miscalculation -- the officials said militaries all over the globe have the right to conduct exercises in international waters and do so regularly. For example, on Friday about 20 NATO countries including the U.S. will begin BALTOPS 24, a major naval and air exercise in the Baltic region near Russia.\n\nThe officials said they expect the Russian ships will remain in the region through the summer and will likely conduct similar, follow-up exercises in the Caribbean after this one concludes.\n\nThe officials said Congress was notified of the upcoming Russian exercises on Wednesday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Russia has since labeled South Korea as one of the unfriendly nations.\n\n\"Just like in our relations with Italy, we do not see any Russophobic stance when working with the South Korean government. Neither are there any weapons supplies to the conflict zone. We highly appreciate that,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin also said he is aware that the United States is approaching South Korea to look for weapons to send to Ukraine and he is watching the situation closely.\n\n\"Today, unfortunately, certain problems have been created in many areas of our cooperation, which is a pity ... But this is not our choice. It is the choice of the Korean leadership. The channel is open on our side, and we are ready,\" he said.\n\nPutin also said that Moscow expects its relations with Seoul will preserve, at least partially, to be restored to the previous depth in the future, according to Russia's Sputnik news agency.\n\nOn North Korea, Putin reaffirmed his commitment to strengthening relations with Pyongyang.\n\n\"As for relations with North Korea ... our neighbors, we will develop relations, whether someone likes it or not,\" he said.\n\nRelations between Pyongyang and Moscow have significantly strengthened since September's summit between Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Putin has been considering paying a reciprocal visit to the North.\n\nPutin said the North Korean nuclear issue will be resolved when Pyongyang is no longer threatened.\n\n\"They are being threatened, and they respond. Without threats, I think, the nuclear issue will gradually be resolved. But they are facing threats all the time. What else can they do?\" Putin said, according to TASS news agency.\n\nWednesday's meeting with international news agencies, organized by TASS, took place for the first time since 2021, when the meeting was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRepresentatives of 16 international news agencies took part in the meeting, including Park Sang-hyun, executive director of digital media at Yonhap News Agency. Other news agencies included the Associated Press, AFP, Reuters, Germany's DPA, Japan's Kyodo, China's Xinhua and Iran's IRNA.\n\n(END)", "source": {"uri": "en.yna.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title":

Moscow's current foreign policy - whether using military or other means - is aimed at achieving results that can be sold to the Russian population as successes.\n\nAlthough the Russian regime is authoritarian, it is dependent on stable support from the elites and the wider population. Putin's adventurism has developed over the last quarter of a century against the backdrop of Moscow's military aggression remaining more or less unpunished, or Western punitive measures turning out to be air acts.\n\nRussia's external aggression - whether in Georgia, Syria or Ukraine - appeared to be successful at relatively low cost. They were and are more or less popular with the Russian political elite and ordinary citizens, as survey results show. The ability of Ukraine to hit back with Western weapons on Russian territory is likely to call Putin's past and future track record into question in the eyes of many Russians. It may therefore - despite all the continuing warlike rhetoric from the Kremlin - reduce rather than increase the regime's readiness for aggression and escalation.\n\nWhat dangers do you see as real and which Scholz puts forward as arguments for his position?\n\nThere is of course a danger of tensions escalating into an all-European and nuclear war between NATO and Moscow. However, this danger has existed for 70 years now, and was also prominent at a time when there were far more atomic warheads in Europe than there are today. Would it not have been wise in the 1950s to respond positively to Stalin's idea of separating West Germany from Western structures? Would this not have been good peace policy at the time? Shouldn't the USSR have been allowed to station nuclear missiles in Cuba in the 1960s? Wasn't Kennedy an irresponsible warmonger back then? Other similar examples could be added.\n\nAnother case from recent history: In 2015, Turkey deliberately and openly shot down a Russian fighter bomber over Syria. Both Russian pilots were killed. Russia's response was all kinds of threats and temporary economic sanctions against Turkey. After about a year, however, Turkish-Russian relations virtually returned to normal.\n\nTo what extent do you see the possibility that Putin could \"foist\" attacks with civilian casualties on Russian territory on the West?\n\nSuch so-called false flag actions are possible, even probable. The prototype of this tactic are the mysterious bomb attacks in Moscow, Buynaksk and Volgodonsk in the fall of 1999, the political repercussions of which propelled Putin into the presidency for the first time in the spring of 2000. However, the question would arise today as to how exactly Russia should react to self-orchestrated, alleged Western crimes against Russian civilians.\n\nMoscow will continue to want to achieve results that can be sold to the population as successes. Russian involving the West directly in the Russo-Ukrainian War (or accusing them of such involvement) would change the balance of power in Eastern Europe and reduce Moscow's chances of success. Arguably, it would even be in Ukraine's interests. The Kremlin will therefore avoid escalating political tensions with the West into a direct military confrontation with NATO, despite Putin and Medvedev's aggressive rhetoric.\n\nUS Secretary of State Blinken is now also hinting at American flexibility on the limited use of Western weapons on Russian territory. Would this be a game changer for the war if the USA were to follow the Europeans?\n\nThat would undoubtedly be a step in the right direction, but not enough by itself to change the course of the war in the short term.

World leaders will be discussing the conditions for ending the war unleashed by Russia.\n\nRussia said that it saw no point in attending the summit. However, certain countries are pushing Ukraine toward direct negotiations with Russia, turning a blind eye to the fact that under the current conditions, peace talks would focus solely on the terms of Ukraine's capitulation.\n\nThose countries present this not as a surrender but as a \"freezing\" of the conflict, similar to the truce that ended active fighting in Korea in 1953. And the group is growing larger.\n\nWhen China proposed a broadly worded peace plan in 2023 that called for direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv, it was rejected by both Ukraine and the West for failing to call for Russia to leave occupied parts of Ukraine.\n\nHowever, time has passed and Western opinion has changed. The world is tired of the war in Europe and is looking for ways to stop it. It's a situation Russian President Vladimir Putin is seeking to take advantage of.\n\nOn May 15, Putin said in an interview with the Chinese news agency Xinhua that he was ready to hold peace talks with Ukraine, but with Russia's interests in mind. In other words, he demands that Ukraine give up its claim to its lost territories.\n\nIt is clear that both Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have similar demands. Despite their talk of peace, Russian forces are pressing an offensive in northeastern Ukraine's Kharkiv region, while China continues to supply key components needed by Moscow for weapons production.\n\nPutin is rushing to advance his troops as far as possible while Ukraine's depleted military waits for new supplies of anti-aircraft missiles and artillery shells from the United States after months of delay. He understands achieving a military triumph will enhance his leverage during negotiations, and he harbors absolute certainty that talks will occur during the upcoming summer.\n\nUntil now, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly proclaimed that any negotiations must include a restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression, and security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\nSetbacks on the battlefield may push him toward a more flexible stance. Additionally, his Western allies, who are committed to peace in Europe, are subtly influencing him to reconsider this approach.\n\nAs a result, Zelensky now finds himself caught between two fires.\n\nBy choosing to prolong the war until Ukraine wins, he risks losing the support of powerful allies and confronts increasing tensions inside Ukraine, which is suffering from shelling, blackouts, and an economic recession.\n\nBy agreeing to negotiations with Russia, he will anger the patriotic heart of the nation and lead his country to surrender.\n\nHe will almost inevitably lose his presidency in either case.\n\nParadoxically, Zelensky finds that the safest course of action is to prolong the war. In an interview with Agence France-Presse on May 18, he rejected a French call for an Olympic truce this summer and expressed his dissatisfaction by saying: \"We want the war to end with a fair peace for us,\" while \"the West wants the war to end. Period. As soon as possible.\"\n\nZelensky's demeanor resembled that of a disgruntled child, possibly the result of an unexpected recent visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Kyiv. The Ukrainian media's limited coverage of their meeting could be attributed to the insufficient information provided by the presidential office.\n\nMeanwhile, Blinken's message to Zelensky was extremely clear. He said the Biden administration hoped to build up Ukraine's military capabilities, but achieving this goal would necessitate significant reform initiatives to combat corruption in the country.\n\nBlinken spoke even more directly the following day, no longer addressing Zelensky but students of the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. In a unequivocal speech -- a change from his usual diplomatic style -- he said: \"Winning on the battlefield will prevent Ukraine from becoming part of Russia. Winning the war against corruption will keep Ukraine from becoming like Russia.\"\n\nIn my opinion, Zelensky's vulnerability lies in his inability to purge the government of corrupt officials. While he can evade inquiries from journalists regarding the whereabouts of funds designated for fortifying defensive lines and upgrading the power grid, he cannot dismiss these same inquiries from Western allies. This erosion of trust in him, unfortunately, coincides with diminishing optimism for Ukraine's triumph in the prolonged conflict with Russia.\n\nNot long ago, Volodimir Zelensky drew comparisons to Mr. Winston Churchill. If he fails to eradicate corruption within his government and loses the backing of the West, who will he be likened to this summer?\n\nIt is my wish that once global leaders decide to turn away from Zelensky, they will bear in mind that he is merely a transient figure representing the Ukrainian people, who deserve admiration for their strength, bravery, and determination to win.\n\nSergey G.

Is Putin Really Ready for Negotiations?", "body": "In the run-up to the Peace Summit for Ukraine in Switzerland, it is important to understand that the only way to real peace is to be vigilant against Moscow's ploys.\n\n\"The 'war party' rules in Kyiv, and it seeks, at least in words, to defeat Russia 'on the battlefield.' Under such conditions, it is difficult to imagine a peace dialogue,\" said the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, on May 30.\n\nAccusations of Ukraine's reluctance to start a peace process are coming from Moscow more and more often, as are assurances of their readiness for negotiations.\n\nObviously, in this way, Russia seeks to weaken Kyiv's position at the Global Peace Summit in Switzerland on June 15-16.\n\nBut Moscow also pursues a more ambitious goal. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Putin failed to convince the world that the best solution for everyone would be a quick surrender of Ukraine.\n\nNow Russia is trying to \"sell\" the same idea, but under the guise of \"peacekeeping.\"\n\nImitation of goodwill\n\nThe full-scale invasion of Ukraine began to the accompaniment of harsh and uncompromising rhetoric from the Kremlin.\n\nHowever, six months later, in September-October 2022, Moscow began to talk about its readiness for peace. The reason was completely banal: at that moment, Putin's \"blitzkrieg\" was clearly a failure, and Russia had lost the strategic initiative at the front. Russian troops were knocked out of the Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy regions, then from the Kharkiv region and the right bank of Kherson region, and plans to land in Odesa sank along with the cruiser Moskva.\n\nTo prevent the further collapse of the occupying army, the Kremlin was forced to announce a partial mobilization in Russia, as well as to throw thousands of Russian prison inmates into \"meat assaults.\"\n\nDespite Russia's failure, there was no sign of Putin's real intentions to stop the bloody war. But his generals desperately needed an operational pause to prepare mobilized recruits and replenish the weapons reserves depleted after the considerable losses of the first months of the war.\n\nThe occupation administrations, installed on the captured Ukrainian territories after Feb. 24, also required time to consolidate their power and suppress at least the active resistance of residents.\n\nIn addition, the Kremlin was frightened by the consolidation of the West, which began to provide effective support to Ukraine. In such a situation, the best gift for Moscow would be the beginning of negotiations with Kyiv to gain time and try to undermine the West's determination to continue supporting Ukraine.\n\nAll these calculations were well understood in Kyiv and in the capitals of Western states. The Minsk agreements, concluded in 2014 and 2015, despite all the efforts of Kyiv, did not lead to lasting peace.\n\nHowever, even in the first days of the full-scale war, President Zelensky repeatedly publicly appealed to Putin with the offer to meet at the negotiating table. But until Russia started having problems at the front, the Kremlin scornfully brushed off such appeals.\n\nEven at the negotiations between the delegations of Ukraine and Russia, which took place in March 2022 in Belarus and Turkey, the Russians agreed to put forward clearly unacceptable demands from a position of strength, the fulfilment of which would have been not only humiliating for Ukraine, but also suicidal.\n\nSimilarly, in the fall of 2022, the Kremlin spoke about negotiations exclusively \"on its terms,\" without naming them. It is obvious that Kyiv was not going to capitulate or give the occupiers time to recover.\n\nRepeating lies\n\nDuring 2023, Putin returned to the topic of negotiations several times, and this year, assurances of readiness for dialogue became a constant refrain in the Kremlin's official rhetoric. But did the context of such statements change?\n\nRussia also needs an operational pause. This need became especially acute after the long-awaited adoption of US military aid for Ukraine and the activation of assistance from EU countries.\n\nMoscow is particularly concerned about the prospect of Ukraine receiving F-16 aircraft, as well as permits for the use of long-range missiles on the Russian Federation territory.\n\nIf, with its own means, Ukraine was able to inflict a series of stinging strikes on many objects located deep in the Russian rear, then what will it be capable of later?\n\nIn addition, Ukraine is carrying out increased mobilization aimed at re-staffing existing units and creating new combat units. The cumulative effect of all these measures can greatly complicate the occupying army situation and probably put Putin in front of the need to conduct a new wave of mobilization, which is extremely unpopular in Russian society.\n\nIn addition, the start of negotiations on the Kremlin's terms would raise the question of the feasibility of further support for Ukraine by Western countries: What is the point in this, if Kyiv is ready to capitulate now?\n\nThe word \"capitulation\" is not an exaggeration in this context. The Kremlin has still not outlined its negotiating position, hoping, obviously, that the result of the negotiation process will be the acceptance by Kyiv of all of Moscow's ultimatums.\n\nPutin has indirectly confirmed this version, saying on May 28 that Russia is ready to resume the negotiation process based on the Istanbul negotiation results. And the meeting in Istanbul, as we know, was nothing more than an invitation for Ukraine to capitulate.\n\nLavrov's following statement, from May 30, also testifies that Moscow still seeks to induce Kyiv to capitulate: \"Russia is open to peace negotiations, not a truce. There is a theoretical possibility to speed up the settlement: in case of the cessation of the Western weapons supply and the cessation of hostilities by Kyiv.\"\n\nThese conditions are difficult to call adequate. We have already seen the consequences of the delay in approving aid for Ukraine in the US Congress.\n\nIt is not difficult to imagine how much Ukraine's situation will deteriorate if Western weapons stop arriving altogether. Ukraine's ability to offer effective resistance will decrease, leading not to a \"settlement,\" but to an increase in the number of victims, destruction, and eventually to the expansion of the occupation territories.\n\nLikewise, the cessation of hostilities can only be bilateral, and the first step must be taken by the aggressor state, not the victim state. This is not a matter of principles but of common sense.\n\nSubstitution of priorities\n\nHowever, the promotion of the Kremlin's idea about its readiness for negotiations has not only a tactical but also a strategic purpose. The strategic purpose is to create confusion in the minds of Western societies so that the first item on the agenda will not be military aid for Ukraine, but the beginning of a peace process that Moscow is open to.\n\nTo create the illusion of such openness, Russia used all available means of influencing the opinions of the Western public and establishment.\n\nPortraying the victim as the aggressor is one of Russia's favorite propaganda techniques.\n\nExactly in this way, the Kremlin prepared a casus belli on the eve of a full-scale invasion, spreading lies about Ukraine's aggressive militaristic plans.\n\nNow Russia wants to use this technique again, presenting the leadership of Ukraine as a \"party of war\" that rejects generous peace proposals, coming from the Kremlin.\n\nf course, the war of attrition is a test for both Ukrainian society and Kyiv's Western partners. But the worst thing that can be done now is to give in to the temptation to believe in Putin's goodwill and consider the Kremlin's statements as a chance to end the war.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Russia has convincingly proved that any scenario proposed by Russia does not lead to the establishment of a real long-term peace. The only way to end the war is to force Russia to agree to the beginning of a peace settlement, whose principles will be developed not in Moscow, but in Kyiv, together with the partner states and having a broad international consensus.\n\nIn order for such a scenario to become possible, Russia must face the fact of its inability to force Ukraine to fulfil ultimatums and impose the Kremlin's rules of the game on the world. That's why solidarity with Kyiv at the Global Peace Summit and increasing military support for Ukraine are equally important and necessary.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news",

But no one - I want to emphasize this - no one in the West, in Europe, wants to remember how this tragedy began,\" the president said, responding to a question by German journalist.\n\n\"It began with a coup in Ukraine - an unconstitutional coup d'etat. This is the beginning of the war. Well, is Russia to blame for this coup? No.\"\n\nThe Russian leader pointed out that everyone seems to have forgotten how the foreign ministers of Poland, Germany and France arrived in Kiev and signed the Minsk agreements as guarantors on peacefully resolving the crisis in Ukraine.\n\nThese countries now prefer not to remember this, instead they decided to resolve the conflict by use of arms against civilians in Eastern Ukraine, Putin said.\n\n\"No one planned to execute the Minsk agreements, they publicly state they are not going to implement it,\" the Russian president stressed, adding: \"We were deceived.\"\n\nAccording to Putin, following the coup, Moscow made every attempt to settle the bloodshed in Donbass \"by peaceful means.\"\n\nFollowing the US-backed coup, the then-Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Lugansk, known as Donbass, with predominantly Russian-speaking populations refused to accept the new government, which increasingly embraced nationalist ideology. The regions proclaimed their independence and Kiev responded with a military campaign that led to a years-long conflict.\n\n\"We recognized people who voted to be independent,\" Putin stressed.\n\nAsked about Western arms supply to Ukraine, the Russian leader called it a direct participation in the conflict which will ultimately completely destroy global relations and undermine international security.

Still, the war has been going on for two years and three months, and there is no sign of it ending soon.\n\nThis summit would continue to discuss peace initiatives proposed by the Ukrainian president at the end of 2022. These initiatives mainly include the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, the restoration of the 1991 Russian-Ukrainian border, the convening of a peace conference, the signing of an international treaty, a war crimes trial against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, and the issue of nuclear safety.\n\n\"With these aids, I think Russia's current artillery advantage could be reversed, and the dynamic of the war would change.\" Mr. Li said.\n\nHeng He, a political and economic commentator, believes that the reason why Russia was able to launch the attack this year was largely because Ukraine was short of ammunition, and its total population is four times less than that of Russia. \"So if Ukraine expects to prolong the resistance against Russia, its casualties would be much lower than those of the Russian side, and that's if there is a sufficient supply of firepower.\"\n\nOn the other hand, in Mr. Heng's opinion, Russia has temporarily obtained some less-advanced ammunition from North Korea that is not likely to have any special advantage in precision guidance.\n\n\"For Russia, the use of tactical nuclear weapons will not do any good. If Russia uses tactical nuclear weapons, then NATO forces will eliminate all the Russian forces that invade Ukraine. That is to say, if Russia uses nuclear weapons, then Russia will confront NATO.\"\n\n\"Therefore, Russia would think twice before using tactical nuclear weapons, and I don't think it is likely to use it to invite NATO to join in the war.\"\n\nMr. Shi believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is determined to fight a protracted war. In the early stages of the Russia-Ukraine war, Russia used professional military staff as the main force; while there were only new recruits on the battlefield, some were only trained for two weeks.\n\nGuo Jun, editor-in-chief of Hong Kong Epoch Times, believes that the outbreak of the war in Ukraine has led to a significant increase in Europe's dependence on NATO and the United States, and the war will likely continue until both sides are exhausted.\n\n\"At the beginning, everyone overestimated Russia, thinking that Russia's military power was so potent that the war at its doorstep should have been over very quickly, but in reality, Russia failed to do so as its military power had declined a lot. Now many people have gone to the opposite opinion that 'Russia is weak.' The fact is Russia inherited the huge military-industrial system of the Soviet Union, which is still largely in place.\"\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is one of the countries that would like to see the war continue, Ms. Guo said. \"First of all, the marathon war reduces the pressure from the U.S. in the Asia-Pacific region. Secondly, Russia is revitalizing the Chinese military industry, increasingly relying on the CCP for funds, equipment, and electronic components.\n\n\"Several other countries in the authoritarian camp are also becoming more and more dependent on the Chinese Communist regime, which is also very favorable to the CCP.\"\n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union never had direct military conflicts, and all conflicts were proxy, especially in the Asian, African, and Latin American regions, according to Ms. Guo.\n\n\"The Russian-Ukrainian War can also be seen as a continuation of the Cold War and a proxy war. Between the U.S. and Russia, and even between European countries and Russia, direct military confrontation was avoided, and many hoped to 'confine' the war to Ukrainian soil.\"\n\nMs. Guo believes the Russia-Ukraine war could be a crucial one in shaping the future geopolitical landscape. \"For example, the Cold War began with the Korean War, which lasted three years, and the CCP and the Soviet Union chose to accept an armistice, and the world entered a period of Cold War.\"\n\n\"In history, almost all the major global changes begin with a war.\" The First World War led to the collapse of four empires: the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the German Empire, the Russian Tsarist Empire, and the Ottoman Empire. The Second World War can be seen as an extension of the First World War, but it had a similar consequence that brought about the collapse of the British Empire and the independence of the colonies, as per Ms. Guo.\n\n\"The disintegration of totalitarian imperialism usually heralds a dramatic change. What we are seeing in the battle in Ukraine is the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Thus, the war in Ukraine is only the beginning of a new global landscape,\" Ms. Guo said.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [],

This exercise, however, is taking place as Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested that Moscow could take \"asymmetrical steps\" elsewhere in the world in response to President Joe Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weapons to strike inside Russia to protect Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.\n\nThe officials, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not been announced publicly, said the exercise is \"certainly\" part of a broader Russian response to the U.S. support for Ukraine, but it also is an effort by Putin to show his navy is still capable of global power projection after losing several ships to Ukrainian strikes.\n\nUkrainian military officials said in March that Russia had lost one-third of its Black Sea fleet to Ukrainian strikes during the past two years of war.\n\nRussia did not notify the U.S. of the pending exercise, but the ships' movements have been tracked by the U.S. Navy, the officials said.\n\nDespite Russia not notifying the U.S. -- which countries often do to avoid miscalculation -- the officials said militaries all over the globe have the right to conduct exercises in international waters and do so regularly. For example, on Friday about 20 NATO countries including the U.S. will begin BALTOPS 24, a major naval and air exercise in the Baltic region near Russia.\n\nThe officials said they expect the Russian ships will remain in the region through the summer and will likely conduct similar, follow-up exercises in the Caribbean after this one concludes.\n\nThe officials said Congress was notified of the upcoming Russian exercises on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_projection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power projection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Sea Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_region", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltic region"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International waters"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Naval", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Naval", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624887", "eventUri": "eng-9624887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Yet that hasn't stopped many Putin supporters in the West from blaming Nato for his decision to invade. Even the liberal establishment has resisted acknowledging its colonial aspects. Policy officials in Washington and Europe prefer a different narrative: this is a war between the democratic West and the autocratic East, not a war of national liberation.\n\nFor Western democracies, the dominant framework used to interpret world politics continues to be that of a struggle between the West and the dark forces of despotism threatening it from the outside. The Second World War, followed by the Cold War, are past iterations in this struggle. With the invasion of Ukraine we entered a new chapter. You often hear from those who hold this perspective that Putin's problem was Ukraine's democracy, which he feared could spread to Russia - a notion almost touching in its naivety. What Putin wants is to conquer Ukraine.\n\nElsewhere, the narrative concerning world politics is different. In Africa or Asia, the central story explaining the past couple of centuries is the struggle of national liberation against colonial power and exploitation. In his 1950 essay \"Discourse on Colonialism\", Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, the Martinican poet and politician, interpreted even Nazism through the prism of colonialism. For him, Hitler's innovation was that he applied to Europe the colonialist procedures that until then had been applied exclusively to populations in the Global South.\n\nThe war in Ukraine can be interpreted just as easily from both points of view. In 2022, when I travelled through Asia and Africa, it quickly became obvious to me that Ukraine's plight would receive a lot more sympathy in the Global South if it were presented as a war of national liberation. It particularly helped if you described Russia as the last European empire.\n\nWestern democracies, nevertheless, were extremely reluctant to embrace that narrative. To turn anti-colonialism into a rallying cry might force them to change their official position on a host of other issues, from Palestinian statehood to China's \"century of national humiliation\" prior to the Second World War, which Western leaders tend to dismiss as mere propaganda. I was often told by my interlocutors in the Global South that Western democracies would fail to apply the same standards on international law if innocent civilians were under attack outside the West. Many see a blatant contradiction in the West's response to Israel's war in Gaza compared with Ukraine.\n\nDuring the first year of the war it was the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who took up the mantle of revolutionary anti-colonialism, arguing there was something wrong with a world order in which the brutal 2022 invasion could take place. Since then, he has toned down his language, but his efforts to gather as many countries as possible for a 15-16 June peace conference show the same desire to universalise the conflict. The war in Gaza is exacting a price: I am told many non-European leaders will not travel to Switzerland for the conference in protest at the West's contradictions.\n\nOn 1 June, I spoke at the Kyiv book fair about the war and colonialism. Though new deliveries of weaponry have started to arrive in Ukraine, mobilising troops has become increasingly difficult. Daily power blackouts lasting many hours plague the capital. After the discussion at the fair, students in the audience shared some of their frustrations. One complained that the West is willing to do for Israel what it has never done for Ukraine. Another argued that the West is more concerned with defending Russian military assets from Ukraine's attacks than protecting Ukrainian civilians in Kharkiv and other cities in the east.\n\nFor Ukraine, there are obvious dangers in the narrative of \"the West and the rest\". First, a war between these abstract principles threatens to reduce the country to a mere battlefield rather than a state capable of acting in its own interests. (During the Cold War, Vietnam and Afghanistan paid a steep price for playing that role.) Indeed, since Russia's invasion in 2022, Ukraine has often been portrayed as a vital battlefield but never quite as an actor working towards its own liberation. The West has forbidden Ukrainian forces from using the weapons it supplies to attack targets deep inside Russia, and from using their own weapons to attack Russian oil refineries. Even the recent decision by Joe Biden to make an exception in the case of the Russian forces stationed just across the border from Kharkiv is just that - an exception.\n\nThe \"West\" is also a highly contested concept. Is Ukraine part of the West? To some extent, but not like Israel, which forms the symbolic core of the West's narrative of redemption after the Holocaust. And not to the same extent as Nato members, let alone the US. At the beginning of the Ukrainian counteroffensive a year ago, a staff member at Washington's National Security Council told me that the Biden administration thought of its responsibilities as divided between three levels: it was willing to do everything for Ukraine, the third level, provided that support did not increase the risk for the top two levels, occupied by Nato and the US.\n\nThis view explains why support for Ukraine has been kept at levels consistent with the country's resistance - but not with its victory. Every time Ukraine has moved closer to making decisive progress, Putin has played the nuclear card and Western support has retreated.\n\nAnother problem with the West's narrative is that it excludes a large part of the world. It is doubtful that Russia can be conclusively defeated unless it can be economically isolated, but by turning the war into a conflict between the West and the rest, the US has ensured this will not happen. In fact, Russia's economy now benefits from a reorientation towards large, growing markets in Asia.\n\nIn recent weeks the Biden administration has tried a new strategy, casting the war in Ukraine as an episode of a new cold war between the US and China. On a visit to Brussels on 29 May, the US's deputy secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, accused China of backing Russia \"to the hilt\" and warned Europe to get serious about China - presumably by following Washington in its efforts to decouple from the Chinese economy. He made no effort to distinguish between what is at stake in Ukraine and the broader goal of containing China.\n\nViewed from Kyiv, this strategy seems unwise. On 1 June, Zelensky travelled to Singapore to address an audience of predominantly Asian officials at the Shangri-La Dialogue. According to my sources in Kyiv, he also intended to meet with the Chinese delegation, but the meeting did not happen. Afterwards, Zelensky could not hide his irritation with China's understanding of Ukraine as merely a tool of Washington.\n\nThe immediate goal for Zelensky is to leave Switzerland in June with a diplomatic triumph. Beyond that, he knows Ukraine can only win by building a global coalition, not by becoming the scorched battlefield between West and East.", "source": {"uri": "newstatesman.com", "dataType": "news",

In addition, its combat losses are over a million killed, severely wounded, captured or deserters. At least as many military age men have fled Russia to avoid military service and the high probability of being sent to Ukraine.\n\nAlthough Russia has a population four times that of Ukraine, declining birth rates since the 1980s have reduced the number of military age men even more. Ukraine has similar problems but to less of an extent. After all, Russia was the invader and the Ukrainians were defending their homeland with lots of material assistance from western Europe and the United States. The only allies Russia has are Iran and North Korea. China will help Russia overcome economic sanctions, for a price. In practical terms, Russia is on its own and can no longer depend on Russian male civilians to make themselves available for military service. Russia instead entices a growing number of foreign workers in Russia, as well non-Slavic minorities, into enlisting for the money. There is also a critical shortage of junior officers and NCOs (sergeants) to train new recruits. As a result, Russian soldiers currently sent to Ukraine are poorly trained and well aware of how dangerous it is for Russian soldiers in Ukraine. That's because Russia was the invader and is still attacking. The Ukrainians have become expert defenders because they are better trained and led in defending their homeland. Ukrainian soldiers suffer far fewer casualties than the Russians. In practice that means for every Ukrainian casualty, there are five Russian casualties.\n\nIn addition to heavy personnel losses the Russians have lost over 20,000 armored vehicles, a third of them tanks. The first year of fighting wiped out nearly all of Russia's best tanks and since then they have been depending on second rate tanks, most of them older models taken out of storage and refurbished for combat. The losses have been so heavy that, for the last two years, the annual May 8th military parade in Moscow celebrating victory in World War II, the only tank available for the parade has been a lone World War II T-34/85 tank in running condition and able participate in parade in place of dozens of more modern tanks that used to be available. Those tanks were destroyed or captured in Ukraine. The Russian government prefers not to discuss that, but the lone T-34/85 speaks for itself.\n\nCurrently most of the Russian tanks Ukrainian forces encounter are older models, like T-62s, taken from storage depots and made ready to operate in Ukraine, and then quickly destroyed. Ukraine has lots of modern anti-tank weapons including some it manufactures itself as well as many more from NATO military aid.\n\nGiven the number of tanks Russia continues to lose in Ukraine, its older tank reserves could keep the fighting going for another two or three years. Beyond that the heavy troop losses and the fact Russia is the invader and not defending Russia itself as was the case during World War II, popular support for the war in Ukraine is falling rapidly. To make matters worse, there is another corruption scandal among the senior commanders of whom over a dozen have been accused or implicated in corruption scandals. This comes at a time when many Russians are angry at the heavy troop losses and now see the Russian generals making illegal profits from the war effort.

In the case of Ukraine, \"not winning\" means that President Zelensky and his handlers in Washington choose to pursue a negotiated settlement that would allow Russia to keep the territory it captured during the war while addressing Moscow's modest security demands. (Note -- Ukraine must reject any intention of joining NATO)\n\nOn the other hand, \"losing\" the war means that the US and NATO continue on the same path they are today -- pumping lethal weapons, trainers and long-range missiles systems into Ukraine -- hoping that the Russian offensive is progressively weakened so Ukraine can prevail on the battlefield. This alternate path -- which amounts to 'wishful thinking' -- is the path to \"losing\" the war.\n\nUnlike the \"not winning\" the war scenario, \"losing\" the war will have a catastrophic effect on the United States and its future. It would mean that Washington had been unable to prevent a Russian military incursion into Europe which is NATO's primary raison d'etre. It would challenge the idea that the US is capable of acting as the guarantor of regional security which is the role the US has enjoyed since the end of WW2. The perception of a US defeat at the hands of Russia would unavoidably trigger a re-evaluation of current security relations leading to the dissolution of NATO and, very possibly, the EU as well. Simply put, losing the war would be a disaster. Here's how Colonel Daniel Davis summed it up just last week:\n\n\"We can't let Russia win.\"\n\nI've heard that throughout the entire 2-plus years of the war. But here's what I'm saying: If you keep going down this path -- ignoring all the realities we keep talking about -- not only will Russia win, we'll lose. And I assure you if you thought it was bad to 'let Putin win' -- which means having a negotiated settlement in which Putin ends up with territory he didn't start the war with -- ...But if you say that -- because I don't want that to happen, I'm going to keep fighting -- that implies you think you can win. But if you can't win, then the likely outcome is that you lose even more, and that's what's really going to hurt our credibility because, imagine if the whole force of NATO was shown to be unable to stop Russia from winning? Now our credibility is damaged far worse than having a negotiated settlement Colonel Daniel Davis, You Tube\n\nSo, while \"not winning\" is not the perfect outcome, it is vastly superior to \"losing\" which would severely undermine the Alliance's credibility, greatly erode Washington's power in Europe, and force the US to rethink its plans for projecting power into Central Asia. (pivot to Asia) In short, a US defeat by Russia in Ukraine would be a serious body-blow to the \"rules-based order\" and the denouement of the American Century.\n\nSo, there's a lot at stake for the United States. Unfortunately, there is no real debate in elite power circles about the best way forward. And, that's because the decision has already been made, and that decision hews closely to the maximalist views articulated in an article at the Atlantic Council titled \"NATO at 75: The Alliance's future lies in Ukraine's victory against Russia\"\n\nNATO will mark its seventy-fifth anniversary on April 4 as history's most successful military alliance. However, i ts future as a credible deterrent to aggression now lies in the success or failure of Russia's unjust and brutal invasion of Ukraine.....\n\nAllied leaders have unambiguously bound NATO's security to this war. NATO summits have repeatedly condemned the invasion and demanded that Russia \"completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its forces and equipment from the territory of Ukraine.\"\n\nAnd the rhetoric has escalated. French President Emmanuel Macron recently described the war as \"existential\" for Europe. \"If Russia wins this war, Europe's credibility would be reduced to zero,\" Macron said...\n\nIf the upcoming Washington summit is to inspire continued confidence in NATO's credibility, and thus its future, then t he Alliance must take action to place Ukraine onto a clear path to victory...\n\nAllied leaders must unambiguously endorse Ukraine's war objectives -- that is, total territorial reconstitution back to the nation's 1991 borders. Anything short of that is a disillusioning signal to Ukraine and encouragement to Putin to sustain his invasion. NATO at 75: The Alliance's future lies in Ukraine's victory against Russia, atlanticcouncil.org\n\nRepeat: Allied leaders must unambiguously endorse Ukraine's war objectives -- that is, total territorial reconstitution back to the nation's 1991 borders. Anything short of that is a disillusioning signal to Ukraine and encouragement to Putin to sustain his invasion.\n\nAs we said earlier, this maximalist view of NATO's objectives is nothing more than wishful thinking. The anemic UAF is not going to drive the Russian Army out of Ukraine nor are they going to win the war. Even so, the views above are shared by the vast majority of foreign policy elites who have not adjusted their thinking so that it corresponds to Ukraine's bloody battlefield losses. Here's more from a Foreign Affairs op-ed:\n\nThe Biden administration and its European counterparts have failed to articulate their endgame for this war. Three years into the conflict, Western planning continues to be strategically backwards -- aiding Kiev has become an end in itself, divorced from a coherent strategy for bringing the war to a close.\n\nBut the \"theory of victory\" presented by Zagorodnyuk and Cohen to replace the strategic malaise in which the west finds itself is, remarkably, even more dangerous and ill-conceived than the status quo. The authors call on the White House to come out in full-throated support of Kiev's war aims: namely, ejecting all Russian forces from Ukraine's 1991 borders including Crimea, subjecting Russian officials to war crimes tribunals, extracting reparations from Moscow, and providing Ukraine with \"long-term security arrangements.\" Put differently, the West must commit itself to nothing short of Russia's total and unconditional battlefield defeat.\n\nHow is Ukraine, with its battered military, collapsing demography, and an economy entirely reliant on Western cash infusions, to accomplish this lofty task? By doing more of the same, but on a larger scale. The New Theory of Ukrainian Victory Is the Same as the Old, The American Conservative\n\nThe point we're trying to make is that this type of delusional thinking is virtually universal among US foreign policy elites none of whom are prepared to accept the fundamental reality on the ground. As a result, there is no chance that the Biden administration will make a course-correction or make any attempt to prevent a direct clash between the two nuclear-armed adversaries, NATO and Russia.\n\nSo, how would a reasonable person approach the current conflict in Ukraine?\n\nThey'd look for a way to end it ASAP while inflicting as little damage as possible on the losing side. Here's what Marymount Professor Mark Episkopos had to say in the same article above:\n\nWestern leaders are long overdue in articulating a coherent theory of victory -- one that grapples with the trade-offs and limitations confronting Kiev and its backers rather than sweeping them aside in pursuit of maximalist battlefield objectives that are increasingly detached from realities on the ground. This does not mean resigning oneself to Ukraine's unconditional surrender. Yet it will require policymakers to acknowledge that there is no viable pathway to Russia's unconditional defeat and to shape their thinking around war termination accordingly. It is not too late to end the war on terms that guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty while advancing U.S. interests. The West still has substantial leverage on and off the battlefield, but the key to wielding this influence effectively is to finally abandon a zero-sum framing of victory that has prevented leaders from repairing to a more pragmatic, strategically nimble approach. The New Theory of Ukrainian Victory Is the Same as the Old, The American Conservative\n\nBottom line: A deal can be made that will minimize the overall damage to the United States and Ukraine, but it's up to US diplomats and foreign policy elites to identify areas of common ground so an agreement can be reached that will avoid an even bigger catastrophe.\n\nThe problem with Professor Episkopos recommendation, is that it is an imminently reasonable suggestion which means it will be dismissed out-of-hand by the warhawks who set policy. Even now, US powerbrokers are certain that the war can be won if they just throw caution-to-the-wind and apply more raw, military force. That ought to do it. (they think)\n\nThis is the kind of flawed reasoning that drives the US war machine. Policy elites honestly believe that if they fully embrace a ridiculous platitude like \"We can't lose\", that somehow the reality of superior Russian firepower, manpower, logistical support and industrial capability will vanish into thin air and the \"exceptional\" nation will prevail once again. But that's not going to happen.\n\nOkay. So, what will happen?\n\nFor that, we turn to military analyst Will Schryver and a recent post on Twitter:\n\nIt... must be understood that the US/NATO could not assemble, equip, send, and sustain even a dozen competent combat brigades to engage the Russians in Ukraine.\n\nDo you realize what would happen to 50k NATO combat troops -- none of whom have EVER experienced high-intensity warfare -- if they were suddenly thrust, with necessarily deficient leadership and coordination, into the Ukraine battlefield?\n\nThey would be mercilessly slaughtered. Bleeding the Beast, Will Schryver, Twitter\n\n\"Mercilessly slaughtered\"? That doesn't sound very hopeful.\n\nEven so, France has already announced that it will send military trainers to Ukraine, and others will certainly follow. At the same time more lethal weaponry, particularly long-range missiles and F-16s are already en route and will likely be used sometime in the near future. But, will it matter? Will the provision of new weapons and combat troops turn the tide and prevent the collapse of the Ukrainian army? Here's Schryver again:\n\nWhy should the Russians object if the US/NATO sends more of its scant stockpiles of short-range ballistic and longer-range cruise missiles? The success rates for ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles has been abysmal, and steadily decreases with the passage of time. They are strategically meaningless. And there is effectively zero replenishment capacity!\n\nWhy should the Russians object if the US/NATO sends a squadron -- or even five -- of antiquated F-16s to Ukraine. Yes, of course, they would be piloted by NATO \"volunteers\", and they might even achieve a handful of overhyped and fleeting \"successes\" in the early going. But if they actually attempt to mount serious sorties over the Ukraine battlefield, old F-16s with inadequate logistics and sustainment are going to have a life span numbered in mere HOURS. Bleeding the Beast, Will Schryver, Twitter\n\nIs Schryver right? Will these prospective long-range missile strikes on targets inside Russia merely be pinprick attacks that Putin will ignore while his troops continue to crush Ukrainian forces along the 800-mile Line of Contact? And should Putin welcome the introduction of US/NATO \"ground troops\" into Ukraine to face the Russian army? Will that actually bring the war to a swifter end? Here's Schryver one more time:\n\nAt the rate this whole Ukraine debacle is going, essentially all European-based military power... is going to be attrited to \"combat-ineffective\" for at least a decade, and probably more. If I were the Russians, I would view that objective as the summum bonum (\"The highest good\") to be achieved as a result of this war, and I would be loath to interrupt the Masters of Empire while in the process of handing it to me on a silver platter....\n\nSo, if I'm Gerasimov, I would say, \"Bring 'em on! Bleeding the Beast, Will Schryver, Twitter\n\nThe furor over the use of NATO-provided long-range missiles (and deployment of F-16s and French trainers) only diverts attention from the inescapable fact that NATO is going to be defeated by the Russia Armed Forces if they enter the war. So, a wise man would pursue a negotiated settlement now before things get out of hand. But that is not what our leaders are doing, in fact, they are doing the exact opposite and escalating at every turn.\n\nSo, let's examine the facts a bit more thoroughly. Check out this summary analysis by the pros at War on the Rocks:\n\nWhen asked two weeks ago in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee whether the Army was \"outranged\" by any adversary, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley said: \"Yes ... the ones in Europe, really Russia. We don't like it, we don't want it, but yes, technically [we are] outranged, outgunned on the ground.\"\n\nGiven Russia's aggression in Ukraine, this is sobering testimony. But is it accurate? Unfortunately, yes: Nearly two years of extensive wargaming and analysis shows that if Russia were to conduct a short-warning attack against the Baltic States, Moscow's forces could roll to the outskirts of the Estonian capital of Tallinn and the Latvian capital of Riga in 36 to 60 hours. In such a scenario, the United States and its allies would not only be outranged and outgunned, but also outnumbered....\n\nOutgunned? (The Russians) have much more advanced armor, weapons, and sensors, and in some areas -- such as active protection systems to defend against anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) -- are superior to their Western counterparts....\n\nBeyond the disadvantages of being outnumbered, outranged, and outgunned, a slew of other issues compounds the problem. First, NATO allies and the U.S. military would be of limited immediate help offsetting these disadvantages. European allies followed the American lead by cutting armor and optimizing their remaining forces for \"out-of-area\" missions like Afghanistan. Thus, Great Britain is continuing with plans to withdraw its last troops from Germany, while Germany has reduced its army from a Cold War level of 10 heavy divisions to the equivalent of two.\n\nBut it's not just the numbers here that matter. The United States and its partners have also steadily reduced the infrastructure necessary to support any kind of substantial deterrent or defensive effort in Europe. Today, there are no U.S. division or corps headquarters forward-based on the continent, nor any Army aviation, engineer, and associated logistics brigades....\n\nRussia fields perhaps the most formidable array of surface-to-air missile (SAM) defenses in the world. Operating from locations within Russian territory, these SAMs far outrange existing defense-suppression weapons and present a credible threat to U.S. and allied airpower that would be costly and time-consuming to counter....\n\nToday NATO is indeed outnumbered, outranged, and outgunned by Russia in Europe and beset by a number of compounding factors that make the situation worse....\n\nA war with Russia would be fraught with escalatory potential from the moment the first shot was fired; and generations born outside the shadow of nuclear Armageddon would suddenly be reintroduced to fears thought long dead and buried. Outnumbered, Outranged, and Outgunned: How Russia Defeats NATO, War On The Rocks\n\nWhat does this analysis show?\n\nIt shows that -- despite the delusional fulminations of armchair generals on cable TV braying about inflicting a \"strategic defeat\" on Russia -- it's not going to happen. Russia has the edge in virtually every area of firepower, manpower, combat-readiness and material. They also have the industrial capability that is unmatched in the West. Here's how Schryver summed it up:\n\nThere has been no meaningful increase in armaments production in the collective west, and there won't be anytime soon. Europe has been effectively demilitarized, and the US is severely depleted and effectively deindustrialized....\n\nOutside of the hopelessly propagandized populace of the so-called \"western democracies\", no one in the world believes Russia looks \"meek\" at this point in time. Instead, they realize the Russians have completely defeated the empire's plans and exposed its weakness....\n\nThe west has no advantage whatsoever. NATO is an empty shell.... I am utterly convinced a NATO expeditionary force in Ukraine would be massacred AT LEAST as comprehensively as the AFU has been, and quite likely MUCH WORSE, and MUCH MORE RAPIDLY.... Will Schryver, Twitter\n\nThere it is in black and white: The \"deindustrialized\" West is an empty shell that has no chance of prevailing in a combined-arms ground war with Russia. Even so, Washington is determined to proceed with its lunatic plan pushing the world closer to Armageddon while bringing ruin on the American people.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com",

The former president has repeatedly attacked the criminal justice system and claimed, without evidence, that the verdict was orchestrated by Joe Biden.\n\nSpeaking earlier this week, former White House Russia specialist Fiona Hill warned that Putin was likely to see Trump's conviction as a chance to undermine the US's global influence and boost his own standing.\n\n\"What mischief does he have to make when you have people within the American system itself denigrating it and pulling it down?\" Hill, a former senior adviser to three US presidents - including Trump - said to AP.\n\nPutin, she said, was probably \"rubbing his hands with glee\" at Trump's attacks on the US criminal justice system.\n\nIn his 25-year rule, Putin has repeatedly used the Russian court system to impose long prison terms to crack down on dissent and expand political control, transforming the country from once tolerating some dissent to ruthlessly suppressing it. The Russian rights group OVD-Info estimates that more than 1,000 people are currently behind bars on politically motivated charges.\n\nEarlier this year, Putin said he would prefer to see Biden re-elected in remarks that were met with skepticism by many Russia watchers who believe his intention may be to use his notoriety to boost Trump. Trump, on his part, has frequently voiced admiration for the Russian leader.\n\n\"Basically, we don't care,\" Putin said when asked what this year's US elections would mean for relations with Moscow. \"We will work with any president the American people elect.\" He added that he \"never had any special ties with Mr Trump\".\n\nTrump and Putin have been entangled on the world stage for nearly a decade amid warnings of Russian interference in US elections. Moscow was accused of meddling in the 2016 election with the aim of boosting Trump and damaging Hillary Clinton's candidacy.\n\nA 2019 special counsel investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow ended with multiple indictments and extensive evidence of attempted obstruction by Trump, but no proof of collusion.\n\nLast month, Trump boasted that he would quickly free the jailed US journalist Evan Gershkovich from Russia if he wins the election. Putin \"will do that for me, but not for anyone else\", he wrote on his Truth Social platform, prompting fresh allegations of collusion. The Kremlin, in turn, denied discussing the case with Trump.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leonie_chao_fong@theguardian.com", "name": "L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Hill_(presidential_advisor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiona Hill (presidential advisor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political repression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85e37186e59063f5d973554023c49c359ebe3fb2/0_0_4402_2642/master/4402.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b687875b6deefeba4c3a10d1826f9209", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624887", "eventUri": "eng-9624887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Blinken himself, as well as by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and various Ukrainian military leaders.\n\nFrom the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine over two years ago, Biden had made it clear that no US troops would be sent to fight for Ukraine, and no US weapons would be used against Russian territory. Nothing would be done that could risk turning the conflict into a head-to-head battle between US and Russian forces, because it was felt (correctly!) that such a situation could quickly lead to the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nWhat changed to make Biden suddenly stop worrying about taking the first steps up what Pentagon strategists have, since the early days of the nuclear era in the late 1940s and early '50s, referred to as the \"nuclear ladder\" of tit-for-tat nuclear escalation?\n\nClearly it was the fact that Ukraine has begun losing the war. It's out of ammunition, out of anti-aircraft missiles, short of troops, is facing a mass flight of draft-age men from the country's recently expanded conscription efforts, and it is loosing ground around Kharkiv , Ukraine's second-largest city of 1.5. million located near the Russian border in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, it has become evident that the supposedly marvelous US weapons (as well as some widely banned ones like anti-personnel shells, rockets and bombs, and depleted uranium shells) have not turned the tide against Russian forces as optimistically predicted.\n\nThe reality is that this idea of attacking Russian targets -- for the moment only in Russian territory relatively close to Kharkiv, but perhaps later much more deeply inside Russia -- is nothing short of terrifying.\n\nRussia, remember, has a nuclear arsenal of ICBM missiles and nuclear warheads that closely matches the US nuclear arsenal in number and destructive power. For 75 years since the Soviet Union successfully tested its own first nuclear bomb in August 1949, that rough parity has been able to prevent the wartime use of any third nuclear weapon against another nation since the bombing of Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945.\n\nNothing has changed in those anxious years. Russia may be much weaker in many ways than the Soviet Union was, though the USSR's military was never as powerful or advanced in its nuclear capability as the US's forces. Still through all those decades, the ability of both nations to wreak unimaginable catastrophe on the other should even a fraction of its missiles reach their targets has over and over proven to be a compelling reason for even hotheads in both capitals, Washington and Moscow, to stay their hands during a crisis.\n\nWhat seems different this time is that with Russia's military proving weaker and less capable than expected in its war with Ukraine, and with the US bent on draining Russia further by simply helping keep the Ukrainians from losing, Russian President Vladimir Putin has begun stating clearly that if Russia is threatened by Western powers -- including by weapons supplied by Western powers -- it will if necessary turn to nuclear weapons.\n\nThat is where the \"escalation ladder\" comes into play.\n\nAs played by Pentagon strategists, the war games are basically a game of nuclear chicken:\n\nOne country, its forces pinned down and in danger of losing, launches a \"small\" so-called tactical nuke, which could be anywhere from a few kilotons equivalent in TNT, to 300 kilotons ( about 20 times the size of the bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945). Whether such a first shot destroys a battalion, an air base, or is an air-burst that destroys all electronic systems, that turn to nukes presents the other side with a bleak choice: sue for peace, or respond in kind with a nuclear shot targeting the other side.\n\nIn many of those games, the second country to go nuclear decides it has to up the ante to show it's willing to stand firm and go on offense, which then makes it up to the initial nuclear attacker to make its own decision to sue for peace, respond in kind and seek negotiations, or go up the next rung on the ladder with a bigger blast or a strike an a significant city.\n\nThe process of ascending the escalation ladder in these games is often quite rapid, moving from bigger and deadlier back-and-forth exchanges to a full-scale nuclear apocalypse within hours or days because of a fear on both sides that the other side could launch a full-scale attack and knock out most of its ability to retaliate.\n\nMost ordinary people are aware of this instinctively. That's why Biden tried to keep his decision to change his policy and to allow Ukraine to start using US-supplied weapons to hit Russian targets across the Russian border from Kharkiv a secret from the US public. (It certainly wouldn't after all be a secret to the Russians!)\n\nI haven't found a poll yet that asks Americans if they support the US's permitting Ukraine's military to hit targets inside of Russia's heartland, but I think it's clear from the months-long blocking of military aid to Ukraine by the Republican-led House of Representatives, that a huge swath of Republican voters would oppose the idea. Also, Donald Trump is polling slightly ahead of Biden lately, which could be either despite or perhaps even because he does not favor military aid for Ukraine.\n\nI also think Biden and his campaign strategists know that a broad swath of Democratic and independent voters are opposed to the US's doing anything that would make nuclear war with Russia more likely. (It's certainly not a great way to win the youth or the millennial vote!)\n\nWill Biden, having now approved crossing one of Putin's \"red lines,\" go further and allow deeper strikes with US-supplied missiles at targets in Russia?\n\nPerhaps, but the immediate criticism of a Ukrainian attack (not with a US weapon, but rather a Ukrainian drone) on a radar station used as part of the Russian nuclear early warning system, with an order to Ukrainian forces not to do such a thing again, suggests that total madness hasn't yet taken over at the Oval Office and the White House War Room.\n\nThe problem of course is that Biden is widely being viewed internationally as a push-over. Israel i Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been ignoring Biden's warnings not to attack Rafah, even bombing that lone-remaining still surviving city at the \"Strip's\" western border with Egypt after being presented with Biden's negotiated cease-fire deal proposal -- a proposal that Netanyahu has dismissed out of hand as \"not achieving our goals.\"\n\nWhat if Ukraine gets longer range US missiles, and then takes shots at critical targets deep inside Russia despite a lack of US approval?\n\n*. * *\n\nMeanwhile, try this experiment, suggested by Noam Chomsky and the late Edward Herman:\n\nTake a story in the US media like this one about the US approving Ukraine's use of US longer range missile to strike military targets deep inside Russia. Now wherever you see Russia, substitute US, and wherever you see US, substitute Russia. And for good measure, where it says Ukraine, replace it with Cuba or Venezuela. Now read it and see if you think you'd ever see that article in a US newspaper or magazine.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar", "body": "If we accept the fundamental truth that Ukraine is nothing more than a proxy battleground between Russia and the West, then you might say WWIII has already begun. The powers-that-be have been content to keep the situation contained primarily to Ukraine so far, but a recent event suggests things are about to change. There's something very strange happening on the nuclear front between NATO and Russia and I believe it might be time to consider the possibility that a false flag threat is in the works.\n\nIn the past two weeks Ukraine has taken credit for at least two separate strikes on peculiar targets - Russian \"over the horizon\" radar stations using drones with an impressive flight range of at least 1200 miles. Until this point, long range attacks into Russian territory have been exceedingly rare. So, why these specifics radar stations?\n\nThe Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. The strikes are being hailed as the furthest Ukraine has attacked into the heart of Russia, but the corporate media has ignored the wider implications of the situation.\n\nIt is likely that the drones used were of US or European origin. NATO has (until the past couple of days) enforced tight restrictions on how their weapons can be used by Ukraine. Long range drones and cruise missiles hitting targets deep in Russia invites major blowback, including the threat of a nuclear response.\n\nThat said, it's not so much the weapons used that concerns me, it's the specific targets that Ukraine supposedly chose.\n\nRussia's over-the-horizon radar systems have a detection range of at least 6000 miles (the real range is classified) and scan specifically for high altitude ballistic missiles. They are not designed to detect lower flying medium range cruise missiles (ATACMS) and drones. Meaning, the two stations destroyed by Ukrainian weapons are meant to act as an early warning system for nuclear attack.\n\nThe Ukrainians supposedly defied NATO restrictions, not once, but twice, to target radar systems that have nothing to do with them. In fact, the arrays sit in permanently fixed positions and neither array was actually aimed at Ukraine, they were aimed to the North and Southwest of Russia. The Armavir radar was constructed in 2009 to close a gap created by the loss of radars in Ukraine, and was also meant to replace an older Daryal radar in Gabala. Interestingly, Armavir and Orsk \"search fans\" watches the skies primarily above the Middle East, including Israel, and a large chunk of Europe including Switzerland.\n\nActivist Post is Google-Free -- We Need Your Support\n\nContribute Just $1 Per Month at Patreon or SubscribeStar\n\nInstead of attacking vital strategic resources like oil refineries or ammo depots, Russia's nuclear defenses are being systematically hobbled. Why?\n\nIt's important to understand that a strike of this kind deep into the center of Russia requires complex planning and logistics. It cannot be achieved without covert intel on the ground as well as aid from satellite surveillance. Ukraine relies completely on NATO satellites and intel; no such strike would ever be possible without NATO involvement. Furthermore, the drones used would need to have the ability to evade early detection systems and remain hidden for thousands of miles. This kind of technology comes mainly from the West.\n\nIn other words, there's no way that these attacks were accomplished by Ukraine without extensive help and approval from the US or European command. I question the notion that a Ukrainian pilot was even remotely flying the drones. We're talking about some of the most closely defended radar stations in the whole of Russia.\n\nWhy does any of this matter? Let's consider the ugly realities...\n\nFirst, the targeting of Russian nuclear defenses might make the Kremlin believe they are being prepped for a nuclear strike. Why else would their ballistic radar be singled out? This means they will be on high alert for a possible nuclear exchange. Not good.\n\nSecond, the Voronezh-DM stations are used to identify FALSE POSITIVE alerts of nuclear attack. Meaning, if there a weapon is used against Russia that mimics a high altitude ballistic missile, their ability to detect that it's NOT a nuke has been reduced. They might launch their own warheads in response to a non-nuclear strike (a fake strike or false flag).\n\nThird, Armavir and other stations could be used to record ballistic missile activity well outside Russian air space (in places like the Middle East). It's possible these strikes were meant to blind Russia and stop them from detecting missile events that are unrelated to the Ukraine war.\n\nFourth, it's possible that NATO and Ukraine believe dismantling the radar sends a message that if Russia threatens nuclear attack, they might be hit first. All this means is that Russia won't give a warning, they'll simply launch.\n\nFifth, the attack on Armavir alone meets the conditions the Russian government laid out publicly in 2020 for actions that could trigger a nuclear retaliatory strike. Russia's early warning network is part of the country's broader nuclear deterrent posture.\n\n\"The conditions specifying the possibility of nuclear weapons use by the Russian Federation\" include any \"attack by an adversary against critical governmental or military sites of the Russian Federation, disruption of which would undermine nuclear forces response actions,\" according to the Basic Principles of State Policy of the Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence the Kremlin published in 2020.\n\nSo far there has been no indication on how Russia will retaliate, but let's consider the circumstances at the front right now. Ukrainian defenses are thin and they lack the manpower needed to maintain the most rudimentary of strong points. As I noted last month, Ukraine's front line is about to be overrun, likely this summer, with Russia opening a new offensive push in the north near Kharkiv.\n\nNATO countries are now say they support Ukraine's use of long range weapons inside Russia. This means major metropolitan areas of Ukraine will be on the the table for Russia's own long range strikes, a measure which they have avoided for the most part. Also watch for the potential use of thermobaric bombs (vacuum bombs) by Russia; these are massively destructive weapons that have so far been absent from the battlefield (aside from unverified reports).\n\nThe West is sending Russia the message that they will not allow Ukraine to lose, they will not pursue diplomatic solutions and if Russia begins gaining significant ground, anything goes. Does this include nukes? It's hard to say.\n\nMy suspicion is that the establishment wants to create a scenario in which Russia is led to overreact to an event, or, the public is led to believe Russia is a legitimate nuclear threat to the West. There is also the outside possibility that Russia is being blocked from monitoring a future ballistic incident in the Middle East.\n\nThe timing of the radar attacks comes only weeks before the planned Ukraine \"peace conference\" in Switzerland on June 15. Although major leaders from the US, China, and Europe will not be attending (and Russia isn't invited), the summit is still a juicy target for a false flag and thus unification of Western interests around a larger war with Russia. I'm not saying the conference itself will be attacked, necessarily, but a major attack during the conference could be used to sell the idea of total NATO intervention.\n\nIf the goal is to expand the war then any perceived hostilities aimed at the conference could also be used as an excuse to rally popular support. The fact that so many world leaders including Biden refuse to show up makes it even more dubious.\n\nI highly doubt the establishment wants to trigger a global nuclear war. They have everything to lose and very little to gain. They just spent the better part of the last century building up one of the most intricate economic and political control grids in the history of humanity. I don't think they would be happy to see it all vaporized in the blink of an eye. That said, a limited nuclear event might serve their interests well.\n\nAs I write this multiple governments including the French government are calling for European troops to be deployed to Ukraine. Some political leaders want them to go as \"advisers\" and trainers. This is exactly what the US did right before it deployed extensive military forces to Vietnam. Remember the false flag Gulf of Tonkin incident?\n\nSomething very odd is going on here. I have no doubt that WWIII is the intended outcome of the confrontation between NATO and Russia in Ukraine. The question is, how do they plan to arrange that outcome while convincing the American and European public to join the war effort? They need a serious false flag.\n\nIf you would like to support the work that Alt-Market does while also receiving content on advanced tactics for defeating the globalist agenda, subscribe to our exclusive newsletter The Wild Bunch Dispatch.

She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and senior columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN\n\nParachutes flapped open in midair over France on Sunday as US paratroopers leaped out of World War II-era military planes, launching the start of a week of solemn commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day, a week that will bring dozens of world leaders, including President Joe Biden, for events that will be rich in symbolism and resonant with current times.\n\nFrida Ghitis\n\nCNN\n\nFor decades, the United States, its allies and others have come together to remember the June 6, 1944, US-led landing in Normandy, the largest seaborne invasion in history and the pivotal final stage of the Allied push to defeat Nazi Germany's devastating, genocidal campaign of conquest.\n\nThe ceremonies, as is tradition, honor those who fought and died in World War II, and reaffirm a commitment to learn the lessons of history. But what exactly are those lessons, and how exactly will world leaders turn that commitment into reality?\n\nThat nebulous pledge to prevent history from repeating itself has become starkly concrete as Russian forces seek to subjugate Ukraine in the first major land war in Europe since World War II.\n\nAnd in a remarkable twist, history also echoes in the possibly next president of the United States, Donald Trump, who has revived the term \"America First,\" used in the 1930s and '40s by Americans who wanted the US to stand back, even as Hitler launched a war to conquer Europe.\n\nAs he foreshadows potentially drastic changes in the US approach to Europe's defense and to the war in Ukraine, Trump is raising \"existential\" anxiety among US allies.\n\nReenactors participate in a ceremony Tuesday at Utah Beach near Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, France, in celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nDaniel Cole/AP\n\nIn France this week, Biden will join some 25 prime ministers and presidents -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend; Russia's Vladimir Putin has not been invited -- marking the occasion. Biden will then travel to Paris for a state visit.\n\nDuring his time in France, he will speak \"about the importance of defending freedom and democracy,\" and discuss \"a wide range of global challenges.\"\n\nTopping the agenda: how to help Ukraine.\n\nThe host, French President Emmanuel Macron, has emerged as one of the most outspoken advocates of upgrading support for Kyiv, contrasting with Biden's assertive but more cautious approach.\n\nMacron's transformation has been remarkable. In the weeks leading up to Russia's unprovoked full-scale invasion of its neighbor, he traveled to Moscow, meeting with Putin at his colossally long Covid-19-distancing table, in search of a way to prevent the conflagration.\n\nThose who thought Macron was being too deferential to the Russian dictator had extra reason to cringe when, months after Russian forces crossed into Ukraine, Macron declared that \"we must not humiliate Russia.\" And all as Russia's plan to score a swift victory was unraveling and Biden was reaffirming his unwavering support for Kyiv.\n\nIn the intervening years, Macron's stance has hardened as his view of the risk Russia poses to Europe and the West has darkened. In April, he warned, \"Our Europe is mortal; it can die,\" partly as a result of Russia's aggression.\n\nEarlier this year, he jolted Europeans when he declared that nothing can be ruled out, not even sending Western troops to Ukraine, adding \"We will do anything we can to prevent Russia from winning.\"\n\nGermany rejected the idea, as did others. But apparently Macron was doing more than trying to stiffen allies' spines.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, right, has emerged as one of the most outspoken advocates of upgrading support for Kyiv. Here he meets with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in Spain in October.\n\nLudovic Marin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, this week, with Biden and Zelensky in France, Macron will announce that European troops will, in fact, soon go to Ukraine.\n\nOne of the most pressing decisions faced by Ukraine's backers now is how much freedom to give Kyiv to strike Russian targets with the weapons they provide.\n\nThe dilemma embodies one of the two fears driving Western support. On one hand, Europe and the United States fear that if Russia wins, Putin will continue pushing to conquer territories that belonged not just to the Soviet Union but also to the Russian Empire.\n\nThat's a concern searingly underscored by the lessons of World War II, when Hitler was allowed to slice off a piece of Czechoslovakia, then moved into Poland and barreled across Europe until he was finally stopped.\n\nThe worry is palpable among Russia's neighbors and is one of the reasons Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has told his people to prepare, calling this time a \"prewar era.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the fear is that giving Ukraine carte blanche to strike at Russia risks escalating the conflict into one between nuclear-armed Russia and nuclear-armed NATO, perhaps World War III.\n\nCan the war be contained and Russia defeated?\n\nZelensky has been imploring Kyiv's friends to let Ukraine use their arms to strike inside Russia. While allies discussed the issue, Russian forces, facing little risk, struck a department store in Kharkiv, not far from the Russian border, killing 18 people.\n\n\"Please give us the permission\" to use the weapons for preventing those attacks, Zelensky implored allies. He won't use them without permission, for fear of losing Western support.\n\nUS soldiers attend a wreath-laying ceremony Tuesday at the 1st Infantry Division monument near Omaha Beach.\n\nJeremias Gonzalez/AP\n\nThe West remains divided on the issue. Biden has loosened some of the restrictions. Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz want them loosened even more, though still restricted. Finland and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg say Ukraine's friends are forcing it to fight with one hand tied behind its back.\n\nThe D-Day anniversary meetings are sure to include discussions about how to stop Russia, and the question of whether Russia, if facing a more empowered Ukraine, would really face off directly with the West, as Putin threatens.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter\n\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.

Eventually, 16.4 million Americans served in the military during World War II, more than 10% of the population. Some 29,000 Americans died in the Normandy invasion, in a war that engulfed 50 countries, a catastrophe that would kill more than 70 million people, one of every 30 people who were alive when it started.\n\nThe conflicts are not the same; the ideologies and the leaders are different.

The former president has repeatedly attacked the criminal justice system and claimed, without evidence, that the verdict was orchestrated by Joe Biden.\n\nSpeaking earlier this week, the former White House Russia specialist Fiona Hill warned that Putin was likely to see Trump's conviction as a chance to undermine the US's global influence and boost his own standing.\n\n\"What mischief does he have to make when you have people within the American system itself denigrating it and pulling it down?\" Hill, a former senior adviser to three US presidents - including Trump - said to AP.\n\nPutin, she said, was probably \"rubbing his hands with glee\" at Trump's attacks on the US criminal justice system.\n\nIn his 25-year rule, Putin has repeatedly used the Russian court system to impose long prison terms to crack down on dissent and expand political control, transforming the country from once tolerating some dissent to ruthlessly suppressing it. The Russian rights group OVD-Info estimates that more than 1,000 people are currently behind bars on politically motivated charges.\n\nEarlier this year, Putin said he would prefer to see Biden re-elected in remarks that were met with skepticism by many Russia watchers who believe his intention may be to use his notoriety to boost Trump. Trump, on his part, has frequently voiced admiration for the Russian leader.\n\n\"Basically, we don't care,\" Putin said when asked what this year's US elections would mean for relations with Moscow. \"We will work with any president the American people elect.\" He added that he \"never had any special ties with Mr Trump\".\n\nTrump and Putin have been entangled on the world stage for nearly a decade amid warnings of Russian interference in US elections. Moscow was accused of meddling in the 2016 election with the aim of boosting Trump and damaging Hillary Clinton's candidacy.\n\nA 2019 special counsel investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow ended with multiple indictments and extensive evidence of attempted obstruction by Trump, but no proof of collusion.\n\nLast month, Trump boasted that he would quickly free the jailed US journalist Evan Gershkovich from Russia if he wins the election. Putin \"will do that for me, but not for anyone else\", he wrote on his Truth Social platform, prompting fresh allegations of collusion. The Kremlin, in turn, denied discussing the case with Trump.\n\n\"There aren't any contacts with Donald Trump,\" the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Hill_(presidential_advisor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiona Hill (presidential advisor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political repression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Peskov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Peskov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/d447e02b62eb61867ffb151fd0f8b46a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624887", "eventUri": "eng-9624887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Now he reverses the policy -- aka, he lied. So where's the pushback? Congress, media? What could be of greater consequence than lying the country into war with a nuclear superpower?\"\n\nAre the peoples of the Western world so completely insouciant that they do not notice that their politicians are pushing them into direct conflict with Russia? It seems Hungarians are the only European people who have any sense.\n\nhttps://www.rt.com/news/598644-budapest-peace-march-nato/\n\nThe Kremlin could not issue any warnings more dire, and in response moronic Western politicians provoke harder. Are they unable to comprehend that they are provoking a nuclear war, or is it their intention to provoke a nuclear war?\n\nBiden, Blinken, and NATO have made another U-turn. The long range missiles that Ukraine could not use for attacks on Russian territory can now be used that way, but, for now, only on military targets. But the distinction between military and non-military targets is a distinction without meaning or substance. All modern wars are attacks on civilians and infrastructure.\n\nThe argument that resulted in removing restrictions on long range missiles is that in order to defend itself Ukraine needs to be able to use the weapons Washington provides to attack the military infrastructure that Russia uses to attack Ukraine.\n\nRussia will simply attack the sites from which it is being attacked, so the long range missiles will contribute nothing to Ukraine's defense. Even worse: as the Kremlin knows the missiles have to be programmed with targeting information by US and NATO personnel, Russia regards the countries responsible for the targeting as combatants and targets. We are on the verge of the final widening of the war.\n\nAs every previous no-no became a yes-yes, the Kremlin has to assume that the no-no prohibition on sending NATO troops will soon become a yes-yes. If realism prevails in the Kremlin, this forces Putin to abandon his limited military operation and to knock out Ukraine before it fills up with NATO soldiers.\n\nFrom the beginning it was obvious to me that the limited military operation was a strategic blunder that would allow the West to become involved, with the consequence being the widening of the war. That is precisely what has happened. We have reached the point where Putin is telling the West to back off or out come the nukes.\n\nBut no one in the West hears.\n\nAs every previous no-no became a yes-yes, the Kremlin has to assume that the no-no prohibition on sending NATO troops will soon become a yes-yes. If realism prevails in the Kremlin, this forces Putin to abandon his limited military operation and to knock out Ukraine before it fills up with NATO soldiers.\n\nWashington cares no more for Ukrainians than it cares for Palestinians. The Ukraine conflict is a way for Washington to force Russia into a response that can be used to justify a US/NATO attack on Russia. What is to be served by this? It is a form of suicide for the West.\n\nWhere is a responsible Western leader to diffuse this dangerous situation? Why are there none? Keeping Russian Donbas in Ukraine, where it should never have been put, is not worth the war that is being fomented. As the long range missiles cannot improve Ukraine's battlefield performance, their only purpose is to be used for provocations. Anyone looking at the situation who thinks more provocations are what is needed is insane.\n\nIt is mind-boggling to actually watch Western leaders foment a nuclear war.\n\nThere is no opposition from Congress. None from print and TV media. None from European governments except Hungary. Western peoples are too insouciant to understand that they are standing on the edge of annihilation.\n\n\"We Are Inches Away from Destruction\" -- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban\n\nSome who find reality too upsetting take issue with my warnings of how close we are to a final war. I have acquired a new accolade -- \"scaremonger.\" But I am not the only aware person on earth. Dr. Postal at MIT understands the seriousness of the situation, as does Mike Whitney, Steven Starr, Gilbert Doctorow, Scott Ritter, and Viktor Orban. Even the restrained, unprovocative Putin now understands that Russia is confronted with war, not a limited military operation to liberate the Donbas Russians.\n\nPrime Minister Orban says that every week he sees more and more signs that the EU and NATO are preparing for military action. The Western governments, Orban has concluded, \"want to defeat Russia, they want to achieve military success at any cost.\" The cost will be life on the planet. Why is Ukraine's NATO membership more important than the massive loss of life and perhaps the livability of life on the planet? https://tass.com/world/1796133\n\nIt is extraordinary that the Western world will do nothing to stop Israel's genocide of the Palestinians, but is prepared to destroy life on earth for the artificial borders of an artificial country called Ukraine, which is known historically as \"the Ukraine,\" that is, as a province of a larger country.\n\nOrban tells the truth. He says \"NATO is a strong defensive alliance created to protect its member states, not to intervene in another war.\" Orban says he will do what he can to prevent Hungary from being drawn into the maelstrom. \"This is not our war, and Hungarians should not suffer because of it.\"\n\nBut Hungary along with any survivors and Mother Earth herself and all her creatures and plant life will suffer from the massive fires, radioactivity, perhaps a nuclear winter, total disruption of all global supply chains, and so forth. The countries that survive, if any, will be those well removed from the blast zones, wind patterns loaded with radioactivity, and self sufficient in food production. All economies dependent on global relationships will be destroyed.\n\nThe world as it is organized today cannot survive a major war. How will cities of millions of people be sustained when supply chains no longer exist? Without war Mexico City with its 20 millions is almost empty of water.\n\nI can continue asking this kind of questions, to which there are no answers.\n\nBut it is pointless.\n\nThe problem is that except for Orban and Putin, every Western political leader is committed to war for no justifiable reason.\n\nThere is no reason for the pending war. Ukraine can exist as a neutral state. Washington can pull back its presence on Russia's borders.\n\nThe American neoconservatives' nonsensical demand for US hegemony can be abandoned. Whatever the consequences of accepting reality, they are better than nuclear war.\n\nWhy is it that no one in the Western world understands the threat to life?\n\nWhat is the explanation for Biden now approaching the end of his fourth year in office HAVING NEVER MET WITH PUTIN IN AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE MOST DANGEROUS CRISIS IN HUMAN HISTORY?\n\nThe dumbshits governing us do not comprehend that today's thermonuclear weapons can be a thousand times more powerful as the atomic bombs the US dropped on two Japanese civilian cities. The weapons today do not merely obliterate large cities, they obliterate large regions.\n\nSteven Starr and other experts have expressed their concerns that a nuclear war could fill the atmosphere with dust and debris that would block the sun for years until it settled. In those years there may be a limited or non-existent growing season. Therefore, all life can be the casualty.\n\nFrom a presentation by Dr. Theodore Postal, Massachusetts Institute of Technology:\n\nThe Russian nuclear Early Warning System (EWS) at Amir was damaged by an attack. The decision to attack the Russian EWS was made in Washington. The drones were guided to their targets using US aerial and satellite reconnaissance (they have to take multiple evasive actions in the course of their flights to evade Russian radar systems, and this can only be supplied via real-time targeting information provided by the US). The operators of the drones were likely mercenaries trained in the US or out-of-uniform US troops. Russia knows this and so it considers this a US attack on its nuclear Early Warning System.\n\nThe attack was reckless beyond comprehension. ANY such attacks against the EWS system used to protect Russia from a nuclear attack can justify, under Russian law, a nuclear retaliatory strike.\n\nThe US/NATO/Ukraine previously conducted multiple drone attacks on the Russian airbase at Engels, which is where Russia keeps its long-range strategic nuclear bombers. It appeared that at least in one of these attacks, a strategic nuclear bomber was damaged. Engels airbase is hundreds of miles inside of Russia and the drones could not have made it to the base without real-time targeting information supplied by US aerial and satellite reconnaissance.\n\nRussian military planners must consider these attacks as a possible prelude to a nuclear first strike against Russia by the United States.\n\nThe US and NATO are also preparing to send F-16s to Ukraine. Russia has announced that they will consider these to be nuclear-capable weapon systems and treat them accordingly, including striking whatever bases these weapons are launched from -- inside or outside of Ukraine (meaning in Poland and Romania).\n\nBiden today authorized attacks inside Russia using US long-range weapons. France and Germany then followed the US, giving their approval to the use of Western-supplied weapons to attack targets inside Russia.\n\nThe situation in Ukraine is escalating to the point of being out of control. Yet Western mass media ignores these events and the general public remains blissfully unaware that their leaders continue to escalate the war in Ukraine to the point where it can become a nuclear war that will destroy all nations and peoples.\n\nGilbert Doctorow explains that Russia's \"dead hand\" launch system cannot be deterred by a first strike\n\nGilbert Doctorow reminds us that the Russians have a \"dead hand\" launch system. Even if every Russian command and control center is wiped out in a first strike against Russia, sufficient missiles launch to wipe out the US and Western Europe. In other words, there is no advantage in a US first strike on Russia. https://gilbertdoctorow.com/2024/06/01/first-strike-capable-why-russia-is-indifferent-to-damage-to-one-or-another-ground-based-radar-installation/\n\nDoctorow also reminds us that it only takes one fully loaded hypersonic non-interceptible Sarmat multiple warhead missile to level a country the size of the UK to the ground, and only several to erase the US from the map. It goes far beyond insanity for Europe and the US to cultivate their own suicide. The media keep all information from the public, which is unaware that its continued existence is in question.\n\nHere is Scott Ritter on the likely consequences of attacks inside Russia:\n\nScott Ritter reminds us that the weapons used to strike inside Russia have to be programmed by the US/NATO countries that supply them. Ukraine is ancillary to the process. Russia understands this and has stated that Russia will attack the countries responsible.\n\nHere is a summary of the Scott Ritter video provided by an expert who shares my concern that Washington is driving the world into nuclear war:\n\n\"Scott Ritter explains that any further attacks on Russian strategic sites or attacks on Russian territory using missiles or cruise missiles will result in Russia hitting back against all the NATO targets -- inside and outside Ukraine -- responsible for such attacks.\n\n\"This includes US aerial reconnaissance assets: US satellites, AWACS, and Reaper drones; it includes any NATO headquarters and air bases that were involved in the preparation, programming, targeting, and launching of the long-range missiles and drones used to hit Russian territory. This includes bases within France, the UK, Germany, and possibly the US.\n\n\"Ritter says that such attacks would result in the NATO nations struck by Russian retaliatory strikes invoking Article V of the NATO Charter, claiming they had been attacked by Russia. Ritter says that if NATO member states take this action and unite in war against Russia, then Russia will launch a massive nuclear strike against all these nations. I hope he is wrong.\n\n\"Given that the US, the UK, France, and Germany have all signed off on using long-range weapons against Russia, albeit in a 'limited' area of Russia, I think we are close to the scenario that Ritter suggests because the 'limited' area of Russia subject to attack will expand. A situation will arise where Putin is forced to hit back in a way that is decisive. The West will deny that the Russian strike is in retaliation for their own thinly disguised attacks on Russia -- they will call the Russian strikes \"unprovoked aggression\" and an act of war.\n\n\"The US and NATO have been hiding behind the lie that it is Ukraine fighting Russia -- not the West fighting Russia. When US, UK, French, and German weapons arrive in Ukraine, they become \"Ukrainian weapons\", and thus Ukraine, not the West, is made responsible for whatever is done with them, whatever targets they hit.\n\n\"Russia no longer will accept the lie that only Ukraine, not the West, is at war with Russia. Even Putin has publicly stated that the high-tech, long-range weapons are US and NATO weapons, programmed, operated, guided, and launched by US/NATO troops. The targets are decided on by the US, not by Ukraine. The weapons have to use real-time guidance from US aerial and satellite reconnaissance, hence, Russia will destroy the satellites, drones, and AWACs providing the targeting information. All the components of the attacks on Russia will be targeted.\n\n\"Russia is not bluffing. Russia will not back down.\"\n\nIt is extraordinary that the entire political leadership of the Western world is pushing the world into nuclear war. Why does the West seek its own destruction? What is to be gained?\n\nDuring the 20th century Cold War in which I was intimately involved both as a trustee of the Committee on the Present Danger and as a member of a secret Presidential Committee with authority to investigate the CIA's opposition to President Reagan's effort to end the Cold War and normalize relations with the Soviet Union, I can say with confidence that even hard line anti-communists sought to reduce tensions instead of provoking war.\n\nWhat I have witnessed in the 21st century is the most egregious cultivation of war by the US government in human history, and no one in the print or TV media tells us the consequences.\n\nNeo-Nazi ideology has become one of the main protagonists of political and social life in Ukraine since the 2014 coup d'\u00e9tat. Meanwhile, fascist ideology and blatant lies also permeate the consciousness of most people in the West. Those in the comfortable top 10%, the \"PMCs\" (Professional Managerial Class), are especially vulnerable. They support and disseminate such ideas. They are the executors of the actual ruling class' orders, those in the 0.001%, who remain largely invisible. The PMCs are the political class, the media whores, the top military brass, some people in academia, and the \"national security/foreign policy\" industry honchos.

Feel free to repost and share widely Global Research articles.\n\nGlobal Research Wants to Hear From You!\n\n***\n\nThere is a vast difference between \"not winning\" and \"losing\" a war.\n\nIn the case of Ukraine, \"not winning\" means that President Zelensky and his handlers in Washington choose to pursue a negotiated settlement that would allow Russia to keep the territory it captured during the war while addressing Moscow's modest security demands. (Note -- Ukraine must reject any intention of joining NATO)\n\nOn the other hand, \"losing\" the war means that the US and NATO continue on the same path they are today -- pumping lethal weapons, trainers and long-range missiles systems into Ukraine -- hoping that the Russian offensive is progressively weakened so Ukraine can prevail on the battlefield. This alternate path -- which amounts to 'wishful thinking' -- is the path to \"losing\" the war.\n\nUnlike the \"not winning\" the war scenario, \"losing\" the war will have a catastrophic effect on the United States and its future.\n\nIt would mean that Washington had been unable to prevent a Russian military incursion into Europe which is NATO's primary raison d'etre. It would challenge the idea that the US is capable of acting as the guarantor of regional security which is the role the US has enjoyed since the end of WW2. The perception of a US defeat at the hands of Russia would unavoidably trigger a re-evaluation of current security relations leading to the dissolution of NATO and, very possibly, the EU as well. Simply put, losing the war would be a disaster. Here's how Colonel Daniel Davis summed it up just last week:\n\n\"We can't let Russia win.\"\n\nI've heard that throughout the entire 2-plus years of the war. But here's what I'm saying: If you keep going down this path -- ignoring all the realities we keep talking about -- not only will Russia win, we'll lose. And I assure you if you thought it was bad to 'let Putin win' -- which means having a negotiated settlement in which Putin ends up with territory he didn't start the war with -- ...But if you say that -- because I don't want that to happen, I'm going to keep fighting -- that implies you think you can win. But if you can't win, then the likely outcome is that you lose even more, and that's what's really going to hurt our credibility because, imagine if the whole force of NATO was shown to be unable to stop Russia from winning? Now our credibility is damaged far worse than having a negotiated settlement Colonel Daniel Davis, You Tube\n\nSo, while \"not winning\" is not the perfect outcome, it is vastly superior to \"losing\" which would severely undermine the Alliance's credibility, greatly erode Washington's power in Europe, and force the US to rethink its plans for projecting power into Central Asia. (pivot to Asia) In short, a US defeat by Russia in Ukraine would be a serious body-blow to the \"rules-based order\" and the denouement of the American Century.\n\nSo, there's a lot at stake for the United States. Unfortunately, there is no real debate in elite power circles about the best way forward. And, that's because the decision has already been made, and that decision hews closely to the maximalist views articulated in an article at the Atlantic Council titled \"NATO at 75: The Alliance's future lies in Ukraine's victory against Russia\"\n\nNATO will mark its seventy-fifth anniversary on April 4 as history's most successful military alliance. However, its future as a credible deterrent to aggression now lies in the success or failure of Russia's unjust and brutal invasion of Ukraine.....\n\nAllied leaders have unambiguously bound NATO's security to this war. NATO summits have repeatedly condemned the invasion and demanded that Russia \"completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its forces and equipment from the territory of Ukraine.\"\n\nAnd the rhetoric has escalated. French President Emmanuel Macron recently described the war as \"existential\" for Europe. \"If Russia wins this war, Europe's credibility would be reduced to zero,\" Macron said...\n\nIf the upcoming Washington summit is to inspire continued confidence in NATO's credibility, and thus its future, then t he Alliance must take action to place Ukraine onto a clear path to victory...\n\nAllied leaders must unambiguously endorse Ukraine's war objectives -- that is, total territorial reconstitution back to the nation's 1991 borders. Anything short of that is a disillusioning signal to Ukraine and encouragement to Putin to sustain his invasion. NATO at 75: The Alliance's future lies in Ukraine's victory against Russia, atlanticcouncil.org\n\nRepeat: Allied leaders must unambiguously endorse Ukraine's war objectives -- that is, total territorial reconstitution back to the nation's 1991 borders. Anything short of that is a disillusioning signal to Ukraine and encouragement to Putin to sustain his invasion.\n\nAs we said earlier, this maximalist view of NATO's objectives is nothing more than wishful thinking. The anemic UAF is not going to drive the Russian Army out of Ukraine nor are they going to win the war. Even so, the views above are shared by the vast majority of foreign policy elites who have not adjusted their thinking so that it corresponds to Ukraine's bloody battlefield losses. Here's more from a Foreign Affairsop-ed:\n\nThe Biden administration and its European counterparts have failed to articulate their endgame for this war. Three years into the conflict, Western planning continues to be strategically backwards -- aiding Kiev has become an end in itself, divorced from a coherent strategy for bringing the war to a close.\n\nBut the \"theory of victory\" presented by Zagorodnyuk and Cohen to replace the strategic malaise in which the west finds itself is, remarkably, even more dangerous and ill-conceived than the status quo. The authors call on the White House to come out in full-throated support of Kiev's war aims: namely, ejecting all Russian forces from Ukraine's 1991 borders including Crimea, subjecting Russian officials to war crimes tribunals, extracting reparations from Moscow, and providing Ukraine with \"long-term security arrangements.\" Put differently, the West must commit itself to nothing short of Russia's total and unconditional battlefield defeat.\n\nHow is Ukraine, with its battered military, collapsing demography, and an economy entirely reliant on Western cash infusions, to accomplish this lofty task? By doing more of the same, but on a larger scale. The New Theory of Ukrainian Victory Is the Same as the Old, The American Conservative\n\nThe point we're trying to make is that this type of delusional thinking is virtually universal among US foreign policy elites none of whom are prepared to accept the fundamental reality on the ground. As a result, there is no chance that the Biden administration will make a course-correction or make any attempt to prevent a direct clash between the two nuclear-armed adversaries, NATO and Russia.\n\nSo, how would a reasonable person approach the current conflict in Ukraine?\n\nThey'd look for a way to end it ASAP while inflicting as little damage as possible on the losing side. Here's what Marymount Professor Mark Episkopos had to say in the same article above:\n\nWestern leaders are long overdue in articulating a coherent theory of victory -- one that grapples with the trade-offs and limitations confronting Kiev and its backers rather than sweeping them aside in pursuit of maximalist battlefield objectives that are increasingly detached from realities on the ground. This does not mean resigning oneself to Ukraine's unconditional surrender. Yet it will require policymakers to acknowledge that there is no viable pathway to Russia's unconditional defeat and to shape their thinking around war termination accordingly. It is not too late to end the war on terms that guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty while advancing U.S. interests. The West still has substantial leverage on and off the battlefield, but the key to wielding this influence effectively is to finally abandon a zero-sum framing of victory that has prevented leaders from repairing to a more pragmatic, strategically nimble approach. The New Theory of Ukrainian Victory Is the Same as the Old, The American Conservative\n\nBottom line: A deal can be made that will minimize the overall damage to the United States and Ukraine, but it's up to US diplomats and foreign policy elites to identify areas of common ground so an agreement can be reached that will avoid an even bigger catastrophe.\n\nThe problem with Professor Episkopos recommendation, is that it is an imminently reasonable suggestion which means it will be dismissed out-of-hand by the warhawks who set policy. Even now, US powerbrokers are certain that the war can be won if they just throw caution-to-the-wind and apply more raw, military force. That ought to do it. (they think)\n\nThis is the kind of flawed reasoning that drives the US war machine. Policy elites honestly believe that if they fully embrace a ridiculous platitude like \"We can't lose\", that somehow the reality of superior Russian firepower, manpower, logistical support and industrial capability will vanish into thin air and the \"exceptional\" nation will prevail once again. But that's not going to happen.\n\nOkay. So, what will happen?\n\nFor that, we turn to military analyst Will Schryver and a recent post on Twitter:\n\nIt... must be understood that the US/NATO could not assemble, equip, send, and sustain even a dozen competent combat brigades to engage the Russians in Ukraine.\n\nDo you realize what would happen to 50k NATO combat troops -- none of whom have EVER experienced high-intensity warfare -- if they were suddenly thrust, with necessarily deficient leadership and coordination, into the Ukraine battlefield?\n\nThey would be mercilessly slaughtered. Bleeding the Beast, Will Schryver, Twitter\n\n\"Mercilessly slaughtered\"? That doesn't sound very hopeful.\n\nEven so, France has already announced that it will send military trainers to Ukraine, and others will certainly follow. At the same time more lethal weaponry, particularly long-range missiles and F-16s are already en route and will likely be used sometime in the near future. But, will it matter? Will the provision of new weapons and combat troops turn the tide and prevent the collapse of the Ukrainian army? Here's Schryver again:\n\nWhy should the Russians object if the US/NATO sends more of its scant stockpiles of short-range ballistic and longer-range cruise missiles? The success rates for ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles has been abysmal, and steadily decreases with the passage of time. They are strategically meaningless. And there is effectively zero replenishment capacity!\n\nWhy should the Russians object if the US/NATO sends a squadron -- or even five -- of antiquated F-16s to Ukraine. Yes, of course, they would be piloted by NATO \"volunteers\", and they might even achieve a handful of overhyped and fleeting \"successes\" in the early going. But if they actually attempt to mount serious sorties over the Ukraine battlefield, old F-16s with inadequate logistics and sustainment are going to have a life span numbered in mere HOURS. Bleeding the Beast, Will Schryver, Twitter\n\nIs Schryver right? Will these prospective long-range missile strikes on targets inside Russia merely be pinprick attacks that Putin will ignore while his troops continue to crush Ukrainian forces along the 800-mile Line of Contact? And should Putin welcome the introduction of US/NATO \"ground troops\" into Ukraine to face the Russian army? Will that actually bring the war to a swifter end? Here's Schryver one more time:\n\nAt the rate this whole Ukraine debacle is going, essentially all European-based military power... is going to be attrited to \"combat-ineffective\" for at least a decade, and probably more. If I were the Russians, I would view that objective as the summum bonum (\"The highest good\") to be achieved as a result of this war, and I would be loath to interrupt the Masters of Empire while in the process of handing it to me on a silver platter....\n\nSo, if I'm Gerasimov, I would say, \"Bring 'em on! Bleeding the Beast, Will Schryver, Twitter\n\nThe furor over the use of NATO-provided long-range missiles (and deployment of F-16s and French trainers) only diverts attention from the inescapable fact that NATO is going to be defeated by the Russia Armed Forces if they enter the war. So, a wise man would pursue a negotiated settlement now before things get out of hand. But that is not what our leaders are doing, in fact, they are doing the exact opposite and escalating at every turn.\n\nSo, let's examine the facts a bit more thoroughly. Check out this summary analysis by the pros at War on the Rocks:\n\nWhen asked two weeks ago in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee whether the Army was \"outranged\" by any adversary, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley said: \"Yes ... the ones in Europe, really Russia. We don't like it, we don't want it, but yes, technically [we are] outranged, outgunned on the ground.\"\n\nGiven Russia's aggression in Ukraine, this is sobering testimony. But is it accurate? Unfortunately, yes: Nearly two years of extensive wargaming and analysis shows that if Russia were to conduct a short-warning attack against the Baltic States, Moscow's forces could roll to the outskirts of the Estonian capital of Tallinn and the Latvian capital of Riga in 36 to 60 hours. In such a scenario, the United States and its allies would not only be outranged and outgunned, but also outnumbered....\n\nOutgunned? (The Russians) have much more advanced armor, weapons, and sensors, and in some areas -- such as active protection systems to defend against anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) -- are superior to their Western counterparts....\n\nBeyond the disadvantages of being outnumbered, outranged, and outgunned, a slew of other issues compounds the problem. First, NATO allies and the U.S. military would be of limited immediate help offsetting these disadvantages.European allies followed the American lead by cutting armor and optimizing their remaining forces for \"out-of-area\" missions like Afghanistan. Thus, Great Britain is continuing with plans to withdraw its last troops from Germany, while Germany has reduced its army from a Cold War level of 10 heavy divisions to the equivalent of two.\n\nBut it's not just the numbers here that matter. The United States and its partners have also steadily reduced the infrastructure necessary to support any kind of substantial deterrent or defensive effort in Europe. Today, there are no U.S. division or corps headquarters forward-based on the continent, nor any Army aviation, engineer, and associated logistics brigades....\n\nRussia fields perhaps the most formidable array of surface-to-air missile (SAM) defenses in the world. Operating from locations within Russian territory, these SAMs far outrange existing defense-suppression weapons and present a credible threat to U.S. and allied airpower that would be costly and time-consuming to counter....\n\nToday NATO is indeed outnumbered, outranged, and outgunned by Russia in Europe and beset by a number of compounding factors that make the situation worse....\n\nA war with Russia would be fraught with escalatory potential from the moment the first shot was fired; and generations born outside the shadow of nuclear Armageddon would suddenly be reintroduced to fears thought long dead and buried. Outnumbered, Outranged, and Outgunned: How Russia Defeats NATO, War On The Rocks\n\nWhat does this analysis show?\n\nIt shows that -- despite the delusional fulminations of armchair generals on cable TV braying about inflicting a \"strategic defeat\" on Russia -- it's not going to happen. Russia has the edge in virtually every area of firepower, manpower, combat-readiness and material. They also have the industrial capability that is unmatched in the West. Here's how Schryver summed it up:\n\nThere has been no meaningful increase in armaments production in the collective west, and there won't be anytime soon. Europe has been effectively demilitarized, and the US is severely depleted and effectively deindustrialized....\n\nOutside of the hopelessly propagandized populace of the so-called \"western democracies\", no one in the world believes Russia looks \"meek\" at this point in time. Instead, they realize the Russians have completely defeated the empire's plans and exposed its weakness....\n\nThe west has no advantage whatsoever. NATO is an empty shell.... I am utterly convinced a NATO expeditionary force in Ukraine would be massacred AT LEAST as comprehensively as the AFU has been, and quite likely MUCH WORSE, and MUCH MORE RAPIDLY.... Will Schryver, Twitter\n\nThere it is in black and white: The \"deindustrialized\" West is an empty shell that has no chance of prevailing in a combined-arms ground war with Russia. Even so, Washington is determined to proceed with its lunatic plan pushing the world closer to Armageddon while bringing ruin on the American people.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.

It is not clear which figures he was citing and he did not name a city but Rotterdam is a hydrocarbon gateway that 13 percent of all energy in Europe comes through.\n\n\"That shore is called a rather 'fat target' by the military,\" Gurulyov said. \"There is a catalog of existing targets right? Right. We know very well how to deliver critical damage and put it on its knees -- in fact it can be done in a day with the minimal use of our nuclear arsenal.\"\n\nThe anchor Vladimir Solovyov, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, sought clarification from Gurulyov on whether he meant a nuclear strike was needed. The lawmaker replied: \"For sure. I think we need to display our decisiveness -- what is there to be afraid of?\"\n\nNext to a clip of the discussion, the X account WarTranslated wrote: \"A member of the so-called Russian parliament, Andrey [Gurulyov], known for his freakish behavior, proposed striking the Netherlands with nuclear weapons in order to bring Europe to its knees.\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted the Dutch foreign ministry for comment.\n\nGurulyov has repeatedly framed Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine as a proxy war between Moscow and the West. In 2022 he warned of a \"colossal\" conflict with NATO and in December 2023 he said that Putin's war will go \"further\" than Ukraine.\n\nSince the start of Putin's invasion, Moscow has engaged in nuclear saber rattling. Although the U.S. has assessed that the threat of Russia using non-conventional weapons is low for the moment, this has not stopped Putin from sending mixed messages about his intentions.\n\nLast

Source: The international legion for the defense of Ukraine\n\nRussia warned that any French military instructors sent to Ukraine would be considered legitimate targets for Russian forces, following reports that France is considering deploying personnel to assist Ukrainian troops.\n\nFrance is expected to announce the deployment of military trainers to Ukraine, focusing on technical expertise and demining. This move aims to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities amid ongoing war with Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will discuss the details during his visit to France on 6 June.\n\n\"Whoever they are labelled as, whether they are members of the French armed forces or are just mercenaries, they represent an absolutely legitimate target for our armed forces,\" said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that the nationality of the instructors is irrelevant and that they would not be granted any special protection.\n\nThe tension between Russia and France was further heightened by posters that appeared on a bus stop outside the French embassy in Moscow. The posters, which featured a black-and-white photo of a soldier wearing a French tricolour armband, accused the French of repeating the mistakes of their ancestors by fighting alongside \"Nazis\" against Russia, France 24 reports.\n\nMoscow has consistently pushed the narrative that the Ukrainian government is \"neo-Nazi\" and that Russia's military campaign aims to liberate Ukraine from fascism, despite these claims being rejected by both Kyiv and Western nations, according to France 24.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's proposal to deploy Western troops to Ukraine caused a major disagreement with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who feared it could lead to World War III.\n\nHis proposal faced mixed reactions, with countries like Germany, Czech Republic, and Poland initially opposing it, while the Baltic states showing support.\n\nIn June, Ukraine launched a HIMARS strike on Belgorod, Russia, just hours after US President Joe Biden lifted restrictions on using American-supplied weapons on Russian soil. This decision came following severe Russian attacks on Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine, including a devastating bombing that killed 18 people.\n\nRead more:\n\nReuters: France could announce sending military

It is, tragically, not an exaggeration to say that Europe (and crucially, this time, the United States) again faces a fateful choice: between a negotiated settlement in Ukraine and the possibility of a third, and perhaps final, world war.\n\nIf recent statements by US and European officials are to be believed, there is a growing consensus in favor of war. On May 16, The New York Times reported that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, with regard to the possibility of NATO sending military trainers to Ukraine, \"We'll get there eventually.\" The same report also noted that a US official floated the \"possibility\" of NATO advisers \"training Ukrainian troops in Lviv.\"\n\nGiven the Biden administration's practice of telling us one thing and doing another -- as when it was discovered that the administration had secretly sent long-range ATACMS missiles to Ukraine -- there may already be US advisers on the ground. Indeed, in April 2022, a Pentagon official who requested anonymity told Asia Times that it is \"likely we have a limited footprint on the ground in Ukraine, but under Title 50, not Title 10\" -- meaning US intelligence operatives and paramilitaries, as opposed to reserves.\n\nMeanwhile, key officials -- including French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron, and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock -- are calling for the delivery of even-longer-range weapons. The New York Times also notes: \"Britain, Germany, and France are working to base defense contractors in Ukraine to help build and repair weapons systems closer to the combat zone.\" Russia has responded to these developments with a series of threats.\n\nRussia and the West have started down the perilous path of tit-for-tat belligerence. The Russian Defense Ministry issued a statement claiming that Russian forces would \"practice the issues of preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons...in response to provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation.\"\n\nThe question remains: Are these the signs of an approaching and tragic \"inflection point\" -- and if so, can it still be avoided?\n\nTo do so, the Biden administration should, at long last, adopt a cold-eyed realism in Ukraine and understand that while the plight of the Ukrainian people is heartrending, the more humane option is not to widen the war. Even Ukraine's original backers are coming to see a widening of the war for what it is: a danger to the future of Ukraine. Former Council on Foreign Relations president Richard Haass notes that Ukraine should \"propose an interim ceasefire along existing lines,\" explaining: \"Ukraine would be better off with a military and diplomatic strategy that protects the country's core, preserves its independence, and maintains external support.\"\n\nThe unpleasant truth is that Russia today has a larger, more capable army than it did at the beginning of the war. As NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe stated in testimony submitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee in April, Russia will soon \"command the largest military on the continent.\"\n\nEvery day, Ukraine inches further into the abyss. The United Nations International Organization for Migration reports that \"more than 14.6 million people -- a staggering 40 per cent of Ukraine's total population -- remain in need of some form of humanitarian assistance in 2024.\" It is no surprise, then, that polls conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology show that millions of Ukrainians reject the official line that the war can be ended only by military means.\n\nPresident Barack Obama recognized years ago that Russia possesses \"escalatory dominance\" -- the ability to continually up the stakes -- in Ukraine. \"The fact is that Ukraine...is going to be vulnerable to military domination by Russia no matter what we do,\" he said.\n\nPresident Obama was right. Picking a fight over NATO expansion in Russia's backyard was a tragic, costly mistake -- and for the sake of the Ukrainian people, the Biden administration needs to find an off-ramp, and soon.",

The politician had earlier opted to scrap presidential elections, under the pretext of martial law he had imposed due to the ongoing military conflict with Russia.\n\nHowever, the martial law says nothing about extending presidential powers, Putin told journalists on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF).\n\n\"It says that [Zelensky's] powers are transferred to the parliament, and that presidential elections are not held as long as the martial law is in force. But it does not say that presidential powers should be extended... If it does not say so, it means no,\" the Russian leader said.\n\nZelensky's move to extend his own presidential term indefinitely seems to be in breach of \"Article 109 of Ukraine's Criminal Code, which says that this should be treated as seizure of power,\" Putin argued.\n\nThe Russian President went on to suggest that Ukraine's Western backers were keeping Zelensky in power to push through and bear full blame for the upcoming \"unpopular decisions,\" such as possibly lowering the military draft eligibility age to 18.\n\n\"I think that the US administration will force the leadership of Ukraine to make these decisions - to lower the mobilization age to 18 years - and then will get rid of Zelensky... in order to do this, I feel, it will take a year, until the spring, until the beginning of next year at the very least,\" Putin noted.\n\nThe Ukrainian constitution forbids parliamentary election during a period of emergency and explicitly states that elected MPs should retain their powers until a new parliament can be chosen by the Ukrainian people. However, the constitution does not spell out any rules for canceling presidential elections and extending a president's term. Putin reasoned last week that since Ukraine's political system emphasizes the role of the parliament, the highest executive authority should now go to the speaker, as determined by law.\n\nThe Russian leader said that it was up to the Ukrainians to sort the issue out, while Ukraine's speaker, Ruslan Stefanchuk, declared that anyone who questions Zelensky's legitimacy is an \"enemy of Ukraine.\"\n\nWhen asked for clarification on Zelensky's status in the eyes of the Russian government, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated that he is now \"the ringleader of the Kiev regime, whose legitimacy is disputed in Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martial law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_International_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg International Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "October Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruslan_Stefanchuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruslan Stefanchuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Zakharova", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maria Zakharova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Russia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Associations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.06/article/6660f85385f5405e0c041bbc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624887", "eventUri": "eng-9624887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 471, "textEnd": 477}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Source: Foreign policy association YouTube\n\nAt Foreign Policy Association's annual W. Michael Reisman Distinguished Lecture on International Law and Diplomacy in New York City on 18 April, American historian Timothy Snyder slammed the US for its six-month delay in approving drastically needed military funding for Ukraine in Congress. Shortly after the lecture, Congress finally passed the $61 bn bill. The delay, however, left the Ukrainians outgunned 8:1, leading to the fall of the city of Avdiivka and enabling current Russian creeping gains.\n\nIn his lecture, titled The Peril of Slowness: American Mistakes during Russia's War of Aggression in Ukraine, Snyder argues that American foreign policy failed Ukraine because it tends to distance itself from reality and avoid thinking about ways to win the war against Russia, which threatens not only Ukraine but also the global order and freedom.\n\nSnyder identifies two factors that influence the perception of time and lead to shortcomings in policymaking:\n\nDespite this slowness in supporting Ukraine, Americans maintain the view that they are doing everything possible and that others should be grateful to them, Snyder claims. However, when measuring the percentage of GDP spent on supporting Ukraine, the US lags behind countries like Czechia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Malta, and numerous other European countries.\n\n\"And we're not even vaguely competitive with the Norwegians, Estonians, Lithuanians, Latvians, or Poles,\" Snyder says.\n\nEstonia and Denmark contributed the highest percentages of their GDP to support Ukraine between 24 January 2022 and 15 January 2024, donating 3.6% and 2.4%, respectively.\n\nIn terms of total amounts, the EU institutions, such as the European Commission and Council, pledged the most bilateral aid at nearly \u20ac85 ($92) billion as of 15 January 2024. The United States was the second-largest donor, committing \u20ac24 ($26) billion, according to the Statista research department.\n\nSnyder calls on American leaders to think in terms of \"conjunctures\" -- moments of great possibility where events can branch off in radically different directions based on the choices made.\n\nAt the outset of the war in February 2022, both the American foreign policy establishment and the Kremlin believed that Ukraine would swiftly fall within 72 hours. However, reality unfolded along a different timeline, one in which Ukraine mounted a stubborn resistance, Zelenskyy and his government remained in the country, and Russia failed to seize control of all Ukraine's resources.\n\nSnyder emphasizes that as Americans find themselves on this more favorable timeline, they begin to take it for granted, forgetting how easily things could have played out differently. He warns that American inaction is creating the conditions for a potential collapse of the Ukrainian front and further Russian advance if Ukrainian allies delay and slow down the military aid.\n\nThe delays in delivering aid have already allowed Russia to start a major offensive in Kharkiv Oblast in May and continue razing Ukrainian cities to the ground through daily shellings.\n\nTimothy Snyder goes on to explain how Ukraine's brave resistance benefited the West and why Americans \"owe to the Ukrainians\"\n\n1. Ukrainian army prevents a large-scale genocide of Ukrainians on the whole territory of Ukraine. Snyder has previously argued that Russia's war against Ukraine constitutes genocide, highlighting explicit threats and acts of violence against Ukrainians from Russian officials and media. He pointed to the statements from Russian officials advocating for the extermination of Ukrainians, deliberate attacks on civilians, and the systematic destruction of Ukrainian culture and identity.\n\nBountiful evidence also proves that people in the Russian-occupied territories already face torture, persecution, deportation, and murders for their pro-Ukrainian stance or any non-compliance with the newly imposed government.\n\nBy continuing to resist Russian aggression, the Ukrainian armed forces hold off a \"general destruction of Ukrainian society,\" according to Snyder.\n\n2. Ukraine defends the international legal order principle that countries are prohibited from using force or the threat of force against any other country's territorial integrity or political independence, as stated in the UN report. Russia broke this principle first in 2014 by annexing Crimea and helping separatists to establish the \"Donetsk People's Republic\" (\"DNR\") and\" Luhansk People's Republic\" (\"LNR\") in eastern Ukraine and then in 2022 by invading Ukraine full-scale.\n\nUkraine defends its borders, which were officially recognized in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\n3. Ukraine holds up the entire European Union model based on the principle that \"post-imperial countries can engage with one another in prosperity and peace without war,\" according to Snyder. Russia, however, started the war in Ukraine after the Ukrainian government leaned more towards integration into the European Union, which resonated with the demands of the Ukrainian population during the Euromaidan revolution in 2013-14.\n\nRussian aggression also raised concerns about the security of other EU countries by Snyder believing that in a hypothetical case of capturing Ukraine fully, Russia would threaten Poland and the Baltic states.\n\n4. Ukraine fulfills the mission of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) without even being a member of the alliance. NATO was initially created during the Cold War period for the US and its European allies to counter the threat of Soviet expansion. The center of Soviet rule was in Moscow, now modern Russia, which remains hostile towards \"the West,\" claiming that NATO is expanding to weaken Russia, which Russian President Vladimir Putin uses as one of the justifications for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. One more of NATO's missions is to protect democratic values, for which Ukraine is also fighting.\n\n5. Ukraine's successful resistance against Russia deters China, reducing the likelihood of a major conflict between China and the United States. For the past 25 years, the risk of such a conflict has been a central concern in American foreign policy discourse, according to Snyder. However, Ukraine's defense of its sovereignty against Russian aggression demonstrated to China that offensive military operations can be unpredictable and challenging, thereby deterring Chinese aggression. Snyder also suggests that Ukraine's resistance has significant implications for Taiwan, which faces the threat of a potential Chinese invasion.\n\n6. Ukraine fights against a state with nuclear weapons and proves that countries do not necessarily need to possess nuclear weapons to protect their sovereignty. Snyder argues that if Ukraine had surrendered or been defeated, this would have potentially encouraged other countries to seek nuclear weapons as a means of self-defense. Therefore, Ukraine's resistance played a crucial role in reducing the risk of nuclear war and proliferation.\n\nSnyder identifies three areas in the American system that led to this ineffective use of time during the war in Ukraine: social media, the executive branch, and the legislative branch of the US government.\n\nWhile acknowledging that Ukrainians have used social media effectively to their advantage by countering Russian propaganda and spreading the truth about Russian war crimes, Snyder points out that social media platforms generally struggle to maintain users' attention spans and focus on the long-term trends crucial for understanding war dynamics.\n\nSnyder singles out Twitter, now owned by Elon Musk, whom he characterizes as a \"pro-Putinist.\" He argues that Musk, through his control over Twitter's algorithms and his personal interventions, has steered the conversation in a direction favorable to Putin's interests.\n\nIn one of the tweets, Elon Musk suggested that Ukraine should negotiate peace by ceding Crimea and Donbas to Russia and remain neutral to end the war. Ukrainians criticized his tweet for ignoring the realities of Russia's aggression, Ukraine's sovereignty, and the historical context.\n\nSnyder also highlights one specific incident when Elon Musk blocked Starlink satellite internet access during Ukraine's first major attack on the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Crimea in September 2022.\n\nThis action disrupted Ukrainian maritime drone operations, leading to a mission failure. Despite attempts to persuade Musk to restore connectivity, he refused, citing concerns about escalating the war.\n\nWhile Timothy Snyder praises the Biden administration for predicting and warning about the impending Russian invasion in 2022, he argues that it failed to adequately plan for supporting Ukraine once the invasion began.\n\nHe blames the US executive branch for being too slow in recognizing Ukraine's potential to win the war and lacking a clear vision for how the war will end.\n\nHe contends that the US could have changed the course of the war in the spring and fall of 2022 by sending larger quantities of readily available, \"off-the-shelf\" weapons.\n\nInstead of providing Ukraine with war-winning quantities of weapons, the US supplied them in merely symbolic amounts, such as 10-20 HIMARS, instead of the potentially decisive 100-200.\n\nSnyder criticizes the administration and the press for treating Western weapons with \"religious reverence\" and overestimating the impact of small numbers of weapons while failing to follow up with larger, more consequential deliveries.\n\nTimothy Snyder criticizes the legislative branch of the US government by bringing up the topic of delayed military aid to Ukraine. This aid was stalled for over six months due to political disagreements within the US Congress. Key opposition came from far-right Republicans, some of whom Snyder characterized as a \"determined and ever-better organized Putinist fraction.\"\n\nThis delay was particularly detrimental as Ukraine at that time was facing ammunition shortages amidst ongoing Russian offensives, notably in Kharkiv Oblast, which borders Russia.\n\nHowever, at the time of posting this article, the US had already approved $61 billion in aid for Ukraine. The aid will provide Ukraine with essential military equipment, including long-range ATACMS missiles, artillery, and air defense systems, crucial for countering Russian advances, particularly in regions like Kharkiv Oblast, where Russian forces have recently intensified their attacks. Zelenskyy still characterized these decisions by Ukraine's partners, including the US, as \"late by about one year.\"\n\nSnyder claims that American slowness and indecisiveness can potentially lead to Ukraine losing this war, which not only might cause a large-scale genocide of Ukrainians but also create even greater security problems in the international order.\n\nIn case of a hypothetical loss of Ukraine, it would not disappear as a country but rather be exploited by Russia for its human and material resources, according to Snyder.\n\nUkraine's highly skilled and experienced soldiers could be forcibly conscripted into the Russian military, while the technologies developed by Ukraine would instead fall into the hands of Russia and China.\n\nRussia would gain control over Ukraine's agriculture, producing one of the world's largest harvestsn, as well as its rare earth resources, which are crucial for various industries and land use.\n\nHe also emphasizes that a hypothetical winning Russia would be different from the Russia that Americans are dealing with right now. It would be a much more empowered and aggressive state that knows it can break international rules and get away with it.\n\n\"A Russia which has won a war of aggression. A Russia which has proven that the rules don't matter. A Russia which has gained lots of resources. And a Russia which has proven, not only to itself but to most of the world, that there's no particular reason to take the American seriously,\" Snyder warned.\n\nA Ukrainian hypothetical defeat would also severely damage American reputation and credibility in the global arena, as this war is widely seen as an \"incredibly easy test\" for the US given the lack of direct American military involvement, the relatively low costs, and the alignment with America's ideological commitments to defend threatened democracies. Failing this test of helping Ukraine win would cast doubt on American abilities to deal with greater challenges in the future.\n\nHe suggests that the proper approach to time in the context of this war is to envision and actively shape a better future rather than passively allowing events to unfold. That is why defining what victory looks like and formulating a plan to achieve it are necessary steps for the American government.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy Ukraine's counteroffensive failed: WP analysis in 7 minutes\n\nHistorian Timothy Snyder met Ukrainian soldier who read his book in a trench: PHOTOS\n\nWe should be asking what feature of Russian politics is not fascist - Timothy Snyder\n\n\"We fight real Nazis of today\": Azov commander slams US weapons ban in plea for aid\n\nAP: US officials confirm Ukraine's June strikes inside Russia with American weapons\n\nUkraine launches website on Western components in Russian missiles and weapons", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euromaidan Press"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vira_kravchuk@euromaidanpress.com", "name": "Vira Kravchuk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_D._Snyder", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Timothy D.

Representatives of the anti-Kremlin opposition and civil society will also not be present.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is to host US President Joe Biden, British King Charles III and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the shores of Normandy, representing the three main countries involved in the landings on June 6, 1944.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and about 200 surviving war veterans are also expected to attend.\n\nDuring World War II the Soviet Union, in which Russia was the largest of 15 republics, was allied with Britain and the United States against Nazi Germany. The USSR bore the brunt of the battles until the Allies opened a second front on D-Day and suffered the greatest number of casualties in the war, with more than 20 million killed.\n\nWhile some Russian dissidents agreed that Moscow officials should not be present, they said Russians should not be excluded altogether from the hugely symbolic celebrations.\n\n\"It is not okay that representatives of Russia, which sacrificed millions in this war, will not be there,\" veteran rights campaigner Lev Ponomarev, a co-founder of the Nobel Peace Prize winning Memorial group, told AFP.\n\n\"I believe that the opposition could and should have been there,\" said 82-year-old Ponomarev, who lives in France after fleeing threats of arrest in Russia.\n\n\"We are representatives of the Russia that defeated Hitlerism if only because we have stood up to Putin's fascism\", he said.\n\n- Change of tack -\n\nOlga Prokopieva, head of the Paris-based association Russie-Libertes for anti-Putin exiles, struck a similar note, saying it was important for Russia to be represented at the D-Day ceremonies.\n\n\"The absence of Russia will be used by Russian propaganda, this will be shown as a humiliation of the Russian people.\"\n\nIn April, organisers said that Russian officials -- but not Putin -- would be invited to the ceremonies in Normandy, drawing protests from Ukrainians.\n\nThe Russie-Libertes association sent a letter to Macron's aides, suggesting that instead France extend an invitation to members of the embattled Russian opposition and civil society such as Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Alexei Navalny who has vowed to continue his cause, and Evgenia Kara-Murza, wife of Vladimir Kara-Murza, a campaigner jailed in Russia over his opposition to the war.\n\nLast week the French presidency said however that a Russian delegation will not be present at the ceremonies, \"considering the war of aggression that Russia is waging against Ukraine that has intensified over the past several weeks\".\n\nAfter France changed tack over Russia, Canada's Trudeau said he believed all countries involved in WWII must be recognised, despite \"our extreme disagreement\" with the Kremlin.\n\nParis said the USSR's \"decisive contribution\" during WWII will be mentioned during the ceremony at Omaha Beach and during events at cemeteries containing the remains of Soviet soldiers.\n\nMacron at the weekend also hosted Navalnaya for a meeting at the Elysee Palace.\n\nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there had been no discussion about Russian officials attending. \"We have no contacts of any type on this issue.\"\n\n- Ceasefire call -\n\nDmitry Muratov, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021 and met Macron in Paris in April, said he personally did not care who attends celebrations and parades.\n\n\"They're vastly overrated,\" he told AFP, adding the surviving World War II veterans were the most important guests.\n\nMuratov, who co-founded top Russian independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, said it was paramount to stop Moscow's war against Ukraine, urging the D-Day veterans to issue a call for a ceasefire \"in memory of those who died for peace in World War II.\"\n\n\"This would be very important for us all,\" he said.\n\n\"It is these people who can demand from Putin and from the world that the fighting be stopped.\"\n\nHistorically, Operation Overlord has been a source of tensions with the Kremlin, who has insisted that the Allies took too long to open a second front in Europe.\n\nPutin alluded to the controversy during the Victory Day celebrations on May 9, saying that \"for the first three long, difficult years of the Great Patriotic War\" the Soviet Union fought against Nazi Germany \"virtually one-on-one.\"\n\nPutin attended the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings in 2004, alongside Jacques Chirac. He was also present at the events commemorating the 70th anniversary in 2014, despite Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It also accurately framed a contest not only between two superpowers, but between two different, even mutually exclusive, worldviews.\n\nOne has to wonder what the answer would be -- or should be -- today as to how the war in Ukraine ends.\n\nI spent the better part of the last two weeks talking with political and business leaders all over Europe and the Middle East. Almost without exception, and without regard to nationality or political persuasion, whenever the question of Ukraine came up, the input I got was surprisingly consistent.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of opinions were not \"Ukraine wins, Russia loses.\" It was the far more nuanced offering that the war would end with Ukraine ceding some portion of territory to Russia permanently -- perhaps Donetsk, Donbas, and the southern coast along the Black Sea to Crimea. Occasionally, someone would suggest that Russia might in fact succeed in overrunning the entire country.\n\nBut not a single person suggested that Ukraine would be able to fully and permanently expel the Russians from Ukrainian territory. Indeed, I haven't heard anyone other than the most dedicated Ukrainian patriots and politicians seriously offer that the outcome can be as absolute as Reagan suggested.\n\nIf that is correct -- if the generally accepted most likely outcome in Ukraine is some sort of partition of the country, with a small risk of a complete Russian victory -- then why aren't we having real discussions now about ending the war?\n\nWhen Russia invaded more than two years ago, the West was faced with a delicate balancing act. Too little of a response would amount to appeasement, and too much would risk escalation. And both of those outcomes carry tremendous costs. But America and its allies have managed to walk that fine line with some success. Through a combination of military support (without direct intervention) and economic sanctions, the message has become clear to the Russians. There is a real cost to what they have done, and it is enormous.\n\nWhile there are valid debates to be had as to the specifics (have the sanctions been severe enough?), the Kremlin has already gotten the message loud and clear. Beijing has also certainly watched closely to calculate the price -- especially the economic price -- that comes with hostile military expansionism.\n\nThe argument can be made that, by acting as it has, the West has taken the issue of appeasement off the table, and not just in Europe.\n\nBut the risk of escalation is still very real. And that carries potential costs at least as severe as appeasement.\n\nFrance is now considering sending French troops -- under the pretense of being \"advisers\" -- to the front. And the U.S. recently explicitly endorsed the use of Western armaments on certain limited targets inside Russia. It doesn't take many anticipated moves down the chessboard to see how actions like those increase the risk of the war spilling over outside the current boundaries.\n\nAt the same time, it is hard to argue that those moves by France and the U.S. increase the likelihood of an outright Ukrainian victory. Although Western military hardware and logistical support can empower Ukraine, the country probably lacks the basic manpower to expel Russian forces. Put another way: The West can and should help Ukraine defend itself, but nothing short of a full boots-on-the-ground military intervention can drive the Russians out.\n\nThe recent moves by France, the U.S., and others seem more likely to reaffirm the outcome that seems to be so widely, if privately, expected -- that things are simply moving toward a stalemate.\n\nIf that is where so many people, in so many national capitals, from so many political persuasions, think the war in Ukraine is headed, then why are we prolonging things? Where are the calls for a ceasefire, or peace talks? Who is broaching the topic with Volodymyr Zelensky or Vladimir Putin?\n\nThe next skirmish outside of Kharkiv is not likely to lead to the expulsion of Russian troops. It is only more likely to cement the stalemate. And it carries with it the nonzero possibility of escalation and further human suffering.\n\nI have heard several experts suggest that, generally, peace talks do not begin until both sides believe they have a better outcome available at the table than they do in the field. That sounds like an accurate reading of history. I suppose the recent moves by France and the U.S. could be arguably intended to change the Russians' calculations about where their best deal lies. As it takes two to talk, however, one is left to wonder whether we are trying to convince the Ukrainians of the same.\n\nI don't like that Russian forces are in Ukraine, nor do I welcome the prospect of them staying there. But it may well be that that die was cast when the West yawned in response to the 2014 invasion of Crimea.\n\nToday, the choices in Ukraine seem to be between a peace involving territorial concessions to Russia, a complete Ukrainian collapse, a permanent state of war, or an escalation. Out of those, the first keeps looking like the least bad option.\n\nMick Mulvaney, a former congressman from South Carolina, is a contributor to NewsNation.

Would it be 'aggression' against a separatist Province of China, which America has been arming in order that Taiwan declare its independence? (As we shall see here, the U.S. Government itself has an official policy that \"The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China.\" That policy even has a name: \"the One-China policy\". So: America's official policy is that Taiwan is a Province of China.)\n\nThe TIME article pretends to include 'fact checks' of Biden's allegations, but the most important of those checks are based upon dubious sources, such as the following important statement from Biden, which expresses Biden's view that defeating Russia in Ukraine is a realistic primary objective of his Presidency:\n\nThe Russian military has been decimated. You don't write about that. It's been freaking decimated. [TIME'S FACT CHECK: \"The Facts: This is a fair assessment, according to a Reuters report [12 December 2023] on a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment provided to Congress\" [but never made public; so, what does 'declassified' even mean here, regarding a report which might not even exist, or else be from untrustworthy sources?]. The intelligence [What intelligence?] determined that Russia had 360,000 active military personnel when it invaded Ukraine in February of 2022. By December of last year, 315,000 Russian troops had been either killed or injured in the war -- a reduction in troop strength by 87%.\n\nThat speech by Putin wasn't aiming to explain the invasion of Ukraine that began three days later; he wasn't so stupid as to be referring to an invasion before it happened -- but Biden's statement published on 4 June 2024 pretends otherwise. Putin's actual speech to his nation explaining why he had decided to invade Ukraine occurred on 24 February 2022. It, too, was very long and winding, and wasted much time detailing history that wasn't directly relevant to the urgent national-security concerns which made this invasion necessary; and Putin said:\n\nIt is a fact that over the past 30 years we have been patiently trying to come to an agreement with the leading NATO countries regarding the principles of equal and indivisible security in Europe. In response to our proposals, we invariably faced either cynical deception and lies or attempts at pressure and blackmail, while the North Atlantic alliance continued to expand despite our protests and concerns. Its military machine is moving and, as I said, is approaching our very border. ...\n\nIn December 2021, we made yet another attempt to reach agreement with the United States and its allies on the principles of European security and NATO's non-expansion. Our efforts were in vain. The United States has not changed its position. It does not believe it necessary to agree with Russia on a matter that is critical for us. The United States is pursuing its own objectives, while neglecting our interests. ...\n\nWe can see that the forces that staged the coup in Ukraine in 2014 have seized power, are keeping it with the help of ornamental election procedures and have abandoned the path of a peaceful conflict settlement. For eight years, for eight endless years we have been doing everything possible to settle the situation by peaceful political means. Everything was in vain. ...\n\nI have already said that Russia accepted the new geopolitical reality after the dissolution of the USSR. We have been treating all new post-Soviet states with respect and will continue to act this way. We respect and will respect their sovereignty, as proven by the assistance we provided to Kazakhstan when it faced tragic events and a challenge in terms of its statehood and integrity. However, Russia cannot feel safe, develop, and exist while facing a permanent threat from the territory of today's Ukraine. ...\n\nThey did not leave us any other option for defending Russia and our people, other than the one we are forced to use today. In these circumstances, we have to take bold and immediate action. ...\n\nNowhere in the speech did Putin amplify upon the little in the speech which was directly relevant and which therefore ought to have been expanded upon, such as Putin's statement that \"Russia cannot feel safe, develop, and exist while facing a permanent threat from the territory of today's Ukraine.\" What's so special about Ukraine, for Russia? The answer is simple: it is the only country whose border reaches only about 300 miles away from The Kremlin, which the U.S. Government aims to obliterate by positioning a missile there, to blitz-decapitate Russia's central command. Putin never so much as explains that concern. And here's more:\n\nIts military machine is moving and, as I said, is approaching our very border. ...\n\nIn December 2021, we made yet another attempt to reach agreement with the United States and its allies on the principles of European security and NATO's non-expansion. Our efforts were in vain. The United States has not changed its position. It does not believe it necessary to agree with Russia on a matter that is critical for us. The United States is pursuing its own objectives, while neglecting our interests. ...\n\nWe can see that the forces that staged the coup in Ukraine in 2014 have seized power, are keeping it with the help of ornamental election procedures and have abandoned the path of a peaceful conflict settlement. For eight years, for eight endless years we have been doing everything possible to settle the situation by peaceful political means. Everything was in vain. ...\n\nOn 17 December 2021, Russia formally presented, both to the U.S. Government and to NATO, Russia's national-security demands and proposed peace treaty provisions that have since 1991 been violated by the U.S. and NATO; and included, in both documents, the core, which was that -- despite promises the U.S. Government and NATO had made to Gorbachev prior to his 1991 termination of both the Soviet Union and its communism, as well as his termination of the Soviet Union's 1955 Warsaw Pact military alliance mirror organization against America's 1949 NATO military alliance against the Soviet Union (all of which terminations Gorbachev did carry out in 1991), saying that if the Soviet Union and its communism would end, then NATO would not expand \"even one inch to the east\" toward Russia's border (those promises by the U.S. and NATO having been rampantly violated by both Amrica and NATO) -- and Russia's provisions in these two draft-documents on 17 December 2021 prohibited further such expansion of NATO, and explicitly prohibited Ukraine (whose border is far closer to The Kremlin than any other nation is) to become a member-nation of NATO. These demands from Russia were like America's JFK having demanded from the Soviet Union, in 1962, that Cuba not receive Soviet missiles -- but even more so than back then, because whereas Washington DC is only 1,131 miles from Cuba, Ukraine is only 317 miles from The Kremlin -- a mere 5-minute missile flight away from decapitating Russia's central command.\n\nBoth of Putin's documents were totally rejected on 7 January 2022, and this rejection by NATO and the U.S. -- and refusal to propose their own provisions, absolute refusal to negotiate with Russia over Russia's needs in order for Russia to be able to consider America and NATO to be anything other than deadly enemies of Russia -- unquestionably sparked Putin's decision to invade Ukraine; he was compelled by America and NATO to address Russia's national-security necessities now by force since America and NATO refused to participate in diplomatic resolution of these matters.\n\nThe key demand on 17 December 2021 in the NATO draft document, was: \"Article 6: All member States of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization commit themselves to refrain from any further enlargement of NATO, including the accession of Ukraine as well as other States.\" So: for Biden now to be saying that, instead, Putin's 21 February 2022 speech indicated that \"He [Putin] says this is part of reestablishing the Soviet Union,\" is as vicious and dangerous a lie as can possibly be imagined. And, so, also: TIME'S FACT CHECK: \"The Facts: This is a fair assessment, according to a Reuters report [12 December 2023] on a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment provided to Congress\" [but never made public],\" is deceit of the public on a very high order.\n\nTIME asked Biden, \"So what is the endgame though in Ukraine and what does peace look like there?\" He responded: \"Biden: Peace looks like making sure Russia never, never, never, never occupies Ukraine. That's what peace looks like. And it doesn't mean NATO, they are part of NATO.\" (TIME offered no 'fact check' on Biden's blatantly false allegation that Ukraine is part of NATO. Is there anyone nowadays who subscribes to TIME who isn't a blithering idiot?)\n\nI've spent more time with Xi Jinping than any leader in the world, over 90 hours alone with him since I've been Vice President. And we have a very candid relationship.\n\nYou know, I don't have any (unintelligible) He wanted to know why I was doing all these things. I said the simple reason I'm doing those things: to make sure that you don't, that you aren't able to change the status quo any.\n\nThe U.S. Government said, and signed with China's Government, in 1972, the Shanghai Communique, including \"The U.S. side declared: The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China.\" George W. Bush's Administration tried unsuccessfully in 2007 to outlaw internationally the phrase \"Taiwan is a part of China\"; and, so, the Shanghai Communique has remained the official U.S. Government policy to this day. (It hopes to get China to invade Taiwan in order for the U.S. to have a supposed pretext to then 'defend that independent nation' 'against China's aggression', by invading China.)\n\nHis plan is to arm Taiwan and entice it to announce its complete independence from China -- that Taiwan is no mere province of China but instead an independent country -- which announcement would then immediately force China either to invade China or else to accept Taiwan's becoming a separate and independent country.\n\nTaiwan's new leader has complied with that, even in his inaugural address. Will Biden go to war against China in the months leading up to the November 5th U.S. elections if China invades Taiwan in order to make clear to Taiwan's voters that they had been suckered by U.S.-imperial propaganda to choose as their 'President' someone who would declare that Taiwan is not only independent of China but ruling over China? How much international backing would the U.S. regime have if it did that?\n\nInvestigative historian Eric Zuesse's latest book, AMERICA'S EMPIRE OF EVIL: Hitler's Posthumous Victory, and Why the Social Sciences Need to Change, is about how America took over the world after World War II in order to enslave it to U.S.-and-allied billionaires. Their cartels extract the world's wealth by control of not only their 'news' media but the social 'sciences' -- duping the public.", "source": {"uri": "dehai.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dehai

We can't let Russia undo it in Ukraine | Opinion", "body": "Russia's looming new offensive in its war against Ukraine can feel far away from America's heartland. But in my conversations across the country, I am discovering that a free Ukraine matters to Americans.\n\nThese conversations, held so far in Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania, are central to our Whistlestop Tour to 10 states. I am joined by Ukraine's ambassador to the United States and Howard Buffett, whose foundation plays a significant role in helping Ukrainian farmers and communities. We speak with farmers, local governments, civic and faith-based organizations, businesses and Ukrainian-American communities about how the war directly impacts American security and prosperity.\n\nThese conversations echo another whistle-stop tour after the Second World War. In 1947 and 1948, General George Marshall Jr., President Harry S. Truman and other leaders traveled the country to talk about the importance of the Marshall Plan and the dangerous Cold War world America was entering.\n\nThis week, we observe the 80th anniversary of D-Day, a decisive moment in American leadership that partially liberated a continent from German aggression and occupation. After victory in Europe, America made another powerful choice to invest again in our shared security and prosperity by helping to rebuild Western Europe through the Marshall Plan and protect it through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. These decisions sent a powerful message of hope. Seventy-five years later, that investment has paid off: Europe is our largest trade and investment partner and strongest security partner.\n\nIt is vital that we again talk to Americans about our investment in Ukraine in support of its war against Russian aggression -- and what the return on that investment will mean for the United States, just as we did in the last century. I am often asked important questions: Can Ukraine win? What happens if it loses? And I always find America's great spirit of generosity and hear: What can we do to help? Many are already helping Ukraine through donation drives, volunteering skills such as training for surgeons or providing medical equipment, including prosthetics.\n\nBut I also encounter many Americans who repeat Russian propaganda. Their messages flood social media, and unfortunately are parroted by politicians. For example, given Russia's crackdown on Christian groups in occupied Ukraine, it's unbelievable how many believe the very opposite is true. These false statements led many in Congress to vote in April against the aid package for Ukraine despite their constituencies benefiting from the package through orders to local factories.\n\nIn our conversations, I found four things were important for why Ukraine must remain free.\n\nFirst, it protects America. Russian President Vladimir Putin is quite clear. He laments the breakup of the Soviet Union and sees his war in Ukraine as a proxy war against the U.S. and NATO. He's fighting with the help of China, Iran and North Korea, all of them hostile to America. If Ukraine loses, China will grow stronger.\n\nSecond, the American economy benefits by providing this assistance. Most of Congress' aid package for Ukraine will be spent in the United States on ammunition, missiles and weapons systems. This benefits American families and businesses. If Putin, with China's help, expands his war, the global and U.S. economy will be at great risk. The U.S. and Europe account for more than one third of all global trade.\n\nThird, freedom is on the line -- which so many among our great farming communities understand so clearly. If you ever see combine harvesters and trucks gathering in a field, it likely means a farmer is in need, and neighbors are helping the family with the harvest. Ukrainians are a community in need today -- and they will help us someday when we are in need, just as our NATO allies did when the U.S. was attacked on 9/11. When American farmers hear about Ukrainian farmers being driven off the land they love, seeing their harvests stolen and their land filled with mines, they know freedom is at stake.\n\nThe most powerful of all these reasons is that American assistance sends a clear message of hope. There will be a better tomorrow for Ukraine. Sustained support for the Ukrainian people will strengthen American security and prosperity, too. America has the alliances and resources that can help Ukraine win and rebuild -- a power greater than Russia's efforts to destroy. That's what we did more than seven decades ago.

The document described American objectives with respect to the Soviet Union.\n\nA significant part of the memorandum focused on Ukraine. American analysts were convinced that the territory was an integral part of greater Russia, and it was highly unlikely that Ukrainians could exist as an independent nation. Most importantly, it noted, any support given to separatists would be met with a strong negative reaction by Russians.\n\n\"The economy of the Ukraine is inextricably intertwined with that of Russia as a whole ... To attempt to carve it out of the Russian economy and to set it up as something separate would be as artificial and as destructive as an attempt to separate the Corn Belt, including the Great Lakes industrial area, from the economy of the United States...\n\nFinally, we cannot be indifferent to the feelings of the Great Russians themselves ... They will continue to be the strongest national element in that general area, under any status ... The Ukrainian territory is as much a part of their national heritage as the Middle West is of ours, and they are conscious of that fact. A solution which attempts to separate the Ukraine entirely from the rest of Russia is bound to incur their resentment and opposition, and can be maintained, in the last analysis, only by force,\" read the report.\n\nIt seems like today's American establishment and media have forgotten something that was obvious to US analysts and politicians at a time when America was the only superpower with nuclear weapons. It would appear that the White House and EU now believe they can make Russians think of Ukraine as a different country through force and sanctions threats.\n\nIf the West is successful in its attempts to \"deter\" Russia, it will get its reward - long-lasting resentment from Russians, who will view the US-led West as a force that prevents them from managing a big chunk of their historic land.\n\nThe first important factor is personal ties.\n\nMany Russian citizens were born in Ukraine, but they don't think of themselves as Ukrainians - especially not in the sense understood by the Kiev government today. Even more Russians have relatives in Ukraine. It would be almost impossible to find a Russian citizen without any family ties to Ukraine.\n\nRussians see it as the land of their forefathers - quite literally, as they can show you the graves of their ancestors and the land where their houses stood.\n\nWhen the administrative boundaries between the republics of the USSR turned into real borders in 1991, eight million ethnic Russians became 'Ukrainians' on paper. Kharkov in Ukraine and Belgorod in Russia, for example, are essentially twin cities that were founded by Russian tsars as frontier fortresses against the Crimean Tatars in the mid-17th century. After the Soviet Union's collapse, they ended up on the opposite sides of the border. Country houses belonging to residents of the Russian city were now in Ukraine and vice versa. People from Kharkov would now have to travel to a different country to get to their dacha.\n\nToday, Russians in Russia are puzzled - why does the regime in Kiev think it has the right to make decisions about their land?\n\nAs a result, many support the so-called separatists in what was the east of Ukraine. The term is a tricky one though, as a Russian may consider the regime in Kiev to be separatists, while activists in Crimea or in the Donbass have actually separated themselves from the separatists and, by that logic, could be considered unionists. Activism in Crimea, the movement in the Donbass, and the protests in Odessa that were brutally repressed, back in 2014, are part of unionism in the context of one greater Russia, not separatism.\n\nMany Russians not only lived but also worked in Ukraine, which was a key industrial area in Russia. Its industrial development can't be attributed to Ukrainian national character - it was the tsars and then the Soviet authorities that focused on this region's growth. The industrial density of eastern Ukraine could only compare to that of Germany's Ruhr.\n\nThere are a significant number of Russians who worked for Ukrainian plants and factories at one point or another - manufacturing aircraft carriers, helicopters, spacecraft components, etc. These were elements of the complex economic system of the huge Soviet superpower. Independent Ukraine didn't need any of that.\n\nThe political and economic elites of independent Ukraine treated the industrial 'dowry' they inherited not as a complex system in need of maintenance, but as wild walnut trees that they should harvest while the nuts still hung on the branches.\n\nThe Ukrainian leaders' attitude towards the powerful gas transportation system that had been left to them by the USSR was characteristic - they perceived it as a tool for blackmail. Unable to create or improve the system, they threatened to block or destroy it if they did not receive more money for the right to pump gas through 'their' territory.\n\nHence the hysterical reaction of the Ukrainian elites to the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, linking Russia directly to Germany. The fact that the Western powers have supported this view has led to the largest gas crisis in European history.\n\nRussians living in Russia, as well as those living in Ukraine, cannot understand why Ukrainian land should be used by NATO. In Russia, Ukraine's possible accession to the US-led military bloc is not construed as a free choice made by the country in its own security interests, but as a means for the West to build advance bases for launching a direct attack on Moscow.\n\nDo the Russians have historical grounds for considering this land their own, and for seeing the Kiev regime and NATO as the actual occupiers of this land? Definitely, in my view.\n\nKiev in modern Ukraine, Polatsk in contemporary Belarus, and Novgorod, Smolensk, and Rostov in today's Russia were one state in ancient times - Rus.\n\nThough Kiev, the 'Mother of Russian cities,' was the capital of this state, Novgorod, which is now part of Russia, played no lesser a role. Amazingly, anthropologists in northern Russia's Arkhangelsk Region have recorded epic ballads about Prince Vladimir and his warriors, who baptized Rus, which are similar in many ways to legends about King Arthur and the knights of the round table. It is therefore obvious that the local population retained a direct cultural connection with the population of ancient Kiev and Russia. At the same time, no similar ballads have been preserved in modern Ukraine.\n\nKiev was almost destroyed as the result of the Mongol invasion by Genghis Khan's grandson, Batu Khan, in 1240, and the fate of the inhabitants in different parts of Rus was divided after that. The eastern regions became vassals of the Mongols (Tatars) but continued to be ruled by direct male descendants of Prince Vladimir. The city of Moscow, with princes from this house, gradually gained hegemony and created a state that managed to gain independence.\n\nA different fate awaited the inhabitants of Western Russia. The cities there lost the power of Prince Vladimir's descendants, as well as their historical connection to ancient Kiev. They were conquered by Lithuania, which soon merged with Poland to form a single state - the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Since these lands were cut in half by the practically impassable Polesie Marshes, two different groups of Russian origin emerged there during the Middle Ages: Belarusians to the north of the marshes, and 'Little Russians' to the south.\n\nThe Muscovite princes, who became tsars in 1549, always proclaimed their right to these lands and demanded their return from Poland, leading a slow kind of 'Reconquista'. Poland lost the support of its Little Russian and Belarusian subjects in this struggle after it announced the religious Union of Brest in 1596 and began persecuting the Orthodox Church and its adherents. An Orthodox resistance movement emerged in the territories of Little Russia shortly thereafter.\n\nThe resistance's strike force was the Cossacks - a community of free warriors that assembled in the steppe for battles with the Tatars and Turks. A Cossack could be a native of any country who professed Orthodox Christianity and was ready to fight for it. As Poland progressively persecuted the Orthodox religion, the Cossacks increasingly raised their sabers against it. One of the episodes in this struggle was described in a historical novella entitled 'Taras Bulba' by Nikolai Gogol. Although he was born in Poltava, which is now in modern Ukraine, the great author always wrote in Russian and criticized acquaintances who tried to create a separate 'Ukrainian' language.\n\nIn 1648, the leader (hetman) of the Cossacks, Bogdan Khmelnitsky, sparked a great uprising against Poland in defense of oppressed Orthodoxy. After winning a number of victories, he triumphantly entered Kiev and was met by church leaders. He then created a state - the Zaporozhian Host - which in many ways resembled the rebellious republics of the Donbass now recognized by Russia.\n\nIn 1654, after the resolutions of a Zemsky Sobor (a kind of parliament representing feudal classes) in Moscow and a Rada (a kind of people's assembly) in Pereyaslavl near Kiev, Khmelnitsky's state became part of Russia.\n\nPalace created as a summer retreat for Tsar Nicholas II and served as the location for the Yalta Conference in 1945, Yalta, Crimea. \u00a9 DeAgostini / Getty Images\n\nTsar Aleksey Mikhaylovich was declared 'Tsar of All Great, Little, and White Russia' and began a grueling 13-year war with Poland, which ended with a partial victory - the lands on the left bank of the Dnieper were ceded to Russia, and the Russian Tsardom bought Kiev, the ancient capital of Rus on the right, for 146,000 silver rubles and seven tons of silver, which the richest Polish families divided among themselves.\n\nSubsequently, many Little Russians from the territory of modern Ukraine moved north and settled throughout the vast reaches of Russia, making careers both in the church and at court. The word 'Ukraine' was not used as a place name at all during this period - in both Russian and Polish it meant 'borderland' or 'frontier'. Its use as a name referring to the territories around Kiev only began in the 18th century, when these lands really did become a borderland during the constant wars between Russia and Turkey.\n\nThe integration of Little Russians into Russia was not even disrupted by the adventure of Hetman Mazepa, who betrayed Peter the Great out of personal interests and sided with the Russian leader's enemy King Charles XII of Sweden. Mazepa was abandoned by everyone except his personal guards, and a fierce guerrilla war began against the Swedish troops that entered the territory of modern Ukraine. The first attempt to exploit the concept of 'Ukrainian separatism' ended in disaster for the party that tried to employ it.\n\nBy the middle of the 18th century, the integration of Little Russians and Russia was extremely tight. Singer and musician Alexey Razumovsky, born near Chernigov, became the secret husband of Peter's daughter, Empress Elizabeth Petrovna. Moreover, the brother of this 'Night Emperor', Kirill, was simultaneously the hetman of the Zaporozhian Host and president of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Later, his numerous legitimate and illegitimate descendants formed an influential clan in the aristocracy of the Russian Empire.\n\nThe new empress, Catherine II, abolished the Zaporozhian Host and relocated the remnants of the Cossacks to the Kuban, in the North Caucasus. She also decisively conquered the steppes of southern Russia from the Tatars and Turks and, along with her secret husband, Prince Potemkin, founded a new part of Russia there - Novorossiya. The population of this area was extremely diverse. First of all, there were peasant and 'Great Russian' parts of the country, but there were also Greeks, Serbs, and a lot of Germans invited by the Empress, who were born in a small German principality. In fact, Novorossiya bore little resemblance to old Little Russia.\n\nNovorossiya was the Russian equivalent of the New World, except that it wasn't separated by an ocean. In the 19th century, industry was actively developed in the city now called Donetsk, commerce blossomed in Odessa, which was founded by a Spanish nobleman in the Russian civil service named De Ribas, and resort areas began to sprout up in Sevastopol and Crimea, bizarrely mixed with naval bases.\n\nDuring the three partitions of Poland, which Russia participated in along with Prussia and the Austrian Empire, Catherine II finally finished the work begun by Aleksey Mikhaylovich. Russia reunited almost all the lands belonging to ancient Rus, along with their peasant populations, which had preserved the Russian language and maintained Orthodox Christian traditions.\n\nThe inhabitants of these territories began to return to their Russian identity. The fate of the family of the great Russian writer Dostoevsky can be taken as an example. The writer's grandfather was a 'Uniate' priest at a Catholic Church near Vinnytsia, which is located in modern Ukraine, but returned to Orthodoxy after Russia annexed the territory. The writer's father went to Moscow and made a brilliant career as a military surgeon. And Dostoevsky himself became a great writer who once penned: \"The master of the Russian land is solely Russian (Great Russian, Little Russian, Belarusian - it's all the same).\"\n\nIn the partition of Poland, Russia did not go beyond the borders of ancient Rus and even ceded the Old Russian city of Lvov to Austria. However, all the members of the privileged classes on these lands considered themselves Poles, and the land to be Polish, so they waged a stubborn struggle against the Russian government, both openly and clandestinely. As part of this battle, they began to spread the idea that the peasant population of western Russia was not Russian, but 'Ukrainian', a separate people that was closer to the Poles. Therefore, Russia had no right to these territories, the propaganda claimed.\n\nSome young Russian intellectuals embraced this idea during the 'Springtime of the Peoples', a series of revolutions that shook Europe in the mid-19th century, when original nationalities were discovered, and even sometimes invented. Ukrainophiles like the acclaimed genius of Ukrainian literature, Taras Shevchenko, collected Little Russian songs and wrote poems in a similar style.\n\nUkrainophile propaganda was met with hostility by both Russia's imperial government and Russian society, which hadn't felt any difference at all between the lands of Little Russia and the rest of Russia for a long time. The life of Little Russians did not seem to be anything extraordinary in light of the much more colorful lives of the Don, Kuban, and Terek Cossacks. And most importantly, the majority of those pushing this propaganda ended up disappointed in it themselves - when they realized that this idea primarily served the interests of the Poles, the enthusiasm for Ukrainophilism cooled considerably.\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian idea survived thanks to Austria, which provided an academy dedicated to Ukrainian studies in the city of Lvov, as well as a generous subsidy to Ukrainophile historian Mikhail Grushevsky. Torn apart by ethnic conflicts, the Austrian Empire had two primary objectives. Firstly, to prove that those living in Galicia and its capital, Lvov, which belonged to it at the time, were not Russian, but Ukrainians, who were an entirely different people, because this would mean that Russia had no right to claim this land. Secondly, to prove to the Poles living in Lvov that they had no right to this city either. Grushevsky began to construct a Ukrainian historical myth revolving around Galicia. He also published a Ukrainian language newspaper, inventing several new 'Ukrainian' words for each issue.\n\nThe moment of truth came during the First World War, when Austria committed real acts of genocide against those in Galicia who displayed a political or cultural orientation towards Russia. More than 30,000 Galician 'Muscovites' and representatives of small ethnic groups who spoke their own Russian dialects - Rusyns and Lemkos - were thrown into the Thalerhof and Terezin concentration camps, the predecessors of Auschwitz. Thousands of people there were tortured by Austrian guards and died of hunger or disease.\n\nThe inhabitants of southern Russia captured by the Austrians during the war were placed in special camps where Grushevsky's followers tried to inspire them with the belief that they were Ukrainians. This attempt ultimately failed, however. In a letter to his friend Inessa Armand, Vladimir Lenin, who himself maintained close contacts with Austrian and German special services, described an escaped prisoner's account of this \"experiment,\" in which 27,000 people forcibly participated, as follows: \"Ukrainians were sent clever lecturers from Galicia. Results? Only 2,000 were for 'independence' ... after a month's efforts by the propagandists!! Others flew into a rage at the thought of separating from Russia and going over to the Germans or Austrians. A significant fact! It's undeniable that ... the conditions for Galician propaganda are most opportune. And yet the proximity to the Great Russians prevailed!\"\n\nNevertheless, after seizing power in Russia, Lenin recognized the self-proclaimed Ukrainian People's Republic headed by Grushevsky in Kiev. Then, during the civil war against the White defenders of 'a united and indivisible Russia', he demanded that his comrades in arms emphasize - or at least pretend - that an \"independent communist Ukraine\" existed.\n\nProtesters hammer at the toppled statue of Lenin on Kiev's Bessarabska Square. \u00a9 Sputnik / Andrey Stenin\n\nPerfectly aware of how unacceptable Ukrainian propaganda was to the masses, Lenin, nevertheless, insisted on creating a 'Ukraine' in order to weaken \"the Great Russian oppressor,\" as he called the Russian Empire's leading ethnic group. It was to protect Ukraine from ultimately dissolving into Russia that Lenin rejected Stalin's plan to turn peripheral areas into autonomous regions within Soviet Russia. Instead, he insisted on creating a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which is described in its statutory documents as a rather loose confederation with a right to exit. Current Ukraine dates back to the 'Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic' (Ukrainian SSR) that was created within the framework of this Leninist project.\n\nThe problem was, there were practically no Ukrainians in Soviet Ukraine, so the Soviet government took an unheard-of step - it invited its ideological enemy, Grushevsky, the former president of the Ukrainian People's Republic, to the Ukrainian SSR and entrusted him with carrying out the 'Ukrainization' of public education. For a decade and a half, schoolchildren there could only receive a school education in Ukrainian, using Grushevsky's textbooks.\n\nThe campaign in government ministries and departments was no less tough. Officials, including those with no ideological bent - who dealt with agriculture, for example - were required to study the Ukrainian language and use it at work. Moreover, they were dismissed from the service for displaying an ignorance of the language or an unwillingness to learn it. Interestingly, the number of those sacked was quite large, which demonstrates that many people were still resisting Ukrainization at the time.\n\nBut, of course, not everyone resisted. There were many 'chameleon' officials in the Communist Party. For example, the future leader of the USSR, Leonid Brezhnev, who led the nation during the Cold War, listed his ethnic origin as 'Ukrainian' in some forms, and 'Russian' in others. This goes to show that, in fact, there was no clear way to distinguish a 'real Ukrainian' from a 'real Russian'.\n\nConvinced that Ukrainization made it impossible for schools to produce literate people who were well-versed in technology (most of the USSR's literature on science and technology always remained in Russian), Stalin began to limit the process. Subsequently, learning Russian became mandatory, and enthusiastic advocates of Ukrainism began to be persecuted as 'bourgeois nationalists'.\n\nHowever, even after this about face, the official Soviet regime diligently pretended that Ukraine was a 'fraternal' state, independent and separate from Russia. Ukraine was granted its own seat in the UN, separate from the USSR's (the Russian Federation was not). The mosaics created in the Moscow Metro's Kievskaya station presented a kind of iconography of the 'history of Ukraine'.\n\nHowever, Soviet Ukraine faced a new problem. In 1939, Stalin annexed the regions of Western Ukraine that had been captured by Poland after the collapse of the Russian Empire and assigned them to the Ukrainian SSR. And with them came Lvov and Galicia, which had never been part of Russia. As a result of Poland's strict national policy, a radical political movement emerged in this area led by Stepan Bandera dubbed the 'Ukrainian Insurgent Army'. This group's political structure greatly resembled that of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, only under a nationalist rather than communist banner. The Poles were the first object of Bandera's hatred - in 1942, with support from Hitler, his group organized the terrifying Volhynia Massacre of the Polish population.\n\nAs German collaborators, Bandera and his comrades in arms committed many crimes against Jews, Poles, and Russians during the Second World War. While the Red Army advanced against the Germans, Bandera's people increasingly turned their weapons against it and shifted the hatred they harbored against the Poles and Jews to Russians and Communists. The Banderists waged a fierce guerrilla-terrorist war in the western part of the Ukrainian SSR for many years after the Second World War ended. When the partisans were finally defeated, they went underground, but passed their radical ideology on to the younger generation of Ukrainian nationalists.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union weakened and collapsed in 1991, three factors came together in Ukraine. Firstly, the official communist government in Kiev was given the opportunity to take advantage of the constitutional opportunities left by Lenin to create its own state. Secondly, amidst the complete ideological vacuum in this post-communist Ukraine, it was the heirs of Bandera, with their rabid racism directed at Russians, who took up the new country's ideological banner.\n\nAt the same time, the majority of Ukraine's population fell victim to this process, both those officially listed as 'Ukrainians' and 'Russians'. Most had seen the USSR as a Greater Russia, and the Ukrainian SSR where they lived as one of the corners within it. They did not know and did not want to learn any language other than Russian. If their grandmothers had taught them to speak the rural Ukrainian dialect in childhood, they saw it as a way of making a joke. And suddenly, through schools, propaganda, and political speeches, these people were hit by powerful pressure to become 'Ukrainian' from what had recently been a totalitarian communist state.\n\nThe Russian Federation had been experiencing a long crisis with respect to national identity and \u0441consciousness, and it was Ukraine that pulled it out of this muddle. As predicted in 1948 by US National Security Council analysts, the Russians became enraged on learning that propaganda was being used to make some Russians see themselves as 'non-Russian'.\n\nThe first wound to Russian pride was inflicted back in Soviet times, when Malenkov and Khrushchev transferred Crimea from the RSFSR (Russia) to the Ukrainian SSR (Ukraine) in 1954. Russians considered this peninsula to be their own land, steeped in the blood of two heroic defenses of Sevastopol (1854-55 and 1941-42). Though the outward manifestation of this transfer was limited to changing the color of Crimea on maps from pink to green, it was perceived as an ethnic insult by Russians in the USSR. Sevastopol was the 'city of Russian sailors' (as was sung in a famous song) and no one dared argue with this. Russian indignation reached a boiling point after the peninsula became part of an independent Ukraine in 1991, and the government began to ban the Russian language there. The phrase \"You will still answer for Sevastopol\" from the popular movie 'Brat 2' became a nationwide meme.\n\nSeveral waves of forced Ukrainization in the 20th century have convinced Russians that Ukrainian identity is not something stemming from ancient history and culture, but something that is instilled by propaganda. Like it or not, Russians in Russia see modern Ukraine's hostility towards the Russian part of its population not as a free choice of ethnic identity, but as a disease that has arisen under the influence of propaganda that must be cured. The more assertively some Ukrainians declare that they are not brothers to Russians, but enemies, that they want to be with NATO, and not Russia, the greater the desire on the other side is to save and cure them, whatever that means.\n\nThe trick of the West - to appeal to the population of modern Ukraine's sense of unique identity - is even more dangerous in terms of provoking conflict. The reaction of Russians to these appeals is similar to that of the parents of a kidnapped child who has been turned against them. It's better not to get in their way.\n\nTo sum up: Russians have many vital and historical reasons to consider Ukraine their land, and to see Ukrainians, even those most hostile to Russia, as their own people, who are in need of protection (including from brainwashing). The West's claims that it has a right to exercise hegemony over Ukraine because 'Ukraine is not Russia' is seen by Russians in Russia as false and predatory.\n\nLenin Square and the monument to Taras Shevchenko in the town of Kramatorsk, Donetsk Region. \u00a9 Sputnik\n\nMoreover, they consider this attitude a land grab directed at territory Russians consider their own. One of the decisive factors in Russians' ethnic awakening during the Putin era has been the resistance to this attempt to tear Ukraine away. The president himself was not the initiator of this process but reflects the national mood.\n\nThere is no way to get Russians to accept that Ukraine is somehow separate, except by brutal force. Russians will always see any world order that involves the separation of Ukraine from Russia as hostile. By supporting an 'independent Ukraine', the West will always have a tireless and relentless enemy in Russia and the Russians.\n\nThe question is why does it need this, and who benefits?\n\nBy Egor Kholmogorov, a Russian historian and journalist\n\n___\n\nThe Most Important History of the Ukraine Never Seen in the West\n\nAt this late date, it's crucial to apprehend these critical details of this untold Ukraine back story. If you are an American reader, it's absolutely vital to understand that the deliberate balkanization of Ukraine will soon be coming to the 50 states, for The Same Barbarians Are Inside The Gate ... unless righteous Patriots rise up everywhere to terminate the Khazarian vice grip on the U.S. Federal Government and Corporate America. (See Addendum below)\n\nFor any American who doubts that The Khazarian Barbarians Have Been Inside The Gate For Well Over A Century, all they have to do is consider who they cannot criticize or joke about -- EVER! On the other hand, as the irrefutable expos\u00e9 at the preceding hyperlink well delineates, the Khazarians have been making fun of US as long as they have been domiciled in the USA, and on our dime.\n\nLastly, if there's one brief paper that does a deep dive into essential Khazarian history, as it has severely impacted the fate of Russia, the fate of the United States and the fate of Ukraine, it is this quite revelatory essay: HIDDEN HISTORY: Rothschild & Schiff Banksters, Zionist Ukrainian Oligarchy & Satanic Khazarian Mafia\n\nRevisionist Historians for World Peace\n\nState of the Nation\n\nBoth the U.S. Federal Government and Corporate America are covertly controlled by a worldwide Khazarian-run network of secret societies, globalist organizations and financial entities which effectively rule planet Earth.

Why would he travel another 2,391 kilometers for an hour's meeting with President Marcos in the Philippines, which can't afford to give him a dollar to help him fight the mighty Russia? Zelenskyy, in fact, wouldn't have time to rush back home if the Russians made a sudden push for Kyiv.\n\nTo justify his trip Zelenskyy asked Marcos to provide Ukraine with mental health workers. \"You mentioned humanitarian possibilities, especially for medicine and, like I said to you, especially psychological mental health,\" the Ukrainian leader told Marcos. Does this guy think we have so many mad men here that we would have so many health workers?\n\nThe only rational explanation for the Zelenskyy to travel so far is that their puppeteer the US is a demanding taskmaster, and its propagandists thought it would be great optics for the leaders of two countries being \"bullied\" by the two superpowers to meet to express their solidarity with each other, the world's two Davids fighting the evil Goliaths of our era. That's it.\n\nRussia\n\nRussia, of course, will resent the Zelenskyy-Marcos meeting as this makes the Philippines, other than Singapore, which hosted that \"Shangri-La Forum,\" the only Asian country to host the Ukrainian president.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nDo we really have to make another superpower an enemy, which has been undertaking substantial trade ($639 million) with us, providing iron and finished petroleum products? And to think that just two years back Marcos said: \"We may have to deal with Russia for fuel, for fertilizer.\"\n\nI hope, though, that Marcos didn't ask Zelenskyy for tips on how to successfully impose martial law with most of the world not noticing it. Zelenskyy's term would be ending on May 24, 2024, and elections would be called. He must have thanked Putin for invading his country on 20 March 2022, as he said martial law was necessary to meet the Russian threat. The Ukrainian parliament has extended martial law for another 90 days and automatically renews from that point on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZelenskyy also signed a decree that merged all national television channels into one platform due to martial law and ordered suspending the activities of eleven opposition political parties, citing claimed ties to the Russian government. That's the kind of puppet the leader of the free world does.\n\nThe US false narrative driven by America's powerful media apparatus, of course, dominates most views on the Ukraine war, just as it does on our dispute with China.\n\nThinking people don't buy these, though, as renowned public policy analyst Jeffrey Sachs, Columbia University professor, doesn't. Follows is from a 2023 column published in a number of newspapers titled \"The War in Ukraine Was Provoked -- and Why That Matters to Achieve Peace.\" Read and understand what's really the Ukraine war is about.\n\nSachs' column:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Biden administration has repeatedly and falsely claimed that the Ukraine War started with an unprovoked attack by Russia on Ukraine on February 24, 2022. In fact, the war was provoked by the US in ways that leading US diplomats anticipated for decades in the lead-up to the war, meaning that the war could have been avoided and should now be stopped through negotiations.\n\nRecognizing that the war was provoked helps us to understand how to stop it. It doesn't justify Russia's invasion. A far better approach for Russia might have been to step up diplomacy with Europe and with the non-Western world to explain and oppose US militarism and unilateralism. In fact, the relentless US push to expand NATO is widely opposed throughout the world, so Russian diplomacy rather than war would likely have been effective.\n\nThe Biden team uses the word 'unprovoked' incessantly, most recently in Biden's major speech on the first-year anniversary of the war, in a recent NATO statement, and in the most recent G7 statement. Mainstream media friendly to Biden simply parrot the White House. The New York Times is the lead culprit, describing the invasion as 'unprovoked' no fewer than 26 times, in five editorials, 14 opinion columns by NYT writers, and seven guest op-eds!\n\nThere were, in fact, two main US provocations. The first was the US intention to expand NATO to Ukraine and Georgia in order to surround Russia in the Black Sea region by NATO countries (Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Georgia, in counterclockwise order). The second was the US' role in installing a Russophobic regime in Ukraine by the violent overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian President, Viktor Yanukovych, in February 2014. The shooting war in Ukraine began with Yanukovych's overthrow nine years ago, not in February 2022 as the US government, NATO, and the G7 leaders would have us believe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKey to peace\n\nThe key to peace in Ukraine is through negotiations based on Ukraine's neutrality and NATO non-enlargement.\n\nBiden and his foreign policy team refuse to discuss these roots of the war. To recognize them would undermine the administration in three ways. First, it would expose the fact that the war could have been avoided, or stopped early, sparing Ukraine its current devastation and the US more than $100 billion in outlays to date. Second, it would expose President Biden's personal role in the war as a participant in the overthrow of Yanukovych, and before that as a staunch backer of the military-industrial complex and very early advocate of NATO enlargement. Third, it would push Biden to the negotiating table, undermining the administration's continued push for NATO expansion.\n\nThe archives show irrefutably that the US and German governments repeatedly promised to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not move 'one inch eastward' when the Soviet Union disbanded the Warsaw Pact military alliance. Nonetheless, US planning for NATO expansion began early in the 1990s, well before Vladimir Putin was Russia's president. In 1997, national security expert Zbigniew Brzezinski spelled out the NATO expansion timeline with remarkable precision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNATO\n\nUS diplomats and Ukraine's own leaders knew well that NATO enlargement could lead to war. The great US scholar-statesman George Kennan called NATO enlargement a 'fateful error,' writing in the New York Times that, 'Such a decision may be expected to inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, and to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking.'\n\nPresident Bill Clinton's Secretary of Defense William Perry considered resigning in protest against NATO enlargement. In reminiscing about this crucial moment in the mid-1990s, Perry said the following in 2016: 'Our first action that really set us off in a bad direction was when NATO started to expand, bringing in eastern European nations, some of them bordering Russia. At that time, we were working closely with Russia, and they were beginning to get used to the idea that NATO could be a friend rather than an enemy... but they were very uncomfortable about having NATO right up on their border and they made a strong appeal for us not to go ahead with that.'\n\nIn 2008, then US Ambassador to Russia and now CIA Director, William Burns, sent a cable to Washington warning at length of grave risks of NATO enlargement: 'Ukraine and Georgia's NATO aspirations not only touch a raw nerve in Russia, they engender serious concerns about the consequences for stability in the region. Not only does Russia perceive encirclement, and efforts to undermine Russia's influence in the region, but it also fears unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences which would seriously affect Russian security interests. Experts tell us that Russia is particularly worried that the strong divisions in Ukraine over NATO membership, with much of the ethnic-Russian community against membership, could lead to a major split involving violence or, at worst, civil war. In that eventuality, Russia would have to decide whether to intervene, a decision Russia does not want to have to face.'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBig war\n\nUkraine's leaders knew clearly that pressing for NATO enlargement to Ukraine would mean war. Former Zelenskyy advisor Oleksiy Arestovych declared in a 2019 interview 'that our price for joining NATO is a big war with Russia.'\n\nDuring 2010-2013, Yanukovych pushed neutrality, in line with Ukrainian public opinion. The US worked covertly to overthrow Yanukovych, as captured vividly in the tape of then US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt planning the post-Yanukovych government weeks before the violent overthrow of Yanukovych. Nuland makes clear on the call that she was coordinating closely with then Vice President Biden and his national security advisor Jake Sullivan, the same Biden-Nuland-Sullivan team now at the center of US policy vis-\u00e0-vis Ukraine.\n\nAfter Yanukovych's overthrow, the war broke out in the Donbas, while Russia claimed Crimea. The new Ukrainian government appealed for NATO membership, and the US armed and helped restructure the Ukrainian army to make it interoperable with NATO. In 2021, NATO and the Biden administration strongly recommitted to Ukraine's future in NATO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the immediate lead-up to Russia's invasion, NATO enlargement was center stage. Putin's draft US-Russia Treaty (December 17, 2021) called for a halt to NATO enlargement. Russia's leaders put NATO enlargement as the cause of war in Russia's National Security Council meeting on February 21, 2022. In his address to the nation that day, Putin declared NATO enlargement to be a central reason for the invasion.'\n\nProgress\n\nHistorian Geoffrey Roberts recently wrote: 'Could war have been prevented by a Russian-Western deal that halted NATO expansion and neutralized Ukraine in return for solid guarantees of Ukrainian independence and sovereignty? Quite possibly.' In March 2022, Russia and Ukraine reported progress towards a quick negotiated end to the war based on Ukraine's neutrality. According to Naftali Bennett, former prime minister of Israel, who was a mediator, an agreement was close to being reached before the US, the UK, and France blocked it.\n\nWhile the Biden administration declares Russia's invasion to be unprovoked, Russia pursued diplomatic options in 2021 to avoid war, while Biden rejected diplomacy, insisting that Russia had no say whatsoever on the question of NATO enlargement. And Russia pushed diplomacy in March 2022, while the Biden team again blocked a diplomatic end to the war.\n\nBy recognizing that the question of NATO enlargement is at the center of this war, we understand why US weaponry will not end this war. Russia will escalate as necessary to prevent NATO enlargement to Ukraine. The key to peace in Ukraine is through negotiations based on Ukraine's neutrality and NATO non-enlargement. The Biden administration's insistence on NATO enlargement to Ukraine has made Ukraine a victim of misconceived and unachievable US military aspirations.

Jeff Colyer witnessed were unlike anything he's seen in other warzones.\n\nColyer, a 63-year-old Johnson County physician, spent a month in Ukraine earlier this spring, working with the International Medical Corps to help advise doctors. Colyer has traveled to other conflict zones with the non-profit aid group in the past, including Soviet-controlled Afghanistan, Iraq, and Sudan.\n\nUkraine is different. More than two years into Russia's invasion, millions of artillery rounds have been exchanged as the nations fight along a frontline that spans hundreds of miles. Add to that the drones, sometimes small quadcopters essentially outfitted with a grenade, that drop destruction from above with little warning.\n\nThat produces different injuries than a conflict characterized chiefly by gunfire or improvised explosive devices.\n\n\"They're certainly much more complex, much more lethal,\" Colyer, describing the injuries in Ukraine, said in a recent interview with The Star.\n\nColyer, a Republican, served as governor for a little less than a year. He took office in January 2018 after Gov. Sam Brownback resigned to become the U.S. ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom. Colyer lost an extremely close GOP primary in 2018 and ran for governor again in 2021 but dropped out after a prostate cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe former governor, with some exceptions, has stayed mostly out of public view since then. He endorsed former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election last November after visiting Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nBut Colyer is reemerging now to warn Americans about the nature of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe injuries inflicted are challenging to surgeons, though he praised the ingenuity of Ukrainian doctors. However, the number of injuries is astounding.\n\nThe U.S. health care system isn't prepared to respond to the large numbers of severely wounded civilians and soldiers - injured by artillery and drones - that could result from a war with Russia, China, or North Korea, Colyer wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Friday. American and European officials have long feared the war could spread if Russia eventually captures Ukraine.\n\nColyer told The Star that one hospital he visited, which he likened to Research Medical Center, had just treated its 28,000th war wound. For perspective, nearly 21,000 American service members were injured in action during the entirety of the war in Afghanistan.\n\n\"You multiply that into other places ... and everywhere is just super crowded,\" Colyer said.\n\nThe United States has committed $175 billion in aid for Ukraine since the war began in February 2022. Many Republicans at the start of the war vowed to help Ukraine, but support for continued U.S. aid has waned, including among some members of Congress from Kansas.\n\nOver some GOP opposition, Congress approved $61 billion more for Ukraine in April as part of a $95 billion package that also included aid to Israel and Taiwan. Ukraine aid has long split the Kansas congressional delegation.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" Sen. Roger Marshall, a Republican who originally voted for U.S. military aid to Ukraine, before reversing course as the war stretched on, said last month. \"For me, it will always be America first - our safety, health, and security above all else.\"\n\nRepublicans opposed to aid are often from the more populist wing of their party -- a faction cultivated by Trump. Meanwhile, the lawmakers who remain from the pre-Trump Republican establishment have remained steadfast in their support for helping Ukraine push back the Russian invasion.\n\nSen. Jerry Moran, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, is among those strongly advocating for additional support, saying the money sent to Ukraine benefits the United States.\n\n\"There is no path forward for Ukraine, there is no path forward for Israel or for Taiwan if the United States of America disengages in the world,\" Moran said on the Senate floor last month. \"The price tag is significant, but in the absence of taking a stand now, we have to take a stand tomorrow. Do what we need to do today or pay a price later, and later will be even more costly.\"\n\nIn the House, Reps. Sharice Davids, a Democrat, and Jake LaTurner, a Republican, supported an April bill that provided additional funding for Ukraine. Republican Reps. Tracey Mann and Ron Estes voted against it.\n\nThe measure passed after House Speaker Mike Johnson called a vote despite resistance from some Republicans; he later survived an attempt to remove him from the speakership with help from Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\"They were very thankful to the U.S.,\" Colyer said, adding that he was in Ukraine during the aid vote in Congress. Still, Ukrainians \"really felt like they were fighting with one hand tied behind their back.\"\n\nFor much of the war, President Joe Biden has prohibited Ukraine from using American weapons to attack inside Russia, with his administration casting the policy as necessary to prevent a dangerous escalation of the conflict. Biden in the past couple weeks has softened that stance, however, and has begun allowing Ukraine to use American weapons to attack inside Russia to help repel advances by Russia toward Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city.\n\nColyer declined to comment for this story about whether he believes opposition to further American aid is a mistake. But when asked about how the war is perceived in the United States compared to what he saw in Ukraine, he said Americans certainly want to help Ukraine \"on the humanitarian side\" and said there's broad support for helping people.\n\n\"We don't see this war on our newsfeeds, it's not on TV, which is something that is a big deal. And I think that's a mistake,\" Colyer said.\n\nColyer painted a portrait of a Ukraine rocked by war but resilient. The doctors and other health care professionals in the country are well trained and can go head to head with American physicians, he said. The problem - in addition to the war taking out some medical facilities - is a lack of good equipment.\n\nMedical instruments are often old and worn out. Sometimes, it's as simple as dull scissors.\n\n\"These are first-world doctors and technologies - our understanding - using third-world equipment,\" Colyer said.\n\nColyer described his role in Ukraine as working with the International Medical Corps to help identify \"gaps\" in service. He mentioned the medical instruments as one example.\n\nIMC, founded in 1984, helps provide medical assistance in areas wracked by war and disaster but also offers training. In 2022 the organization received about 56% of its revenue from contracts and grants, with about 40% coming from contributions. Colyer stressed the importance of contributions, saying donations allow the organization to start up operations across the globe, including looking at what work to do next in Ukraine.\n\nSince returning to the United States, Colyer has visited Washington, D.C., once and plans to go again to share his medical perspective on what is taking place in Ukraine.\n\n\"I don't see this war ending anytime soon,\" Colyer said. \"I think this war goes on for a couple more years.\"", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The commemoration in Normandy will be followed by the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Italy June 11-13, the Switzerland peace summit for Ukraine June 15-16, and the NATO Summit in Washington July 9-11. French President Emmanuel Macron hopes that what happens this week in France sets the tone for each of these subsequent events -- and he will start by trying to secure more backing from Biden for a stronger and more independent European defense.\n\nBoth countries continue to have divergences on two major questions driving the institutional framework for European security: the way to factor the European Union (EU) in transatlantic relations and the nature of the NATO-Ukraine relationship. France has pushed for its vision of \"strategic autonomy\" and Ukrainian membership in NATO, while Biden has made clear that he was \"not prepared to support the NATOization of Ukraine.\"\n\nMacron and Biden will be joined for the D-Day commemorations by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among others leaders, but notably no Russian representatives. This eightieth anniversary has taken on an even deeper historical weight as it will likely be among the last with living veterans in attendance. The US contribution to the liberation of France and Europe in World War II changed the fate of the continent, and leaders will likely draw lessons from that conflict that can be applied to the continent today regarding Ukraine.\n\nMacron has sought to build momentum for his foreign and European policy in recent months, positioning France to take on greater initiative in supporting Ukraine. At the February 2024 conference on Ukraine in Paris, Macron aimed to build consensus to take new actions on Ukraine but has drawn a lot of criticism for placing the focus on France's agenda. These actions include cyber-defense, co-production of armaments, enhancing Ukraine's military capabilities, deepening France's partnership with Moldova, and sending nonmilitary forces and demining support to Ukraine's border with Belarus. In late April, he outlined a doctrine in a speech at the Sorbonne on how he would like to shape European security over the next five-year political cycle of the EU. Therefore, for Macron the state visit will also be an opportunity to rally Biden's support for a strong European defense and closer EU-NATO institutional cooperation. \"A sine qua non condition for our security,\" Macron said, \"is that Russia does not win the war of aggression it is waging on Ukraine. This is essential.\"\n\nIn his speech, Macron also called for a more \"sovereign\" Europe, one that is prepared to weather the outcomes if the United States reduces its engagement on the continent. This call is in part a reaction to the Trump administration's earlier criticism of NATO. There is, however, an unfortunate tendency in the United States and Germany, when French leaders and officials speak of greater European sovereignty, to interpret such statements as France seeking to reinforce its own influence at the expense of transatlantic relations. Such a view should address the real points of divergence and dispel any drawn-out tendency for Franco-American sparring on this point. Biden and Macron both have an opportunity to capitalize on recent momentum to coalesce Europe around longer-term goals for Euro-Atlantic security and a strategy toward Russia. But also, at the bilateral level between France and the United States, extending cooperation in interoperability and other critical domains in defense and security would send a strong signal of unity and resolve to Russia.\n\nFrench posture toward Russia has hardened considerably since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Macron has sought to underscore this shift and dispel any lingering skepticism among European allies farther east. May 2023 was a turning point, when Macron said in Bratislava that Western Europe \"missed opportunities to listen\" to the warnings of Central and Eastern European countries about Russia. In doing so, Macron has sought to lay a foundation for France to act as a bridge between the United States and NATO's eastern flank countries.\n\nIn continuation of the February 2024 conference on Ukraine in Paris, Macron has in recent weeks been at the forefront of two initiatives intended to increase the West's \"strategic ambiguity.\" This means that as the battlefield constantly evolves, allies must show their adaptability, take the initiative, and create new strategic dilemmas for Russia, rather than draw red lines for themselves. Both initiatives will likely continue to be discussed among Ukraine's partners in the weeks ahead.\n\nFirst, Macron has pushed for Ukraine to be allowed to strike targets within Russia with Western weapons. This initiative includes the decision on May 28, during Macron's visit to Berlin, to allow Ukraine to use weapons delivered by France to strike targets within Russia, including long-range missiles. A direct line can be drawn from the current decision to the proposal stemming from the February 2024 conference on Ukraine to establish a ninth \"deep precision strike\" coalition within the Ramstein Group (the fifty-six-nation group of supporters of Ukraine's defense) for supplies of mid- and long-range missiles. The aim of the ninth working group was to mobilize states willing to send such equipment but to also work on operational concepts given how rare and expensive these weapons are. This approval is linked to the current necessity for the defense of Kharkiv and shows that allies are able to adapt quickly to the evolution in the front lines and play on \"strategic ambiguity\" rather than establish red lines for themselves. The aim is to allow Ukraine to attack the point from which the missiles are fired: to hit the archer instead of the arrow. It is not a blank check, however, and Ukrainian forces are not permitted to hit targets other than those from which the missiles hitting Kharkiv are fired.\n\nSecond, Macron has advanced the idea of sending Western military personnel into Ukraine to build up the operational capacity of the Ukrainian armed forces, which has been welcomed by Estonia, the Netherlands, and Lithuania, among others, but remains a very sensitive, divisive issue. France would certainly look to convince the United States and build a coalition of the willing on this initiative. These military personnel would be in supporting roles, such as logistics, maintenance, and training. They could also help in a number of noncombat roles, such as enhancing Ukraine's resilience against electronic warfare. In return, Western countries would gain a better understanding of terrain and intelligence about Russian forces.\n\nBiden has recently supported the first of these initiatives but not yet the second. Both leaders will have the opportunity to discuss these issues and more options to support Ukraine this week in France and in the weeks ahead. As Russian forces evolve their tactics, NATO's ability to adapt to Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine but also respond to Russia's ability to use latent capabilities all over the eastern flank is paramount in the deterrence and defense of the Alliance.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that Macron's foreign policy ambitions for Europe, however critical to the continent's defense, will need to have the support of French voters. Following the D-Day commemoration, Biden and Macron will meet on June 8. The next day, European Parliament elections will be held in France. While Macron has more than two years left in his presidency, the EU parliamentary elections will likely be interpreted by many France watchers as a referendum on the current national government and its policies, both domestic and foreign. With Macron's party challenged by Marine Le Pen's populist far-right National Rally, which is currently polling ahead, a setback at the ballot box this weekend could be a setback for the \u00c9lys\u00e9e's diplomatic efforts, too.\n\nL\u00e9onie Allard is a visiting fellow at the Atlantic Council's Europe Center, previously serving at the French Ministry of Armed Forces.\n\nImage: French President Emmanuel Macron during a ceremony commemorating SAS paratroopers and Free French Forces who died in Brittany during World War II, at La Gree mill SAS (Special Air Service) memorial in Plumelec, western France, on June 5, 2024, as part of the \"D-Day\" commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the World War II Allied landings in Normandy.

The Russian Federation will not be able to ignore the single voice of the global majority.\n\n\uf0b7 The summit in Switzerland will lay the groundwork for the further involvement in the negotiations of Russian representatives, who are ready to take responsibility for ending aggression.\n\n\uf0b7 Unfortunately, the People's Republic of China will not join the Peace Summit, although, if desired, Beijing could significantly influence the Russian Federation to persuade Moscow to abandon the continuation of the war.\n\n\uf0b7 The involvement of the air defence forces of Ukraine's neighbours to cover the western regions of the country could significantly help the Defence Forces to repel Russian missile terror.\n\n\uf0b7 The idea of closing the sky over part of the Ukrainian territory was heard in the first weeks of the full-scale war and has not lost its relevance to this day.\n\n\uf0b7 The repulse of Iran's missile and drone attack against Israel in April demonstrated that international joint air defence efforts are indeed possible and effective. Western countries shot down the same Iranian drones that Russia uses to kill Ukrainian men and women every day.\n\n\uf0b7 From the perspective of international law, the involvement of partners in the defence of the sky is no different from the military support that Ukraine is already receiving. This is not crossing ''red lines'' or ''getting involved in war''.\n\n\uf0b7 Russian missiles and drones attacking the western regions of Ukraine pose a direct threat to its neighbours and have repeatedly violated the airspace and caused damage to Poland, Romania, and Moldova.\n\n\uf0b7 During the two years of the full-scale war, we can recall many cases when a categorical ''no'' regarding certain assistance for Ukraine eventually ended with positive decisions.\n\n\uf0b7 Russian aggression has caused irreparable damage to the Ukrainian environment and continues to pose environmental threats to our country and the Eastern European region as a whole.\n\n\uf0b7 Russian troops began military operations in industrial agglomerations of Ukraine, where heavy, chemical and coal industry enterprises were concentrated. As a result, the territory, atmosphere and subsoil are polluted with toxic substances.\n\n\uf0b7 The Russians have violated the inviolability of the Chernobyl radiation exclusion zone; their actions at the seized Zaporizhzhia NPP threaten a new man-made disaster. Moscow is blackmailing Ukraine and the world with the possibility of using nuclear weapons.\n\n\uf0b7 A year ago, the occupiers blew up the dam of the Kakhovka HPP, causing the flooding of the lower Dnipro ecosystems and the destruction of Ukraine's biodiversity. Nature conservation funds are being destroyed: the Serebryansky forest was burned; invaders are organizing ''safaris'' in the Askania-Nova nature reserve.\n\n\uf0b7 A significant territory of Ukraine is mined. The hostilities led to a sharp increase in carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. As a result of hostilities, the fauna of the Black Sea is suffering, and the populations of fish, birds, and sea mammals are sharply decreasing.\n\nCenter for Strategic Communication and Information

Soon after, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo claimed Russia was paying the members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to spread propaganda in Europe.\n\nThese moves were the latest by the European Union to defend its information space from alleged Russian influence ahead of European Parliament elections on Thursday and Friday, during which right-wing parties that enjoy warm relations with Moscow are anticipated to make significant gains.\n\nThe European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), a think tank, in January forecast that far-right parties would outpoll mainstream parties in nine out of 27 EU member states, and form the third-biggest bloc in the European Parliament after the centre-right European Popular Party (EPP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP).\n\nThat bloc, Identity and Democracy (ID), comprises the most hardline parties, like Freedom of Austria and Italy's Northern League.\n\nOther conservatives who self-identify to the right of the EPP, such as Brothers of Italy and Poland's Law and Justice (PiS), belong to the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR). Others still are unaligned. If they were all to join forces after June 9, the ECFR believes they would command 225 seats in the 720-seat chamber, becoming the biggest bloc.\n\nRussia officially denies meddling in Western elections, but analysts are convinced otherwise.\n\nMoscow is trying to aid the progress of hardliners with what Maxim Alyukov, a research fellow at Manchester University's Department of Russian and East European Studies, calls \"pragmatic manipulation\".\n\n\"These far-right parties are seen [by Moscow] as allies because they in general are seen as centrifugal forces which can erode cohesion in the EU, making it easier for Russia to establish its own hegemony,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\nTo influence the European vote, Alyukov suggested Moscow has been plying narratives already tested on the Russian electorate.\n\nFor example, amid its war in Ukraine, Russia has ramped up its messaging against gay rights propagated by Western liberal democracies, and in favour of traditional family values.\n\n\"At a certain point, [the Kremlin] just found it to be a very effective strategy to divide people in Russia ... and weaponise this implicit homophobia which was there in Russia but wasn't a political instrument,\" said Alyukov.\n\nThe vehicles for this and other narratives have been Russian news outlets, like Rossiyskaya Gazeta, RIA Novosti and Izvestia, which the European Commission took off the airwaves in May. But there have also been outfits such as Voice of Europe, which are not based in Russia and sport a mainstream appearance.\n\nOther information operations carried similar European-sounding names like Euro-More, France et EU, and Recent and Reliable News, said Stephen Hutchings and Vera Tolz-Zilitinkevic, professors of Russian studies at Manchester University and lead investigators in the (Mis)Translating Deceit project, which tracks covert Russian news operations.\n\n\"All these outlets appeared in the context of the banning of Russia Today and Sputnik [in March 2022] as alternatives,\" Tolz-Zilitinkevic told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"[With] RT and Sputnik, it was very clear [they] were state-funded outlets with content that was sometimes disinformation in the strictest sense - fabricated material,\" she said. \"But these sites ... their provenance is much less clear, and clearly their creation is part of the strategy which is organised by various actors in Russia including intelligence services.\"\n\nSome of these operations were easy to detect, said Hutchings, because they used auto-translations from original Russian articles, or cited Russian media as sources.\n\n\"My sense is [the Russians] are paying attention to these elections and they do see an opportunity here in a success of the far right,\" Hutchings told Al Jazeera.\n\nTheir focus, he said, was \"any stories that present the EU in a bad light\".\n\nIn liberal member states, for example, \"they might emphasise minorities being underrepresented in the EU Parliament\", said Hutchings. \"But elsewhere, such as Poland and Hungary, they will go with the antiliberal, anti-woke narratives that appeal to those populations.\"\n\nPerhaps the most aggressively pursued narrative is the argument that sanctions are an own goal for Europe, because they raise energy costs and living costs.\n\nThat ties in with a sister narrative that \"major international institutions are dominated by elites from the Western liberal establishment and basically they apply the law any way they want\", said Alyukov.\n\nRussia justifies spun reporting through similar relativism, he said.\n\n\"[The Russians] understand that all reporting is subjective, so it's political, and if you live in Russia you have to defend Russia's interests.\"\n\nThere is a military purpose to exploiting political divides in Western society, said Jade McGlynn, a researcher in the War Studies Department at King's College London.\n\n\"If we look at where their messaging is focused, particularly regarding elites, it suggests that what they're most worried about is a re-entrenchment of Western support for Ukraine, and the West really giving Ukraine free rein to fight,\" she told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe Kremlin has been counting on Western self-restraint, propagated by conservatives who have amplified Russian arguments that the West provoked the Russian invasion and that its persistent defence of Ukraine will lead to nuclear war.\n\nThat effort has been failing.\n\nLast April, the United States Congress approved a $60bn spending bill for Ukraine over Republican objections, and last week, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the US gave Ukraine permission to use their weapons to strike on Russian soil, enraging the Kremlin.\n\nEuropean elections present a new opportunity, McGlynn told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"I think, the Russians are making a good bet that the West will lose interest in helping Ukraine before Russia loses interest in destroying it.\"\n\nThese narratives have played especially well in landlocked Central European countries stretching across the former Austro-Hungarian Empire from the Carpathians to the Alps, either because they have large Russophilic populations or because they have a vested interest in buying piped oil and gas from Russia.\n\nAll of them successfully argued for derogations from an EU ban on Russian oil imports, which took effect in December 2022, and while many other EU states did the same, those seen as geographically vulnerable to Russian supplies won the longest exceptions.\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis and the 2015 refugee crisis gave far-right parties in this region a huge lift, said Daniela Richterova, a senior lecturer in Intelligence Studies at the War Studies Department at King's College London, who specialises in the former Czechoslovakia.\n\n\"Especially the more working-class voters were disillusioned with what they saw as the EU's inability to help improve their economic conditions,\" Richterova told Al Jazeera. \"The EU's handling of the migration crisis ... also made some voters sceptical about the pros and cons of being in the Schengen zone and having open borders.\"\n\nHere and elsewhere in Europe, authoritarian, anti-immigrant, anti-globalist, Eurosceptic, populist parties have since flourished.\n\nFidesz has ruled in Hungary since 2010 and the PiS party ruled Poland from 2015 to October 2023, partly thanks to a shared playbook of suppression of free speech and judicial subversion.\n\nThe Party for Freedom became the third-largest in the Netherlands in the 2010 parliamentary election, rose to second place in 2017 and came first in November 2023. Its controversial leader, Geert Wilders, now dominates a coalition formed last month.\n\nThe Alternative for Germany (AfD) won seats in a series of state legislatures beginning in 2014 and took 12.6 percent of the vote to enter the federal parliament in 2017.\n\nIn Finland, the Finns Party, formerly known as the True Finns, took 17.7 percent of the vote in 2015 and ruled as coalition partners for two years. The Sweden Democrats became the country's second-largest party in 2022. A right-wing coalition came to power in Italy that year. In France, the National Front has been steadily increasing its vote share in the past three presidential elections.\n\nBut the far right in Austria predates them all.\n\nUnder Jorg Haider, the Freedom Party of Austria (FPO) placed second in the 1999 general election unaided by global crises, and entered a coalition with the centre-right Austrian People's Party, which had placed third.\n\nIt was the first entry of a hardline party in government since the second World War and it shocked Europe.\n\nThe FPO now outpolls everyone else at 29 percent on the basis of a platform that is friendly towards Russia, including continuing to import almost all of Austria's oil and gas from Russia.\n\nThat is because Austrian ultraconservatism and Russophilia cross party lines, said Velina Tchakarova, an independent geopolitical and risk consultant based in Vienna.\n\n\"The [mainstream] conservatives were in power in 2018 when the state contract for delivery of Russian gas was signed. It runs to 2040 and nobody can tell you its contents,\" she told Al Jazeera. \"There is no publicity, no transparency. Opposition forces tried to have a debate on it - they didn't get it.\"\n\nConservatives are now bleeding voters to the FPO, Tchakarova believes.\n\n\"Conservatives won 37 percent in the last election, and are polling at 21-23 percent, so that tells you where this difference is going.\"\n\nSo powerful are the forces protecting Russian gas that the decennial process of drafting a new security strategy - in which Tchakarova was involved - foundered last year when the conservatives insisted on not diversifying from Russian gas.\n\nShe said, \"Now we still have a security strategy that goes back to 2013, before the first Russian invasion [of Ukraine], and in this document, Russia is a strategic partner.\"\n\nThe FPO signed another secret agreement with Moscow in December 2016 - this time with the United Russia Party that supports President Vladimir Putin. It is a boilerplate agreement, also contracted a few months later between United Russia and the Northern League, a far-right party in neighbouring Italy.\n\nDanilo Procaccianti, lead reporter on the state RAI network's show Report, obtained both of those agreements, which he shared with Al Jazeera.\n\nThey call for experience-sharing in \"party building, organisational work, youth policy, economic development ... legislative activity\", and suggest United Russia wanted to learn about the workings of two major European democracies.\n\nWhen Procaccianti interviewed Northern League leader Matteo Salvini after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he downplayed the agreement.\n\n\"They backed down because, especially at the beginning of the war, it was very inappropriate to appear close to Putin,\" Procaccianti told Al Jazeera.\n\nIn the invasion year, the League's share of the popular vote also fell to 8.79 percent from 17.35 percent in 2018, but Procaccianti does not believe voters punished Salvini for his pro-Russia views.\n\n\"I do not believe that this influenced the electoral results,\" said Procaccianti, \"because Italians pay little attention to foreign policy ... Salvini has lost consensus because [Prime Minister Giorgia] Meloni has dried up his electoral base - they are fishing in the same sea.\"\n\nFor Dimitar Bechev, a lecturer at the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies (OSGA) and senior fellow at Carnegie Europe, the question is whether mainstream conservatives will embrace the right.\n\n\"The big question, to my mind, is whether the EPP - the likely winner overall - will recreate the coalition with Social Democrats,\" Bechev told Al Jazeera, \"or rather turn to the conservative ECR [Meloni, Orban, Poland's PiS]. A centre right-far right realignment will be an important inflexion point.\"", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Alarming statements from Russia you can't ignore", "body": "Nuclear war imminent? Alarming statements from Russia you can't ignore\n\nNuclear war poses an existential threat with catastrophic consequences, and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has escalated tensions between the United States and Russia, bringing the world dangerously close to such a scenario. The Biden administration's decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided missiles to strike within Russian territory has significantly raised the stakes. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and other Russian officials have issued stark warnings about the potential for a direct nuclear conflict. Russia's alarming rhetoric and actions, such as Dmitry Suslov suggesting a demonstration nuclear explosion and Vladimir Solovyov declaring nuclear war inevitable, reflect a growing belief in an unavoidable showdown with the West.\n\nUkraine's attacks on Russian radar systems and NATO's preparations for potential conflict further exacerbate the situation. Global tensions are also rising, with U.S.-China relations strained over Taiwan and continued volatility in the Middle East. The urgent need for de-escalation is clear, but public awareness and urgency in addressing the crisis remain low. World leaders must pursue diplomatic solutions to avoid plunging into an unprecedented disaster.\n\nEscalating Tensions in Ukraine\n\nThe Biden administration's decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided missiles to strike deep within Russian territory has significantly raised the stakes. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev issued a stark warning that this policy shift could precipitate a direct nuclear conflict between the two superpowers.\n\nMedvedev, who served as Russia's president from 2008 to 2012 and could potentially lead the country again, stressed the gravity of the situation. His public statements highlight the real risk of nuclear escalation and the dire consequences it could bring. Medvedev emphasized that miscalculations involving tactical nuclear weapons could lead to fatal mistakes, underlining the high population density in Europe and the strategic nuclear capabilities of both nations.\n\nThreats from Russian Officials\n\nThe rhetoric from Russian officials has been increasingly alarming. Dmitry Suslov, a member of the Russian Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, has suggested a demonstration nuclear explosion to convey the seriousness of Russia's intentions. Such an act, he argued, could restore the fear of nuclear war that has historically prevented major conflicts between great powers.\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by prominent Russian journalist Vladimir Solovyov, who declared that nuclear war is inevitable. His statements reflect a growing consensus within Russia that a final showdown with Western powers is unavoidable and that striking first in a nuclear conflict offers the best chance of survival.\n\nProvocations and Responses\n\nUkraine's recent attacks on Russian early-warning radar systems have further exacerbated tensions. These strikes, deep inside Russian territory, could be interpreted as preparatory moves for potential nuclear strikes by the U.S. or as desperate attempts to fully commit NATO to the conflict. Either scenario increases the risk of a catastrophic miscalculation.\n\nNATO's plans to deploy American troops to the frontlines of Europe in the event of an all-out conflict with Russia add another layer of complexity. The alliance is preparing new land corridors to quickly move soldiers through central Europe, bypassing local bureaucratic impediments. These preparations underscore the seriousness with which NATO views the potential for escalation.\n\nGlobal Implications and Further Conflicts\n\nThe risk of nuclear conflict extends beyond the immediate U.S.-Russia dynamic. President Joe Biden has not ruled out deploying American troops to Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, further straining U.S.-China relations. This stance comes at a time of heightened tensions, with Taiwan's new president being an outspoken critic of Beijing.\n\nSimultaneously, the Middle East remains a volatile region. Recent Israeli airstrikes in Syria, targeting Iranian military advisers and possibly more militia members, illustrate the potential for regional conflicts to escalate. The interconnected nature of these global hotspots increases the likelihood of a broader, more devastating conflict.\n\nThe Urgent Need for De-escalation\n\nGiven the dire consequences of a nuclear war, it is imperative for world leaders to pursue de-escalation strategies. The current trajectory of the conflict in Ukraine, coupled with rising tensions in other regions, demands a concerted effort to find diplomatic solutions. The risk of miscalculation is too great, and the stakes are too high to continue down the path of escalation.\n\nThe general public, particularly in the United States, remains largely unaware of how close the world is to a nuclear confrontation. Major news networks focus on domestic politics, while Russian media is filled with discussions of war. This disparity in public awareness contributes to a lack of urgency in addressing the escalating crisis.\n\nA potential overlooked detail is the influence of domestic politics on international decisions. Leaders might prioritize short-term political gains over long-term global security, increasing the risk of miscalculation and escalation.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe threat of nuclear war looms large over the current geopolitical landscape. The decisions made by leaders in the coming months will determine whether the world steps back from the brink of catastrophe or plunges into an unprecedented disaster. It is crucial for all parties involved to recognize the gravity of the situation and to work towards peaceful resolutions.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher. The world must heed the warnings of experts and officials who understand the catastrophic potential of nuclear conflict. Diplomacy, dialogue, and a commitment to peace are essential to preventing a disaster that would change the course of human history forever.", "source": {"uri": "guerillastocktrading.com", "dataType":

On the contrary, the Alliance will be on this path \"if it does nothing for Ukraine,\" the US President emphasized.\n\nAs previously reported by OBOZ.UA:\n\n- On May 31, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken assured that at the NATO summit in Washington, \"we will see a powerful package of support for Ukraine. It will contribute to our Euro-Atlantic integration.\n\n- North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that the allies had made progress in three areas of support for Kyiv during their meeting in Prague, Czech Republic.

Biden arrived in France on June 5 for the event.\n\nThe meeting, the first face-to-face talks between the two leaders since the U.S. Congress on April 20 finally approved a desperately needed $61 billion military aid package for Ukraine, comes shortly after Biden told TIME magazine in an interview that he does not support NATO membership for Ukraine -- a position in contradiction with that of NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg -- which is likely to raise questions from Zelenskiy.\n\n\"While he's in Normandy, he'll have the opportunity to sit down with President Zelenskiy and have an engagement with him to talk about the state of play in Ukraine and how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine,\" national-security adviser Jake Sullivan said.\n\n\"He will also have an opportunity several days later to see President Zelenskiy at the G7 [summit] in Italy, and then as you saw, he has asked Vice President [Kamala] Harris to represent the United States at the peace summit in Switzerland, and I will accompany the vice president on that trip,\" he said.\n\nIn the wide-ranging June 4 interview with TIME, Biden pointed out that \"peace looks like making sure Russia never, never, never, never occupies Ukraine. That's what peace looks like.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"It doesn't mean NATO, [that] they are part of NATO.\"\n\n\"It means we have a relationship with them like we do with other countries, where we supply weapons so they can defend themselves in the future. But...I am not prepared to support the NATOization of Ukraine.\"\n\nThe meeting comes amid a difficult battlefield situation for outmanned and outgunned Ukrainian forces on the eastern front.\n\nRussia has stepped up almost daily strikes on civilian targets in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, where Moscow has been attempting to reestablish a bridgehead, and in the eastern region of Donetsk, where intense fighting continues.\n\nZelenskiy will also meet French President Emmanuel Macron on June 7 in Paris, the Elysee Palace announced. Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni said Zelenskiy will take part in the G7 summit of the most developed nations that will be held on June 13-15 in the southern Italian region of Puglia.\n\nSince Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv has increasingly sought to join the NATO military alliance.\n\nIn 1994 it joined NATO's Partnership for Peace plan, and applied for NATO membership in September 2022 after Russia proclaimed it had annexed part of Ukraine's southeast.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

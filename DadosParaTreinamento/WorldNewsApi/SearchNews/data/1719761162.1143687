{"id": 225073062, "title": "Ugandan Jon Muq's Music Is Warm and Familiar on Flying Away", "text": "Presumably, most PopMatters readers know little about Uganda\u2019s country and culture. The African nation rarely invades the Western consciousness except when something horrendous (the reign of Idi Amin) or momentous (the Israeli raid at Entebbe) happens there. The story of Ugandan singer-songwriter Jon Muq demonstrates what one might be missing by not paying attention to non-Western music. Muq is a very talented and charismatic performer. He was not famous in his home country when he got his first significant opportunity. Agents for a Norwegian cruise line hired him as a performer after seeing a video of him entertaining a group of homeless children in the capital city of Kampala. He honed his skills on board and somehow parlayed that gig into a trip to America, where he was stranded in Austin, Texas\u2014the self-proclaimed live music capital of the world. Muq was taken in by friendly locals when COVID-19 hit. After several months, luck and chance provided Jon Muq with occasions to become part of the local music scene and opening for notables such as Mavis Staples, Billy Joel, and Norah Jones, as well as the ears of Dan Auerbach (Black Keys), who has produced Muq\u2019s debut album, Flying Away. Auerbach has a distinctive production style that can make artists as different as British chanteuse Yola (Walk Through Fire), redneck country star Hank Williams Jr. (Rich White Honky Blues), and Latin instrumental band Hermanos Guti\u00e9rrez (El Bueno y el Malo) seem like they were all made out of the same cloth in the best possible manner. Auerbach gives them the patina of authenticity as if one is hearing the unadulterated artist. The musicians sound as if they were performing in their living room to friends. While other recordings by these artists reveal they are complex artists who work in a variety of styles, the Auerbach-produced records are paradoxically seen as the most authentic and genuine. There is a sense of intimacy in the performances. This is Jon Muq\u2019s first album, so one has no other work by him to compare this to, but the Auerbach magic is present in the production. Songs such as \u201cBend\u201d, \u201cButterflies\u201d, and \u201cHello Sunshine\u201d showcase the warmth in Muq\u2019s voice and the tenderness in his guitar playing. The lyrical details seem less important than the overall atmospherics. These are love songs. The emotion expressed matters more than the particulars. Other tracks, such as \u201cCrying, Laughing, Loving, Lying\u201d, \u201cOne You Love\u201d, \u201cLucky Love\u201d, and \u201cLove, Love, Love\u201d, show Muq\u2019s obsession with the topic. \u201cThere\u2019s really no way you can get too much of it, he proclaims, \u201cbeautiful, glorious love\u201d. But thankfully, the musician keeps from being overly saccharine and addresses other themes. As one might guess from the situation of an artist in exile, he sings about being away (\u201cFlying Away From Home\u201d) and alienation (\u201cRunaway\u201d). Sometimes, Muq is best when he\u2019s singing about nothing in particular. As its name suggests, \u201cShake Shake\u201d is a song about the pleasures of dance. \u201cRiding\u201d may invoke deeper questions about the purpose of life, but at heart, concerns moving on down the road. These songs allow the singer to voice his feelings without overdramatizing them. Love can be a heavy topic, even when it is joyous. Just existing offers its own satisfaction. Auerbach captures the exoticism of Muq\u2019s African rhythms by not drawing attention to them. The instrumentation remains in the background. One doesn\u2019t notice how unusual the settings are unless one deliberately listens for that purpose. The same is true of the whole of Muq\u2019s music. His voice and presence come off as natural and unaffected. One has to carefully listen to appreciate both the breadth and the subtlety of his talents. Jon Muq is from Uganda, a place as strange and unknown to most listeners as the surface of the moon or the floor of the ocean. His music is as warm and familiar as our hometowns.", "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://www.popmatters.com/jon-muq-flying-away-review\" title=\"Ugandan Jon Muq&#8217;s Music Is Warm and Familiar on &#8216;Flying Away&#8217;\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://www.popmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jon-Muq-by-Devon-Hutchins-2024.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"Jon Muq 2024\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.popmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jon-Muq-by-Devon-Hutchins-2024.jpg 1000w, https://www.popmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jon-Muq-by-Devon-Hutchins-2024-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.popmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jon-Muq-by-Devon-Hutchins-2024-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.popmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jon-Muq-by-Devon-Hutchins-2024-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></p>Jon Muq's voice and presence come off as natural and unaffected.

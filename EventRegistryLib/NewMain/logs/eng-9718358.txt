Every year, you must start afresh,\" added Chiloane.\n\nChiloane said the system had improved since its launch in 2015, with the help of all stakeholders and suggestions from parents.\n\nAmong those is communication from the department, which now sends regular updates on the number the parents provide.\n\n\"I'm confident to say the system is working very well.

Don't put one school because if your child doesn't get placed in that school, we will have a problem. You're putting your child at a disadvantage. Choose five schools, minimum of three.\"\n\nThe system will give parents seven days to upload the required documents from the day they create their profile.\n\n\"If the system gives you a spot within these seven days and you don't upload the documents, it automatically pushes you down and prioritises one who has uploaded the documents,\" said Chiloane.\n\nWhile this does not mean parents will have to start their applications afresh, it does, however, push them down on a list of their preferred schools.\n\nChiloane further warned against uploading fraudulent documents with the application, as the system can pick it up.\n\nALSO READ: SA's education system in crisis as teacher attacks escalate\n\n\"If you upload fraudulent documents, we will not be able to place your child.

online for school placements in the provincial system,\" Chiloane said.\n\nHe said even if parents applied for learners in the system last year, they must start a fresh profile this year on the official GDE website for school admissions.\n\n\"Placement offers will be sent out via SMS on September 16 and there will be contingencies in place to ensure that all learners are placed for the 2025 academic year.\"\n\nChiloane said parents with children that are currently in Grade R must apply online for their children to be admitted to Grade 1.\n\n\"Parents are reminded that the GDE Online Admissions System currently only services applications to Grade 1 and Grade 8, applications to other grades must be made directly at the school of your choice.\"\n\nParents are encouraged to use the home address within the school feeder zone application option to see schools within the zone of their home address.\n\nAccording to Chiloane this is to increase the chance of placement closer to home.\n\nHe reminded parents that the school choices they make will all be considered as \"preferred schools\" and the child may be placed at any, not just the first they chose.\n\nChiloane said when applying, parents are urged to select a minimum of three and a maximum of five schools.\n\n\"Parents who select one or two schools when applying jeopardise the chances of their children being placed in the instance of those selected schools reaching full capacity.\"\n\nHe stressed that selecting more schools increases the chance of placement.\n\nParents cannot make more than one application for one learner to the same school.\n\nhttps://x.com/matomekopano/status/1810583112541163576\n\n- The parent's ID or passport and child's birth certificate or passport\n\n- Latest Grade 7 school report (Grade 8 applicants only)\n\n- Clinic card/immunisation report (Grade 1 applicants only).\n\n\"Parents and guardians must ensure that all documents are certified and valid, submitting or uploading fraudulent documents will result in non-placement for your child.\"\n\nAll documents must be submitted or uploaded within seven days of applying.\n\nConstant system reminders on the parent's profile and SMS notifications will be sent to parents to submit or upload documents within seven days.\n\n- Applications without a valid proof of home address will be considered incomplete.\n\n- During the application period, consistent reminders will be sent to applicants with incomplete applications to submit outstanding documents within 7 days.\n\n- 7 days after the application period, all applicants with incomplete applications are informed via SMS and a message on their profile, that their applications are not valid.\n\nChiloane said GDE placed 400 000 learners in the 2024 academic year, and now the system works smoothly.\n\nHe said parents must comply with Gauteng online school admissions processes and with time restrictions.\n\n\"The sooner you apply, the faster your child will get placement.\"\n\nHe stressed that Grade R learners are not automatically accepted to Grade 1 at the school they are currently enrolled.\n\n\"This means that all learners currently enrolled in Grade R in a school or ECD site, as well as learners that are not in any type school must apply on the system for admission to a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 schools.\"\n\nApplicants that do not have access to the internet or resources required to apply can visit any of the 80 decentralised walk-in centres across 15 education districts for assistance.\n\n- Libraries will also be available to assist parents to apply\n\n- Head Office, all 15 District Offices and schools will serve as walk-in centres.\n\nInformation required for first-time Gauteng school admissions:\n\n-Where other siblings

With this process, we've eliminated all of that.\n\n\"For us, it assists us with data access, accurate stats; it allows us immediate access and enables us to plan accordingly.\"\n\nThe provincial education department introduced the schools online registration system for grade one and eight learners in 2016, under leadership of premier Panyaza Lesufi. This was part of the department's effort to prevent long queues and encourage a tech-savvy school registration process.\n\nThe system, however, has often been prone to hiccups, ranging from the inability to handle multiple users at a time and the department failing to communicate on time with parents on the status of their children's applications, to finding schools for unplaced learners at the start of every academic year.\n\nIt has also been reported that the system has been prone to manipulation by some officials in schools and district offices.\n\nDuring today's announcement, Chiloane acknowledged the system began slowly, with some teething problems when it started. However, that's not the case today, he stated.\n\n\"I'm confident today that the system is smooth, it is working very well. In this academic year, we've placed over 400 000 learners. All learners that completed applications for this academic year were placed.\n\n\"We had incomplete applications, but those that complied were placed.\"\n\nAccording to the MEC, among the key issues raised by parents and stakeholders during consultative processes is timeous communication and updates. \"We've tried to improve on that aspect and worked around the clock to sort it out.\n\n\"What's also important is the parents' phone numbers - give us a reliable number and don't lose it. This is how we'll continually update you on how far the process is.\"", "source": {"uri": "itweb.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITWeb"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simnikiwe_mzekandaba@itweb.co.za", "name": "Simnikiwe Mzekandaba", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council_(South_Africa)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive Council (South Africa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauteng", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gauteng"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gauteng"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matome_Chiloane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matome Chiloane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauteng_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gauteng Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panyaza_Lesufi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Panyaza Lesufi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2024/07/Matome-Chiloane-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718358", "eventUri": "eng-9718358", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 163, "textEnd": 170, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-12", "textStart": 465, "textEnd": 474, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

He said this while announcing that the applications for Grades 1 and 8 placements at Gauteng schools for 2025 will open on July 11 at 8am.\n\nThe MEC said the Gauteng department of education was fully behind the schools that verify the addresses on applications. This to ensure that parents and guardians apply where they reside.\n\n\"Gauteng is a home for everyone. You will find people in Limpopo applying for space using the address of a relative in Tembisa,\" Chiloane said. He added that it was important for parents and guardians to register their children where they live.\n\nParents and guardians will be able to register when the system goes live on July 11.\n\n\"All parents are expected to register; previous login details will not work. Only parents with children going to Grade 1 and/or Grade 8 seeking space at a public school in Gauteng for the 2025 academic year will be able to register and apply online,\" he said.\n\nParents whose children are in Grade R at any Gauteng public school are not exempted. They are also still required to apply for placement in Grade 1 through the online system.\n\n\"In this academic year [2024] alone, we have placed more than 400,000 learners,\" said Chiloane. He was denying claims that some pupils were not placed in schools. \"It is not true that some learners were not placed. There were incomplete applications. But those [whose applications] were complete were placed on time,\" he said.\n\nParents have until midnight on August 12 to apply for placements in any of the public schools in the province. These are for Grades 1 and 8.\n\n\"Applications to other grades must be made directly at the school of your choice,\" he said.\n\nIn their application for placement, Chiloane encouraged parents and guardians to select at least three options. This with a maximum of five options.\n\nThe MEC said parents must not only choose their options as a tick-box exercise. They must note what it means when they agree to the terms and conditions of the application. This means they are agreeing to placement in any of the options they provided. This applies in case there's no space in their first-option school.\n\nParents and guardians are encouraged to follow the five-step application process right until the end. The required documentation must be submitted within seven days of the application, as required.\n\nThose who do not have access to the internet are encouraged to use any of the 80 walk-in centres around the province. They can also use schools facilities for assistance with the applications.\n\n\"This is free of charge. Report anyone who will charge you with the application to the Gauteng department of education,\" he said.\n\nChiloane also encouraged parents to use their home address as a feeder zone for the application. He said since parents often change jobs, children could be disadvantaged by an application made using a work address.\n\nThe department is working with Home Affairs, Chiloane said. This is to ensure that the information provided by parents and guardians is consistent.\n\nDocuments required are certified copies of IDs or passports of parents; birth certificates or passports of children. Proof of home or work address and the latest Grade 7 results for Grade 8 applications. Immunisation records for Grade 1 applications are all documents required to complete the application.\n\n\"Avoid submitting fraudulent documents; it will affect the application process for your child,\" he warned parents.\n\nHe said parents and guardians must provide a phone number.

Applications are set to close on 12 August at midnight.\n\nIn previous years, parents have faced numerous hurdles when trying to secure a spot for their children in the province's public schools.

Very often children were allocated who lived very far away or who wanted education in English but were assigned to a monolingual Afrikaans school.\"\n\nEqual Education and Equal Education Law Centre are getting an influx of requests from children who have not been in school since January.\n\nMahlangu said: \"We are helping people apply in their local districts by creating pamphlets for parents.

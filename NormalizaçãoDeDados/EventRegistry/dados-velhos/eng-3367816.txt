The former followed up his scoring debut in Macedonia by notching a brace in a thumping 4-0 victory over West Ham United, while the latter's highly effective performances in the engine room alongside Paul Pogba has led to widespread bemusement as to why the crisis-stricken defending champions were willing to offload him to a direct rival.\n\nMourinho reiterated last month that he wanted another attacking option capable of playing out wide in addition to a new midfielder in Matic, with Ivan Perisic widely believed to be his priority target.

Ivan Perisic, the would-be 'Fourth Player', remains at Internazionale a month after United felt a deal was 'very close', only the Croat boarded Inter's pre-season tour plane to China.\n\nA senior United source acknowledged there had been no further developments on Perisic over the last month and there is an air of acceptance the club might end the month with three additions, their lowest intake since David Moyes 's woeful window in 2013. Mourinho has not concealed his desire for a winger and, should the goals dry up again, the United manager and supporters need only look towards the Old Trafford directors' box for their scapegoat.\n\nLouis van Gaal spent \u00a3151.5m and \u00a3106.5m in successive summer windows and United only broke over the \u00a3150m limit in 2014 because of the Radamel Falcao loan payment. So, where permanent fees are concerned, they have not hit the \u00a3150m barrier. Pep Guardiola has expended more than \u00a3400m and wants two more recruits.\n\nUnited's last bid for Perisic was believed to be \u00a339m and their reluctance to improve on that might be simply because they have spent their budget. They could have \u00a39.3m left in the pot to spend and, to quote Sir Alex Ferguson , there is no value in the market with that amount. Tom Lawrence, who played only once for United, just joined Derby for a fee rising up to \u00a37m.\n\nMourinho wanted to sign an additional player a year ago in Jose Fonte but had to sell and there were no takers for Marcos Rojo, who proved his worth later on. Internazionale, maybe mindful of the 'limit', have baited United by insisting Anthony Martial be included in any deal for Perisic. United will not consider a swap.\n\nUnited have not raised much from player sales, either. Adnan Januzaj joined Real Sociedad for \u00a39.8m but Josh Harrop agreed to move to Preston for a compensation fee, United waived a transfer fee as Wayne Rooney returned to Everton and Ibrahimovic was also out of contract.\n\nIt is entirely possible United's fourth signing might already be at the club. When Paul Pogba was asked in Georgetown last month if he was relishing filling Ibrahimovic's void he was not about to barge the man he dubbed 'Thor' aside like the Hulk did. \"He's still a big leader because he's still in the team,\" Pogba clarified.\n\nThe feeling among United players and their manager is Ibrahimovic is neither gone, nor forgotten, despite his status as a free agent. He is continuing his rehabilitation in Manchester and when Mourinho spoke about United's four injured players last month he was possibly referring to Ibrahimovic rather than the short-term absentee Juan Mata, along with Rojo, Ashley Young and Luke Shaw .\n\nHe is 'Thor' to Pogba while others inside the United dressing room call Ibrahimovic 'God'. The self-appointed 'King of Football' is 'coming back', as a recent Instagram video teased, and he might be back in red.\n\nMourinho's rapport with Ibrahimovic could appease him if United do not add to their squad this month. It is only 17 weeks since Ibrahimovic landed awkwardly in front of the Stretford End and the hoisting a 12th career title in front of the stand would provide satisfactory closure.\n\n\"It was very clear by showing what he did, last year was not enough for him,\" Mourinho said on Friday. \"He wants more football at the highest level, so we are having conversations and discussing the possibility of him staying for the second part of the season.\"\n\nIbrahimovic is one man Mourinho will be patient with.", "id": "9722648", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Have Manchester United FC

fourth summer signing will elude United, it is unlikely Jose Mourinho will hit the panic button come the turn of the year.\n\nThe Portuguese, generally, does not use the January transfer window to make big-money signings unless he allows a player to leave as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nWhen Mourinho made the bold decision to let both Morgan Schneiderlin and Memphis Depay depart, he even decided against bringing in reinforcements.\n\nThe United manager sees January as a bailout of sorts and prefers to trust the group he painstakingly assembled to get his side over the line.\n\nThere have been a handful of exceptions over the years, including Carlos Alberto, Goran Pandev and Diego Lopez, who all made an immediate impact.\n\nBut, if Mourinho had his way, he would cut the length of the January transfer window to two weeks - such is his faith in his squad.\n\nThat is particularly true of his second season in charge of a club, his favourite period, when his bond with his players is never stronger.\n\nInstead, to cover injuries or provide a fillip in the second-half of the season, Mourinho tends to go for short-term deals if he does enter the market.\n\nManiche and Emmanuel Adebayor are just some of the mid-season loan deals he has got over the line in the last decade or so.\n\nAnd, generally, it is only when a big name leaves that he can justify a sizable purchase.\n\nMourinho only moved for Mohamed Salah after Juan Mata asked to go in 2013 and only signed Juan Cuadrado when Andre Schurrle was on his way to Wolfsburg a year later.\n\nNeither were roaring successes at Stamford Bridge - which may have had a bearing on Mourinho's attitude towards the window ever since.\n\nThat is not to say Mourinho would turn a blind eye if a player came on the market or to tee up a future signing.\n\nJanuary was seen as the perfect time to re-sign Nemanja Matic, for example, to allow him to bed in ahead of leading Chelsea's title charge the following season.\n\nMourinho used similar logic when meeting Ashley Cole in January, 2005 ahead of his controversial move to Stamford Bridge 18 months later; he was fined \u00a3200,000 for his troubles.\n\nVictor Lindelof, too, was sounded out ahead of a possible mid-season move but Mourinho opted to wait until the summer.\n\nGiven how the 23-year-old will need time to adjust to life in England, it was perhaps a surprise United did not get the deal done earlier as they had previously with Patrice Evra, Nemanja Vidic and Anders Lindegaard.\n\nBut Mourinho's finger prints are all over United's transfer plans - and that is not just limited to the seven signings he has made in the last year.\n\nFrom considering Jan Oblak in March, in case David de Gea left, to lining up Leander Dendoncker if a deal for Matic failed to materialise, United have had all bases covered.\n\nAnd, as Paul Scholes and Henrik Larsson previously proved, a mid-season veteran could yet raise weary winter spirits.\n\nWith his favoured No.10 shirt still vacant, all roads point to Zlatan Ibrahimovic re-joining the club as a dressing room colossus.\n\nIbrahimovic is a walking reminder of what is possible under Mourinho and the pair share a remarkable relationship after previously spending just one season together at Inter Milan.\n\nIbrahimovic has relished that ambassadorial role - from mentoring Marcus Rashford to bizarrely slicing a giant block of swiss cheese at a Tag Heuer event.\n\nTellingly, the Swede has remained in the headlines - even after his horrific knee injury in April - and that is significant given how Mourinho usually ignores injured players.\n\nPerhaps he will get that fourth signing, after all.\n\nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download

Previous managers had to clear every transfer with the remote Glazer family in Tampa, Florida whereas Mourinho agreed on a pot of cash before his maiden window as United manager and it was up to him how he used it.\n\nMourinho has spent \u00a3286million (\u00a3145.3m last year and \u00a3140.7m this year) in two summer windows, excluding the add-ons United could later shell out for Victor Lindelof, Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic. In each summer, United's spending has fallen just shy of the \u00a3150m mark for up-front fees, having identified four priority targets.\n\nLast year, United were fortunate to get Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a free transfer but do not have that luxury this year. Ivan Perisic, the would-be 'Fourth Player', remains at Internazionale a month after United felt a deal was 'very close', only the Croat boarded Inter's pre-season tour plane to China.\n\nA senior United source acknowledged there had been no further developments on Perisic over the last month and there is an air of acceptance the club might end the month with three additions, their lowest intake since David Moyes' woeful window in 2013. Mourinho has not concealed his desire for a winger and, should the goals dry up again, the United manager and supporters need only look towards the Old Trafford directors' box for their scapegoat.\n\nLouis van Gaal spent \u00a3151.5m and \u00a3106.5m in successive summer windows and United only broke over the \u00a3150m limit in 2014 because of the Radamel Falcao loan payment. So, where permanent fees are concerned, they have not hit the \u00a3150m barrier. Pep Guardiola has expended more than \u00a3400m and wants two more recruits.\n\nUnited's last bid for Perisic was believed to be \u00a339million and their reluctance to improve on that might be simply because they have spent their budget. They could have \u00a39.3m left in the pot to spend and, to quote Sir Alex Ferguson, there is no value in the market with that amount. Tom Lawrence, who played only once for United, just joined Derby for a fee rising up to \u00a37m.\n\nMourinho wanted to sign an additional player a year ago in Jose Fonte but had to sell and there were no takers for Marcos Rojo, who proved his worth later on. Internazionale, maybe mindful of the 'limit', have baited United by insisting Anthony Martial be included in any deal for Perisic. United will not consider a swap.\n\nUnited have not raised much from player sales, either. Adnan Januzaj joined Real Sociedad for \u00a39.8m but Josh Harrop agreed to move to Preston for a compensation fee, United waived a transfer fee as Wayne Rooney returned to Everton and Ibrahimovic was also out of contract.\n\nIt is entirely possible United's fourth signing might already be at the club. When Paul Pogba was asked in Georgetown last month if he was relishing filling Ibrahimovic's void he was not about to barge the man he dubbed 'Thor' aside like the Hulk did. \"He's still a big leader because he's still in the team,\" Pogba clarified.\n\nThe feeling among United players and their manager is Ibrahimovic is neither gone, nor forgotten, despite his status as a free agent. He is continuing his rehabilitation in Manchester and when Mourinho spoke about United's four injured players last month he was possibly referring to Ibrahimovic rather than the short-term absentee Juan Mata, along with Rojo, Ashley Young and Luke Shaw.\n\nHe is 'Thor' to Pogba while others inside the United dressing room call Ibrahimovic 'God'. The self-appointed 'King of Football' is 'coming back', as a recent Instagram video teased, and he might be back in red.\n\nMourinho's rapport with Ibrahimovic could appease him if United do not add to their squad this month. It is only 17 weeks since Ibrahimovic landed awkwardly in front of the Stretford End and the hoisting a 12th career title in front of the stand would provide satisfactory closure.\n\n\"It was very clear by showing what he did, last year was not enough for him,\" Mourinho said on Friday. \"He wants more football at the highest level, so we are having conversations and discussing the possibility of him staying for the second part of the season.\"\n\nIbrahimovic is one man Mourinho will be patient with.\n\nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download it here

Ferguson still made 13 winter window additions after its inception in 2003 but his mood towards it was indifferent. \"We have bought in January in the past, we tried one bit of business but it didn't work,\" he once said. He was not referring to Wilfried Zaha.\n\nJose Mourinho is not as dismissive of the January window and wanted to recruit earlier this year. Atletico Madrid's Jose Gimenez and Victor Lindelof were both sounded out before United deemed both of them too exorbitant and, months earlier, Mourinho had shown interest in compatriot Jose Fonte but was informed United had to sell before they could buy. There were no takers for Marcos Rojo - who later impressed as the season went on.\n\nUnited find themselves in an identical situation to last year. They have spent just shy of \u00a3150million on three players and their manager is hankering for another, only he needs to sell first to buy later. Mourinho's demand is undermined by his squad size, which currently stands at 26 and is excessive, going off the Portuguese's past proclamations.\n\nMourinho might have wished the press box was locked up swiftly after full-time on Sunday. While the majority of journalists wondered what was taking him so long to arrive for his post-match briefing, others who had headed down to the mixed zone watched United's fringe players enjoy a six-a-side session presided over by their manager and Ed Woodward. Ashley Young was one of them and did not appear, as Mourinho suggested, scheduled to return in October.\n\nIt is understood Mourinho overstated the recovery dates of Young and Luke Shaw as he attempted to bring in reinforcements on United's left flank. Woodward, an ally of the Glazer family owners since his days at JP Morgan, is also delegated to protect the family's blue-chip investment. It perhaps explains why, as a United source put it, there have been 'no further developments' since Ivan Perisic boarded a plane to China almost a month ago.\n\nThere is an air of acceptance that United could end the transfer window with three summer signings, their lowest intake since 2013. United's new transfer scout Javier Ribalta was in the directors' box on Sunday, which fuelled excitement among some fans, and was spotted heading in the direction of Manchester Airport the following day. He was not accompanied by Perisic's agent.\n\nDuring Ferguson's last four years, the prospect of United spending a lavish fee on an undistinguished 28-year-old was unthinkable. Robin van Persie, 28 when he joined United, was a world-class exception who had also entered the last year of his contract and thrived for a Premier League rival over an eight-year period. Internazionale want more than double for Perisic what United paid for Van Persie.\n\nMourinho has prioritised reinforcing United's left flank by lobbying for Perisic and monitoring Danny Rose's situation at Tottenham. That argument was compromised by the sight of two left wingers in Young and Shaw participating in a practice match, while Marcos Rojo will provide an additional option upon his return from a knee injury.\n\nA senior United figure opined on the eve of the Europa League final the transfer window would be 'crazy' and United have not yielded as willingly as they two or three years ago. They were not led down the garden path by Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar could not entice them and it barely got touchy-feely between Mourinho and Gareth Bale.\n\n\"I understand the reality of the market,\" Mourinho acknowledged at Carrington on Friday. \"I understand the reality of the numbers, and I also understand that my club, by doing 75 per cent [signing three out of four players] of what I initially asked, I think the club did very well.\n\n\"So I don't think I am in a position of crying, of moaning, of protesting, I am not in a position to say I am not happy with... I will not moan.\" There is a hint of begrudging acquiescence.\n\nThis week, Scott McTominay and Demetri Mitchell were removed from the first-team squad section on the United website. The duo have dropped back down to the Under-23s and their demotions leave Mourinho with 26 players, three of whom are unavailable. It is maybe short-sighted to opt against another addition when a number of squad members have a history of injuries.\n\nThe timing of the McTominay and Mitchell alterations, while Mourinho is attempting to recruit a fourth player, is probably coincidental and United were rampant against West Ham on Sunday. The ruthless Romelu Lukaku could be an upgrade on Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but not every visiting side will take a knife to a gunfight and there is an over-reliance on Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba to offset the absence of a Griezmann.\n\nMaybe there really is no value in the market.\n\nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download it here now.", "id": "9615882", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Manchester United transfer plans are changing as deadline day looms", "image": "http://i4.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article13486134.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PicMonkey-Collage.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "86277", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neymar"}, "id": "302787", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar"}, {"label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}, "id": "303027", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}, "id": "303119", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}, "id": "304433", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}, "id": "304435", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}, "id": "305102", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "id": "305737", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}, "id": "306207", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Gareth Bale"}, "id": "306284", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Bale"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "id": "307959", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}, "id": "308110", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Southampton F.C."}, "id": "311377", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}, "id": "312748", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}, "id": "313859", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robin van Persie"}, "id": "323769", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_van_Persie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marcos Rojo"}, "id": "355137", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_Rojo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manchester Airport"}, "id": "442310", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Airport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107"}, "id": "492544", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Peri\u0161i\u0107"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ashley Young"}, "id": "516551", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Young"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wilfried Zaha"}, "id": "594254", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfried_Zaha"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glazer ownership of Manchester United"}, "id": "893117", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glazer_ownership_of_Manchester_United"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ed Woodward"}, "id": "1280456", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Woodward"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity"}], "time": "05:23:00"}

The Guadeloupe-born forward is capable of playing anywhere across the second line of attack, a tactically important area of Mourinho's teams.\n\nRecruiting for one of five positions prioritised by the Old Trafford manager this summer has proved particularly problematic. United unsuccessfully explored the possibility of exploiting Ronaldo's publicly-stated desire to leave Spain to bring the World Player of the Year back to Manchester, then found Bale resistant to Madrid's efforts to sell the Welshman.\n\nChelsea stonewalled Mourinho's attempts to bring his former player Willian north, refusing to allow the Brazil international to reunite with a coach he has repeatedly expressed an admiration for. \"There were a few conversations with my agent,\" said Willian earlier this month. \"I worked with Mourinho and I became his friend as well.\n\n\"He likes me a lot and I like him a lot as a coach and as a person. He has put his trust in me and in my work, and I was very grateful to him. Manchester came to me, they talked with my agent, but nothing happened because Chelsea would not negotiate me in any way and I'm very happy at Chelsea.\"\n\nAs first reported by The Daily Record , Mourinho would also like to strengthen the left side of his defence before the window closes. The Portuguese wants to sign a starting left back of Champions League quality and would consider selling England international Luke Shaw to fund a deal.", "id": "9695494", "details": {}, "date":

I'm talking about someone who can generally play left wide.\n\n\"If you could add one world-class winger to add to the squad you could say it was a complete squad.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Anthony Martial's United future may have just been revealed by the attacker's cousin on Twitter.\n\nWith considerable speculation surrounding the youngster's potential departure, Martial's cousin, Jema, took to Twitter to quash the rumours.\n\nThe tweet, which was subsequently deleted, read: \"For Manchester United, Anthony's departure is not a possibility, even on loan. They rely on him.\"\n\nLinked with a move to Inter Milan, and most recently Tottenham Hotspur, the 21-year old is looking increasingly likely to remain at the Red Devils this season.\n\nIn a blow for United, Ernesto Valverde has insisted that midfield target Sergi Roberto remains an integral member of his Barcelona squad.\n\nSpeaking to Mundo Deportivo, the Catalan boss maintained that the 25-year old had a significant role to play: \"Of course, I am absolutely counting on him [this season].\n\n\"In some games he will be a major player and in some games no, but he remains an important player.\"\n\nWith a \u00a336m release clause written into the Spaniard's contract, there is little Barcelona can do if United were to match the fee.\n\nHowever, with the manager confirming that Roberto has a place in the squad for the season ahead, the midfielder may still decide he wants to remain at the Nou Camp.\n\nIn a surprising update from the Daily Mail, the outlet claims that Cristiano Ronaldo believed his Real Madrid teammate Gareth Bale would be joining Manchester United this summer.\n\nWith speculation over the Welshman's future lasting what seems like all off-season, the 28-year-old is said to be determined to prove his worth at the Spanish giants, with Mourinho allegedly ready to bid if given any sign of encouragement.\n\nIn direct opposition to the mayhem that is expected to take place in the next two weeks, ESPN FC are suggesting that Mourinho is prepared to wait until the January window to make any further additions to his United squad; unwilling to part ways with fringe players in order to fund a move for a fourth summer signing.\n\nThe report claims the Portuguese manager would rather wait than upset the harmony within the squad as they look to make a strong start to the Premier League season.\n\nWith a number of squad members unlikely to get significant playing time this year, the January window may see significant change.", "id": "9598051",

A vote is set to be taken at the next Premier League shareholders' meeting on September 7.\n\nManchester United boss Jose Mourinho has called on his players to continue the good start\n\nAsked about making a fourth signing, Mourinho said: 'I don't think we are, unless something happens to put us in the market again. I told (executive vice-chairman) Mr (Ed) Woodward my plans were four, but I also told him be cool - no pressure from me, do what you think is best for the club.\n\n'We will be together again for anther transfer window in January and next summer so no pressure from me at all. I'm happy with the squad we have. I'm ready to go without the fourth player. If we are out of market, I'm fine, I'm ready.'\n\nThe transfer sagas surrounding Diego Costa, Danny Rose, Alexis Sanchez, Phillip Coutinho and Virgil van Dijk have overshadowed the start of the season at a number of English clubs. It has raised the issue of closing the transfer window before the season begins, and Mourinho agrees.\n\n'My opinion is we have to adapt to the situation, it doesn't matter what,' he added. 'But as a football manager and not a market man , just a football man just as somebody who wants to work with the team, work with the players, I would prefer the window to closer as soon as possible.\n\nMourinho is preparing his side to face Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday\n\n'So everybody knows the players we have and the deals will be done earlier and nobody would be waiting for the last week. We wouldn't have the situation of sometimes a player plays game No.1 for a team and game No.2 for another team.\n\n'And the question marks somebody puts, if other leagues don't close at the same time, are we in danger of losing players in the last couple of weeks? My question is how many clubs in the world are powerful enough buy the best players in the Premier League? The answer is I think is very obvious.\n\n'So the risk is minimal and even those powerful clubs have to know if we can't buy after, let's say 14th or 15th of August more or less, if we can't buy players we're not going to sell.\n\n'So if they are interested in players from the Premier League they also have to do it before the limit. So again, I repeat, I'm not a market man but as a football manager I would like it to close before the first match.\n\n'I had a meeting with a representative of the Premier League and gave my opinion, but in the end the clubs are going to vote. I think obviously the democratic way, the decision will be the decision that the majority of the clubs will support and vote.\n\nMourinho had four transfer targets this summer but he may have to settle for signing three\n\n'Of course I will meet with Mr Woodward because I know that he will want to share my opinion so I think very soon we are going to have a decision.'\n\nAsked if the situation is current situation disruptive, Mourinho replied: 'Not for me specifically, but you can imagine some managers don't have the same situation that I have.\n\n'My club did phenomenally well. I had four targets, we got three and got all of them before the first match of the season so my club did great work for us.\n\n'The players I have in the squad, nobody is in any doubt, we are very objective with them. We are very face to face. Players aren't in risk of maybe my manager on the last day of the market is going to say he doesn't want me.\n\n'Everybody knows the situation well. Even Timothy Fosu-Mensah, we wanted to do it (send him on loan to Crystal Palace), we accepted it before the first match of the season so we're in a stable situation.'", "id": "9895410", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho remaining calm on transfers", "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/18/13/435AC64800000578-0-image-a-122_1503059863595.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 2697, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2711}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 764, "date": "2017-09-07", "amb": false, "textEnd": 775}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "id": "302552", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}, "id": "303119", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}, "id": "304433", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}, "id": "304435", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Rose"}, "id": "304660", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "id": "305737", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}, "id": "306183", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Real Madrid C.F."}, "id": "306281", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F."}, {"label": {"eng": "Gareth Bale"}, "id": "306284", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Bale"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "id": "307959", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romelu Lukaku"}, "id": "311381", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romelu_Lukaku"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diego Costa"}, "id": "313877", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Costa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Swansea City A.F.C."}, "id": "317224", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_City_A.F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Alexis S\u00e1nchez"}, "id": "319722", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_S\u00e1nchez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liberty Stadium"}, "id": "361333", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Stadium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stamen"}, "id": "397436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}, "id": "460422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107"}, "id": "492544", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Peri\u0161i\u0107"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 539, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 597, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 673, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 822, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "time": "12:47:00"}

Swedish international defender Victor Lindelof was the first arrival at Old Trafford before striker Romelu Lukaku and midfielder Nemanja Matic moved to United from Everton and Chelsea, respectively.\n\nJose Mourinho has publicly expressed his desire to complete four signings this summer as he looks to bring in an attacking player to the club before the transfer deadline. According to the Mirror, United have still not given up on bringing Perisic to Old Trafford as they look to further strengthen the squad for the 2017/18 season.\n\nInter slapped a \u00a348m ($62m) asking price for the Croatian international and United were unwilling to meet the Serie A outfit's demands. Failure from the Premier League giants to convince the Nerazzurri to lower the asking price has seen the winger still continue at San Siro.\n\nApart from United, even Chelsea are also in the race to Inter star. Antonio Conte has identified the former Wolfsburg man as a transfer target as the Blues will be looking to challenge Mourinho's side for Perisic.\n\nThe Old Trafford club are keen on securing the player's signature before the end of the summer transfer window. United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has held talks with Perisic's agent, Fali Ramadani, in recent days.\n\nRamadani has held talks with Inter officials as he is trying to convince them to sanction his client's sale, which would allow the 28-year-old to join United this summer. The Red Devils offer of \u00a339m ($50.2m) bid is still on the table and is now to see if the Italian outfit will accept the English club's offer.\n\nMeanwhile, Inter chairman Erick Thohir expects Perisic to continue with his current employers, despite interest from United and Chelsea.

The Guadeloupe-born forward is capable of playing anywhere across the second line of attack, a tactically important area of Mourinho's teams.\n\nRecruiting for one of five positions prioritised by the Old Trafford manager this summer has proved particularly problematic. United unsuccessfully explored the possibility of exploiting Ronaldo's publicly-stated desire to leave Spain to bring the World Player of the Year back to Manchester, then found Bale resistant to Madrid's efforts to sell the Welshman.\n\nChelsea stonewalled Mourinho's attempts to bring his former player Willian north, refusing to allow the Brazil international to reunite with a coach he has repeatedly expressed an admiration for. \"There were a few conversations with my agent,\" said Willian earlier this month. \"I worked with Mourinho and I became his friend as well.\n\nRead More Football transfer news 2017\n\n\"He likes me a lot and I like him a lot as a coach and as a person. He has put his trust in me and in my work, and I was very grateful to him. Manchester came to me, they talked with my agent, but nothing happened because Chelsea would not negotiate me in any way and I'm very happy at Chelsea.\"\n\nAs first reported by The Daily Record , Mourinho would also like to strengthen the left side of his defence before the window closes.

The Guadeloupe-born forward is capable of playing anywhere across the second line of attack, a tactically important area of Mourinho's teams.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now\n\nRecruiting for one of five positions prioritised by the Old Trafford manager this summer has proved particularly problematic. United unsuccessfully explored the possibility of exploiting Ronaldo's publicly-stated desire to leave Spain to bring the World Player of the Year back to Manchester, then found Bale resistant to Madrid 's efforts to sell the Welshman.\n\nChelsea stonewalled Mourinho's attempts to bring his former player Willian north, refusing to allow the Brazil international to reunite with a coach he has repeatedly expressed an admiration for. \"There were a few conversations with my agent,\" said Willian earlier this month. \"I worked with Mourinho and I became his friend as well.\n\n\"He likes me a lot and I like him a lot as a coach and as a person. He has put his trust in me and in my work, and I was very grateful to him. Manchester came to me, they talked with my agent, but nothing happened because Chelsea would not negotiate me in any way and I'm very happy at Chelsea.\"\n\nAs first reported by The Daily Record , Mourinho would also like to strengthen the left side of his defence before the window closes. The Portuguese wants to sign a starting left back of Champions League quality and would consider selling England international Luke Shaw to fund a deal.\n\npoll loading Will Manchester United sign

he is happy that '75%' of his transfer business has been completed this summer but he would ideally like to bring Perisic in in the next fortnight.\n\nThe Mirror claim United are still working hard on the transfer and Woodward met with Perisic's agent Fali Ramadani this week to go over details.\n\nRamadani is then believed to have met with Inter Milan officials after the meeting to communicate

It made me feel great and I am grateful for that.\"\n\nWhen Porto winger Cesar Peixoto suffered a serious knee injury in 2003, Jose Mourinho did everything he could to keep his spirits up throughout his recovery.\n\nBut something changed when he arrived in England a year later.\n\nHaving grown up watching Liverpool games on television in Portugal, Mourinho adopted the macho attitude of a bygone era when it came to injuries.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of managerial greats like Bill Shankly and Brian Clough, Mourinho generally avoided his players if they were on the treatment table.\n\nWith Chelsea skipper John Terry, for example, he would blank him if he even missed a day's training; all the while, Mourinho would be in regular contact with the club's physio to gauge his progress.\n\nTerry's commitment, on the field at least, has never been in question and that cold shoulder pushed him to get back into his manager's plans.\n\nHaving surrounded himself with warriors and monsters down through the years, Mourinho demands his squad leave blood on the field.\n\nBut when a player does suffer a serious injury, such as Petr Cech's fractured skull in 2006, the father-of-two has been visibly moved and concerned for the player's welfare.\n\nThat is why he was keen for Zlatan Ibrahimovic to be involved in last season's Europa League celebrations and why he took Luke Shaw, Ashley Young and Marcos Rojo on tour.\n\nThe grey area is when players are entering the final stages of their recovery or suffer knocks in the run up to a game.\n\nAhead of last season's visit to Swansea, Chris Smalling still did not feel 100% after injuring his foot against Chelsea two weeks' previously.\n\nMeanwhile, his international team-mate, Shaw, fresh from a leg break, ruled himself out on the morning of the game after playing the full 90 minutes against Fenerbahce just three days' previously.\n\nMourinho was aghast and, 13 games into his tenure, questioned the pair's commitment in his post-match press conference in the bowels of the Liberty Stadium.\n\nIt went straight to heart of the most sacred aspect of man management - trusting your players to manage their own bodies and know when they are fit to return.\n\nBut Mourinho's combative, and risky, approach eventually paid off.\n\nShaw went on to play with cramp against Anderlecht in the Europa League quarter-final while Smalling and Phil Jones made remarkable recoveries ahead of the semi-final against Celta Vigo.\n\nThe result? They finally earned Mourinho's trust.\n\nUltimately, the Portuguese has rarely had such a close, tight-knit squad all pulling in the same direction as he looks forward to his favoured second season.\n\nThis summer, Mourinho has repeatedly gushed about this group being the most hard-working one he has ever worked with despite not having the stardust of some of his previous clubs.\n\nWhile Mourinho has quickly had to adjust to coaching more fragile millennials, the 54-year-old has been given a new lease of life by Jesse Lingard's wisecracks and Marcus Rashford's attitude to training.\n\nPerhaps, team spirit has never been higher since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement and Mourinho would loathe to lose any of his 'boys' ahead of the transfer window closing.\n\nEven though there is plenty of depth in this squad - new signing Victor Lindelof and skipper Michael Carrick failed to even make the bench against West Ham - the challenge now is ensuring the club are not crippled by an injury crisis like last season.\n\nMourinho will hope his 'less is more' approach to training will finally allow him to pick his favoured starting XI at the business end of the season as he did at Porto, Inter, Chelsea and Real Madrid.\n\nBut one thing is for sure: he now has a squad who are willing to run through walls for him.\n\nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download it here now.", "id": "9876068", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Man Utd have bought into Jose Mourinho's vision since last visit to Swansea", "image": "http://i1.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article13494878.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/download.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Portuguese Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "184", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "label": {"eng": "Portuguese Republic"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Swansea"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "83404", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea", "label": {"eng": "Swansea"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "86277", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}, "id": "303026", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}, "id": "303027", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Generation Y"}, "id": "304390", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}, "id": "304433", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}, "id": "304434", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}, "id": "304435", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "id": "305737", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107"}, "id": "306182", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlatan_Ibrahimovi\u0107"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jesse Lingard"}, "id": "306572", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Lingard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "id": "307959", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}, "id": "308110", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson"}, {"label": {"eng": "F.C.

And who might that be? Well, that's just the point. The Express doesn't say who Mourinho has in mind, only that Shaw could be on his way to Tottenham as they search for someone to fill the shoes of Danny Rose, widely expected to sign for Manchester City before the month is out.\n\nFinally, Metro returns to an old favourite at Transfer Talk - David de Gea.

The Neymar transfer from Barcelona to PSG for nearly 200 million has sent the transfer market spiraling out of control.\n\nPlayers valuations have gone through the roof and now clubs are wanting 50 million pounds or more for their star players. So far the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, Everton have spent staggering amounts and they have not stopped spending yet.\n\nDanny Rose recently put himself in the shop window by discussing his dissatisfaction with his pay and stating he would love to move back up north in a recent interview. The player was fined two weeks wages by his club and it has led to speculation that he will be sold before the window closes. With the defender hoping to move back to northern England, the obvious clubs that he wants to move to are both Manchester clubs. Manchester City has already done business with Spurs this summer as they signed Kyle Walker for 50 million. Walker trembled his salary by joining City which has unsettled Rose who feels he should be on a similar amount.\n\nTottenham have already made one bid for Martial which was rejected by United. It is believed that Spurs are putting together a second offer for the French International. With Man U looking for a left wing back Tottenham could use Rose as part of a deal to tempt United into selling. Levy values Rose at around 50 million which is the amount they were able to get from City for Walker.\n\nSince Jose Mourinho arrives at Old Trafford Martial has dropped down the pecking order. With the recent signing of Lukaku and Ibrahimovic signing an extension the 21-year-old is not going to get much game time this season. It has led to the forward been unsettled and is vying for a move away.\n\nIn the Red Devils opening match of the season, Martial came on as a substitute and scored in their 4-0 thrashing over the Hammers. He has made 57 EPL appearances and managed to find the back of the net 16 times. It is believed that when United was trying to sign Ivan Perisic from Inter Milan the Italian clubs were wanting Martial to be included in the deal Mourinho would not sanction this though and wants to keep the Frenchman at the club.\n\nThere are a number of key players injured at United so Mourinho wants to be certain he has a squad capable of dealing with any injuries. With the Red Devils having lots of options up front and them in the market for a new left-wing back a swoop deal for Rose could be an ideal situation for both clubs. Spurs are desperate to find a high quality back up striker to Harry Kane and Martial is ideal for that role.

The popular actor, best known for his role as hard-living gangster Arthur Shelby Jr in the BBC drama, looked smart in a two-piece suit while calling into a local Tesco Express. Anderson, 46, rounded of the look with a white statement T-shirt and black Chelsea boots, while red tinted sunglasses served as his only notable accessory. The actor's latest public appearance was in stark contrast to his last, during which he looked pale, gaunt and disheveled while walking the streets close to his \u00a31.2million mews home. It comes just months after he was caught with crack cocaine after a day in the pub. He was also found to have amphetamines, plus diazepam and pregabalin on him. One local shopkeeper, who counts Anderson as a friend, told MailOnline: 'It's heartbreaking. He's a mess. But his erratic behaviour is causing real problems. He often seems dazed and not with it. 'He's had arguments with people locally. He walks around making a lot of noise. We are all very worried. He had a big argument in Tesco a few weeks ago. 'He is living like he is on another planet. He's been in public topless. He struggles to walk. It's a great concern. He looks out of control. It's tragic.' Another said: 'He has been slowly looking worse over the months. He really stands out in the area. It's awful.' Despite concerns for his health, Anderson appeared to be in good spirits as he called into a local shop, a protective leopard print face-mask pulled beneath his chin. He later emerged carrying a bag of shopping, looking notably smarter as he made his way back to his London property. Real fears for his health has led to speculation that a much-anticipated return to playing Arthur Shelby could be under threat. He looked thin and frail in February, just days after his co-star Cillian Murphy finally confirmed he would be willing to play Tommy Shelby in a Peaky Blinders movie. Filming is due to begin in September - but there is not confirmation that Anderson will be there. His own rags to riches tale is so extraordinary it could be from the pages of a Hollywood script. The South Londoner, who is nicknamed Boycie like the wheeler dealer friend of Del Boy from Only Fools and Horses, had been making ends meet on the very edge of the law when he got his break around 15 years ago. After leaving school at 14, Anderson wanted to be a lead singer in a band and made money working as a tout, which is illegal in the UK. But a chance meeting with a film director outside Stamford Bridge where he was selling tickets for Chelsea versus Barcelona led to a big part in cult movie The Firm after the director said he found his touting 'exotic' and loved his rasping accent. Fame and fortune followed, including a decade on Peaky Blinders and parts in Hollywood blockbusters including The Revenant with Leodardo DiCaprio and his close friend Tom Hardy, he he calls his 'brother'. Anderson lives in a \u00a31.2million property in north London and is believed to be single. He has previously been linked to a jewellery designer Stephy Clark but their relationship status was never made public. In January it emerged that Anderson was arrested after a drinker at his local in Hampstead told the pub's manager he there was a smell of drug fumes coming from the disabled toilet after the actor walked out on Boxing Day. The actor was carrying a crack pipe but denied he was using it. He would play a pivotal role in any Peaky Blinders film if involved, but his drug conviction in January and allegations of bad behaviour on set could threaten his participation. Yet despite his frailty, there are signs that he hasn't given up hope of reprising the role that made his name, with the actor responding to support from his Instagram followers. One commented on a post: 'By order of The Peaky Blinders', to which Anderson replied: 'Forever'.", "summary": "Peaky Blinders star Paul Anderson appeared to be back on form as he ventured out in London on Wednesday, shortly after prompting fears for his well-being during an earlier appearance in the city.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13471827/Paul-Anderson-pulls-smart-suit-shopping-trip-troubled-star-allays-fears-pictured-walking-streets-topless-months-starting-work-Peaky-Blinder-film.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/29/13/85467181-0-image-m-10_1716986410094.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2022/08/16/7828228737288325951/1024x576_MP4_7828228737288325951.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:51:08", "author": "Editor,Jason Chester,Martin Robinson", "authors": ["Editor", "Jason Chester", "Martin Robinson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.078}

Before heading out on loan to the Owls, Vernancio recently signed a 3 year deal to keep him with Wednesday, but the website says that is a loan with an option to purchase. He has played over 100 games for Vitoria.\n\nThe 24-year-old, standing at 6ft1, is the captain of the side, and has been since he was 22. The defender has risen through the academy of the Portuguese side. He has 8 appearances for the U20s national side, and 2 appearances for the U21 equivalent.\n\nVernancio told the club's official website: 'I thank the leaders of Vitoria FC for having understood how important it was for me to embrace this new challenge,'\n\n'Vitoria is in my heart, it's part of me. So I did not hesitate to renew my contract for another three years.\" Venancio said.\n\n'I'm going to England, but I'm going to have the club and my teammates always in my thoughts.'\n\nIn the past, he has been of the interest of Olympiakos, Leeds, Reading, Fulham\u00e2\u0080\u015a so he's not a complete mug, I guess. Wednesday desperately needed a centre-half (although, they probably need two), so we can't complain. He seems to have a good pedigree - so let's see if he can form that partnership with Tom Lees that we all wish to see!\n\nAre you happy with the signing of Vernancio?

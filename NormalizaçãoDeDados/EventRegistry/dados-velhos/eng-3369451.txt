Barrett, seven players are in their fifth year of eligibility in Columbus, meaning each had a redshirt year. Not only are all at the top of the Buckeyes' depth chart, they're among the best players in college football.\n\nThat doesn't happen often at a big-time football program that churns our early departing stars for the NFL.\n\nBarrett, who is 26-4 as a starter and the first three-time captain in Ohio State history, might not even be the best of them. That's defensive end Tyquan Lewis, the reigning Big Ten defensive player of the year. He'll be a top NFL prospect.\n\nThe fifth-year guys also include starting tight end Marcus Baugh, the team's top returning receiver; center Billy Price, who has started 41 consecutive games on the offensive line; defensive tackles Tracy Sprinkle and Michael Hill; and Chris Worley, who will start at linebacker for the second straight year.\n\n\"You've got some guys that are battle-tested,\" said Worley, who's on the watch list for the Butkus Award, given to the nation's best linebacker. \"Every team goes through the tough times, the hard game and you have guys who have been through it, so that's always a plus.\"\n\nCoach Urban Meyer said while he can never plan to have so many elite guys sticking around, it's a great situation.\n\n\"You can't put a price tag on that,\" he said. \"I saw that developing throughout the offseason. It's unusual. I don't think we've ever had that. You'd have to go back some years, because we usually don't redshirt guys with intent that they'll be here in five years nowadays.\"\n\nHOLES AT CORNERBACK\n\nCornerbacks coach Kerry Coombs said he'll likely use a regular rotation of three players at cornerback this season - Damon Arnette, Denzel Ward and Kendall Sheffield.\n\nCoombs has the difficult task of trying to plug the holes left by last year's departing starters Marshon Lattimore and Gareon Conley, both of whom were NFL draft picks.\n\nWard was the third man in the rotation last year and finished with 23 total tackles, nine passes defended and nine pass break-ups. Arnette played in every game is ready for prime time, according to Coombs. Sheffield is a former five-star recruit and junior college transfer who enrolled in the spring.\n\nOthers, including true freshmen Jeffrey Okudah, Shaun Wade and Marcus Williamson, also could see playing time at corner.\n\nBLACK STRIPES GONE\n\nMore freshmen have lost the black stripes on their helmets, meaning they have done enough to be considered full-fledged members of the team. It also means they have a good chance of playing this season instead of sitting for a redshirt year.\n\nSheffield, Okudah, defensive tackle Haskell Garrett, defensive end Chase Young, running back J.K. Dobbins, safety Isaiah Pryor, offensive lineman Thayer Munford and linebacker Pete Werner all have been stripped of their rookie stripes since the beginning of camp.\n\nDUCATS IN DEMAND\n\nOhio Stadium sells out for most home football games, but the Buckeyes aren't No. 1 in current ticket demand on the resale market. That distinction belongs to rival Michigan.\n\nThat's according to ticket-reseller StubHub, which in terms of current ticket demand ranked Ohio State fifth behind Michigan, Notre Dame, Alabama and Penn State.\n\nIt's not a scientific study of fandom, of course, just a snapshot of ticket sales on the website through Aug. 7.\n\nThe most in-demand game, according to StubHub, is the Florida State-Alabama contest on Sept. 2.

Not a jerk. Not close to that. Fervent. Steadfast. Passionate. And when it comes to the Ohio State cornerbacks in recent years, Coombs is almost always right.\n\nSo here's the question, and the looming obvious answer from the coach with belief in his heart and proof on his side.\n\nHow can the Buckeyes lose their top two corners to the No. 11 and No. 24 spots in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft and not be worse at that position?\n\nHere's the thing. Those two players - No. 11 pick Marshon Lattimore and No. 24 pick Gareon Conley - were not those players this time last year. Conley almost was. You could see him coming - like Denzel Ward now. He had played and been good, and you thought maybe he'd be great. Like Ward.\n\nLattimore was an elite athlete who hadn't shown it at Ohio State. Like Kendall Sheffield or Damon Arnette right now. Given a chance, Lattimore looked like a star by week two. That could happen again this year.\n\nSay it won't happen, as we have at cleveland.com, and the point makes sense. Two of the top four cornerback draft picks in 2017 came from Ohio State. How can you replicate that?\n\nSay it will happen, and you'll be on the side of the corners coach with four first-round picks in the last four years. You'll be on the side of the assistant who may have changed the position in a way that not even Urban Meyer would have believed with the plan he developed to bring a true three-man rotation to those two corner spots.\n\nDoubt Coombs. Go ahead. (OK, I did.) You'll tick him off a bit. And you'll probably be wrong.\n\n* Coombs explains connection between past and present OSU CBs\n\n\"You guys never believe me,\" Coombs said after practice Wednesday, as I began a question aimed at finding out how the Buckeyes could lose so much at a position and still expect to be so good.\n\n\"I find it insulting,\" Coombs said. \"Not to me personally. But to the unit. I have people all the time that ask me, 'Well, how are you going to replace those guys?'\"\n\nHow? He pointed out Ward played in a rotation with Lattimore and Conley last year.\n\n\"You would never take first-rounders off the field,\" Coombs said, \"if the guy coming in wasn't as good. So, to me that's what we do.\"\n\nWatch the video at the top to get the full Coombs effect.\n\nKnow this. He said he'd rotate the corners last year, and he did, and it worked.\n\nKnow this. Ward is projected as a first-rounder in the earliest of early mock drafts. Sheffield, a former five-star recruit, is two inches taller than the 5-foot-10 Ward and nearly as fast.\n\nIt's hard to believe Ward-Sheffield-Arnette could match what Conley-Lattimore-Ward did a year ago.\n\nBut Coombs believes they can. Watch the video. Check the history.\n\nDoubt him at your own risk.\n\n\"They're great football players,\" Coombs said. \"August 31st is coming.

Credit: Colin Hass-Hill | Sports Editor.\n\nIt's rare for a team to have a first-round cornerback. It's close to improbable for a team to have two first-round cornerbacks in the same draft, and it's even more difficult to replace those lost to the NFL. This is Ohio State's reality, but the difficulty of the situation seems to be missing.\n\nWithout Marshon Lattimore and Gareon Conley patrolling the defensive backfield, there should be an adjustment period. But, that doesn't seem to be the case with junior cornerbacks Denzel Ward, redshirt sophomore Damon Arnette and redshirt sophomore Kendall Sheffield -- the cornerbacks tasked with shadowing receivers for the defense in 2017.\n\nWard was the third man in the rotation last season for Ohio State, behind first-rounders Lattimore and Conley, who are now with the New Orleans Saints and Oakland Raiders, respectively. With those two gone, Ward will inherit the top corner spot and attempt to extend the line of succession of Ohio State cornerbacks to the NFL.\n\nUnlike most No. 3 corners on college rosters, Ward has ample experience after just one season in cornerbacks coach and assistant defensive coordinator Kerry Coombs' rotation, having played the same number of snaps as Lattimore and Conley. Ward was also tied for the team lead in pass breakups (nine) with Lattimore.\n\n\"You would never take two first-rounders off the field if the guy coming off the bench wasn't just as good,\" Coombs said Wednesday. \"To me, that's what we do.\"\n\nAs the rotation stands right now, Coombs and Arnette both said that Ward and Arnette are practicing with the starters and Arnette slides inside to the nickel in three-receiver sets while Sheffield handles the other outside corner position opposite Ward.\n\nArnette filled the nickel corner spot for much of last year, struggling at times but showcasing his speed and potential to be a future starter on other occasions. Ward has risen as the leader of the unit, but Arnette, who admitted to being nervous in game situations last year and wanting to play like Lattimore and Conley rather than playing his game, is on the road toward maturing as a corner at Ohio State.\n\n\"Damon's always had really good physical skills and he's always been a little bit lacking from the maturity standpoint and that's just a grown man conversation that we've had over and over and over again,\" Coombs said. \"He'll still make some of those mistakes that come from momentary lack of focus. But I'm telling you right now, he's a football player. And he's a Buck. You're going to go get in a fight, you're going to take Damon with you.\"\n\nSheffield arrived at Ohio State for spring practice, transferring from Blinn College in Brenham, Texas. The former five-star recruit who spent a season at Alabama as a redshirt has been mentioned as one of the fastest on the team, along with Ward, and might possibly be the final fixture in another dominant unit.\n\n\"Have you seen (Sheffield)? He looks like an action figure,\" Arnette said. \"He's fast, he's athletic, he's a great corner. He's just exactly what we need for that rotation.\"\n\nOhio State's 2016 secondary finished the season as one of the best units in the country, which had much to do with Lattimore and Conley who combined for eight of the team's 21 interceptions. Lattimore had one of the Buckeyes' NCAA-leading seven defensive touchdowns. Yet, similar questions regarding the relatively unproven cornerbacks existed at this time last year.\n\nIs Ward ready to take the jump to No. 1 corner? Can Arnette become a consistent player and stay healthy at the No. 2? Does Ohio State have the right player to fill in at corner when one of the top two need a breather?\n\nFrom what Ward, Arnette and Coombs all said, they would check the box that says 'yes.'", "id":

Barrett, seven players are in their fifth year of eligibility in Columbus, meaning each had a redshirt year. Not only are all at the top of the Buckeyes' depth chart, they're among the best players in college football.\n\nThat doesn't happen often at a big-time football program that churns our early departing stars for the NFL.\n\nBarrett, who is 26-4 as a starter and the first three-time captain in Ohio State history, might not even be the best of them. That's defensive end Tyquan Lewis, the reigning Big Ten defensive player of the year. He'll be a top NFL prospect.\n\nThe fifth-year guys also include starting tight end Marcus Baugh, the team's top returning receiver; center Billy Price, who has started 41 consecutive games on the offensive line; defensive tackles Tracy Sprinkle and Michael Hill; and Chris Worley, who will start at linebacker for the second straight year.\n\n\"You've got some guys that are battle-tested,\" said Worley, who's on the watch list for the Butkus Award, given to the nation's best linebacker. \"Every team goes through the tough times, the hard game and you have guys who have been through it, so that's always a plus.\"\n\nCoach Urban Meyer said while he can never plan to have so many elite guys sticking around, it's a great situation.\n\n\"You can't put a price tag on that,\" he said. \"I saw that developing throughout the offseason. It's unusual. I don't think we've ever had that. You'd have to go back some years, because we usually don't redshirt guys with intent that they'll be here in five years nowadays.\"\n\nHOLES AT CORNERBACK\n\nCornerbacks coach Kerry Coombs said he'll likely use a regular rotation of three players at cornerback this season - Damon Arnette, Denzel Ward and Kendall Sheffield.\n\nCoombs has the difficult task of trying to plug the holes left by last year's departing starters Marshon Lattimore and Gareon Conley, both of whom were NFL draft picks.\n\nWard was the third man in the rotation last year and finished with 23 total tackles, nine passes defended and nine pass break-ups. Arnette played in every game is ready for prime time, according to Coombs. Sheffield is a former five-star recruit and junior college transfer who enrolled in the spring.\n\nOthers, including true freshmen Jeffrey Okudah, Shaun Wade and Marcus Williamson, also could see playing time at corner.\n\nBLACK STRIPES GONE\n\nMore freshmen have lost the black stripes on their helmets, meaning they have done enough to be considered full-fledged members of the team. It also means they have a good chance of playing this season instead of sitting for a redshirt year.\n\nSheffield, Okudah, defensive tackle Haskell Garrett, defensive end Chase Young, running back J.K. Dobbins, safety Isaiah Pryor, offensive lineman Thayer Munford and linebacker Pete Werner all have been stripped of their rookie stripes since the beginning of camp.\n\nDUCATS IN DEMAND\n\nOhio Stadium sells out for most home football games, but the Buckeyes aren't No. 1 in current ticket demand on the resale market. That distinction belongs to rival Michigan.\n\nThat's according to ticket-reseller StubHub, which in terms of current ticket demand ranked Ohio State fifth behind Michigan, Notre Dame, Alabama and Penn State.\n\nIt's not a scientific study of fandom, of course, just a snapshot of ticket sales on the website through Aug. 7.\n\nThe most in-demand game, according to StubHub, is the Florida State-Alabama contest on Sept. 2.

Coombs believes Arnette will bring those same qualities to this year's Ohio State secondary.\n\n\"He has got charisma, he has got juice,\" Coombs said of Arnette. \"I love that about him. Every day I've got to pull him back, and he will still make some of those mistakes that come from momentary lack of focus, but I am telling you right now, he is a football player. And he's a Buckeye. If you're going to go get in a fight, you're going to take Damon with you.\"\n\nArnette played in all 13 of Ohio State's games last season and played 181 snaps on defense, primarily at the nickel back position, but his playing time dwindled after some early-season struggles, most notably against Oklahoma when he was beaten in one-on-one coverage for a 35-yard touchdown.\n\nThis year, however, Arnette is in line to be part of Ohio State's main three-man rotation at the cornerback position, along with junior Denzel Ward and junior college transfer Kendall Sheffield. While Arnette is competing with Sheffield to start opposite Ward as an outside cornerback, he says he continues to work inside as the slot cornerback when all three are on the field in nickel packages.\n\nArnette acknowledges he didn't play as well as he needed to when he got opportunities to play last year. He says he tried too hard to be like last year's starting cornerbacks, Marshon Lattimore and Gareon Conley, instead of playing within himself. Arnette is confident, though, that he's gotten better in preparation for this season.\n\n\"I gave up some catches that I wasn't supposed to give up (last year), and then I lost the spot. And that's just how it is,\" Arnette said. \"So coming back for this camp, I just know that I've just got to be on top of my stuff to make the team better, 'cause last year I feel like if they kept me in, the team would have suffered.\"\n\nWhile Arnette is currently in line for a prominent role in Ohio State's secondary, he knows he must continue to prove he deserves it, as he has four true freshman cornerbacks behind him - including a pair of five-star recruits in Jeffrey Okudah and Shaun Wade - who are pushing for playing time.\n\nArnette also feels he has a responsibility to set a positive example for the freshman cornerbacks.\n\n\"With all the younger dudes that came in, I just feel like that I have to play well for them to be good for them and be better for the team,\" Arnette said. \"I didn't have Okudah or Marcus (Williamson), Amir (Riep) and Shaun last year. I was the younger dude last year, and I was looking up to Marshon and Gareon. So maybe just having, knowing that some people are looking up to you, that just drives me and makes me want to become a better player for them.\"\n\nWhile Arnette was only a three-star recruit out of St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Coombs says Arnette \"has always had really good physical skills\" but \"has always been a little bit lacking from a maturity standpoint.\" The difference in Arnette this year, that has put him in position to be a starter, is that he has grown up.\n\n\"I'm not the same person,\" Arnette said. \"It took growing up to do. I feel like when it comes to football, I have a better understanding of everything. From what Coach Coombs teaches me and from what Denzel teaches me and the conversations that I've had with Marshon, Gareon and Eli (Apple, former Ohio State cornerback), they motivate me to become a better person.\"\n\n\"He will remind you of Bradley Roby when he is on the field with his swagger and the way he plays.\"- Kerry Coombs\n\nCoombs admits he doesn't love the \"swagger nonsense\" and \"trash talk stuff\" that Roby once brought to Ohio State and Arnette brings now. Coombs hasn't tried to take that quality away from Arnette, however, because he believes it's part of what makes him successful.\n\n\"I don't want him to not be himself,\" Coombs said. \"This is a position that has to be played with great confidence. You are out there on an island, and you got to cover that guy and you are all alone, so you better believe in yourself. And I absolutely want all of my guys to do that.\"\n\n\"I think Damon would be that way if he was going to work at IBM,\" Coombs added. \"He would walk in and tell them all, 'Hey, I'm the best computer programmer in the room.' And everybody would be OK with that, for awhile, and then they would tell him to shut up and they would go about their business, which is what we do. But he is an engaging personality, he makes the room fun.\"", "id": "9574472", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Damon Arnette Bringing Swagger to Ohio State's Cornerback Rotation", "image": "https://www.elevenwarriors.com/sites/default/files/c/2017/08/84275_h.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "84180", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "181663", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "219910", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "id": "302552", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"}, {"label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "id": "302611", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "id": "304975", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Freshman"}, "id": "305440", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "308787", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University", "label": {"eng": "Ohio State University"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Redshirt (college sports)"}, "id": "310751", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(college_sports)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}, "id": "324178", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}, "id": "324179", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football"}, {"label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}, "id": "331554", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Junior college"}, "id": "362028", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_college"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nickelback (American football)"}, "id": "362442", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelback_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nickel defense"}, "id": "403626", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_defense"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bradley Roby"}, "id": "407434", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Roby"}, {"label": {"eng": "St. Thomas Aquinas High School (Florida)"}, "id": "1330625", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Thomas_Aquinas_High_School_(Florida)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}], "time": "22:20:00"}

Barrett, seven players are in their fifth year of eligibility in Columbus, meaning each had a redshirt year. Not only are all at the top of the Buckeyes' depth chart, they're among the best players in college football.\n\nThat doesn't happen often at a big-time football program that churns our early departing stars for the NFL.\n\nBarrett, who is 26-4 as a starter and the first three-time captain in Ohio State history, might not even be the best of them. That's defensive end Tyquan Lewis, the reigning Big Ten defensive player of the year. He'll be a top NFL prospect.\n\nThe fifth-year guys also include starting tight end Marcus Baugh, the team's top returning receiver; center Billy Price, who has started 41 consecutive games on the offensive line; defensive tackles Tracy Sprinkle and Michael Hill; and Chris Worley, who will start at linebacker for the second straight year.\n\n\"You've got some guys that are battle-tested,\" said Worley, who's on the watch list for the Butkus Award, given to the nation's best linebacker. \"Every team goes through the tough times, the hard game and you have guys who have been through it, so that's always a plus.\"\n\nCoach Urban Meyer said while he can never plan to have so many elite guys sticking around, it's a great situation.\n\n\"You can't put a price tag on that,\" he said. \"I saw that developing throughout the offseason. It's unusual. I don't think we've ever had that. You'd have to go back some years, because we usually don't redshirt guys with intent that they'll be here in five years nowadays.\"\n\nHOLES AT CORNERBACK\n\nCornerbacks coach Kerry Coombs said he'll likely use a regular rotation of three players at cornerback this season - Damon Arnette, Denzel Ward and Kendall Sheffield.\n\nCoombs has the difficult task of trying to plug the holes left by last year's departing starters Marshon Lattimore and Gareon Conley, both of whom were NFL draft picks.\n\nWard was the third man in the rotation last year and finished with 23 total tackles, nine passes defended and nine pass break-ups. Arnette played in every game is ready for prime time, according to Coombs. Sheffield is a former five-star recruit and junior college transfer who enrolled in the spring.\n\nOthers, including true freshmen Jeffrey Okudah, Shaun Wade and Marcus Williamson, also could see playing time at corner.\n\nBLACK STRIPES GONE\n\nMore freshmen have lost the black stripes on their helmets, meaning they have done enough to be considered full-fledged members of the team. It also means they have a good chance of playing this season instead of sitting for a redshirt year.\n\nSheffield, Okudah, defensive tackle Haskell Garrett, defensive end Chase Young, running back J.K. Dobbins, safety Isaiah Pryor, offensive lineman Thayer Munford and linebacker Pete Werner all have been stripped of their rookie stripes since the beginning of camp.\n\nDUCATS IN DEMAND\n\nOhio Stadium sells out for most home football games, but the Buckeyes aren't No. 1 in current ticket demand on the resale market. That distinction belongs to rival Michigan.\n\nThat's according to ticket-reseller StubHub, which in terms of current ticket demand ranked Ohio State fifth behind Michigan, Notre Dame, Alabama and Penn State.\n\nIt's not a scientific study of fandom, of course, just a snapshot of ticket sales on the website through Aug. 7.\n\nThe most in-demand game, according to StubHub, is the Florida State-Alabama contest on Sept. 2. The Michigan-Florida clash that day is No. 2.\n\nThe Ohio State-Michigan game on Nov. 5 ranked fifth.\n\n--\n\nMore AP college football at www.collegefootball.ap.org and

Miller, who catches a slant, slips a poor attempt at a tackle from Arnette and scores a 35-yard touchdown.\n\nThat was when Arnette was as much a part of the cornerback rotation with Marshon Lattimore and Gareon Conley as Denzel Ward was. Ward was the third corner, but Arnette the nickel who would be on the field a lot. That setup didn't last long as Arnette took some lumps and Ward emerged as top-flight corner in the eyes of position coach Kerry Coombs.\n\nEventually Ohio State went with Lattimore, Conley and Ward on the field together in nickel situations. Conley played in the slot.\n\n\"I gave up some catches that I wasn't supposed to give up, and I lost the spot,\" Arnette said. \"That's just how it is. Coming back for this camp I know I gotta be on top of my stuff to make the team better. Last year I felt like if they kept me in, the team would've suffered.\"\n\nArnette ended up playing 181 snaps on defense last year while the starting corner trio logged closer to 600. Not to rag too much on Arnette, but you can't give up touchdowns and expect to stay on the field. He knows that now. Knew it then.\n\nCoombs was talking earlier this week about Arnette's swagger, about how he'll remind you of Bradley Roby and tell you he's the best corner on the field. That's all great. Attitude can be a good thing. But can he play?\n\nThere was a standard set last year.

Standard Sport understands the centre-back features on a shortlist for both Premier League giants ahead of this summer\u2019s transfer window. The Blues are believed to have already sounded the 24-year-old out as they look to reshape their defence ahead of next season. Thiago Silva will return to boyhood club Fluminense, while Tosin Adarabioyo is of interest ahead of his departure from Fulham upon the expiration of his contract. United have considered Todibo, who still has three years to run on his contract with the French club, as an alternative to Everton\u2019s Jarrad Branthwaite. Raphael Varane will be leaving Old Trafford, while Lisandro Martinez endured an injury-hit season during a difficult season for Erik ten Hag\u2019s side on the defensive front. Tottenham were also keen on the France international during the January transfer window before eventually signing Radu Dragusin. Todibo helped lead Nice to second in the Ligue 1 table and while he did insist he respected the club too much to openly talk about his future, he revealed discussions behind the scenes. He told The Daily Telegraph: \u201cHonestly I don\u2019t want to talk about [my future] because of my respect for the fans here and the club also, but we had a little discussion, for sure.\u201d Before adding: \u201cMy ambition is to play in the best competitions in the world and try to be the best version of me. \u201cTry to be the best defender, for sure, that I can be.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Leading Premier League clubs have been keen on 24-year-old</p>", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/todibo-transfer-news-man-utd-chelsea-fc-2024-b1160810.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/05/29/11/59/SEI203509181.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/XtePcjaU-BqwSYW3q.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:08:08", "author": "Jonathan Gorrie", "authors": ["Jonathan Gorrie"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.126}

On Sunday, the Barbadian beauty took to her social media page to promote her new lingerie collection. Rather than seek the services of a model, Rihanna modeled a sample from her collection herself. In the promo clip, the singer flaunted her curves while rocking a sexy nude shapewear. The clip quickly went viral, leaving fans with much to say about Rihanna and A$AP Rocky. Many called the rapper a lucky man for having such beauty as his partner.\n\nRihanna and A$AP Rocky are the names on everyone's lips once again. This time, the buzz surrounding the duo is all thanks to the Fenty CEO's promo video for her latest project. On Sunday, the Grammy award winner jumped on her Instagram page with a video of herself showing off her latest shapewear collection. The clip showed Rihanna modeling a steamy nude lingerie with French-cut legs and spaghetti straps. The singer looked incredibly sexy as her gorgeous curved figure was on display. In the behind-the-scenes footage, Rihanna exuded sex appeal as she pressed her boobs against a window, baring her cleavage.\n\nShe also wrapped her bare legs with a silk white curtain and shot a sultry gaze at the camera. To accentuate the sexy lingerie, the Umbrella hitmaker opted for short blonde hair and an array of accessories, including diamond earrings, a gold necklace, and a bracelet.\n\n\"I was desperate for a nude. I go in between nudes when I get tanned or when I look a little paler. It's hard to find a nude that you can carry through in that range of shade and I found mine in Signature Script,\" she said in a voice-over.\n\nRihanna's posts always garner thousands of reactions in a few hours, and this time wasn't any different. Fans in their numbers trooped to the comments section to gush about the artist's good looks.\n\n\"Let's have a minute to thank God for creating Rihanna...she's our goddess on earth,\" one fan wrote.\n\nAnother fan remarked, \"I love her beauty,\" while a third gushed, \"You're so beautiful, Riri. You're a real woman.\"\n\nOne fan mentioned Rihanna's partner A$AP Rocky, in their comment, calling him a lucky man.\n\n\"Rihanna can have it any time she wants it! You hearing me ASAP Rocky!?\"\n\nMeanwhile, some other fans expressed disappointment that Rihanna launched a new commercial venture instead of a new album. Rihanna hasn't released a new album since 2016. The disappointed fans said seeing the singer focusing on business rather than music was sad.

One of the most significant is her Savage x Fenty lingerie brand. She often steps in to play the role of a model for new releases. She did so earlier this year for the brand's new Valentine's Day launch reminding fans how great she can look. That's the case once again with a nude teddy that coaxed an evocative caption out of the \"Lift Me Up\" singer.\n\n\"looking for nudes\" she captioned her most recent post, which dropped over the weekend. It's attached to a video of RiRi herself showing off a piece from the brand's upcoming Signature Script collection. She's also giving voice over to many of the clips and even briefly addressing the camera directly. In the comments, fellow celebs showed up to show love for the R&B darling. Most notably Khloe Kardashian popped up saying \"This hair!!!! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d so beautiful.\" Check out the full post she made and the flood of fan love that followed below.\n\nRihanna continues to give fans reasons to believe that her new album is still approaching. Late last month she once again teased her new album building up hopes among her die hard fans. She specifically described the album as \"Amazing\" before filing back through rumors in the years since she dropped Anti back in 2016.\n\nOne person who is also dealing with plenty of album speculation is A$AP Rocky. He's been teasing a new project called DON'T BE DUMB dating all the way back to last year. Rihanna isn't doing anything to help slow the hype train down either. She's repeatedly talked about how he's working on the project often and was present when he recently teased it at a pop-up. What do you think of Rihanna modeling a nude-colored teddy for the upcoming Savage x Fenty drop? Do you think she will release any new music at all in 2024?

Nearly 500 metric tons, or over a million pounds, of aid was delivered beginning Saturday morning local time, CENTCOM said in a post on X, the first delivery since the pier broke apart last month. The delivery came the same day the Israeli military rescued four hostages in an operation that authorities in Gaza said killed 236 people and injured more than 400 others. CENTCOM made it clear Saturday that the pier, \u201cincluding its equipment, personnel, and assets,\u201d was not used in the operation. \u201cThe temporary pier on the coast of Gaza was put in place for one purpose only, to help move additional, urgently needed lifesaving assistance into Gaza,\u201d CENTCOM said in a separate post on X. And a US official told CNN on Saturday that the pier, called Joint Logistics Over the Shore, or JLOTS, was not used in the operation. \u201cIt is our understanding that IDF did not use a vehicle with humanitarian markings, or any humanitarian platform, including the JLOTS facility, to conduct hostage rescue operations,\u201d the official said. The pier, used in addition to dropping aid out of planes and trucking it through border checkpoints, sustained damage and broke apart in heavy seas late last month. In the less than two weeks the pier was operational, it helped deliver some 1,000 metric tons of aid to Gaza. The US had faced a number of challenges with the pier, including planning around Israel\u2019s operations in Rafah, establishing who would transport the aid from the pier into Gaza, and logistical issues such as sea and weather conditions. Eight months into the Israel-Hamas war, human rights groups have described \u201cunspeakable\u201d living conditions in Gaza. The United Nations\u2019 food agency warned in May that Palestinians in the north are under a \u201cfull-blown famine\u201d that is spreading south, and more than 1 million people, half of Gaza\u2019s population, are \u201cexpected to face death and starvation\u201d by mid-July, a UN report warned this week. While Israeli officials have insisted there is no limit on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, the UN has accused authorities of imposing \u201cunlawful restrictions\u201d on relief operations, including blocked land routes, communications blackouts and air strikes. The US has made a number of air drops of humanitarian aid into Gaza in partnership with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, though they were suspended in recent weeks due to military operations in the north of Gaza, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper said Friday. Air drops are expected to resume \u201cin the coming days,\u201d he said.

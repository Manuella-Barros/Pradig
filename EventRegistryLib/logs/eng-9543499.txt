(AP Photo/Darko Bandic)\n\nXi arrived in Serbia to a warm welcome on Tuesday evening from France, where he had a high-stakes state visit dominated by trade disputes and Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThousands of people chanting \"China-Serbia\" and waving flags were bused in from across Serbia to attend a welcoming ceremony for Xi on Wednesday in front of the Serbia Palace, in the new part of Belgrade where the talks are being held.\n\nSerbia's populist President Aleksandar Vucic addressed the crowd from a balcony, calling Xi an \"ironclad\" friend. He said hs visit to Serbia is \"historic\" because it opens the path for even closer ties.\n\n\"We are writing history today although it doesn't seem so to many (people,)\" Vucic said. \"We thank President Xi. He hasn't come to Europe in five years and he has again chosen our little Serbia.\"\n\nAt the start of the official meeting on Wednesday, Xi said \"we are first-hand witnesses that the Serbian people view Chinese people as ironclad best friends.\"\n\n\"This is truly two-sided and truthful friendship ... I truly hail this and it really made an extremely deep impression on me,\" Xi said, according to the state RTS television.\n\nXi will proceed to Hungary later on Wednesday. Like Serbia, Hungary is seen as one of China's more friendly partners in Europe.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible throughout the Serbian capital. A huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nChina has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nSome of those agreements, like the trade without tariffs with China, are not in line with EU conditions for membership. Although Serbia formally wants to join the 27-nation bloc, it has been steadily drifting away from that path.\n\nSerbia, a landlocked nation in the heart of the Balkans, has been a key country in China's Belt and Road initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nXi also arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date -- the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by U.S. jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed.\n\nThe incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\nChinese companies run Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbor Hungary.\n\n\"Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xi said in a statement published by China's Foreign Ministry.\n\n\"Standing at a new historical starting point, China will work with Serbia to jointly stay committed to the original aspiration and forge ahead together to open up a new vista in China-Serbia cooperation,\" added Xi. \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\"\n\nIn 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernize the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe more than $2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system flown in on Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes.\n\nThe arms delivery over the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkey and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China's growing global reach.", "source": {"uri": "mb.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Bulletin"}, "authors": [],

Yes, Taiwan is China.\"\n\nBeijing claims the self-ruled island as its own, and has not ruled out using force to bring it under Chinese control.\n\nXi told Vucic in opening comments that there was a \"strong feeling of friendship between our two countries.\"\n\n\"I hope that this visit will meet your expectations and show the contribution that China can make to Serbia,\" he said.\n\nThey later appeared together to sign a joint declaration, with commercial promises including the purchase of new Chinese trains, new air links and increased Serbian imports.\n\nNATO bombing\n\nIn Belgrade Xi received a warm welcome, with streets decked out with Chinese flags and posters proclaiming a \"warm welcome\" to \"Chinese friends.\"\n\nHis visit coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which killed three people.\n\n\"Do not forget that our Chinese friends were with us 25 years ago when this country was being demolished and bombed,\" Vucic told crowds Wednesday.\n\nThe embassy was hit during a months-long, U.S.-led NATO campaign targeting Serbian security forces who were at war with ethnic-Albanian insurgents in Kosovo.\n\nThe U.S. later apologized, saying outdated maps had led the pilot to strike the wrong target.\n\nOn Tuesday, Xi wrote in the Serbian daily Politika that NATO had \"flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy,\" warning that China would \"never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\"\n\nSerbia has repeatedly supported China's claims over Taiwan and in turn, Beijing has long backed Serbia's territorial claims over the breakaway province of Kosovo.\n\nAlong with Russia, China has prevented Kosovo's recognition at the United Nations.\n\nXi called for the two countries to \"firmly support each other's core interests.\"\n\n\"China supports Serbia in upholding its policy of acting independently ... (and) its efforts to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Kosovo issue,\" he said Wednesday.\n\nUkraine fears\n\n\"For Serbia, this is without a doubt one of the most significant visits,\" Marko Tmusic, a political sciences professor at the University of Belgrade, told AFP.\n\nIn Belgrade, many welcomed Xi's visit.\n\n\"I think it's an excellent thing, this visit from the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world,\" 67-year-old Stojan Vidovic, a retiree, told AFP.\n\nIn France, Xi met with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who urged him not to allow the export of technology that could be used by Russia in Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nSome European allies are concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go later Wednesday to Hungary where China has invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle manufacturing plants.\n\n--\n\nBy MINA PEJAKOVIC and HELEN ROXBURGH, Agence France-Presse", "source": {"uri": "courthousenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Court House News

Reuters\n\nXi Jinping is getting the royal treatment in Serbia.\n\nThe Chinese premier's visit to Europe - a rare one and his first since 2019 - saw him head to France on Monday before arriving in Serbia on Tuesday night.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic and government officials welcomed Xi at the Belgrade airport, where he was greeted by a military guard of honour and folk dancers.\n\nThe two leaders will hold a meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThe Belgrade streets were decorated with Chinese flags and placards as thousands of police officers were deployed to secure Xi and his 400-member entourage, the highest-level visit by a foreign leader in years.\n\nWhile some might be surprised that the leader of China has included Serbia on his European sojourn, a look at recent history shows that shouldn't be the case.\n\nSerbia is now seen as China's most important partner in the Balkans\n\nLet's take a look at why Serbia is rolling out the red carpet for Xi.\n\nAccording to RFERL.org, China and Serbia first began improving ties when Vucic's SNS took power in 2012.\n\nRelations were strengthened during Xi's first visit to Belgrade in 2016 when the two countries signed a strategic partnership.\n\nMore importantly, China has given Serbia billions of dollars in infrastructure loans.\n\nIt runs mines and factories across the Balkan country.\n\nSerbian president Aleksandar Vucic describes Xi as a 'friend.'\n\nSerbia is also Europe's firmest supporter of China's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nBoth Serbia and Hungary are part of China's a Belt and Road Initiative to modernise the railway between the countries' capitals of Budapest and Belgrade and connect them to the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe bulk of the project, which after numerous delays is expected to be completed in 2026, is financed through loans from Chinese banks -- the kind of capital that Hungary and Serbia have been eager to utilise.\n\nAccording to the AidData research lab at William & Mary, a public university in Virginia, Chinese lenders have issued loans worth more than $22 billion to nine countries in Central and Eastern Europe between 2000 and 2021.\n\nOf that sum, $5.7 billion has gone to Serbia alone.\n\nThe bulk of the project, which after numerous delays is expected to be completed in 2026, is financed through loans from Chinese banks -- the kind of capital that Hungary and Serbia have been eager to utilise.\n\nChina is also popular in Serbia.\n\nRFERL.org quoted a recent poll as showing that two-third of respondents particularly the youth welcoming Chinese investment in their country.\n\nThe survey, published in October 2023 by the Institute for European Affairs, showed three out of four Serbians think China is a 'friendly nation.'\n\nVucic has said he is \"honoured\" that Xi is visiting.\n\nHe said before the visit that Serbia would seek further Chinese investment, particularly when it comes to advanced technologies.\n\nOn a trip to China, Vucic last year said Serbia is \"the only country in Europe that had never joined declarations criticising or attacking China on any issue.\"\n\nBoth leaders insist on an ironclad partnership between their countries.\n\nAs per RFERL.org, the China's People's Daily has called the visit \"a milestone in bilateral relations.\"\n\n\"Serbia has demonstrated once again that China, not Russia, is its most important partner in the East at the moment, especially with Russian-Serbian ties under constant scrutiny because of Ukraine,\" Vuk Vuksanovic, a senior researcher at the Belgrade Center for Security Policy, told RFE/RL.\n\nLast year, Vucic signed 18 agreements with Xi in Beijing, including a free trade deal that should become operational in July.\n\nAccording to BBC, Beijing claims it is Serbia's biggest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Serbia.\n\nChina's ambassador Li Ming says that Chinese firms provide 20,000 jobs in Serbia.\n\nIn 2023, China was Serbia's second-largest trading partner after the EU with a total trade exchange of $6.1 billion and among its top five investors, according to the national investment agency.\n\nThis time, China and Serbia are likely to pen around 30 agreements, sources in Belgrade told Bloomberg.\n\nBBC quoted Serbia's infrastructure minister, Goran Vesic as saying much more infrastructure projects are in the offing.\n\n\"There is really a lot of room for co-operation with Chinese companies,\" Vesic said.\n\n'Soaked in blood'\n\nXi's visit also comes on the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of China's embassy in which three Chinese journalists were killed.\n\nOn 7 May, 1999, 20 Chinese nationals were wounded in the NATO attack, which prompted outrage in China and an apology from then US president Bill Clinton.\n\nThe embassy was hit during a campaign against the then Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\n\"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself,\" Xi said in an opinion article in the Serbian daily Politika on Tuesday.\n\n\"The friendship between China and Serbia which is soaked in blood that the two peoples spilled together has become a joint memory of the two peoples and will encourage both parties to make together huge steps forward,\" Xi said.\n\nThe Guardian quoted Xi as vowing to \"expand the comprehensive strategic partnership\" with Serbia.\n\nHe also praised Vucic for \"preserving national sovereignty\" and \"opposing the interference of any force in Serbian internal affairs.\"\n\nObservers say Xi's choice of Serbia and Hungary is designed to pull closer two European countries that are pro-Russia and large recipients of Chinese investment.\n\nVedran Dzihic, a senior lecturer at the University of Vienna and senior researcher at the Austrian Institute for International Affairs, told RFERL.org, \"China sees in Hungary and Serbia the two most important partners in Europe, a kind of door that opens up space to a wider European market and to some strategic investments.\"\n\nSerbia's Western partners view the country as a Chinese hub at the gateway to the EU.\n\nThe countries are also growing closer when it comes to tourism.\n\nAccording to CGTN, Serbia has become an 'increasingly popular' destination since it granted visa-free entry to Chinese tourists in 2017.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"},

He said hs visit to Serbia is \"historic\" because it opens the path for even closer ties.\n\n\"We are writing history today although it doesn't seem so to many (people,)\" Vucic said. \"We thank President Xi. He hasn't come to Europe in five years and he has again chosen our little Serbia.\"\n\nAt the start of the official meeting, Xi said \"we are first-hand witnesses that the Serbian people view Chinese people as ironclad best friends.\"\n\n\"This is truly two-sided and truthful friendship ... I truly hail this and it really made an extremely deep impression on me,\" Xi said, according to the state RTS television.\n\nXi will proceed to Hungary today. Like Serbia, Hungary is seen as one of China's more friendly partners in Europe.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible throughout the Serbian capital. A huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nChina has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nSerbia, a landlocked nation in the heart of the Balkans, has been a key country in China's Belt and Road initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a \"Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\"\n\nXi also arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date -- the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by U.S. jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed.\n\nThe incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\nChinese companies run Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbor Hungary.\n\n\"Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xi said in a statement published by China's Foreign Ministry.\n\n\"Standing at a new historical starting point, China will work with Serbia to jointly stay committed to the original aspiration and forge ahead together to open up a new vista in China-Serbia cooperation,\" added Xi. \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\"\n\nIn 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernize the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe more than $2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system flown in on Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes.", "source": {"uri":

Yes, Taiwan is China.\"\n\nBeijing claims the self-ruled island as its own, and has not ruled out using force to bring it under Chinese control.\n\nXi told Vucic in opening comments that there was a \"strong feeling of friendship between our two countries.\"\n\n\"I hope that this visit will meet your expectations and show the contribution that China can make to Serbia,\" he said.\n\nThey later appeared together to sign a joint declaration, with commercial promises including the purchase of new Chinese trains, new air links and increased Serbian imports.\n\nIn Belgrade Xi received a warm welcome, with streets decked out with Chinese flags and posters proclaiming a \"warm welcome\" to \"Chinese friends.\"\n\nHis visit coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which killed three people.\n\n\"Do not forget that our Chinese friends were with us 25 years ago when this country was being demolished and bombed,\" Vucic told crowds Wednesday.\n\nThe embassy was hit during a months-long, U.S.-led NATO campaign targeting Serbian security forces who were at war with ethnic-Albanian insurgents in Kosovo.\n\nThe U.S. later apologized, saying outdated maps had led the pilot to strike the wrong target.\n\nOn Tuesday, Xi wrote in the Serbian daily Politika that NATO had \"flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy,\" warning that China would \"never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\"\n\nSerbia has repeatedly supported China's claims over Taiwan and in turn, Beijing has long backed Serbia's territorial claims over the breakaway province of Kosovo.\n\nAlong with Russia, China has prevented Kosovo's recognition at the United Nations.\n\nXi called for the two countries to \"firmly support each other's core interests.\"\n\n\"China supports Serbia in upholding its policy of acting independently ... (and) its efforts to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Kosovo issue,\" he said Wednesday.\n\n\"For Serbia, this is without a doubt one of the most significant visits,\" Marko Tmusic, a political sciences professor at the University of Belgrade, told AFP.\n\n\"I think it's an excellent thing, this visit from the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world,\" 67-year-old Stojan Vidovic, a retiree, told AFP.\n\nIn France, Xi met with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who urged him not to allow the export of technology that could be used by Russia in Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nSome European allies are concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go later Wednesday to Hungary where China has invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle manufacturing plants.\n\nBy MINA

He said his visit to Serbia was \"historic\" because it opened the path for even closer ties.\n\n\"We are writing history today although it doesn't seem so to many,\" Vucic said. \"We thank President Xi. He hasn't come to Europe in five years and he has again chosen our little Serbia.\"\n\nAt the start of the official meeting on Wednesday, Xi said \"we are first-hand witnesses that the Serbian people view Chinese people as ironclad best friends.\"\n\n\"This is truly two-sided and truthful friendship ... I truly hail this and it really made an extremely deep impression on me,\" Xi said, according to the state RTS television.\n\nXi is traveling to Hungary later on Wednesday. Like Serbia, Hungary is seen as one of China's more friendly partners in Europe.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were visible throughout the Serbian capital. A huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nChina has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nSome of those agreements, such as the free trade pact, are not in line with EU conditions for membership. Although Serbia formally wants to join the 27-nation bloc, it has been steadily drifting away from that path.\n\nSerbia, a landlocked nation in the heart of the Balkans, has been a key country in China's Belt and Road initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nXi arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date -- the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by U.S. jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed.\n\nThe incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\nChinese companies run Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbor Hungary.\n\nIn 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernize the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe more than $2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system flown in on Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes.\n\nThe arms delivery over the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkey and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China's growing global reach.", "source": {"uri": "thestandard.com.hk", "dataType":

He said his visit to Serbia is historic because it paves the way for even closer ties.\n\nWe are making history today even if it doesn't seem like it to many (people), Vucic said. We thank President Xi. He hasn't been to Europe for five years and he has chosen our little Serbia again.\n\nAt the start of the official meeting on Wednesday, Xi said that we are first-hand witnesses that the Serbian people regard the Chinese people as their best and unfailing friend.\n\nThis is a truly bilateral and true friendship... I sincerely welcome this and it really made an extremely deep impression on me, Xi said, according to state television RTS.\n\nXi will visit Hungary later on Wednesday. Like Serbia, Hungary is considered one of China's friendliest partners in Europe.\n\nSigns of pro-Chinese sentiments were clearly visible throughout the Serbian capital. A huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a road leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags were visible in the city center and along a highway.\n\nChina has invested billions of dollars in Serbia in the form of investments and loans, particularly in the mining and infrastructure sectors. The two countries signed a strategic partnership agreement in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nSome of these agreements, such as tariff-free trade with China, do not comply with the conditions of EU membership. Although Serbia officially wants to join the 27-nation bloc, it is gradually moving away from that path.\n\nSerbia, a landlocked country in the heart of the Balkans, is a key country in China's development. Belt and Road Initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nXi also arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date, the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade by American planes during the NATO air war over Kosovo, during which three Chinese citizens were You are.\n\nThis incident helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\nChinese companies operate Serbia's largest copper mine and steel mill, and are also building numerous roads and highways across the country, as well as a railway to Hungary, its northern neighbor.\n\nOur bilateral relationship has stood the test of the changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations, Xi said in a statement issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.\n\nAt a new historic starting point, China will work with Serbia to stick to the original aspiration and forge ahead together to open up a new perspective in China-Serbia cooperation,\" Xi added. I am confident that this visit will be fruitful and open a new chapter in Sino-Serbian relations.\n\nIn 2014, Hungary and Serbia reached an agreement with Beijing to modernize the railway between their capitals, Budapest and Belgrade, as part of a Belt and Road plan to connect the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus, Greece, to the southern port of entry Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe more than $2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system carried on Y-20 transport planes of the Chinese Air Force.\n\nThe delivery of weapons to the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkey and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China's growing global reach.\n\n-\n\nAssociated Press writer Ken Moritsugu contributed from Taipei, Taiwan.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com",

Serbia has condemned the Russian invasion but has refused to join international sanctions against Moscow.\n\nXi arrived in Serbia to a warm welcome on Tuesday evening from France, where he had a high-stakes state visit dominated by trade disputes and Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThousands of people chanting \"China-Serbia\" and waving flags were bused in from across Serbia to attend a welcoming ceremony for Xi on Wednesday in front of the Serbia Palace, in the new part of Belgrade where the talks were held.\n\nSerbia's populist president addressed the crowd from a balcony, calling Xi an \"ironclad\" friend. He said his visit to Serbia was \"historic\" because it opened the path for even closer ties.\n\n\"We are writing history today although it doesn't seem so to many,\" Vucic said. \"We thank President Xi. He hasn't come to Europe in five years and he has again chosen our little Serbia.\"\n\nAt the start of the official meeting on Wednesday, Xi said \"we are first-hand witnesses that the Serbian people view Chinese people as ironclad best friends.\"\n\n\"This is truly a two-sided and truthful friendship ... I truly hail this and it really made an extremely deep impression on me,\" Xi said, according to the state RTS television.\n\nXi is traveling to Hungary later on Wednesday. Like Serbia, Hungary is seen as one of China's more friendly partners in Europe.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were visible throughout the Serbian capital. A huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nChina has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nSome of those agreements, such as the free trade pact, are not in line with EU conditions for membership. Although Serbia formally wants to join the 27-nation bloc, it has been steadily drifting away from that path.\n\nSerbia, a landlocked nation in the heart of the Balkans, has been a key country in China's Belt and Road initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nXi arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date -- the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by U.S. jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed.\n\nThe incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\nChinese companies run Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbor Hungary.\n\nIn 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernize the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe more than $2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system flown in on Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes.\n\nThe arms delivery over the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkey and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China's growing global reach.\n\n___\n\nBy DUSAN STOJANOVIC and JOVANA GEC Associated

Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nXi arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date - the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by US jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed.\n\nThe incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\nChinese companies run Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbor Hungary.\n\nIn 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernize the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe more than $2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system flown in on Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes.\n\nThe arms delivery over the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkey and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China's growing global reach.

While it may not denote a specific initiative, experts believe it has an underlying significance as another term for an alliance.\n\n\"Eight years ago, Serbia became China's first comprehensive strategic partner in the Central and Eastern European region, and today Serbia is the first European country to build a community of destiny with China, fully reflecting the strategic, special and high level of China-Serbia relations,\" Xi said during a press conference after signing the agreement.\n\nVucic said the two countries \"are moving from strategic relations, through which we had managed to raise our bilateral ties, to the joint future of our two countries.\"\n\n\"That is the highest possible form of cooperation between two countries and I am proud that I was able to sign this today as the president of Serbia,\" he added.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the EU would respond to Serbia getting even closer to China. Russia's war on Ukraine has pushed the integration of six Western Balkan countries, including Serbia, into the EU at the top of the 27-nation bloc's agenda.\n\nThe U.S. envoy for the Western Balkans Gabriel Escobar said Xi's visit to Europe, his first in five years, was intended to drive a wedge among the European states.\n\n\"We caution all of our partners and all of our interlocutors to be very aware of China's agenda in Europe and China's agenda with regard to the European community,\" he said in an online press conference.\n\nChina claims neutrality in the Ukraine conflict but has refused to call the Russian assault an invasion and has been accused of bolstering Russia's military capacity. Serbia has condemned the Russian invasion but has refused to join international sanctions against Moscow.\n\nXi arrived in Serbia to a warm welcome on Tuesday evening from France, where he had a high-stakes state visit dominated by trade disputes and Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThousands of people chanting \"China-Serbia\" and waving flags were bused in from across Serbia to attend a welcoming ceremony for Xi on Wednesday in front of the Serbia Palace, in the new part of Belgrade where the talks were held.\n\nSerbia's populist president addressed the crowd from a balcony, calling Xi an \"ironclad\" friend. He said his visit to Serbia was \"historic\" because it opened the path for even closer ties.\n\n\"We are writing history today, although it doesn't seem so to many,\" Vucic said. \"We thank President Xi. He hasn't come to Europe in five years and he has again chosen our little Serbia.\"\n\nAt the start of the official meeting on Wednesday, Xi said, \"We are first-hand witnesses that the Serbian people view Chinese people as ironclad best friends.\"\n\n\"This is truly a two-sided and truthful friendship ... I truly hail this and it really made an extremely deep impression on me,\" Xi said, according to the state RTS television.\n\nXi is traveling to Hungary later on Wednesday. Like Serbia, Hungary is seen as one of China's more friendly partners in Europe.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were visible throughout the Serbian capital. A huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nChina has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nSome of those agreements, such as the free trade pact, are not in line with EU conditions for membership. Although Serbia formally wants to join the 27-nation bloc, it has been steadily drifting away from that path.\n\nSerbia, a landlocked nation in the heart of the Balkans, has been a key country in China's Belt and Road Initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nXi arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date - the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by U.S. jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed.\n\nThe incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\nChinese companies run Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbor Hungary.\n\nIn 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernize the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe more than $2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system flown in on Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes.\n\nThe arms delivery over the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkey and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China's growing global reach.", "source": {"uri": "thediplomat.com", "dataType":

While it may not denote a specific initiative, experts believe it has an underlying significance as another term for an alliance.\n\n\"Eight years ago, Serbia became China's first comprehensive strategic partner in the Central and Eastern European region, and today Serbia is the first European country to build a community of destiny with China, fully reflecting the strategic, special and high level of China-Serbia relations,\" Xi said during a press conference after signing the agreement.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the EU would respond to Serbia getting even closer to China. Russia's war on Ukraine has pushed the integration of six Western Balkan countries, including Serbia, into the EU at the top of the 27-nation bloc's agenda.\n\nChina has claimed neutrality in the Ukraine conflict, but has refused to call the Russian assault an invasion and has been accused of bolstering Russia's military capacity. Serbia has condemned the Russian invasion but has refused to join international sanctions against Moscow.\n\nXi arrived in Serbia to a warm welcome on Tuesday evening from France, where he had a high-stakes state visit dominated by trade disputes and Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThousands of people chanting \"China-Serbia\" and waving flags were bused in from across Serbia to attend a welcoming ceremony for Xi on Wednesday in front of the Serbia Palace, in the new part of Belgrade where the talks were held.\n\nSerbia's populist president addressed the crowd from a balcony, calling Xi an \"ironclad\" friend. He said his visit to Serbia was \"historic\" because it opened the path for even closer ties.\n\n\"We are writing history today although it doesn't seem so to many,\" Vucic said. \"We thank President Xi. He hasn't come to Europe in five years and he has again chosen our little Serbia.\"\n\nAt the start of the official meeting on Wednesday, Xi said \"we are first-hand witnesses that the Serbian people view Chinese people as ironclad best friends.\"\n\n\"This is truly a two-sided and truthful friendship ... I truly hail this and it really made an extremely deep impression on me,\" Xi said, according to the state RTS television.\n\nXi is traveling to Hungary later on Wednesday. Like Serbia, Hungary is seen as one of China's more friendly partners in Europe.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were visible throughout the Serbian capital. A huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nChina has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nSome of those agreements, such as the free trade pact, are not in line with EU conditions for membership. Although Serbia formally wants to join the 27-nation bloc, it has been steadily drifting away from that path.\n\nSerbia, a landlocked nation in the heart of the Balkans, has been a key country in China's Belt and Road initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nXi arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date -- the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by U.S. jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed.\n\nThe incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\nChinese companies run Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbor Hungary.\n\nIn 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernize the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe more than $2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system flown in on Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes.\n\nThe arms delivery over the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkey and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China's growing global reach.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ken Moritsugu

Thousands of people chanting \"China-Serbia\" and waving flags were bused in from across Serbia to attend a welcoming ceremony for Xi on Wednesday in front of the Serbia Palace, in the new part of Belgrade where the talks are being held.\n\nSerbia's populist President Aleksandar Vucic addressed the crowd from a balcony, calling Xi an \"ironclad\" friend. He said his visit to Serbia is \"historic\" because it opens the path for even closer ties. \"We are writing history today although it doesn't seem so to many (people,)\" Vucic said. \"We thank President Xi. He hasn't come to Europe in five years and he has again chosen our little Serbia.\"\n\nAt the start of the official meeting on Wednesday, Xi said \"we are first-hand witnesses that the Serbian people view Chinese people as ironclad best friends.\" \"This is truly two-sided and truthful friendship ... I truly hail this and it really made an extremely deep impression on me,\" Xi said, according to the state RTS television.\n\nXi will proceed to Hungary later on Wednesday. Like Serbia, Hungary is seen as one of China's more friendly partners in Europe. Signs of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible throughout the Serbian capital. A huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nChina has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year. Some of those agreements, like the trade without tariffs with China, are not in line with EU conditions for membership. Although Serbia formally wants to join the 27-nation bloc, it has been steadily drifting away from that path.\n\nXi also arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date - the 25anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by US jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed. The incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\nChinese companies run Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbor Hungary. \"Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xi said in a statement published by China's Foreign Ministry.\n\n\"Standing at a new historical starting point, China will work with Serbia to jointly stay committed to the original aspiration and forge ahead together to open up a new vista in China-Serbia cooperation,\" added Xi. \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\"", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc",

REUTERS/Marko Djurica Purchase Licensing Rights\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Serbia on Tuesday evening escorted by MIG-29 jets in a tightly secured visit coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of China's embassy in which three Chinese journalists were killed.\n\nBelgrade, after France, is the second stop on Xi's first visit to Europe in five years, which also includes Hungary. In Serbia, which is seen as China's most important partner in the Balkans, Xi is expected to discuss China\u00b4s multi-billion investment in the country and possible new deals.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic and government officials welcomed Xi at the Belgrade airport, where he was greeted by a military guard of honor and folk dancers. The two leaders will hold a meeting on Wednesday.\n\nOn May 7, 1999, 20 Chinese nationals were wounded in the NATO attack, which prompted outrage in China and an apology from then US President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe embassy was hit during a campaign against the then Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Reuters reported.\n\n\"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself,\" Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday.\n\n\"The friendship between China and Serbia which is soaked in blood that the two peoples spilled together has become a joint memory of the two peoples and will encourage both parties to make together huge steps forward,\" Xi said.\n\nThe Belgrade streets were decorated with Chinese flags and placards as thousands of police officers were deployed to secure Xi and his 400-member entourage, the highest-level visit by a foreign leader in years.\n\nXi is visiting Serbia after France, where President Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen pressed him to ensure more balanced trade with Europe and use his influence on Russia to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nDuring his first visit to Belgrade in 2016, the two countries signed a strategic partnership. Last year, Vucic signed 18 agreements with Xi in Beijing, including a free trade deal that should become operational in July.\n\nBoth leaders insist on an ironclad partnership between their countries. Along with Hungary, which is Xi\u00b4s next stop, Serbia is Europe's firmest supporter of China's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nChina runs mines and factories across Serbia and has lent billions for roads, bridges and new facilities, becoming Serbia's key partner in much-needed infrastructure development.\n\nObservers say Xi's choice of Serbia and Hungary is designed to pull closer two European countries that are pro-Russia and large recipients of Chinese investment. Serbia's Western partners view the country as a Chinese hub at the gateway to the EU.\n\nIn 2023, China was Serbia's second-largest trading partner after the EU with a total trade exchange of $6.1 billion and among its top five investors, according to the national investment agency.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [],

Vucic said Xi's visit was a \"great honor\" and that China is an \"inspiration\" for Serbia.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible - a huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nChina has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nA man walks in front of a Chinese national flag in Belgrade, Serbia, Tuesday, May 7, 2024.

(AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic)\n\nSerbia, a landlocked nation in the heart of the Balkans, has been a key country in China's Belt and Road initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nXi also arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date: the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by U.S. jets during NATO\u00b4s air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed.\n\nThe incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\n\"Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xi said in an arrival statement published by China's Foreign Ministry. He described the Serbia-China friendship as \"ironclad.\"\n\n\"Standing at a new historical starting point, China will work with Serbia to jointly stay committed to the original aspiration and forge ahead together to open up a new vista in China-Serbia cooperation with stronger momentum, greater scope, and higher quality,\" added Xi. \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\"\n\nChinese companies are running Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbor Hungary.\n\nIn 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernize the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe more than $2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system flown in on Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes.\n\nThe arms delivery over the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkey and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China\u00b4s growing global reach.\n\nPeople walk in front of a Chinese national flag in Belgrade, Serbia, Tuesday, May 7, 2024.

Yes, Taiwan is China.\"\n\nBeijing claims the self-ruled island as its own, and has not ruled out using force to bring it under Chinese control.\n\nXi told Vucic in opening comments that there was a \"strong feeling of friendship between our two countries\".\n\nThey later appeared together to sign a joint declaration, with commercial promises including the purchase of new Chinese trains, new air links, and increased Serbian imports.\n\n- NATO bombing -\n\nStreets in the Serbian capital were decked out with Chinese flags and posters proclaiming a \"warm welcome\" to \"Chinese friends\".\n\nXi's visit coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which killed three people.\n\n\"Do not forget that our Chinese friends were with us 25 years ago when this country was being demolished and bombed,\" Vucic told the crowds Wednesday.\n\nThe embassy was hit during a months-long, US-led NATO campaign targeting Serbian security forces who were at war with ethnic-Albanian insurgents in Kosovo.\n\nThe United States later apologised, saying outdated maps had led the pilot to strike the wrong target.\n\nOn Tuesday, Xi wrote in the Serbian daily Politika that NATO had \"flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy\", warning that China would \"never allow such tragic history to repeat itself\".\n\nSerbia has repeatedly supported China's claims over Taiwan and in turn, Beijing has long backed Serbia's territorial claims over the breakaway province of Kosovo.\n\nAlong with Russia, China has prevented Kosovo's recognition at the United Nations.\n\nXi called for the two countries to \"firmly support each other's core interests\".\n\n\"China supports Serbia in upholding its policy of acting independently... (and) its efforts to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Kosovo issue,\" he said Wednesday.\n\n- Ukraine fears -\n\n\"For Serbia, this is without a doubt one of the most significant visits,\" Marko Tmusic, a political sciences professor at the University of Belgrade, told AFP.\n\nIn Belgrade, many welcomed Xi's visit.\n\n\"I think it's an excellent thing, this visit from the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world,\" 67-year-old Stojan Vidovic, a retiree, told AFP.\n\nIn France, Xi met President Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who urged him not to allow the export of technology that could be used by Russia in Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nSome European allies are concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nIn Hungary, China has invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle manufacturing plants.\n\nXi will hold talks with Orban, who has bucked the European Union's official position to \"de-risk\" relations with China.\n\nbur-rox-ehl/kym/imm", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType":

Yes, Taiwan is China\".\n\nBeijing claims the self-ruled island as its own, and has not ruled out using force to bring it under Chinese control.\n\nXi told Vucic in opening comments that there was a \"strong feeling of friendship between our two countries\".\n\n\"I hope that this visit will meet your expectations and show the contribution that China can make to Serbia,\" he said.\n\nThey later appeared together to sign a joint declaration, with commercial promises including the purchase of new Chinese trains, new air links, and increased Serbian imports.\n\nIn Belgrade Xi received a warm welcome, with streets decked out with Chinese flags and posters proclaiming a \"warm welcome\" to \"Chinese friends\".\n\n\"For Serbia, this is without a doubt one of the most significant visits,\" Marko Tmusic, a political sciences professor at the University of Belgrade, told AFP.\n\nIn Belgrade, many welcomed Xi's visit.\n\n\"I think it's an excellent thing, this visit from the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world,\" 67-year-old Stojan Vidovic, a retiree, told AFP.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [],

(and) its efforts to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Kosovo issue,\" he said Wednesday.\n\n- Ukraine fears -\n\n\"For Serbia, this is without a doubt one of the most significant visits,\" Marko Tmusic, a political sciences professor at the University of Belgrade, told AFP.\n\nIn Belgrade, many welcomed Xi's visit.\n\n\"I think it's an excellent thing, this visit from the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world,\" 67-year-old Stojan Vidovic, a retiree, told AFP.\n\nIn France, Xi met President Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who urged him not to allow the export of technology that could be used by Russia in Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nSome European allies are concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nIn Hungary, China has invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle manufacturing plants.\n\nXi will hold talks with Orban, who has bucked the European Union's official position to \"de-risk\" relations with China.\n\nbur-rox-ehl/kym/imm\n\nFOX41 Yakima\u00a9FOX11 TriCities\u00a9",

He said his visit to Serbia is \"historic\" because it opens the path for even closer ties.\n\n\"We are writing history today although it doesn't seem so to many (people,)\" Vucic said. \"We thank President Xi. He hasn't come to Europe in five years and he has again chosen our little Serbia.\" At the start of the official meeting on Wednesday, Xi said \"we are first-hand witnesses that the Serbian people view Chinese people as ironclad best friends\".\n\n\"This is truly two-sided and truthful friendship... I truly hail this and it really made an extremely deep impression on me,\" Xi said, according to the state RTS television.\n\nXi will proceed to Hungary later on Wednesday. Like Serbia, Hungary is seen as one of China's more friendly partners in Europe.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible throughout the Serbian capital. A huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nChina has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nSome of those agreements, like the trade without tariffs with China, are not in line with EU conditions for membership. Although Serbia formally wants to join the 27-nation bloc, it has been steadily drifting away from that path.\n\nSerbia, a landlocked nation in the heart of the Balkans, has been a key country in China's Belt and Road initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nXi also arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date -- the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by US jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed.\n\nThe incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\nChinese companies run Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbour Hungary.\n\n\"Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xi said in a statement published by China's Foreign Ministry.\n\n\"Standing at a new historical starting point, China will work with Serbia to jointly stay committed to the original aspiration and forge ahead together to open up a new vista in China-Serbia cooperation,\" added Xi. \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\"\n\nIn 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernise the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe more than USD 2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system flown in on Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes.\n\nThe arms delivery over the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkiye and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China's growing global reach.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors":

Serbia!\" while waving Chinese and Serbian national flags as they welcome the visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping in Belgrade on May 8, 2024. Photo: Xinhua\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Wednesday signed a joint statement on building a community with shared future in the new era in Belgrade, making Serbia the first European country to build such a community with China.\n\nIn the joint statement, the two countries decided to deepen and elevate the China-Serbia comprehensive strategic partnership. Serbia was the first Central and Eastern European country to become China's comprehensive strategic partner eight years ago.\n\n\"It is a strategic choice made by both sides to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era. Its goal is to realize the aspiration of the two peoples for a better life. Its foundation and driving force come from the firm support and extensive participation of the two peoples,\" Xi told reporters during a joint press conference with Vucic.\n\nXi also announced six measures to support the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future.\n\nChina is ready to import more quality and distinctive agricultural products from Serbia. China welcomes Serbia to increase direct flights between Belgrade and Shanghai, and encourages airlines from both sides to launch direct flights between Belgrade and Guangzhou.\n\nThe Chinese side will aid 50 young Serbian scientists in exchange programs with China for the next three years and a total of 300 Serbian youths will be invited to study in China in the next three years, said Xi.\n\nChina supports Serbia in hosting Expo 2027, and will send a delegation to participate in the grand show. China encourages its enterprises to take part in the construction of relevant projects, Xi said.\n\nWith joint efforts from China and Serbia, the free trade agreement between the two countries will take effect on July 1, Xi said.\n\nDuring his talks with Vucic on Wednesday in Belgrade, Xi said bilateral relations between China and Serbia are richer in content and have become a model of friendly relations between China and European countries.\n\nXi called on China and Serbia to carry forward the innovative nature of bilateral relations, open up new prospects for cooperation, and make innovative cooperation a new growth point of bilateral ties.\n\nXi was greeted by tens of thousands of Serbians on Wednesday and a welcoming ceremony was held outside the Palace of Serbia before the meeting between the two leaders.\n\nChinese national flags and Chinese-language welcoming banners were hanging on landmark buildings in Belgrade on Wednesday.\n\nChinese and Serbian experts said the meeting between the two heads of state will continue to provide high-level guidance to the sound development of bilateral relationship for the years to come and further inject vitality into the time-weathered, ironclad friendship.\n\nIronclad friendship\n\nOn Tuesday, a signed article by President Xi titled \"May the Light of Our Ironclad Friendship Shine on the Path of China-Serbia Cooperation\" was published in Serbian media Politika.\n\nXi noted in the article that \"there has always been an affinity between Chinese and Serbian peoples despite the long distance between us. During the bitter Anti-Fascist War and our respective nation-building in the last century, the Chinese and Serbian peoples forged a strong friendship that extends through time and space.\"\n\n\"Amid the ongoing transformations unseen in a century in the world, our mutual support remains as strong as ever, our cooperation is closer, and our exchanges and mutual learning more substantive. Whatever changes in the international landscape, China and Serbia remain true friends and good partners. Our ironclad friendship is ever-growing, setting a model for state-to-state and people-to-people interactions,\" Xi wrote.\n\nXi said China and Serbia should always be good friends and treat each other with sincerity, good partners for win-win cooperation, play an exemplary role in promoting fairness and justice and strengthen the heart-to-heart connection between their two peoples.\n\nWith China's support, hundreds of kilometers of highways have been built, the fastest railway in Eastern Europe entered operation, and energy facilities keep renewing, Boyan Lalic, Director of the Belt and Road Institute Belgrade, told the Global Times Wednesday.\n\nThe China-built high-speed railway connecting Belgrade to Novi Sad, inexpensive and comfortable, has cut the previously 1.5-hour trip to just 36 minutes, making a two-city life possible for many young people seeking opportunities, the Global Times learned.\n\nThe railway is part of a more ambitious project linking Belgrade and Budapest, the capital of Hungary, which could finish construction as early as 2025. The project has created jobs, offered unique career experience and trainings, and has allowed people like Serbian engineer Aleksandra Milosavljevic to \"make really good friends with my Chinese colleagues.\"\n\nJoin hands on international stage\n\nIn the signed article, Xi wrote \"Twenty-five years ago today, NATO flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia ... This we should never forget. The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\"\n\nThe China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides, Xi wrote.\n\nDong Yifan, a research fellow at the Institute of European Studies, China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that both China and Serbia adhere to independence and non-alignment in their strategic approaches, choosing to follow their own development paths and opposing hegemony. \"We share a strong consensus in international affairs.\"\n\nThe last stop of Xi's three-nation European trip is Hungary, during which a series of cooperation agreements are expected to be signed, according to media reports.\n\nBoth Serbia and Hungary are pillar countries in China-proposed BRI, and have long been at the forefront of European countries' relations with China with close cooperation, Dong said, adding that high-level diplomacy has played a key role in the two countries' relations with China.\n\nHe Zhigao, a research fellow with the Institute of European Studies of CASS, said that Serbia and Hungary \"stand out\" among European countries in regard to developing China ties partly because they can overcome some external restraints and make more independent decisions based on their own interests.", "source": {"uri": "en.people.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "People's Daily, China"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He will fly to Hungary later in the day.\n\n\"We are writing history today,\" Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told a large crowd that had gathered in front of the Serbian presidential palace to welcome Xi, applauding and chanting \"China, China\".\n\nThe two countries signed 29 agreements promoting legal, regulatory and economic cooperation. Serbia will also become the first European country in years to enter into a free trade agreement with China when a deal signed last year comes into effect on Jul 1.\n\nVucic said that since 2020 China had been the single-largest investor in Serbia, and that its investment was up 30-fold over the past decade. The free trade deal will guarantee tariff-free exports for 95 per cent of Serbian products to China over the next five to 10 years, he said.\n\nXi said that China was ready to import more high-quality agricultural products from Serbia and would welcome more direct flights between Belgrade and Chinese cities.\n\nBoth leaders boast of an ironclad partnership. Along with Hungary, Serbia is Europe's firmest supporter of China's huge Belt and Road infrastructure project across parts of Asia and Europe.\n\n\"Serbia became China's first strategic partner in central and eastern Europe eight years ago, and it becomes the first European country with which we shall build a community with shared future,\" Xi said.\n\nThe two leaders said they would support each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, meaning that Serbia considers Taiwan, viewed by Beijing as a breakaway province, to be part of China, just as China considers Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, as part of Serbia.\n\n\"We shall jointly confront hegemony and the politics of power,\" Xi said.\n\nXi\u00b4s visit comes on the anniversary of the 1999 Nato bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during a campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\nNato said the bombing, which killed three Chinese journalists and wounded 20 Chinese nationals, was accidental. It prompted outrage in China and an apology from then US President bill Clinton.\n\n\"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself,\" Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday.\n\nVucic said the two countries had agreed to establish an inter-governmental technology committee that would enable Serbia to get access to the latest technologies and use of artificial intelligence.\n\nChina owns mines and factories across Serbia and has lent billions for roads, bridges and new facilities, becoming Serbia's key partner in much-needed infrastructure development.\n\nXi left France on Tuesday after a two-day trip during which he offered no major concessions on trade or foreign policy, even as President Emmanuel Macron pressed him on market access and Ukraine.

Yes, Taiwan is China\".\n\nBeijing claims the self-ruled island as its own, and said it will not rule out using force to bring the island under Chinese control.\n\nAs the two leaders sat down for meetings, Xi told Vucic in opening comments that there was a \"strong feeling of friendship between our two countries\".\n\nXi arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday evening following a state visit to France that saw sometimes robust exchanges with President Emmanuel Macron on trade and China's close ties to Russia despite the Ukraine war.\n\nThe other two countries chosen for Xi's first trip to Europe since 2019 -- with Hungary as the final stop after Serbia -- are among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.\n\nStreets in the Serbian capital were decked out with Chinese flags, along with posters and billboards that proclaimed a \"warm welcome\" to \"Chinese friends\".\n\nXi's visit also coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which killed three people.\n\n\"Do not forget that our Chinese friends were with us 25 years ago when this country was being demolished and bombed,\" Vucic told the crowds.\n\n\"They paid a high price, they lost people only a few hundred meters from here on this very day.\"\n\nThe embassy was hit during a months-long, US-led NATO campaign targeting Serbian security forces who were at war with ethnic-Albanian insurgents in Kosovo.\n\nThe US later apologised, saying outdated maps had led the pilot to strike the wrong target.\n\nOn Tuesday, Xi wrote in the Serbian daily Politika that NATO had \"flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy\", warning that China would \"never allow such tragic history to repeat itself\".\n\nChina has long backed Serbia's territoral claims over the breakaway province of Kosovo and along with Russia has prevented its recognition at the United Nations.\n\nSerbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told state broadcaster RTS that discussions Wednesday would centre on \"a great project\" and a \"major investment from China in a very promising area.\"\n\n\"For Serbia, this is without a doubt one of the most significant visits,\" Marko Tmusic, a political sciences professor at the University of Belgrade, told AFP.\n\n\"Standing 'shoulder to shoulder' with France -- with whom China marks 60 years of diplomatic relations -- and Hungary... is certainly a great honour\" for Serbia, he added.\n\nPeople in Belgrade welcomed Xi's visit.\n\n\"I think it's an excellent thing, this visit from the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world,\" 67-year-old Stojan Vidovic, a retiree, told AFP.\n\nIn France, Xi met with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. They urged him not to allow the export of technology that could be used by Russia in Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go later Wednesday to Hungary where China has invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing plants.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [],

He will fly to Hungary later in the day.\n\n\"We are writing history today,\" Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told a large crowd that had gathered in front of the Serbian presidential palace to welcome Xi, applauding and chanting \"China, China\".\n\nThe two countries signed 29 agreements promoting legal, regulatory and economic co-operation. Serbia will also become the first European country in years to enter into a free-trade agreement with China when a deal signed in 2023 comes into effect on July 1.\n\nTop investor\n\nVucic said that since 2020 China had been the single-largest investor in Serbia, and that its investment was up 30-fold over the past decade. The free-trade deal will guarantee tariff-free exports for 95% of Serbian products to China over the next five to 10 years, he said.\n\nXi said that China was ready to import more high-quality agricultural products from Serbia and would welcome more direct flights between Belgrade and Chinese cities.\n\nBoth leaders boast of an ironclad partnership. Along with Hungary, Serbia is Europe's firmest supporter of China's huge Belt and Road infrastructure project across parts of Asia and Europe.\n\n\"Serbia became China's first strategic partner in central and Eastern Europe eight years ago, and it becomes the first European country with which we shall build a community with shared future,\" Xi said.\n\nThe two leaders said they would support each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, meaning that Serbia considers Taiwan, viewed by Beijing as a breakaway province, to be part of China, just as China considers Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, as part of Serbia.\n\n\"We shall jointly confront hegemony and the politics of power,\" Xi said.\n\nSymbolism\n\nXi's visit comes on the anniversary of the 1999 Nato bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during a campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\nNato said the bombing, which killed three Chinese journalists and wounded 20 Chinese nationals, was accidental. It prompted outrage in China and an apology from then US president Bill Clinton.\n\n\"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself,\" Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday.\n\nVucic said the two countries had agreed to establish an intergovernmental technology committee that would enable Serbia to get access to the latest technologies and use of artificial intelligence.\n\nChina owns mines and factories across Serbia and has lent billions for roads, bridges and new facilities, becoming Serbia's key partner in much-needed infrastructure development.\n\nXi left France on Tuesday after a two-day trip during which he offered no major concessions on trade or foreign policy, even as President Emmanuel Macron

He said hs visit to Serbia is \"historic\" because it opens the path for even closer ties.\n\n\"We are writing history today, although it doesn't seem so to many (people),\" Vucic said. \"We thank President Xi. He hasn't come to Europe in five years and he has again chosen our little Serbia.\"\n\nAt the start of the official meeting on Wednesday, Xi said \"we are first-hand witnesses that the Serbian people view Chinese people as ironclad best friends.\"\n\n\"This is truly two-sided and truthful friendship ... I truly hail this and it really made an extremely deep impression on me,\" Xi said, according to the state RTS television.\n\nXi will proceed to Hungary later on Wednesday. Like Serbia, Hungary is seen as one of China's more friendly partners in Europe.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible throughout the Serbian capital. A huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nChina has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nSerbia, a landlocked nation in the heart of the Balkans, has been a key country in China's Belt and Road initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nXi also arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date -- the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by U.S. jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed.\n\nThe incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\nChinese companies run Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbor Hungary.\n\n\"Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xi said in a statement published by China's Foreign Ministry.\n\n\"Standing at a new historical starting point, China will work with Serbia to jointly stay committed to the original aspiration and forge ahead together to open up a new vista dcChina-Serbia cooperation,\" added Xi. \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\"\n\nIn 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernize the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe more than $2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after the Russian

Yes, Taiwan is China\".\n\nBeijing claims the self-ruled island as its own, and said it will not rule out using force to bring the island under Chinese control.\n\nAs the two leaders sat down for meetings, Xi told Vucic in opening comments that there was a \"strong feeling of friendship between our two countries\".\n\nXi arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday evening following a state visit to France that saw sometimes robust exchanges with President Emmanuel Macron on trade and China's close ties to Russia despite the Ukraine war.\n\nThe other two countries chosen for Xi's first trip to Europe since 2019 -- with Hungary as the final stop after Serbia -- are among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.\n\nStreets in the Serbian capital were decked out with Chinese flags, along with posters and billboards that proclaimed a \"warm welcome\" to \"Chinese friends\".\n\n- NATO bombing -\n\nXi's visit also coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which killed three people.\n\n\"Do not forget that our Chinese friends were with us 25 years ago when this country was being demolished and bombed,\" Vucic told the crowds.\n\n\"They paid a high price, they lost people only a few hundred meters from here on this very day.\"\n\nThe embassy was hit during a months-long, US-led NATO campaign targeting Serbian security forces who were at war with ethnic-Albanian insurgents in Kosovo.\n\nThe US later apologised, saying outdated maps had led the pilot to strike the wrong target.\n\nOn Tuesday, Xi wrote in the Serbian daily Politika that NATO had \"flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy\", warning that China would \"never allow such tragic history to repeat itself\".\n\nChina has long backed Serbia's territoral claims over the breakaway province of Kosovo and along with Russia has prevented its recognition at the United Nations.\n\nSerbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told state broadcaster RTS that discussions Wednesday would centre on \"a great project\" and a \"major investment from China in a very promising area.\"\n\n- Ukraine fears -\n\n\"For Serbia, this is without a doubt one of the most significant visits,\" Marko Tmusic, a political sciences professor at the University of Belgrade, told AFP.\n\n\"Standing 'shoulder to shoulder' with France -- with whom China marks 60 years of diplomatic relations -- and Hungary... is certainly a great honour\" for Serbia, he added.\n\nPeople in Belgrade welcomed Xi's visit.\n\n\"I think it's an excellent thing, this visit from the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world,\" 67-year-old Stojan Vidovic, a retiree, told AFP.\n\nIn France, Xi met with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. They urged him not to allow the export of technology that could be used by Russia in Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go later Wednesday to Hungary where China has invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing plants.\n\nbur-rox/ds", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mina_pejakovic@ktbs.com", "name": "Mina Pejakovic", "type":

Mt. Vucic said Mr. Xi's visit was a \"great honour\" and China is an \"inspiration\" for Serbia.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible -- a huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nChina has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nSerbia, a landlocked nation in the heart of the Balkans, has been a key country in China's Belt and Road initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nPeople wave Chinese and Serbian flags outside the Palace of Serbia during a welcome ceremony for Chinese President Xi Jinping in Belgrade. | Photo Credit: AFP\n\nMr. Xi also arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date: the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by U.S. jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed. The incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\n'Ironclad' Serbia-China friendship\n\n\"Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Mr. Xi said in an arrival statement published by China's Foreign Ministry. He described the Serbia-China friendship as \"ironclad.\"\n\n\"Standing at a new historical starting point, China will work with Serbia to jointly stay committed to the original aspiration and forge ahead together to open up a new vista in China-Serbia cooperation with stronger momentum, greater scope, and higher quality,\" he said, adding, \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\"\n\nChinese companies are running Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbor Hungary.\n\nIn 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernize the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe more than $2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system flown in on Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes.\n\nThe arms delivery over the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkey and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China's growing global reach.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Yes, Taiwan is China.\"\n\nBeijing claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own and said it would not rule out using force to bring the island under Chinese control.\n\nAs the two leaders sat down for meetings, Xi told Vucic there was a \"strong feeling of friendship between our two countries.\" They later appeared together to sign a joint declaration, with commercial promises including the purchase of new Chinese trains, new air links and increased Serbian imports.\n\nXi's visit coincides with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which killed three people.\n\n\"Do not forget that our Chinese friends were with us 25 years ago when this country was being demolished and bombed,\" Vucic told the crowds. \"They paid a high price, they lost people only a few hundred meters from here on this very day.\"\n\nThe embassy was hit during a months-long, US-led NATO campaign targeting Serbian security forces who were at war with ethnic-Albanian insurgents in Kosovo. The US later apologized, saying outdated maps had led the pilot to strike the wrong target.\n\nXi wrote in the Serbian daily Politika that China would \"never allow such tragic history to repeat

Serbia was the first Central and Eastern European country to become China's comprehensive strategic partner eight years ago.\n\n\"It is a strategic choice made by both sides to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era. Its goal is to realize the aspiration of the two peoples for a better life. Its foundation and driving force come from the firm support and extensive participation of the two peoples,\" Xi told reporters during a joint press conference with Vucic.\n\nXi also announced six measures to support the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future.\n\nChina is ready to import more quality and distinctive agricultural products from Serbia. China welcomes Serbia to increase direct flights between Belgrade and Shanghai, and encourages airlines from both sides to launch direct flights between Belgrade and Guangzhou.\n\nThe Chinese side will aid 50 young Serbian scientists in exchange programs with China for the next three years and a total of 300 Serbian youths will be invited to study in China in the next three years, said Xi.\n\nChina supports Serbia in hosting Expo 2027, and will send a delegation to participate in the grand show. China encourages its enterprises to take part in the construction of relevant projects, Xi said.\n\nWith joint efforts from China and Serbia, the free trade agreement between the two countries will take effect on July 1, Xi said.\n\nDuring his talks with Vucic on Wednesday in Belgrade, Xi said bilateral relations between China and Serbia are richer in content and have become a model of friendly relations between China and European countries.\n\nXi called on China and Serbia to carry forward the innovative nature of bilateral relations, open up new prospects for cooperation, and make innovative cooperation a new growth point of bilateral ties.\n\nXi was greeted by tens of thousands of Serbians on Wednesday and a welcoming ceremony was held outside the Palace of Serbia before the meeting between the two leaders.\n\nChinese national flags and Chinese-language welcoming banners were hanging on landmark buildings in Belgrade on Wednesday.\n\nChinese and Serbian experts said the meeting between the two heads of state will continue to provide high-level guidance to the sound development of bilateral relationship for the years to come and further inject vitality into the time-weathered, ironclad friendship.\n\nIronclad friendship\n\nOn Tuesday, a signed article by President Xi titled \"May the Light of Our Ironclad Friendship Shine on the Path of China-Serbia Cooperation\" was published in Serbian media Politika.\n\nXi noted in the article that \"there has always been an affinity between Chinese and Serbian peoples despite the long distance between us. During the bitter Anti-Fascist War and our respective nation-building in the last century, the Chinese and Serbian peoples forged a strong friendship that extends through time and space.\"\n\n\"Amid the ongoing transformations unseen in a century in the world, our mutual support remains as strong as ever, our cooperation is closer, and our exchanges and mutual learning more substantive. Whatever changes in the international landscape, China and Serbia remain true friends and good partners. Our ironclad friendship is ever-growing, setting a model for state-to-state and people-to-people interactions,\" Xi wrote.\n\nXi said China and Serbia should always be good friends and treat each other with sincerity, good partners for win-win cooperation, play an exemplary role in promoting fairness and justice and strengthen the heart-to-heart connection between their two peoples.\n\nWith China's support, hundreds of kilometers of highways have been built, the fastest railway in Eastern Europe entered operation, and energy facilities keep renewing, Boyan Lalic, Director of the Belt and Road Institute Belgrade, told the Global Times Wednesday.\n\nThe China-built high-speed railway connecting Belgrade to Novi Sad, inexpensive and comfortable, has cut the previously 1.5-hour trip to just 36 minutes, making a two-city life possible for many young people seeking opportunities, the Global Times learned.\n\nThe railway is part of a more ambitious project linking Belgrade and Budapest, the capital of Hungary, which could finish construction as early as 2025. The project has created jobs, offered unique career experience and trainings, and has allowed people like Serbian engineer Aleksandra Milosavljevic to \"make really good friends with my Chinese colleagues.\"\n\nJoin hands on international stage\n\nIn the signed article, Xi wrote \"Twenty-five years ago today, NATO flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia ... This we should never forget. The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\"\n\nThe China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides, Xi wrote.\n\nDong Yifan, a research fellow at the Institute of European Studies, China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that both China and Serbia adhere to independence and non-alignment in their strategic approaches, choosing to follow their own development paths and opposing hegemony. \"We share a strong consensus in international affairs.\"\n\nThe last stop of Xi's three-nation European trip is Hungary, during which a series of cooperation agreements are expected to be signed, according to media reports.\n\nBoth Serbia and Hungary are pillar countries in China-proposed BRI, and have long been at the forefront of European countries' relations with China with close cooperation, Dong said, adding that high-level diplomacy has played a key role in the two countries' relations with China.\n\nHe Zhigao, a research fellow with the Institute of European Studies of CASS, said that Serbia and Hungary \"stand out\" among European countries in regard to developing China ties partly because they can overcome some external restraints and make more independent decisions based on their own interests.", "source": {"uri": "globaltimes.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global Times \u73af\u7403\u65f6\u62a5\u82f1\u6587\u7248"}, "authors": [],

Vucic said that since 2020 China had been the single-largest investor in Serbia, and that its investment was up 30-fold over the past decade.\n\nChina and Serbia on Wednesday agreed to follow a \"shared future\" as President Xi Jinping visited the Balkan country as part of his bid to forge stronger relations with allies at the edge of the European Union. Xi is on his first European tour in five years, and the trip was seen as an effort to strengthen ties with eastern European countries that are pro-Russia and large recipients of Chinese investment. He will fly to Hungary later in the day.\n\n\"We are writing history today,\" Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told a large crowd that had gathered in front of the Serbian presidential palace to welcome Xi, applauding and chanting \"China, China\". The two countries signed 29 agreements promoting legal, regulatory and economic cooperation. Serbia will also become the first European country in years to enter into a free trade agreement with China when a deal signed last year comes into effect on July 1.\n\nVucic said that since 2020 China had been the single-largest investor in Serbia, and that its investment was up 30-fold over the past decade. The free trade deal will guarantee tariff-free exports for 95% of Serbian products to China over the next five to 10 years, he said. Xi said that China was ready to import more high-quality agricultural products from Serbia and would welcome more direct flights between Belgrade and Chinese cities.\n\nBoth leaders boast of an ironclad partnership. Along with Hungary, Serbia is Europe's firmest supporter of China's huge Belt and Road infrastructure project across parts of Asia and Europe. \"Serbia became China's first strategic partner in central and eastern Europe eight years ago, and it becomes the first European country with which we shall build a community with shared future,\" Xi said.\n\nThe two leaders said they would support each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, meaning that Serbia considers Taiwan, viewed by Beijing as a breakaway province, to be part of China, just as China considers Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, as part of Serbia. \"We shall jointly confront hegemony and the politics of power,\" Xi said.\n\nSYMBOLISM OF THE VISIT Xi\u00b4s visit comes on the anniversary of the 1999 NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during a campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\nNATO said the bombing, which killed three Chinese journalists and wounded 20 Chinese nationals, was accidental. It prompted outrage in China and an apology from then U.S. President Bill Clinton. \"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself,\" Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday.\n\nVucic said the two countries had agreed to establish an inter-governmental technology committee that would enable Serbia to get access to the latest technologies and use of artificial intelligence. China owns mines and factories across Serbia and has lent billions for roads, bridges and new facilities, becoming Serbia's key partner in much-needed infrastructure development.\n\nXi left France on Tuesday after a two-day trip during which he offered no major concessions on trade or foreign policy, even as President Emmanuel Macron pressed him on market access and Ukraine.

Vucic said Xi's visit was a \"great honor\" and that China is an \"inspiration\" for Serbia.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible -- a huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nChina has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nSerbia, a landlocked nation in the heart of the Balkans, has been a key country in China's Belt and Road initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nXi also arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date: the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by U.S. jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed.\n\nThe incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\n\"Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xi said in an arrival statement published by China's Foreign Ministry. He described the Serbia-China friendship as \"ironclad.\"\n\n\"Standing at a new historical starting point, China will work with Serbia to jointly stay committed to the original aspiration and forge ahead together to open up a new vista in China-Serbia cooperation with stronger momentum, greater scope, and higher quality,\" added Xi. \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\"\n\nChinese companies are running Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbor Hungary.\n\nIn 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernize the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe more than $2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system flown in on Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes.\n\nThe arms delivery over the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkey and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China's growing global reach.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He said that high-technology projects will be discussed.\n\n\"Serbia does not have a visa regime with China,\" Mali told state TV RTS. \"Thus we are totally open to their investments,\" he said, adding that the Western countries impose barriers and quotas on Chinese investment and produce.\n\nObservers say Xi's choice of Serbia and Hungary is designed to pull closer two European countries that are pro-Russia and large recipients of Chinese investment. Serbia's Western partners view the country as a Chinese hub at the gateway to the EU.\n\nDuring his visit to France, President Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen pressed Xi to ensure more balanced trade with Europe and to use his influence on Russia to end the war in Ukraine, but to no avail, according to analysts.\n\nSYMBOLISM OF THE VISIT\n\nXi\u00b4s visit comes on

Yes, Taiwan is China.\" China has stepped up diplomatic pressure on the island that it has claimed for decades.\n\nThe Chinese president arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday from a state visit to France that saw sometimes robust exchanges with President Emmanuel Macron on trade and China's close ties to Russia despite the Ukraine war.\n\nThe other two countries chosen for Xi's first trip to Europe since 2019 - with Hungary as the final stop after Serbia - are among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.\n\nSerbian Finance Minister Sinisa Mali told state broadcaster RTS that discussions Wednesday would center on \"a great project.\"\n\n\"We are aiming to attract a major investment from China in a very promising area,\" he said, adding \"I won't reveal our cards at this moment.\"\n\nStreets in the Serbian capital were decked out with Chinese flags along with posters and billboards that proclaimed a \"warm welcome\" to \"Chinese friends.\"\n\nXi's visit also coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy there, which killed three people.\n\n\"Do not forget that our Chinese friends were with us 25 years ago when this country was being demolished and bombed,\" Vucic told the crowds.\n\n\"They paid a high price, they lost people only a few hundred meters from here on this very day.\"\n\nThe embassy was hit during a monthslong, U.S.-led NATO campaign targeting Serbian security forces who were at war with ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\nThe U.S. later apologized, saying outdated maps had led the pilot to strike the wrong target.\n\nOn Tuesday, Xi wrote in the Serbian daily Politika that NATO had \"flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia,\" warning that China would \"never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\"\n\nChina has long backed Serbia's territorial claims over the breakaway province of Kosovo and along with Russia has prevented its recognition in the United Nations.\n\nHe also hailed the \"ironclad friendship\" between China and Serbia, which he said was \"forged with the blood of our compatriots.\"\n\nStefan Vladisavljev, program director at the Foundation BFPE for a Responsible Society, said that the date of the visit gave it \"significant symbolic importance.\"\n\nPeople in Belgrade welcomed Xi's visit.\n\n\"I think it's an excellent thing, this visit from the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world,\" 67-year-old Stojan Vidovic, a retiree, told AFP.\n\n\"It's fantastic for us,\" agreed 69-year-old Dijana Radic, a former translator. She said she hoped there would be \"results from this visit, something good for both parties.\"\n\nIn France, Xi met with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. They urged him not to allow the export of technology that Russia could use in Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go later Wednesday to Hungary where China has invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing plants.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@dailysabah.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse",

Xi will proceed to Hungary later on Wednesday, which, like Serbia, is seen as one of China's more friendly partners in Europe. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and other top officials welcomed Xi at the airport on Tuesday after his plane was escorted by military jets. Vucic said Xi's visit was a \"great honour'' and that China is an \"inspiration\" for Serbia. Signs of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible -- a huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nChina has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nSerbia, a landlocked nation in the heart of the Balkans, has been a key country in China's Belt and Road initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nXi also arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date: the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by US jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed. The incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia. \"Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xi said in an arrival statement published by China's Foreign Ministry. He described the Serbia-China friendship as \"ironclad\".\n\n\"Standing at a new historical starting point, China will work with Serbia to jointly stay committed to the original aspiration and forge ahead together to open up a new vista in China-Serbia cooperation with stronger momentum, greater scope, and higher quality,\" added Xi.\n\n\"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\" Chinese companies are running Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbour Hungary. In 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernise the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe more than USD 2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays. In 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system flown in on Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes. The arms delivery over the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkiye and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China's growing global reach.\n\n(This story has not been

Among those welcoming Xi at the Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vucic. The two heads of state will hold meetings on Wednesday.\n\nTwo fighter jets were dispatched to escort Xi's plane upon its entry into Serbia's airspace. Over the past days, the streets of Belgrade have been richly ornamented with Chinese features, not least the flying Chinese national flags and waving banners.\n\nIn a signed article published Tuesday in Politika, a Belgrade-based Serbian daily, Xi wrote that the ironclad friendship between the two countries is ever-growing. \"Whatever changes in the international landscape, China and Serbia remain true friends and good partners.\"\n\n\"Together we will build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era,\" Xi wrote.\n\nThe Chinese president's arrival coincides with the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nIn 1999, the U.S.-led NATO forces carried out savage airstrikes for 78 days against Yugoslavia, leaving more than 8,000 civilians dead or injured and nearly 1 million more displaced. On the night of May 7, exactly 25 years ago, NATO bombed the Chinese embassy, killing three Chinese journalists, including one from Xinhua.\n\n\"The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself,\" Xi wrote in the article. \"The China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides.\"\n\nAleksandar Mitic, research fellow in International Relations at the Institute of International Politics and Economics in Belgrade, told Xinhua that the friendship, tempered by blood and fire, \"will represent a cornerstone for cooperation in the future.\"\n\nDuring Xi's last state visit to Serbia in 2016, Xi made the site of the old embassy as his first stop to pay homage to the Chinese martyrs killed in the NATO bombing in 1999.\n\nThe ruins of the embassy have now been revamped into a Chinese cultural center for local residents in Serbia to learn both Chinese language and traditional culture. The square outside the center was also renamed \"Serbia-China Friendship Square.\"\n\nGordana, a local resident working nearby who didn't reveal her full name, referred to the bombing as a \"painful memory\" to her. \"The cooperation between China and Serbia holds the promise of providing my children with a better life than I experienced,\" she told Xinhua.\n\nPast years have seen leapfrog growth of China-Serbia cooperation. Two-way trade in 2023 surged to $4.35 billion, Chinese customs statistics showed. In 2022, China became the largest source of direct investment for Serbia. In October 2023, witnessed by Xi and Vucic, China and Serbia signed a free trade agreement. After the deal takes effect, more than 60 percent of taxable items will become tariff-free immediately, and the final import volume proportion of both sides with zero-tariff items will reach about 95 percent.\n\nUnder the framework of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative are flagship projects such as the Smederevo Steelworks and the high-speed railway between Belgrade and Budapest. An integral segment of the Belgrade-Budapest railway is the high-speed train linking Belgrade and Serbia's second-largest city Novi Sad, which has transported some 6.83 million passengers over the past two years.\n\n\"We mainly cooperated in the field of transportation and energy field,\" said Katarina Zakic, head of the Regional Centre Belt and Road at the Institute of International Politics and Economics. In the future, cooperation will be important in the fields of green energy and e-commerce, she told Xinhua.\n\nAlready, Chinese companies and their Serbian counterparts are working on a number of green energy programs, such as the Saraorci Photovoltaic Project. Upon completion, the project will provide more than 16 million kilowatt-hours of green electricity every year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 16,000 tons.\n\nSerbia, undoubtedly, stands as a reliable partner for China in Europe, said Aleksandar Vojvodic, head engineer of the Clean Serbia Project of China Road and Bridge Corporation.\n\nThere will be a promising prospect for further enhancement and expansion of existing cooperation, said Vojvodic.", "source": {"uri": "bjreview.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beijing Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In Serbia, which is seen as China's most important partner in the Balkans, Xi is expected to discuss China\u00b4s multi-billion investment in the country and possible new deals.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic and government officials welcomed Xi at the Belgrade airport, where he was greeted by a military guard of honor and folk dancers. The two leaders will hold a meeting on Wednesday.\n\nOn May 7, 1999, 20 Chinese nationals were wounded in the NATO attack, which prompted outrage in China and an apology from then U.S. President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe embassy was hit during a campaign against the then Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\n\"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself,\" Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday.\n\n\"The friendship between China and Serbia which is soaked in blood that the two peoples spilled together has become a joint memory of the two peoples and will encourage both parties to make together huge steps forward,\" Xi said.\n\nThe Belgrade streets were decorated with Chinese flags and placards as thousands of police officers were deployed to secure Xi and his 400-member entourage, the highest-level visit by a foreign leader in years.\n\nXi is visiting Serbia after France, where President Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen pressed him to ensure more balanced trade with Europe and use his influence on Russia to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nDuring his first visit to Belgrade in 2016, the two countries signed a strategic partnership. Last year, Vucic signed 18 agreements with Xi in Beijing, including a free trade deal that should become operational in July.\n\nBoth leaders insist on an ironclad partnership between their countries. Along with Hungary, which is Xi\u00b4s next stop, Serbia is Europe's firmest supporter of China's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nChina runs mines and factories across Serbia and has lent billions for roads, bridges and new facilities, becoming Serbia's key partner in much-needed infrastructure development.\n\nObservers say Xi's choice of Serbia and Hungary is designed to pull closer two European countries that are pro-Russia and large recipients of Chinese investment. Serbia's Western partners view the country as a Chinese hub at the gateway to the EU.\n\nIn 2023, China was Serbia's second-largest trading partner after the EU with a total trade exchange of $6.1 billion and among its top five investors, according to the national investment agency.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2024.", "source": {"uri": "japantoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Japan

bring the island under Chinese control.\n\nAs the two leaders sat down for meetings, Xi told Vucic in opening comments that there was a \"strong feeling of friendship between our two countries\".\n\nXi arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday evening following a state visit to France that saw sometimes robust exchanges with President Emmanuel Macron on trade and China's close ties to Russia despite the Ukraine war.\n\nThe other two countries chosen for Xi's first trip to Europe since 2019 -- with Hungary as the final stop after Serbia -- are among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.\n\nStreets in the Serbian capital were decked out with Chinese flags, along with posters and billboards that proclaimed a \"warm welcome\" to \"Chinese friends\".\n\nXi's visit also coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which killed three people.\n\n\"Do not forget that our Chinese friends were with us 25 years ago when this country was being demolished and bombed,\" Vucic told the crowds.\n\n\"They paid a high price, they lost people only a few hundred meters from here on this very day.\"\n\nThe embassy was hit during a months-long, US-led NATO campaign targeting Serbian security forces who were at war with ethnic-Albanian insurgents in Kosovo.\n\nThe US later apologised, saying outdated maps had led the pilot to strike the wrong target.\n\nOn Tuesday, Xi wrote in the Serbian daily Politika that NATO had \"flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy\", warning that China would \"never allow such tragic history to repeat itself\".\n\nChina has long backed Serbia's territorial claims over the breakaway province of Kosovo and along with Russia has prevented its recognition at the United Nations.\n\nSerbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told state broadcaster RTS that discussions Wednesday would centre on \"a great project\" and a \"major investment from China in a very promising area.\"\n\n\"For Serbia, this is without a doubt one of the most significant visits,\" Marko Tmusic, a political sciences professor at the University of Belgrade, told AFP.\n\n\"Standing 'shoulder to shoulder' with France -- with whom China marks 60 years of diplomatic relations -- and Hungary... is certainly a great honour\" for Serbia, he added.\n\nPeople in Belgrade welcomed Xi's visit. \"I think it's an excellent thing, this visit from the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world,\" 67-year-old Stojan Vidovic, a retiree, told AFP.\n\nREAD ALSO: China's economic partnership with Nigeria

causing global trade imbalances.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nREAD ALSO: China, Nigeria to harness cultural talents toward deepening diplomatic relations\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go later Wednesday to Hungary where China has invested

Ukraine", "body": "BELGRADE -- Chinese President Xi Jinping, fresh off apparently successful talks in Serbia, has departed for Hungary, where he is scheduled to meet with another authoritarian leader, Prime Minister Viktor Orban, and where he'll likely receive another warm welcome.\n\nXi left Belgrade on May 8 after meeting there with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic at a city palace where thousands of people were gathered to greet them as both men lauded their countries' friendship as \"ironclad\" and issued a joint statement to boost cooperation toward \"a common future in the new era.\"\n\nXi is on a rare, six-day European tour that already took him to France to meet with President Emmanuel Macron and EU leaders, who urged him to ease Chinese trade restrictions and to use his influence to press Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nXi's first trip to Europe in five years is seen as part of his drive to increase Beijing's influence on the continent's economic and political affairs.\n\nThe Sino-Serbian agreement signed by Xi and Vucic raises the level of their cooperation from strategic partnership to \"building the community of Serbia and China with a common future in the new era.\"\n\nAfter a series of bilateral meetings, Vucic called it \"the highest form of cooperation between the two countries.\"\n\nXi said their countries will \"jointly oppose hegemony and power politics\" in the interest of \"fundamental and long-term interests.\"\n\nHe called their bilateral political trust \"strong as a rock.\"\n\nVucic has promoted Chinese investment and trade and diplomatic ties for his Balkan nation of around 7 million as he has sought to balance outreach to Russia and China and the bucking of Western sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine war with his country's bid for eventual EU membership.\n\nSpeaking from a balcony of the palace, Vucic thanked Xi for visiting \"little Serbia\" and said they were \"making history today even though it doesn't seem so to many.\"\n\nXi called it a \"truly two-sided and honest friendship,\" according to Serbian state television.\n\nLike Moscow, Beijing has supported Belgrade diplomatically in its refusal to recognize former province Kosovo's independence, while Belgrade has supported China's claims to Taiwan. \"Taiwan is China,\" Vucic said on May 8, citing the UN Charter.\n\nXi's visit was seemingly timed to coincide with the 25th anniversary of NATO's bombing of the former Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999, a deadly incident that has united Beijing and Belgrade in their criticism of Western intervention in the Balkans and around the world.\n\nChina has invested some $6 billion in Serbia in the past decade, putting the money into copper mines and a steel mill as well as major highway and infrastructure projects that have been criticized by some as nontransparent and overly risky deals between governments.\n\nChinese and Serbian officials were expected to sign more than 30 agreements in areas that Vucic suggested were in many cases aimed at boosting technology and innovation in Serbia.\n\nAhead of the Chinese president's arrival, Belgrade was decorated with flags of Serbia and China, and welcome messages were set up along the route from the airport to the city center in Serbian and Chinese.\n\nXi also made Serbia a stop in 2016, when he signed a free-trade agreement with Belgrade that alarmed skeptics of Chinese economic and political intentions in Europe.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

Yes, Taiwan is China\".\n\nBeijing claims the self-ruled island as its own, and said it will not rule out using force to bring the island under Chinese control.\n\nAs the two leaders sat down for meetings, Xi told Vucic in opening comments that there was a \"strong feeling of friendship between our two countries\".\n\nXi arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday evening following a state visit to France that saw sometimes robust exchanges with President Emmanuel Macron on trade and China's close ties to Russia despite the Ukraine war.\n\nThe other two countries chosen for Xi's first trip to Europe since 2019 -- with Hungary as the final stop after Serbia -- are among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.\n\nStreets in the Serbian capital were decked out with Chinese flags, along with posters and billboards that proclaimed a \"warm welcome\" to \"Chinese friends\".\n\n- NATO bombing -\n\nXi's visit also coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which killed three people.\n\n\"Do not forget that our Chinese friends were with us 25 years ago when this country was being demolished and bombed,\" Vucic told the crowds.\n\n\"They paid a high price, they lost people only a few hundred meters from here on this very day.\"\n\nMore from this section Tory minister Mark Harper issues defiant message after local election woes: 'Up for that fight!' NY: ACE Awards 2024 - Arrivals - 53059655 Officials: 2 firefighters hospitalized; dog dies in Wayne house fire\n\nThe embassy was hit during a months-long, US-led NATO campaign targeting Serbian security forces who were at war with ethnic-Albanian insurgents in Kosovo.\n\nThe US later apologised, saying outdated maps had led the pilot to strike the wrong target.\n\nOn Tuesday, Xi wrote in the Serbian daily Politika that NATO had \"flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy\", warning that China would \"never allow such tragic history to repeat itself\".\n\nChina has long backed Serbia's territoral claims over the breakaway province of Kosovo and along with Russia has prevented its recognition at the United Nations.\n\nSerbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told state broadcaster RTS that discussions Wednesday would centre on \"a great project\" and a \"major investment from China in a very promising area.\"\n\n- Ukraine fears -\n\n\"For Serbia, this is without a doubt one of the most significant visits,\" Marko Tmusic, a political sciences professor at the University of Belgrade, told AFP.\n\n\"Standing 'shoulder to shoulder' with France -- with whom China marks 60 years of diplomatic relations -- and Hungary... is certainly a great honour\" for Serbia, he added.\n\nPeople in Belgrade welcomed Xi's visit.\n\n\"I think it's an excellent thing, this visit from the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world,\" 67-year-old Stojan Vidovic, a retiree, told AFP.\n\nIn France, Xi met with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. They urged him not to allow the export of technology that could be used by Russia in Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go later Wednesday to Hungary where China has invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing plants.\n\nbur-rox/ds", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mina_pejakovic@reformer.com", "name":

'Taiwan is China,' Vucic said on May 8, citing the UN Charter.\n\nXi's visit was seemingly timed to coincide with the 25th anniversary of NATO's bombing of the former Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999, a deadly incident that has united Beijing and Belgrade in their criticism of Western intervention in the Balkans and around the world.\n\nChina has invested some $6 billion in Serbia in the past decade, putting the money into copper mines and a steel mill as well as major highway and infrastructure projects that have been criticized by some as nontransparent and overly risky deals between governments.\n\nChinese and Serbian officials were expected to sign more than 30 agreements in areas that Vucic suggested were in many cases aimed at boosting technology and innovation in Serbia.\n\nAhead of the Chinese president's arrival, Belgrade was decorated with flags of Serbia and China, and welcome messages were set up along the route from the airport to the city center in Serbian and Chinese.\n\nXi also made Serbia a stop in 2016, when he signed a free-trade agreement with Belgrade that alarmed skeptics of Chinese economic and political intentions in Europe.\n\nWith reporting by AP\n\nCopyright (c) 2018.

in Serbia", "body": "China has invested billions of dollars in Serbia and the Balkans, especially in the mining and manufacturing sectors\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping was received \"with respect and love\" by his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic in the Serbian capital on Wednesday, a new leg of his European tour that has already taken him to France and will end in Hungary.\n\nChina has invested billions of dollars in Serbia and the Balkans, especially in the mining and manufacturing sectors, and Beijing and Belgrade signed a free trade agreement last year.\n\nAccompanied by his wife Peng Liyuan, Xi Jinping was greeted on Wednesday by Aleksandar Vucic on a red carpet in front of the main government buildings to the sound of the military band.\n\nThe two leaders greeted a crowd of several thousand people, some waving Chinese flags, from a balcony, according to footage from Serbian state television RTS.\n\nVucic welcomed Xi Jinping and called him \"a friend of Serbia\". \"The respect and love you will find here, in our Serbia, you will not find anywhere else,\" he added.\n\nThe Chinese president was greeted by his country's national anthem, before shaking hands with several Serbian officials.\n\n\"Yes, Taiwan is China,\" Vucic told the crowd, a statement in line with China's claim to the island, which it considers part of its territory.\n\nAt the start of their bilateral meeting, Xi told Vucic that there was \"a strong feeling of friendship\" between the two countries.\n\nThey then met to sign a joint statement on strengthening their diplomatic relations and attended the presentation of several draft trade agreements, including the purchase of Chinese trains, new air links and increased imports of Serbian goods.\n\nThe Chinese president arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday evening after a state visit to France where he was received with pomp by French President Emmanuel Macron and they discussed trade disputes and Beijing-Moscow relations, which the West frowns upon in the context of the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to France and Serbia, on his first trip to Europe since 2019, Xi Jinping will visit Hungary.\n\nSerbia and Hungary are considered the most friendly countries with Russia and China on the European continent.\n\nSerbian Finance Minister Sinisa Mali told RTS that Wednesday's talks would focus on \"a big project\", without giving further details.\n\nXi Jinping's visit to Belgrade coincides with the 25th anniversary of the US bombing of the Chinese embassy, which killed three people on May 7, 1999, as part of a NATO campaign against Serb targets during the Kosovo war.\n\nThe US later apologised and claimed that the maps were out of date.\n\nSpeaking about the event in an article published on Tuesday in the Serbian daily Politika, Xi Jinping said NATO had \"brazenly bombed\" the embassy.\n\n\"The Chinese people cherish peace, but will never allow the tragedy of history to happen again,\" he stressed, also extolling the \"unfailing friendship\" between China and Serbia.\n\nSerbs interviewed by AFP in Belgrade said they welcomed Xi Jinping's arrival.\n\n\"I think it's a great thing, this visit by the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world,\" said Stojan Vidovic, a 67-year-old pensioner.\n\n\"It's fantastic for us,\" said Dijana Radic, 69, who hopes the visit will lead to \"something good for both sides\".", "source": {"uri": "atalayar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atalayar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Xinhua correspondent Shao Junhaun and Guangming daily correspondents Su Xinghua and Zhu Ying were killed.\n\nIn the rocket attack on the Chinese Embassy, which happened 15 minutes before midnight, 20 people were injured. The embassy, which was visibly marked as a building of diplomatic importance, was hit by three missiles, and in addition to the main building, auxiliary buildings in the embassy yard were also destroyed.\n\nIn the attack on the embassy, buildings in the immediate vicinity suffered significant damage, especially the \"Energoprojekt\" building and the JBC Residential and Business Center.\n\nA memorial plaque was discovered at the site of the bombing in 2009.\n\nIn an author's text for daily Politika, Chinese President Xi Jinping states that he still remembers the friendly scene during his previous visit to Serbia and that he is looking forward to meeting Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107.\n\n\"When summer approaches, all plants bloom. In this time full of hope, at the invitation of President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, I will pay a state visit to the Republic of Serbia.

Friendly scenes during my last visit to Serbia 8 years ago are still vivid in my mind, and in the past 8 years the close cooperation between the two sides has already achieved fruitful results of cooperation and injects new vitality into the steel friendship between China and Serbia,\" the Chinese president writes in an author's text for Politika.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, who is arriving in Belgrade today, was in France yesterday, where he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron. On that occasion, the two leaders confirmed their commitment to promoting a political solution to the Iranian nuclear issue.\n\nIn a joint statement, Xi and Macron called for \"concrete implementation\" of the two-state solution when it comes to the conflict in the Gaza Strip and condemned Israel's policy of building settlements in the West Bank, Reuters reports citing Chinese state media. Xi and Macron urged all sides to refrain from taking unilateral steps on the ground that could increase tensions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nVu\u010di\u0107 met Xi in October last year in Beijing, during the third \"Belt and Road\" Forum, when 18 agreements were signed, including the Free Trade Agreement between Serbia and China, which should soon enter into force.\n\nThis is President Xi's first visit to Europe in the last five years, since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, and during this European tour, he will visit only three European capitals - Paris, Belgrade and Budapest.\n\nHe started his five-day tour with a visit to France on May 5, he will come to Belgrade on May 7, and after that he will visit Budapest. Major security measures were taken for Xi's arrival in Belgrade, so his delegation will be secured by 3,400 policemen, Tanjug learns.\n\nXi will be met by Serbian MiG-29 fighters who will follow his plane from the border, and a guard of the Serbian Army will be lined up in his honor at the Belgrade airport.\n\nChinese and Serbian flags will be placed along the highway in Belgrade, and a ceremonial welcome of the Chinese delegation, numbering 400 people, will be organized in front of the Palace of Serbia, and more than 30 agreements are planned to be signed.\n\nA festive lunch will be organized, and the Chinese President will have the opportunity to taste Serbian dishes and wines, and a music program in Serbian and Chinese will be held, which will end with the song \"This is Serbia\".\n\nThe Chinese president will be hosted by Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107.

China welcomes Serbia to increase direct flights between Belgrade and Shanghai, and encourages airlines from both sides to launch direct flights between Belgrade and Guangzhou.\n\nThe Chinese side will aid 50 young Serbian scientists in exchange programs with China for the next three years and a total of 300 Serbian youths will be invited to study in China in the next three years, said Xi.\n\nChina supports Serbia in hosting Expo 2027, and will send a delegation to participate in the grand show. China encourages its enterprises to take part in the construction of relevant projects, Xi said.\n\nWith joint efforts from China and Serbia, the free trade agreement between the two countries will take effect on July 1, Xi said.\n\nDuring his talks with Vucic on Wednesday in Belgrade, Xi said bilateral relations between China and Serbia are richer in content and have become a model of friendly relations between China and European countries.\n\nXi called on China and Serbia to carry forward the innovative nature of bilateral relations, open up new prospects for cooperation, and make innovative cooperation a new growth point of bilateral ties.\n\nXi was greeted by tens of thousands of Serbians on Wednesday and a welcoming ceremony was held outside the Palace of Serbia before the meeting between the two leaders.\n\nChinese national flags and Chinese-language welcoming banners were hanging on landmark buildings in Belgrade on Wednesday.\n\nChinese and Serbian experts said the meeting between the two heads of state will continue to provide high-level guidance to the sound development of bilateral relationship for the years to come and further inject vitality into the time-weathered, ironclad friendship.\n\nIronclad friendship\n\nOn Tuesday, a signed article by President Xi titled \"May the Light of Our Ironclad Friendship Shine on the Path of China-Serbia Cooperation\" was published in Serbian media Politika.\n\nXi noted in the article that \"there has always been an affinity between Chinese and Serbian peoples despite the long distance between us. During the bitter Anti-Fascist War and our respective nation-building in the last century, the Chinese and Serbian peoples forged a strong friendship that extends through time and space.\"\n\n\"Amid the ongoing transformations unseen in a century in the world, our mutual support remains as strong as ever, our cooperation is closer, and our exchanges and mutual learning more substantive. Whatever changes in the international landscape, China and Serbia remain true friends and good partners. Our ironclad friendship is ever-growing, setting a model for state-to-state and people-to-people interactions,\" Xi wrote.\n\nXi said China and Serbia should always be good friends and treat each other with sincerity, good partners for win-win cooperation, play an exemplary role in promoting fairness and justice and strengthen the heart-to-heart connection between their two peoples.\n\nWith China's support, hundreds of kilometers of highways have been built, the fastest railway in Eastern Europe entered operation, and energy facilities keep renewing, Boyan Lalic, Director of the Belt and Road Institute Belgrade, told the Global Times Wednesday.\n\nThe China-built high-speed railway connecting Belgrade to Novi Sad, inexpensive and comfortable, has cut the previously 1.5-hour trip to just 36 minutes, making a two-city life possible for many young people seeking opportunities, the Global Times learned.\n\nThe railway is part of a more ambitious project linking Belgrade and Budapest, the capital of Hungary, which could finish construction as early as 2025. The project has created jobs, offered unique career experience and trainings, and has allowed people like Serbian engineer Aleksandra Milosavljevic to \"make really good friends with my Chinese colleagues.\"\n\nJoin hands on international stage\n\nThe China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides, Xi wrote.\n\nDong Yifan, a research fellow at the Institute of European Studies, China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that both China and Serbia adhere to independence and non-alignment in their strategic approaches, choosing to follow their own development paths and opposing hegemony. \"We share a strong consensus in international affairs.\"\n\nThe last stop of Xi's three-nation European trip is Hungary, during which a series of cooperation agreements are expected to be signed, according to media reports.\n\nBoth Serbia and Hungary are pillar countries in China-proposed BRI, and have long been at the forefront of European countries' relations with China with close cooperation, Dong said, adding that high-level diplomacy has played a key role in the two countries' relations with China.\n\nHe Zhigao, a research fellow with the Institute of European Studies of CASS, said that Serbia and Hungary \"stand out\" among European countries in regard to developing China ties partly because they can overcome some external restraints and make more independent decisions based on their own interests.\n\nView original

In Serbia, which is seen as China's most important partner in the Balkans, Xi is expected to discuss China\u00b4s multi-billion investment in the country and possible new deals.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic and government officials welcomed Xi at the Belgrade airport, where he was greeted by a military guard of honor and folk dancers. The two leaders will hold a meeting on Wednesday.\n\nOn May 7, 1999, 20 Chinese nationals were wounded in the NATO attack, which prompted outrage in China and an apology from then U.S. President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe embassy was hit during a campaign against the then Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\n\"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself,\" Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday.\n\n\"The friendship between China and Serbia which is soaked in blood that the two peoples spilled together has become a joint memory of the two peoples and will encourage both parties to make together huge steps forward,\" Xi said.\n\nThe Belgrade streets were decorated with Chinese flags and placards as thousands of police officers were deployed to secure Xi and his 400-member entourage, the highest-level visit by a foreign leader in years.\n\nIRONCLAD FRIENDSHIP\n\nXi is visiting Serbia after France, where President Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen pressed him to ensure more balanced trade with Europe and use his influence on Russia to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nDuring his first visit to Belgrade in 2016, the two countries signed a strategic partnership. Last year, Vucic signed 18 agreements with Xi in Beijing, including a free trade deal that should become operational in July.\n\nBoth leaders insist on an ironclad partnership between their countries. Along with Hungary, which is Xi\u00b4s next stop, Serbia is Europe's firmest supporter of China\u00b4s Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nChina runs mines and factories across Serbia and has lent billions for roads, bridges and new facilities, becoming Serbia's key partner in much-needed infrastructure development.\n\nObservers say Xi's choice of Serbia and Hungary is designed to pull closer two European countries that are pro-Russia and large recipients of Chinese investment. Serbia\u00b4s Western partners view the country as a Chinese hub at the gateway to the EU.\n\nIn 2023, China was Serbia\u00b4s second-largest trading partner after the EU with a total trade exchange of $6.1 billion and among its top five investors, according to the national investment agency.

Xi will proceed to Hungary later on Wednesday, which, like Serbia, is seen as one of China's more friendly partners in Europe.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic and other top officials welcomed Xi at the airport on Tuesday after his plane was escorted by military jets. Vucic said Xi's visit was a \"great honour\" and that China is an \"inspiration\" for Serbia.\n\nCongress Criticises Modi Government China Policy\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible - a huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway. China has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nSerbia, a landlocked nation in the heart of the Balkans, has been a key country in China's Belt and Road initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nXi also arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date: the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by US jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed. The incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\n\"Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xi said in an arrival statement published by China's Foreign Ministry. He described the Serbia-China friendship as \"ironclad\". \"Standing at a new historical starting point, China will work with Serbia to jointly stay committed to the original aspiration and forge ahead together to open up a new vista in China-Serbia cooperation with stronger momentum, greater scope, and higher quality,\" added Xi. \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\"\n\nUS Warns Of China-Russia Collaboration For Possible Taiwan Invasion - Report\n\nChinese companies are running Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbour Hungary. In 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernise the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe more than USD 2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays. In 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system flown in on Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes. The arms delivery over the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkiye and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China's growing global reach.", "source": {"uri":

Yes, Taiwan is China\".\n\nBeijing claims the self-ruled island as its own, and said it will not rule out using force to bring the island under Chinese control.\n\nAs the two leaders sat down for meetings, Xi told Vucic in opening comments that there was a \"strong feeling of friendship between our two countries\".\n\nXi arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday evening following a state visit to France that saw sometimes robust exchanges with President Emmanuel Macron on trade and China's close ties to Russia despite the Ukraine war.\n\nThe other two countries chosen for Xi's first trip to Europe since 2019 -- with Hungary as the final stop after Serbia -- are among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.\n\nStreets in the Serbian capital were decked out with Chinese flags, along with posters and billboards that proclaimed a \"warm welcome\" to \"Chinese friends\".\n\n- NATO bombing -\n\nXi's visit also coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which killed three people.\n\n\"Do not forget that our Chinese friends were with us 25 years ago when this country was being demolished and bombed,\" Vucic told the crowds.\n\n\"They paid a high price, they lost people only a few hundred meters from here on this very day.\"\n\nThe embassy was hit during a months-long, US-led NATO campaign targeting Serbian security forces who were at war with ethnic-Albanian insurgents in Kosovo.\n\nThe US later apologised, saying outdated maps had led the pilot to strike the wrong target.\n\nOn Tuesday, Xi wrote in the Serbian daily Politika that NATO had \"flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy\", warning that China would \"never allow such tragic history to repeat itself\".\n\nChina has long backed Serbia's territoral claims over the breakaway province of Kosovo and along with Russia has prevented its recognition at the United Nations.\n\nSerbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told state broadcaster RTS that discussions Wednesday would centre on \"a great project\" and a \"major investment from China in a very promising area.\"\n\n- Ukraine fears -\n\n\"For Serbia, this is without a doubt one of the most significant visits,\" Marko Tmusic, a political sciences professor at the University of Belgrade, told AFP.\n\n\"Standing 'shoulder to shoulder' with France -- with whom China marks 60 years of diplomatic relations -- and Hungary... is certainly a great honour\" for Serbia, he added.\n\nPeople in Belgrade welcomed Xi's visit.\n\n\"I think it's an excellent thing, this visit from the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world,\" 67-year-old Stojan Vidovic, a retiree, told AFP.\n\nIn France, Xi met with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. They urged him not to allow the export of technology that could be used by Russia in Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go later Wednesday to Hungary where China has invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing plants.\n\nbur-rox/ds\n\nMore from this section\n\nMMI Webinar with MBA Focuses on Using Data, Technology to Reach 'Mortgage-Ready' Millennials Innovating Customer

Orban Meeting, Next Leg Of European Charm Trip", "body": "(RFE/RL) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping, fresh off an apparently successful trip to Serbia, on May 8 arrived in Hungary, where he is scheduled to meet later in the night with another authoritarian leader -- Prime Minister Viktor Orban -- and where he'll likely receive another warm welcome.\n\nChinese state television said Xi arrived in Budapest \"by special plane and began his state visit to Hungary, at the invitation of Hungarian President Tamas Sulyok and Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\"\n\nXi left Belgrade on May 8 after meeting there with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic at a city palace where thousands of people were gathered to greet them as both men lauded their countries' friendship as \"ironclad\" and issued a joint statement to boost cooperation toward \"a common future in the new era.\"\n\nXi is on a rare, six-day European tour that already took him to France to meet with President Emmanuel Macron and EU leaders, who urged him to ease Chinese trade restrictions and to use his influence to press Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nXi's first trip to Europe in five years is seen as part of his drive to increase Beijing's influence on the continent's economic and political affairs.\n\nThe Sino-Serbian agreement signed by Xi and Vucic raises the level of their cooperation from strategic partnership to \"building the community of Serbia and China with a common future in the new era.\"\n\nAfter a series of bilateral meetings, Vucic called it \"the highest form of cooperation between the two countries.\"\n\nXi said their countries will \"jointly oppose hegemony and power politics\" in the interest of \"fundamental and long-term interests.\"\n\nHe called their bilateral political trust \"strong as a rock.\"\n\nVucic has promoted Chinese investment and trade and diplomatic ties for his Balkan nation of around 7 million as he has sought to balance outreach to Russia and China and the bucking of Western sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine war with his country's bid for eventual EU membership.\n\nSpeaking from a balcony of the palace, Vucic thanked Xi for visiting \"little Serbia\" and said they were \"making history today even though it doesn't seem so to many.\"\n\nXi called it a \"truly two-sided and honest friendship,\" according to Serbian state television.\n\nLike Moscow, Beijing has supported Belgrade diplomatically in its refusal to recognize former province Kosovo's independence, while Belgrade has supported China's claims to Taiwan. \"Taiwan is China,\" Vucic said on May 8, citing the UN Charter.\n\nXi's visit was seemingly timed to coincide with the 25th anniversary of NATO's bombing of the former Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999, a deadly incident that has united Beijing and Belgrade in their criticism of Western intervention in the Balkans and around the world.\n\nChina has invested some $6 billion in Serbia in the past decade, putting the money into copper mines and a steel mill as well as major highway and infrastructure projects that have been criticized by some as nontransparent and overly risky deals between governments.\n\nChinese and Serbian officials were expected to sign more than 30 agreements in areas that Vucic suggested were in many cases aimed at boosting technology and innovation in Serbia.\n\nAhead of the Chinese president's arrival, Belgrade was decorated with flags of Serbia and China, and welcome messages were set up along the route from the airport to the city center in Serbian and Chinese.\n\nXi also made Serbia a stop in 2016, when he signed a free-trade agreement with Belgrade that alarmed skeptics of Chinese economic and political intentions in Europe.",

Then-US president Bill Clinton issued an apology in the aftermath of the incident, which sparked outrage in China.\n\nIn the comment piece, Xi also highlighted the enduring friendship between China and Serbia, forged through shared experiences and joint efforts.\n\n\"The friendship between China and Serbia which is soaked in blood that the two peoples spilled together has become a joint memory of the two peoples and will encourage both parties to make together huge steps forward,\" he wrote.\n\nWarm welcome\n\nBelgrade has been prepared to receive Xi with streets adorned with Chinese flags and placards, while thousands of police officers have been deployed to ensure security for the visiting delegation.\n\nAhead of Xi's arrival, several members of the Chinese delegation, including ministers and institutional representatives, have already arrived in Belgrade. Minister of Finance Sinisa Mali and Minister of Trade Tomislav Momirovic, greeted the Chinese delegation at Nikola Tesla airport.\n\nDuring his stay in Serbia, Xi is expected to engage in talks on China's investments in the country and potential new agreements with his Serbian counterpart Vucic.\n\nThe relationship between China and Serbia has seen several advances in recent years. In 2016, the two countries signed a strategic partnership, and last year witnessed the signing of 18 agreements during Vucic's visit to Beijing. These agreements included a free trade deal set to become operational in July, reflecting the deepening economic ties between the two nations.\n\nXi said he expected discussions with Serbian leaders to further strengthen bilateral cooperation.\n\nTrade and infrastructure\n\nSerbia's alignment with China's Belt and Road Initiative has cemented its position as a key partner for China in Europe. Chinese investments in Serbia have contributed significantly to infrastructure development, with projects spanning mines, factories, roads and bridges.\n\nChina is currently Serbia's second most important economic partner following the EU. China was also the top foreign investor in Serbia in 2023, accounting for \u20ac1.37bn of the total \u20ac4.5bn.\n\nChinese companies have played an important role in Serbia's industrial sector, and are among the country's top exporters. Specifically, Serbia's top exporters were dominated by three Chinese-owned companies in 2023: Zijin Mining, Zijin Copper and the HBIS Group.\n\nOther recent collaborations include the establishment of yuan clearing arrangements and the inauguration of a new freight route linking China's Hebei province with Belgrade.\n\nXi's visit coincides with the installation of Serbia's new government, led by

He will fly to Hungary later in the day.\n\n\"We are writing history today,\" Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 told a large crowd that had gathered in front of the Serbian presidential palace to welcome Xi, applauding and chanting \"China, China\".\n\nThe two countries signed 29 agreements promoting legal, regulatory and economic cooperation. Serbia will also become the first European country in years to enter into a free trade agreement with China when a deal signed last year comes into effect on 1 July.\n\nVu\u010di\u0107 said that since 2020 China had been the single-largest investor in Serbia, and that its investment was up 30-fold over the past decade. The free trade deal will guarantee tariff-free exports for 95% of Serbian products to China over the next five to 10 years, he said.\n\nXi said that China was ready to import more high-quality agricultural products from Serbia and would welcome more direct flights between Belgrade and Chinese cities.\n\nBoth leaders boast of an ironclad partnership. Along with Hungary, Serbia is Europe's firmest supporter of China's huge Belt and Road infrastructure project across parts of Asia and Europe.\n\n\"Serbia became China's first strategic partner in central and eastern Europe eight years ago, and it becomes the first European country with which we shall build a community with shared future,\" Xi said.\n\nThe two leaders said they would support each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, meaning that Serbia considers Taiwan, viewed by Beijing as a breakaway province, to be part of China, just as China considers Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, as part of Serbia.\n\n\"We shall jointly confront hegemony and the politics of power,\" Xi said.\n\nXi\u00b4s visit comes on the anniversary of the 1999 NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during a campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\nNATO said the bombing, which killed three Chinese journalists and wounded 20 Chinese nationals, was accidental. It prompted outrage in China and an apology from then US President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself,\" Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday.\n\nVu\u010di\u0107 said the two countries had agreed to establish an inter-governmental technology committee that would enable Serbia to get access to the latest technologies and use of artificial intelligence.\n\nChina owns mines and factories across Serbia and has lent billions for roads, bridges and new facilities, becoming Serbia's key partner in much-needed infrastructure development.\n\nXi left France on Tuesday after a two-day trip during which he offered no major concessions on trade or foreign policy, even as President Emmanuel Macron pressed him on market access and Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

internal issue of China.\n\nThey also pledged to support each other on territorial issues when they met earlier today.\n\nXi said the two countries were also committed to deepening economic relations in traditional strong areas such as transportation and energy infrastructure, while also extending them to innovation cooperation.\n\nHe also said Beijing welcomed the decision to open a direct air route between Belgrade and Shanghai and supported plans for another route linking the Serbian capital to Guangzhou.\n\nThe free trade agreement signed last year by the two countries, which will give Serbian companies access to the vast Chinese market, is expected to come into force in early July.\n\nVucic said the deal would secure the country's future, adding that China's previous experiences could provide a roadmap for Serbia's future trajectory.\n\nIn 2022, China became Serbia's largest source of foreign direct investment and the second largest trading partner after the EU, according to China's official Xinhua News Agency.\n\nTrade between the two countries fell from US$596 million in 2016 to US$4.35 billion last year.\n\nIn recent years, Beijing has invested considerable sums in Serbia, investing in numerous factories and mines, providing billions in loans to build roads and financing the development of a railway line between Belgrade and Budapest.\n\nXi's arrival in Belgrade on Tuesday, after his two-day visit to France, coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the NATO campaign in Kosovo.\n\nThe United States has apologized for the incident, insisting it was an error caused by the use of outdated maps, but it remains a sore point in China.\n\nXi did not visit the site of the former Chinese embassy in Belgrade, although it was to be on his itinerary.\n\nThere were no road closures or significant increased security at the site of the former Chinese embassy on Wednesday, except for a few police stationed along nearby roads, as downtown Belgrade was booked for Xi's visit.\n\nA group of Chinese tourists visited the site around mid-afternoon.\n\nAnother group of overseas Chinese, wearing red caps, began a vigil of sorts at the site on Tuesday, but their numbers dwindled as Xi's departure drew closer on Wednesday.\n\nA young Chinese couple working in Belgrade waited there at noon, expecting to see Xi or his wife Peng Liyuan, but left around 1 p.m. after waiting more than an hour.\n\nThe Chinese Cultural Center, built on the site, also showed no sign of a groundbreaking ceremony, with only an electronic screen in the reception area of its office building showing a poster warmly announcing President Xi's visit in Serbia and some local Chinese. language newspapers reporting on Xi's European tour on a desk.\n\nFlowers placed at the monument to honor the victims were presented by Chinese state-owned companies operating in Serbia, including Shandong Hi-Speed, which invested in the Chinese Cultural Center, and China Energy Engineering Corporation.\n\nIn an opinion piece published Tuesday in Serbia's oldest daily Politika, Xi wrote: \"The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such a tragic history to repeat itself.\"\n\nThe China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will remain in the collective memory of the Chinese and Serbian people and inspire us to make significant progress together.\n\nXi was due to travel to Hungary, the final stop of his European tour, later on Wednesday, before returning to China on Friday.", "source": {"uri":

He will fly to Hungary later in the day.\n\n\"We are writing history today,\" Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told a large crowd that had gathered in front of the Serbian presidential palace to welcome Xi, applauding and chanting \"China, China\".\n\nThe two countries signed 29 agreements promoting legal, regulatory and economic cooperation, with Serbia becoming the first European country to sign a free trade agreement with China in years.\n\nVucic said that since 2020 China had been the single-largest investor in Serbia, and that its investment was up 30-fold over the past decade. The free trade deal that should become operational in July will guarantee tariff-free exports for 95% of Serbian products to China over the next five to 10 years, he said.\n\nBoth leaders boast of an ironclad partnership. Along with Hungary, Serbia is Europe's firmest supporter of China's huge Belt and Road infrastructure project across parts of Asia and Europe.\n\n\"Serbia became China\u00b4s first strategic partner in central and eastern Europe eight years ago, and it becomes the first European country with which we shall build a community with shared future,\" Xi said.\n\nBoth leaders said they would support each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, meaning that Serbia considers Taiwan, viewed by Beijing as a breakaway province, to be part of China, just as China considers Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, as part of Serbia.\n\n\"We shall jointly confront hegemony and the politics of power,\" Xi said.\n\nSYMBOLISM OF THE VISIT\n\nXi\u00b4s visit comes on the anniversary of the 1999 NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during a campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\nThe bombing, which killed three Chinese journalists and wounded 20 Chinese nationals, prompted outrage in China and an apology from then U.S. President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself,\" Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday.\n\nVucic said the two countries had agreed to establish an inter-governmental technology committee that would enable Serbia to get access to the latest technologies and use of artificial intelligence.\n\nChina owns mines and factories across Serbia and has lent billions for roads, bridges and new facilities, becoming Serbia's key partner in much-needed infrastructure development.\n\nXi left France on Tuesday after a two-day trip during which he offered no major concessions on trade or foreign policy, even as President Emmanuel Macron pressed him on market access and Ukraine.\n\n(Writing by by Daria Sito-Sucic in Sarajevo; Editing by

On the night of May 7, exactly 25 years ago, NATO bombed the Chinese embassy, killing three Chinese journalists, including one from Xinhua.\n\n\"The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself,\" Xi wrote in the article. \"The China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides.\"\n\nGordana, a local resident who didn't reveal her full name, referred to the bombing as a \"painful memory\" to her. \"The cooperation between China and Serbia holds the promise of providing my children with a better life than I experienced,\" she told Xinhua.\n\nPrecious moments of goodwill and friendship are a signature of Xi's short but significant stay in Serbia, which lasts no more than 24 hours.\n\nA telling moment was the grand welcoming ceremony held by Vucic on Wednesday morning with the impressive attendance of more than 10,000 Serbian people.\n\nCrowds were waving the national flags of both countries and chanting \"China! Serbia!\" with applause and cheers pervading the atmosphere.\n\n\"We are here to show our friendship with China, and we want our Chinese friends know that we cherish it very much,\" said Milos Tosic, a college professor present at the event. Tosic told Xinhua that it is not only his opinion, but one shared \"by all the people here today.\"\n\nAt a welcoming banquet around noon, Xi shared his nostalgic memory with Vucic, reminiscing about the Yugoslav film \"The Bridge\" and the song \"Bella Ciao,\" which have become the fondest memories in his youthful days.\n\n\"China will work together with the friendly people of Serbia and make tireless efforts to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era,\" Xi pledged in his concluding remarks at the banquet toast.\n\nDuring the meeting with Vucic, Xi said the China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era is an upgrade of the ironclad friendship between China and Serbia, and it also represents their common values and objectives, namely, joint pursuit of development, win-win cooperation and mutual success.\n\nIn support of the building of the China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, Xi has announced six measures when he met the press together with Vucic. Notable among the measures are a free trade agreement between China and Serbia which will take effect on July 1 and an exchange program under which Serbian youths and young Serbian scientists are invited to visit China in the next three years.\n\n\"The sky is the limit,\" said Vucic, referring to the scope of cooperation with China.\n\n\"For Serbia, it obviously brings a great deal,\" said Aleksandar Pavic, a Serbian political expert. \"The opening of the Chinese market with the Free Trade Agreement, academic exchanges ... those are very, very important.\"\n\n\"China offers a hand of cooperation on an equal footing, and offers great opportunities without conditions,\" Pavic said. \"We've grown weary of the zero-sum game for far too long.\"\n\nThe substantial deals added new testimony to the special bond of ironclad friendship enjoyed by China and Serbia.\n\nPast years have seen leapfrog growth of China-Serbia cooperation. Two-way trade in 2023 surged to 4.35 billion U.S. dollars, Chinese customs statistics showed. In 2022, China became the largest source of direct investment for Serbia. After the bilateral free trade deal takes effect, more than 60 percent of taxable items will become tariff-free immediately, and the final import volume proportion of both sides with zero-tariff items will reach about 95 percent.\n\nUnder the framework of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative are flagship projects such as the Smederevo Steelworks and the high-speed railway between Belgrade and Budapest. An integral segment of the Belgrade-Budapest railway is the high-speed train linking Belgrade and Serbia's second-largest city Novi Sad, which has transported some 6.83 million passengers over the past two years.\n\nSerbia has long been known as \"the gateway to the Balkans\" on the European continent. \"Everything that has been done so far and will be done in the future can serve as an example to other countries in the region and throughout Europe to get involved as much as possible,\" said Aleksandar Mitic, a research fellow also with the institute.\n\n\"The principle of mutual benefit can really work,\" said Mitic.\n\nSerbia, undoubtedly, stands as a reliable partner for China in Europe, said Aleksandar Vojvodic, head engineer of the Clean Serbia Project of China Road and Bridge Corporation.\n\nThere will be a promising prospect for further enhancement and expansion of existing cooperation, said Vojvodic. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news",

Yes, Taiwan is China\". China has stepped up diplomatic pressure on the island that it has claimed for decades.\n\nThe Chinese president arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday from a state visit to France that saw sometimes robust exchanges with President Emmanuel Macron on trade and China's close ties to Russia despite the Ukraine war.\n\nThe other two countries chosen for Xi's first trip to Europe since 2019 -- with Hungary as the final stop after Serbia -- are among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.\n\nSerbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told state broadcaster RTS that discussions Wednesday would centre on \"a great project\".\n\n\"We are aiming to attract a major investment from China in a very promising area,\" he said, adding \"I won't reveal our cards at this moment.\"\n\nStreets in the Serbian capital were decked out with Chinese flags, along with posters and billboards that proclaimed a \"warm welcome\" to \"Chinese friends\".\n\nXi's visit also coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 US bombing of the Chinese embassy there, which killed three people.\n\n\"Do not forget that our Chinese friends were with us 25 years ago when this country was being demolished and bombed,\" Vucic told the crowds.\n\n\"They paid a high price, they lost people only a few hundred meters from here on this very day.\"\n\nThe embassy was hit during a months-long, US-led NATO campaign targeting Serbian security forces who were at war with ethnic-Albanian insurgents in Kosovo.\n\nThe US later apologised, saying outdated maps had led the pilot to strike the wrong target.\n\nOn Tuesday, Xi wrote in Serbian daily Politika that NATO had \"flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia\", warning that China would \"never allow such tragic history to repeat itself\".\n\nChina has long backed Serbia's territoral claims over the breakaway province of Kosovo and along with Russia has prevented its recognition at the United Nations.\n\nHe also hailed the \"ironclad friendship\" between China and Serbia, which he said was \"forged with the blood of our compatriots\".\n\nStefan Vladisavljev, programme director at the Foundation BFPE for a Responsible Society, said that the date of the visit gave it \"significant symbolic importance\".\n\nPeople in Belgrade welcomed Xi's visit.\n\n\"I think it's an excellent thing, this visit from the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world,\" 67-year-old Stojan Vidovic, a retiree, told AFP.\n\n\"It's fantastic for us,\" agreed 69-year-old Dijana Radic, a former translator. She said she hoped there would be \"results from this visit, something good for both parties\".\n\nIn France, Xi met with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. They urged him not to allow the export of technology that could be used by Russia in Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go later Wednesday to Hungary where China has invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing plants.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors":

Yes, Taiwan is China\". China has stepped up diplomatic pressure on the island that it has claimed for decades.\n\nThe Chinese president arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday from a state visit to France that saw sometimes robust exchanges with President Emmanuel Macron on trade and China's close ties to Russia despite the Ukraine war.\n\nThe other two countries chosen for Xi's first trip to Europe since 2019 -- with Hungary as the final stop after Serbia -- are among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.\n\nSerbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told state broadcaster RTS that discussions Wednesday would centre on \"a great project\".\n\n\"We are aiming to attract a major investment from China in a very promising area,\" he said, adding \"I won't reveal our cards at this moment.\"\n\nStreets in the Serbian capital were decked out with Chinese flags, along with posters and billboards that proclaimed a \"warm welcome\" to \"Chinese friends\".\n\n- NATO bombing -\n\nXi's visit also coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 US bombing of the Chinese embassy there, which killed three people.\n\n\"Do not forget that our Chinese friends were with us 25 years ago when this country was being demolished and bombed,\" Vucic told the crowds.\n\n\"They paid a high price, they lost people only a few hundred meters from here on this very day.\"\n\nThe embassy was hit during a months-long, US-led NATO campaign targeting Serbian security forces who were at war with ethnic-Albanian insurgents in Kosovo.\n\nThe US later apologised, saying outdated maps had led the pilot to strike the wrong target. On Tuesday, Xi wrote in Serbian daily Politika that NATO had \"flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia\", warning that China would \"never allow such tragic history to repeat itself\".\n\nChina has long backed Serbia's territoral claims over the breakaway province of Kosovo and along with Russia has prevented its recognition at the United Nations.\n\nHe also hailed the \"ironclad friendship\" between China and Serbia, which he said was \"forged with the blood of our compatriots\".\n\nStefan Vladisavljev, programme director at the Foundation BFPE for a Responsible Society, said that the date of the visit gave it \"significant symbolic importance\".\n\n\"I think it's an excellent thing, this visit from the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world,\" 67-year-old Stojan Vidovic, a retiree, told AFP.\n\n\"It's fantastic for us,\" agreed 69-year-old Dijana Radic, a former translator. She said she hoped there would be \"results from this visit, something good for both parties\".\n\nIn France, Xi met with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. They urged him not to allow the export of technology that could be used by Russia in Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go later Wednesday to Hungary where China has invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing plants.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Xi\u00b4s visit is part of his first European tour in five years, and is seen as an effort to strengthen ties with eastern European countries that are pro-Russia and large recipients of Chinese investment.\n\nChina and Serbia on Wednesday agreed to follow a \"shared future\" as President Xi Jinping visited the Balkan country, part of his bid to forge stronger relations with allies at the edge of the European Union.\n\nXi\u00b4s visit is part of his first European tour in five years, and is seen as an effort to strengthen ties with eastern European countries that are pro-Russia and large recipients of Chinese investment. He will fly to Hungary later in the day. \"We are writing history today,\" Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told a large crowd that had gathered in front of the Serbian presidential palace to welcome Xi, applauding and chanting \"China, China\".\n\nThe two countries signed 29 agreements promoting legal, regulatory and economic cooperation, with Serbia becoming the first European country to sign a free trade agreement with China in years. Vucic said that since 2020 China had been the single-largest investor in Serbia, and that its investment was up 30-fold over the past decade. The free trade deal that should become operational in July will guarantee tariff-free exports for 95% of Serbian products to China over the next five to 10 years, he said.\n\nBoth leaders boast of an ironclad partnership. Along with Hungary, Serbia is Europe's firmest supporter of China's huge Belt and Road infrastructure project across parts of Asia and Europe. \"Serbia became China\u00b4s first strategic partner in central and eastern Europe eight years ago, and it becomes the first European country with which we shall build a community with shared future,\" Xi said.\n\nBoth leaders said they would support each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, meaning that Serbia considers Taiwan, viewed by Beijing as a breakaway province, to be part of China, just as China considers Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, as part of Serbia. \"We shall jointly confront hegemony and the politics of power,\" Xi said.\n\nSYMBOLISM OF THE VISIT Xi\u00b4s visit comes on the anniversary of the 1999 NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during a campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\nThe bombing, which killed three Chinese journalists and wounded 20 Chinese nationals, prompted outrage in China and an apology from then U.S. President Bill Clinton. \"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself,\" Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday.\n\nVucic said the two countries had agreed to establish an inter-governmental technology committee that would enable Serbia to get access to the latest technologies and use of artificial intelligence. China owns mines and factories across Serbia and has lent billions for roads, bridges and new facilities, becoming Serbia's key partner in much-needed infrastructure development.\n\nXi left France on Tuesday after a two-day trip during which he offered no major concessions on trade or foreign policy, even as President Emmanuel Macron pressed him on market access and Ukraine.

Yes, Taiwan is China\". China has\n\nstepped up diplomatic pressure on the island that it has claimed for decades.\n\nThe Chinese president arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday from a state visit to\n\nFrance that saw sometimes robust exchanges with President Emmanuel Macron on\n\ntrade and China's close ties to Russia despite the Ukraine war.\n\nThe other two countries chosen for Xi's first trip to Europe since 2019 --\n\nwith Hungary as the final stop after Serbia -- are among the most sympathetic\n\nto Moscow in Europe.\n\nSerbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told state broadcaster RTS that\n\ndiscussions Wednesday would centre on \"a great project\".\n\n\"We are aiming to attract a major investment from China in a very promising\n\narea,\" he said, adding \"I won't reveal our cards at this moment.\"\n\nStreets in the Serbian capital were decked out with Chinese flags, along with\n\nposters and billboards that proclaimed a \"warm welcome\" to \"Chinese friends\".\n\n- NATO bombing -\n\nXi's visit also coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 US bombing of\n\nthe Chinese embassy there, which killed three people.\n\n\"Do not forget that our Chinese friends were with us 25 years ago when this\n\ncountry was being demolished and bombed,\" Vucic told the crowds.\n\n\"They paid a high price, they lost people only a few hundred meters from here\n\non this very day.\"\n\nThe embassy was hit during a months-long, US-led NATO campaign targeting\n\nSerbian security forces who were at war with ethnic-Albanian insurgents in\n\nKosovo.\n\nThe US later apologised, saying outdated maps had led the pilot to strike the\n\nwrong target.\n\nOn Tuesday, Xi wrote in Serbian daily Politika that NATO had \"flagrantly\n\nbombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia\", warning that China would \"never\n\nallow such tragic history to repeat itself\".\n\nChina has long backed Serbia's territoral claims over the breakaway province\n\nof Kosovo and along with Russia has prevented its recognition at the United\n\nNations.\n\nHe also hailed the \"ironclad friendship\" between China and Serbia, which he\n\nsaid was \"forged with the blood of our compatriots\".\n\nStefan Vladisavljev, programme director at the Foundation BFPE for a\n\nResponsible Society, said that the date of the visit gave it \"significant\n\nsymbolic importance\".\n\n\"I think it's an excellent thing, this visit from the president of one of the\n\nmost powerful countries in the world,\" 67-year-old Stojan Vidovic, a retiree,\n\ntold AFP.\n\n\"It's fantastic for us,\" agreed 69-year-old Dijana Radic, a former\n\ntranslator. She said she hoped there would be \"results from this visit,\n\nsomething good for both parties\".\n\nIn France, Xi met with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der\n\nLeyen. They urged him not to allow the export of technology that could be\n\nused by Russia in Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and also hit back\n\nat accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict,\n\nChina is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in\n\narms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go later Wednesday to Hungary where China\n\nhas invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing\n\nplants.", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Among those welcoming Xi at the Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vucic. The two heads of state will hold meetings on Wednesday.\n\nTwo fighter jets were dispatched to escort Xi's plane upon its entry into Serbia's airspace. Over the past days, the streets of Belgrade have been richly ornamented with Chinese features, not least the flying Chinese national flags and waving banners.\n\nIn a signed article published Tuesday in Politika, a Belgrade-based Serbian daily, Xi wrote that the ironclad friendship between the two countries is ever-growing. \"Whatever changes in the international landscape, China and Serbia remain true friends and good partners.\"\n\n\"Together we will build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era,\" Xi wrote.\n\nThe Chinese president's arrival coincides with the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nIn 1999, the U.S.-led NATO forces carried out savage airstrikes for 78 days against Yugoslavia, leaving more than 8,000 civilians dead or injured and nearly 1 million more displaced. On the night of May 7, exactly 25 years ago, NATO bombed the Chinese embassy, killing three Chinese journalists, including one from Xinhua.\n\n\"The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself,\" Xi wrote in the article. \"The China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides.\"\n\nAleksandar Mitic, research fellow in International Relations at the Institute of International Politics and Economics in Belgrade, told Xinhua that the friendship, tempered by blood and fire, \"will represent a cornerstone for cooperation in the future.\"\n\nDuring Xi's last state visit to Serbia in 2016, Xi made the site of the old embassy as his first stop to pay homage to the Chinese martyrs killed in the NATO bombing in 1999.\n\nThe ruins of the embassy have now been revamped into a Chinese cultural center for local residents in Serbia to learn both Chinese language and traditional culture. The square outside the center was also renamed \"Serbia-China Friendship Square.\"\n\nGordana, a local resident working nearby who didn't reveal her full name, referred to the bombing as a \"painful memory\" to her. \"The cooperation between China and Serbia holds the promise of providing my children with a better life than I experienced,\" she told Xinhua.\n\nPast years have seen leapfrog growth of China-Serbia cooperation. Two-way trade in 2023 surged to 4.35 billion U.S. dollars, Chinese customs statistics showed. In 2022, China became the largest source of direct investment for Serbia. In October 2023, witnessed by Xi and Vucic, China and Serbia signed a free trade agreement. After the deal takes effect, more than 60 percent of taxable items will become tariff-free immediately, and the final import volume proportion of both sides with zero-tariff items will reach about 95 percent.\n\nUnder the framework of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative are flagship projects such as the Smederevo Steelworks and the high-speed railway between Belgrade and Budapest. An integral segment of the Belgrade-Budapest railway is the high-speed train linking Belgrade and Serbia's second-largest city Novi Sad, which has transported some 6.83 million passengers over the past two years.\n\n\"We mainly cooperated in the field of transportation and energy field,\" said Katarina Zakic, head of the Regional Centre Belt and Road at the Institute of International Politics and Economics. In the future, cooperation will be important in the fields of green energy and e-commerce, she told Xinhua.\n\nAlready, Chinese companies and their Serbian counterparts are working on a number of green energy programs, such as the Saraorci Photovoltaic Project. Upon completion, the project will provide more than 16 million kilowatt-hours of green electricity every year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 16,000 tons.\n\nSerbia, undoubtedly, stands as a reliable partner for China in Europe, said Aleksandar Vojvodic, head engineer of the Clean Serbia Project of China Road and Bridge Corporation.", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType":

China!\u201d outside the Palace of Serbia, a major government complex in the centre of the capital.\n\nXi told Vucic that Beijing was ready to continue the \u201cironclad friendship\u201d between the two countries, to jointly safeguard the fundamental and long-term interests of both countries, and pursue their national development and national rejuvenation side by side, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nLater, Xi told a joint press conference: \u201cWe agreed to guide and steer the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future for the new era through strengthening strategic communication.\n\nXi first announced his concept of a \u201ccommunity with a shared future\u201d \u2013 which is often seen as a challenge to the existing US-led global order \u2013 over 10 years ago.\n\nAt its core is a vision of a new type of international relations and global governance characterised by mutual respect, common security and peaceful development.\n\n\u201cEight years ago, Serbia became China\u2019s first comprehensive strategic partner in the Central and Eastern European region, and today Serbia is the first European country to build a community of destiny with China, fully reflecting the strategic, special and high level of China-Serbia relations,\u201d Xi added.\n\nXi also told the press conference that Beijing supported Belgrade\u2019s efforts to maintain national sovereignty and territorial integrity in Kosovo.\n\nChina, along with Russia and Serbia and dozens of other countries, does not recognise Kosovo\u2019s 2008 declaration of independence.\n\nIn return, Serbia does not recognise Taiwan as independent and Vucic told the press conference that his country supports the one-China principle and regards the Taiwan question as an internal matter for China.\n\nThey also pledged mutual support on territorial issues when they met earlier in the day.\n\nXi said the two had also pledged to deepen their economic relations both in traditional areas of strength such as transport and energy infrastructure, while also extending it to cooperation on innovation.\n\nHe also said Beijing welcomed the move to open a direct flight route from Belgrade to Shanghai and back plans for another route linking the Serbian capital and Guangzhou.\n\nA free-trade agreement the two countries signed last year, which will grant Serbian companies access to the extensive Chinese market, is due to take effect at the start of July.\n\nVucic said the pact will \u201cguarantee\u201d the country\u2019s future, adding that China\u2019s previous experiences could provide a road map for Serbia\u2019s future trajectory.\n\nAlthough Serbia is a candidate for EU membership, it is one of Europe\u2019s strongest supporters of China\u2019s expansive belt and road infrastructure project.\n\nIn 2022, China emerged as Serbia\u2019s top source of foreign direct investment and the second-largest trading partner after the European Union, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.\n\nTrade between the two countries has risen from US$596 million in 2016 to US$4.35 billion last year.\n\nIn recent years, Beijing has poured substantial investment into Serbia, owning numerous factories and mines, providing billions in loans for constructing roads and funding the development of a railway line between Belgrade and Budapest.\n\nXi\u2019s arrival in Belgrade on Tuesday, following his two-day visit to France, coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during Nato\u2019s Kosovo campaign.\n\nThe US apologised for the incident, insisting it was a mistake that was caused by using outdated maps, but it continues to be a sore point in China.\n\nIn an opinion piece published in Serbia\u2019s oldest daily newspaper Politika on Tuesday, Xi wrote: \u201cThe Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\n\n\u201cThe China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the collective memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to take significant strides forward together.\u201d\n\nXi was due to travel to Hungary, the final leg of his European tour, later on Wednesday before returning to China on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [],

Xi and his wife arrived in Serbia after concluding his visit to France.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic and his wife, Tamara Vucic, welcomed Xi Jinping at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. Children welcomed Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan by presenting them with flowers and waving the national flags of China and Serbia.\n\nXi arrived in Serbia to mark the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999. The US has apologised for what it called a \"mistaken\" bombing that killed three Chinese nationals and injured 20 others. Xi is expected to pay tribute to those killed at the site, which is now a Chinese cultural centre.\n\nDuring his visit to France, French President Emmanuel Macron pressed Xi Jinping on Russia's military action in Ukraine, trade disputes and human rights. Notably, Xi is on a six-day visit to Europe and after his Serbia visit, he will head to Hungary.\n\nSpeaking to VOA News, Francesco Sisci, an Italian sinologist, said that it appears that China is facing difficulties in its relations with European nations.\n\nSisci said, \"It's interesting that ... China didn't manage to secure more significant countries for Xi's visit to Europe. It seems that China is having greater difficulties in its ties with European countries, and it has good ties with two governments that have also good ties with Moscow. That is -- Europe is moving faster away from China as it sees it too close to Moscow.\"\n\nSerbia and Hungary have developed close ties with Russia and China under Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. China has been investing billions in various projects, including electric vehicles, railways, and factories, in Serbia and Hungary.\n\nJa Ian Chong, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said that Xi will try to stress China's role in supporting stability.\n\n\"Xi will probably try to stress the PRC's [People's Republic of China] role in supporting stability and maybe suggest but not openly accuse the United States of being destabilizing and unnecessarily aggressive,\" VOA News quoted Ja Ian Chong as saying.\n\nThe two nations like China have spoken against sanctions by the US and EU on Russia over its military action in Ukraine, which began in 2022, although Hungary has voted in favour of them.\n\nOrban, despite leading a nation that is both a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and EU member, has friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and held talks with him on the sidelines of the Belt and Road International Cooperation Summit Forum held in Beijing in October.\n\nUnlike other EU members, Hungary continues to purchase the majority of its fuel from Russia. Serbia is a candidate to join the European Union. Viktor Orban is the only leader who attended the Summit and met Xi Jinping.\n\nDragana Mitrovic, a political science professor at the University of Belgrade, said those ties have triggered tensions with Hungary's partners in the West.\n\nMitrovic said, \"In this moment of tense geopolitical competition and measuring economic and overall cooperation by strategic gains and losses, Hungary will continue to be under pressure from Brussels and Washington when pursuing cooperation with China,\" VOA News reported.\n\nUpon arriving in Serbia, Xi in a written statement stated, \"China and Serbia enjoy profound traditional friendship. Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xinhua reported.\n\nXi said he looks forward to taking this visit as an opportunity to hold talks with Aleksandar Vuvic on bilateral ties and other issues of mutual interest, renewing friendship, planning for cooperation, exploring development, and creating a new blueprint for the development of bilateral relations.\n\nHe said, \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\" Xi Jinping arrived in Serbia at the invitation of Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.

And with good reason.\n\nThe visit of President Xi is of historical significance for Serbia and represents the pinnacle of successful policies led by Serbia under President Aleksandar Vucic, agree many analysts, not only in Serbia.\n\nSerbia is one of only three European countries that the head of the world superpower, the People's Republic of China, decided to visit after five years. This fact alone speaks volumes, especially considering that the other two countries are France and Hungary.\n\nThe economic significance of Serbia's strategic partnership with China is enormous; that will be discussed later. However, the arrival of the Chinese president primarily represents a valuable encouragement for Serbia and provides it with maneuvering space to persist in its sovereign policies. It is also a message to many in the West that China's role is becoming increasingly significant in the Balkans.\n\nPresident Xi's stay in Belgrade, his second since assuming leadership of China, comes at a sensitive time when Serbia is facing multiple attacks from Western countries on its national interests, both regarding Kosovo and the UN resolution on Srebrenica.\n\nThe sincere and emotional friendly statements of President Xi and Vucic, the announcement of further strengthening of the strategic partnership between China and Serbia, as well as the spectacular reception of the numerous Chinese delegation in Belgrade, in front of thousands of gathered citizens of the Serbian capital, it is clear, will not be very pleasing to some political centers in the West and the region.\n\nSerbia has an alternative\n\nChina is a sincere fighter against the world order based on the rule of force advocated by the West, which violates international law wherever it suits it, with the Serbian people being its biggest victim.\n\nWhat messages does the arrival of the Chinese president in Belgrade send in this regard, here in the Balkans, but also towards the EU and the USA?\n\nPolitical analyst Ognjen Gogic believes that Xi's visit to Belgrade is a good occasion for the West to reconsider its policy and treatment towards Serbia.\n\n\"China is still not on the radar for many regarding Serbia because it is considered that Russia is Serbia's main ally, especially in blocking the recognition of Kosovo's independence and statehood. However, China is also very consistent in this regard. The support of official Beijing to Serbia is very significant in the United Nations, where there is now an attempt with a resolution on genocide, but it also has an impact in the Council of Europe, in the attempts of some countries to admit Pristina. President Xi's visit to Belgrade is not directly related to current events in the Council of Europe, but it can be significant in that regard. It is a message of support to Belgrade, a message to Western countries, for which China is a very important partner,\" explains Gogic for Kontekst.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping's visit to Belgrade, he adds, can signal to influential Western countries that Serbia has an alternative.\n\n\"This means that if Western countries continue to push Serbia away, if they continue with current moves, Serbia can turn to other partners who welcome it with open arms. In that sense, this visit of the Chinese president to Serbia, as one of only three countries President Xi visits in Europe, will have the role of prompting certain Western countries to consider what is more beneficial for them. Does Kosovo's membership in the Council of Europe bring them more harm or benefit? Who is a more important partner in the Balkans, Belgrade or Pristina? If they insist on Kosovo's membership in the Council of Europe, they can push Serbia even further away, which will then turn more strongly to Russia and China, and that doesn't benefit the West. That's why this visit of the Chinese president is of great importance for Serbia's international position,\" emphasizes Gogic.\n\nHistorian and political analyst Ognjen Karanovic emphasizes that Chinese President Xi Jinping is coming to Serbia at a complex geopolitical moment and that his stay in Belgrade is of immense significance.\n\n\"First and foremost, because China represents a global player, it is a global superpower and from that position represents a guardian of Serbia's territorial integrity and sovereignty. On the other hand, official Belgrade, with the statesmanship abilities of President Vucic, who is today one of the most respected world leaders, can be a link between those cold, complex, poisoned relations of Europe, the political West, and the People's Republic of China. If nothing else, then at least in an economic sense,\" points out Karanovic for Kontekst.\n\nHe adds that this visit represents another seal of friendship between President Vucic and President Xi, as well as between Serbia and China as a whole.\n\n\"President Xi is President Vucic's guest for two days, among other things, on the occasion of marking the 25th anniversary of the heinous bombing of the Chinese Embassy during the NATO aggression against Serbia. On the other hand, the People's Republic of China represents a huge support in the epic, titanic struggle of President Aleksandar Vucic on the diplomatic-political level, especially in the United Nations, regarding Aleksandar Vucic's efforts to protect the southern Serbian province and Republic of Srpska, as well as the entire Serbian people, from the attempts of the political West to finish, let's say, their business in Kosovo and Metohija, which they started with the criminal NATO aggression in 1999. On the other hand, in order to complete their dishonorable task, their monstrous task, they consider it politically opportune to label the entire Serbian people as genocidal now. And of course, in that regard, the support of the People's Republic of China has its immense weight, its immense significance,\" notes Karanovic.\n\nKosovo and Taiwan\n\nSerbia and China, he adds, jointly protect the territorial integrity of both countries, when it comes to Kosovo and the island of Taiwan, which is an integral part of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"On the other hand, this visit will be a, let's say, great boost to fruitful economic cooperation between two truly friendly and partner countries. Last year, the total amount of trade between the two countries exceeded six billion euros. This year it will be one billion more. Companies with Chinese capital in Serbia, three of them, are the largest Serbian exporters, and thus the biggest support to the Serbian budget and public finances. Let's remember that President Vucic's congratulations on the Chinese Lunar New Year were broadcast on Chinese state television in prime time. The broadcast of the congratulatory message was watched by 100 million people, which represents a great gesture of honor and gratitude from the Chinese state to Vucic and Serbia. Relations between Serbia and China are at a historical peak, as confirmed by the recently signed Free Trade Agreement, which is a rare privilege that Chinese grant to some smaller countries in the world,\" emphasized Karanovic.\n\nHe emphasizes that geographical distance is not a barrier to the closest ties between Serbia and China.\n\n\"Serbia is a link between China and Europe, which was also confirmed at last year's meeting between President Vucic and Xi Jinping within the framework of the third Belt and Road Forum in Beijing. And indeed, as much as Europe is far from China, Serbia is close to China and China to Serbia. That's why we can understand this panic in regional media, in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Croatia, and even in the political West, which now points fingers at President Vucic's sovereignist policy. On the other hand, they also want to develop economic cooperation with China. Europe wants that too, but insincerely, because they are bothered by the fact that China benefits from it,\" concludes Karanovic.", "source": {"uri": "kosovo-online.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Xi and his wife arrived in Serbia after concluding his visit to France.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic and his wife, Tamara Vucic, welcomed Xi Jinping at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. Children welcomed Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan by presenting them with flowers and waving the national flags of China and Serbia.\n\nXi arrived in Serbia to mark the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999. The US has apologised for what it called a \"mistaken\" bombing that killed three Chinese nationals and injured 20 others. Xi is expected to pay tribute to those killed at the site, which is now a Chinese cultural centre.\n\nDuring his visit to France, French President Emmanuel Macron pressed Xi Jinping on Russia's military action in Ukraine, trade disputes and human rights. Notably, Xi is on a six-day visit to Europe and after his Serbia visit, he will head to Hungary.\n\nSpeaking to VOA News, Francesco Sisci, an Italian sinologist, said that it appears that China is facing difficulties in its relations with European nations.\n\nSisci said, \"It's interesting that ... China didn't manage to secure more significant countries for Xi's visit to Europe. It seems that China is having greater difficulties in its ties with European countries, and it has good ties with two governments that have also good ties with Moscow. That is -- Europe is moving faster away from China as it sees it too close to Moscow.\"\n\nSerbia and Hungary have developed close ties with Russia and China under Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. China has been investing billions in various projects, including electric vehicles, railways, and factories, in Serbia and Hungary.\n\nJa Ian Chong, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said that Xi will try to stress China's role in supporting stability.\n\n\"Xi will probably try to stress the PRC's [People's Republic of China] role in supporting stability and maybe suggest but not openly accuse the United States of being destabilizing and unnecessarily aggressive,\" VOA News quoted Ja Ian Chong as saying.\n\nThe two nations like China have spoken against sanctions by the US and EU on Russia over its military action in Ukraine, which began in 2022, although Hungary has voted in favour of them.\n\nOrban, despite leading a nation that is both a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and EU member, has friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and held talks with him on the sidelines of the Belt and Road International Cooperation Summit Forum held in Beijing in October.\n\nUnlike other EU members, Hungary continues to purchase the majority of its fuel from Russia. Serbia is a candidate to join the European Union. Viktor Orban is the only leader who attended the Summit and met Xi Jinping.\n\nDragana Mitrovic, a political science professor at the University of Belgrade, said those ties have triggered tensions with Hungary's partners in the West.\n\nMitrovic said, \"In this moment of tense geopolitical competition and measuring economic and overall cooperation by strategic gains and losses, Hungary will continue to be under pressure from Brussels and Washington when pursuing cooperation with China,\" VOA News reported.\n\nUpon arriving in Serbia, Xi in a written statement stated, \"China and Serbia enjoy profound traditional friendship. Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xinhua reported.\n\nXi said he looks forward to taking this visit as an opportunity to hold talks with Aleksandar Vuvic on bilateral ties and other issues of mutual interest, renewing friendship, planning for cooperation, exploring development, and creating a new blueprint for the development of bilateral relations.\n\nHe said, \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\" Xi Jinping arrived in Serbia at the invitation of Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.\n\nThis report is auto-generated from a syndicated feed\n\nComments", "source": {"uri": "indiandefensenews.in", "dataType":

In Serbia, which is seen as China's most important partner in the Balkans, Xi is expected to discuss China\u00b4s multi-billion investment in the country and possible new deals.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic and government officials welcomed Xi at the Belgrade airport, where he was greeted by a military guard of honor and folk dancers. The two leaders will hold a meeting on Wednesday.\n\nOn May 7, 1999, 20 Chinese nationals were wounded in the NATO attack, which prompted outrage in China and an apology from then U.S. President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe embassy was hit during a campaign against the then Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\n\"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself,\" Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday.\n\n\"The friendship between China and Serbia which is soaked in blood that the two peoples spilled together has become a joint memory of the two peoples and will encourage both parties to make together huge steps forward,\" Xi said.\n\nThe Belgrade streets were decorated with Chinese flags and placards as thousands of police officers were deployed to secure Xi and his 400-member entourage, the highest-level visit by a foreign leader in years.\n\nIRONCLAD FRIENDSHIP\n\nXi is visiting Serbia after France, where President Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen pressed him to ensure more balanced trade with Europe and use his influence on Russia to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nDuring his first visit to Belgrade in 2016, the two countries signed a strategic partnership. Last year, Vucic signed 18 agreements with Xi in Beijing, including a free trade deal that should become operational in July.\n\nBoth leaders insist on an ironclad partnership between their countries. Along with Hungary, which is Xi\u00b4s next stop, Serbia is Europe's firmest supporter of China's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nChina runs mines and factories across Serbia and has lent billions for roads, bridges and new facilities, becoming Serbia's key partner in much-needed infrastructure development.\n\nObservers say Xi's choice of Serbia and Hungary is designed to pull closer two European countries that are pro-Russia and large recipients of Chinese investment. Serbia's Western partners view the country as a Chinese hub at the gateway to the EU.\n\nIn 2023, China was Serbia's second-largest trading partner after the EU with a total trade exchange of $6.1 billion and among its top five investors, according to the national investment agency.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Among those welcoming Xi at the Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vucic. The two heads of state will hold meetings on Wednesday.\n\nTwo fighter jets were dispatched to escort Xi's plane upon its entry into Serbia's airspace. Over the past days, the streets of Belgrade have been richly ornamented with Chinese features, not least the flying Chinese national flags and waving banners.\n\nIn a signed article published Tuesday in Politika, a Belgrade-based Serbian daily, Xi wrote that the ironclad friendship between the two countries is ever-growing. \"Whatever changes in the international landscape, China and Serbia remain true friends and good partners.\"\n\n\"Together we will build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era,\" Xi wrote.\n\nThe Chinese president's arrival coincides with the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nIn 1999, the U.S.-led NATO forces carried out savage airstrikes for 78 days against Yugoslavia, leaving more than 8,000 civilians dead or injured and nearly 1 million more displaced. On the night of May 7, exactly 25 years ago, NATO bombed the Chinese embassy, killing three Chinese journalists, including one from Xinhua.\n\n\"The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself,\" Xi wrote in the article. \"The China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides.\"\n\nAleksandar Mitic, research fellow in International Relations at the Institute of International Politics and Economics in Belgrade, told Xinhua that the friendship, tempered by blood and fire, \"will represent a cornerstone for cooperation in the future.\"\n\nDuring Xi's last state visit to Serbia in 2016, Xi made the site of the old embassy as his first stop to pay homage to the Chinese martyrs killed in the NATO bombing in 1999.\n\nThe ruins of the embassy have now been revamped into a Chinese cultural center for local residents in Serbia to learn both Chinese language and traditional culture. The square outside the center was also renamed \"Serbia-China Friendship Square.\"\n\nGordana, a local resident working nearby who didn't reveal her full name, referred to the bombing as a \"painful memory\" to her. \"The cooperation between China and Serbia holds the promise of providing my children with a better life than I experienced,\" she told Xinhua.\n\nPast years have seen leapfrog growth of China-Serbia cooperation. Two-way trade in 2023 surged to 4.35 billion U.S. dollars, Chinese customs statistics showed. In 2022, China became the largest source of direct investment for Serbia. In October 2023, witnessed by Xi and Vucic, China and Serbia signed a free trade agreement. After the deal takes effect, more than 60 percent of taxable items will become tariff-free immediately, and the final import volume proportion of both sides with zero-tariff items will reach about 95 percent.\n\nUnder the framework of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative are flagship projects such as the Smederevo Steelworks and the high-speed railway between Belgrade and Budapest. An integral segment of the Belgrade-Budapest railway is the high-speed train linking Belgrade and Serbia's second-largest city Novi Sad, which has transported some 6.83 million passengers over the past two years.\n\n\"We mainly cooperated in the field of transportation and energy field,\" said Katarina Zakic, head of the Regional Centre Belt and Road at the Institute of International Politics and Economics. In the future, cooperation will be important in the fields of green energy and e-commerce, she told Xinhua.\n\nAlready, Chinese companies and their Serbian counterparts are working on a number of green energy programs, such as the Saraorci Photovoltaic Project. Upon completion, the project will provide more than 16 million kilowatt-hours of green electricity every year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 16,000 tons.\n\nSerbia, undoubtedly, stands as a reliable partner for China in Europe, said Aleksandar Vojvodic, head engineer of the Clean Serbia Project of China Road and Bridge Corporation.\n\nThere will be a promising prospect for further enhancement and expansion of existing cooperation, said Vojvodic. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Aleksandar Vucic and Xi Jinping", "body": "Chinese President Xi Jinping is coming to Europe for the first time in five years, and from May 5th to 10th, he will visit France, Hungary, and Serbia. Commentators on Kosovo online emphasize that the visit to Serbia speaks to the importance China attaches to this country. The meeting of the two presidents, Xi Jinping and Aleksandar Vucic, in Belgrade, will mark not only agreements on further major projects but also equally significant face-to-face discussions on current events in the world and the region, as well as key issues for Serbia - Kosovo and the Resolution on Srebrenica in the UN General Assembly.\n\nAnnouncing President Xi's European tour, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Dijian assessed that it is of great importance in promoting the overall development of China's relations with France, Hungary, and Serbia, as well as with the whole of Europe.\n\nHe emphasized that China looks forward to the opportunity to \"consolidate and enhance ironclad friendship with Serbia on May 7th and 8th,\" and that the two presidents will discuss bilateral relations and the enhancement of China-Serbia relations.\n\nEven Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic does not hide that the visit of the Chinese president is a great honor for Serbia, not only because it is one of the most powerful countries in the world but also because it is exceptionally friendly towards Serbia and participates in numerous projects with it.\n\nHe added that he is proud of the exceptional relationship between the two countries and regrets that in Europe, there have been \"voices\" suggesting that Serbia should not host the Chinese president.\n\n\"I am sorry to have seen that some European parliamentarians, since they dare not say anything to Macron, are taking it out on Serbia, and would like to prevent us from hosting President Xi. I am proud that President Xi will visit Serbia for the second time,\" Vucic said.\n\nHe emphasized that their state-owned company is constructing Expo 2027, engaging all Serbian companies, and reminded that as of July 1st, the Free Trade Agreement between the People's Republic of China and Serbia, signed in mid-October last year, will come into effect.\n\nWith this agreement, 843 types of Serbian products will be able to enter the Chinese market duty-free.\n\nEconomic and political aspects\n\nVucic pointed out that during discussions with President Xi, he will initiate projects for accelerated technological development in areas where Serbia lacks sufficient knowledge: robotics, satellite technology, and flying cars.\n\n\"This is a way for us to keep pace with the world and further develop our best relationships,\" Vucic said, adding that high-speed trains from China have arrived in Serbia and will be used in traffic on the Belgrade-Subotica high-speed railway.\n\nChinese Ambassador to Belgrade Li Ming assessed that the visit at the highest state level of President Xi Jinping to Serbia represents a milestone for raising the level of cooperation and upgrading the relationship between Serbia and China.\n\nWhen asked if the topics of the two heads of state will include the resolution on Srebrenica and Kosovo and Metohija, Ambassador Ming emphasized that China has a clear stance that it is necessary to fully respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity and dignity of sovereign countries. According to him, regarding disputed issues, they should be resolved based on full consultations and communications.\n\n\"China and Serbia are ironclad friends, and consistently, our two countries provide each other with unequivocal support on issues of essential interest and those significant for preserving territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" Ming said.\n\nAsked to clarify China's stance on Kosovo, the Chinese Ambassador in Belgrade was unequivocal.\n\n\"Regarding the issue of Kosovo and Metohija, the Chinese side always respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia and understands the legitimate concerns of the Serbian side on this issue and appreciates the efforts of the Serbian side to find a political solution to that issue,\" the ambassador stated, adding that UN Security Council Resolution 1244 should always be the basis and framework for resolving that issue, and in that process of preserving sovereignty and territorial integrity, it should be respected.\n\n\"Double standards should not be applied here,\" Ming said.\n\nThe ambassador said that the Chinese side has noticed, regarding the resolution on Srebrenica, that there are disputes on that issue and about that draft.\n\n\"The Chinese side believes that all parties should, based on complete communication and consensus, jointly do things for the benefit of regional stability, and that should be in favor of strengthening solidarity and stability, not the opposite,\" he stated.\n\nThe importance of the visit and symbolism\n\nAnalyzing the visit of the Chinese president, Dragoslav Raseta, an analyst from the \"New Third Way,\" commenting for Kosovo Online, says that the choice of Serbia as one of the three destinations on the European tour of the Chinese president undoubtedly speaks to the importance that Serbia has for Chinese investments and Chinese influence in Europe.\n\nHe adds that it is not at all accidental that the Chinese president decided to visit Serbia precisely on May 7th and 8th, noting that it marks the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Belgrade.\n\n\"In this way, the Chinese president sends a clear message that this event is not forgotten and that relations between the West and China are still unfavorable,\" says Raseta.\n\nHe emphasizes that the key goal of the European tour of Chinese President Xi Jinping is to improve the chilled relations between the EU and the People's Republic of China in talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, and that alongside economic issues, key topics in discussions with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic will be the issue of Kosovo and the Resolution on Srebrenica.\n\n\"This is his first visit to Europe in the last five years, and he will certainly seek to improve relations that have drifted apart in recent years between our continent and China. The political background for Serbia will certainly be the situation in the UN, the Resolution on Srebrenica, and the general question of Kosovo, but I think that above all, economic issues will dominate because there is still a month until the ratification of the free trade agreement between Serbia and China. That will be the main topic of Xi's visit to Serbia,\" Raseta emphasizes for Kosovo Online.\n\nAccording to him, the fact that the Chinese president has chosen Serbia among the countries he will visit speaks to the importance that this country holds for Chinese investments and Chinese influence in Europe.\n\n\"With the visit to Serbia, a message is sent that China has Serbia in mind and that these relations have been deepening since 2009, especially since 2014, with more investments. The volume of cooperation and trade exchange is increasing, and from that perspective, this visit has been arranged for a longer period,\" says Raseta.\n\nBojan Lalic, Director of the Institute for Belt and Road, believes that the key message of the visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping is continuity in every form of cooperation, and that for Serbia, the friendship of such a major player on the global economic and political stage is extremely significant.\n\n\"When you look at the envoy of President Xi, how often and how many countries he visits, it is quite clear how significant it is. The significance is great. Is it significant at this moment? Unfortunately, Serbia is in a situation where we frequently come across such moments, so the much more important aspect is that continuous relationship of support and reliance rather than a specific moment. Of course, the specific moment is extremely challenging, but a new one will come, such is life. The friendship of such a major player on the global economic and political stage is extremely significant,\" Lalic explains for Kosovo Online.\n\nHe emphasizes that the key word that can most accurately describe the visit of the Chinese president to Serbia is continuity.\n\n\"Already, we are at a level of cooperation with China where the greatest expectation we have, and which will certainly be fulfilled, is continuity. Continuity of relations, cooperation in political, economic, and every other sense. That continuity and meetings of the two presidents, heads of government, certainly testify to that,\" says Lalic.\n\nAsked about what topics could be on the agenda for discussions between the two presidents and whether the issue of Kosovo and initiatives for the adoption of a resolution on Srebrenica will be included, Lalic says it's purely speculative, but there is no doubt that the presidents will touch upon all the topics that are currently of utmost importance for Serbia.\n\n\"We can speculate on what the topics might be, but they will certainly be those that are extremely important for Serbia today, but let's leave it to the two presidents,\" Lalic said.\n\nStrategic partners - ironclad friendship\n\nNikola Zivlak, Academic Director of undergraduate and postgraduate studies at the Asian Campus of the EMLYON Business School in Shanghai, assesses for Kosovo Online that Xi Jinping's visit carries a clear political message that China and Serbia are strategic partners bound by ironclad friendship.\n\n\"Any president coming to our country is significant, and when the president of China, the world's second-largest economy, visits, it is extremely significant. Especially since President Xi is probably one of the most powerful presidents in the world alongside a few others. The Chinese will see it as a great opportunity and a major trigger for further projects. I expect even greater intensification of cooperation, especially in some economic domains. As a university professor, I am also interested in the moment of academic exchange between universities, and I think that will be very significant,\" says Zivlak.\n\nHe emphasizes that the political message of this visit is unequivocal: China and Serbia are strategic partners.\n\n\"A visit by the Chinese president is always a big deal for any country, especially small states like ours. The political message of this visit is definitely that China and Serbia are strategic partners, that they have ironclad friendship,\" emphasizes Zivlak.\n\nThis is explained by the fact that during his European tour, the Chinese president will only visit Hungary and France besides Serbia.\n\nHe emphasizes that the focus of discussions between the two presidents will be on economic issues and ongoing projects.\n\nWhen asked whether the visit of President Xi to Serbia also carries a symbolic message given the current events in Kosovo, and then the question of the adoption of the Resolution on Srebrenica at the UN General Assembly, Professor Zivlak has no doubt that this visit also carries a strong political message.\n\n\"In that sense, the visit is very significant. China supports us not only regarding Kosovo but also all open issues, of course, including Srebrenica, so in that sense, the symbolism is very clear: China stands by us, it's friendship. People should be positive about President Xi's visit,\" Zivlak concluded.", "source": {"uri": "kosovo-online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kosovo Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

After passing through Paris, Xi went to Belgrade to receive a mass bath and commemorate, together with President Aleksandar Vucic, the 25th anniversary of the accidental NATO bombing of his embassy in Belgrade.\n\nThe symbolic meaning of the visit is enormous, in a country where the NATO bombings are the fact that generates the most consensus of social rejection. Serbian society, despite pending possible EU membership, has harbored deep anti-Atlantic sentiment since the 1999 campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force Slobodan Milosevic to end the deliberate repression of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\nThe attack against the Chinese embassy took place on the night between May 7 and 8. Five bombs fell on the diplomatic compound, killing three Chinese journalists. Twenty more people from this country were injured, in an attack that generated a deep rejection in China and forced the then president of the United States, Bill Clinton, to ask for forgiveness. Two of the journalists, Xu Xinghu (31) and Zhu Ying (27), were newlyweds. The third victim was Shao Yunhuan, 48, of the Chinese state news agency Xinhua. Her husband was one of the injured and was blinded. Washington then assured that the strike was a mistake and that the real target was the Yugoslav military procurement agency, about 500 meters away. They then agreed to compensate Beijing with $28 million.\n\nOver the years, the episode has become an ingredient in the anti-Western rhetoric of Chinese nationalism and has been revived in recent times of rising tensions with the White House. Last year, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, Wang Wenbin, assured that \"Beijing has not forgotten or forgiven the bombing of its embassy in Belgrade in May 1999\". Xi expressed himself in the same vein in an article published this week in the Serbian newspaper Politika on the occasion of the visit. \"The Chinese people appreciate peace, but they will never allow a historical tragedy to be repeated,\" Xi wrote. The friendship between China and Serbia has been forged with the blood of our compatriots, who will remain in the shared memory of our two peoples.\"\n\nRelations between China and Serbia today are close, both in the political and economic fields. In his speech, Vucic, who wants both Beijing and the Kremlin to continue not recognizing Kosovo's independence, reiterated that Belgrade considers Taiwan an integral part of China. In exchange for support in countering Kosovo's ambition for independence, Serbia has allowed billions of euros in Chinese investment. \"We will have strong support from China in all matters that are addressed at the UN. Serbia is often under pressure from the great powers. Serbia will strongly oppose attempts at historical revision and historical memories,\" stressed Vucic yesterday, at a time when Belgrade is worried about the possibility of the Council of Europe accepting Kosovo as a full member.\n\n\"Despite wanting to enter the EU, Serbia does not want to give up having a good relationship with Russia and China. Both are countries that agree to defend the territorial unity of the State\", explains Aljosa Ajanovic, from the City to City Association - District 11, which promotes rapprochement between Catalonia and the Balkans. \"Since Vucic has been in power, commercial relations have intensified a lot. Serbia was one of the first countries in Europe to receive the Chinese vaccine and Beijing is a major investor in Serbia, which does not demand as many human rights guarantees as the EU,\" he says.\n\nAfter the EU, China is the second trading partner of Serbia, which in turn is a member of the so-called Chinese New Silk Road, the massive infrastructure program with which the Asian giant wants to shore up its influence in the world Beijing has mines and factories all over Serbia, and has built bridges and roads thanks to the enthusiasm of Vucic, who last year signed a free trade agreement that takes effect in July and provides for the uprising, hence ten years, of the tariffs for a wide number of products. Yesterday both signed thirty new memoranda to intensify their cooperation. \"The respect and love he will find here, in our Serbia, he will not find in other places\", Vucic promised him.", "source":

We will support Serbia in safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Kosovo issue,\" he said.\n\n\"The two sides will continue to advocate fairness and justice and jointly oppose hegemonism and power politics,\" he told reporters.\n\nDuring their talks, Xi called Vucic \"my dear friend\", saying that his visit in 2016 was still fresh in his memory.\n\nHe noted the \"gratifying progress\" in Belt and Road cooperation between China and Serbia.

During his first visit to Belgrade in 2016, the two countries signed a strategic partnership.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping is due to land in Serbia on Tuesday on the 25th anniversary of the accidental NATO bombing of China's Embassy in which three Chinese journalists were killed, the second stop of his first European tour in five years.\n\nTwenty Chinese nationals were wounded in the 1999 NATO attack, which prompted outrage in China and an apology from then U.S. President Bill Clinton. The embassy was hit during a campaign against the then Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\n\"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself,\" Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday. \"The friendship between China and Serbia which is soaked in blood that the two peoples spilled together has become a joint memory of the two peoples and will encourage both parties to make together huge steps forward,\" Xi said.\n\nThe streets of Belgrade were decorated with Chinese flags and placards as thousands of police officers were deployed to secure Xi and his 400-member entourage. IRONCLAD FRIENDSHIP\n\nXi is visiting Serbia after France, where President Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen pressed him to ensure more balanced trade with Europe and use his influence on Russia to end the war in Ukraine. Xi is expected to discuss China\u00b4s multi-billion investment in Serbia and possible new deals.\n\nDuring his first visit to Belgrade in 2016, the two countries signed a strategic partnership. Last year, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic signed 18 agreements with Xi in Beijing, including a free trade deal that should become operational in July. The two leaders talk about an ironclad partnership between their countries. Along with Hungary, which is Xi\u00b4s next stop, Serbia is Europe's firmest supporter of the China's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nChina runs mines and factories across Serbia and has lent billions for roads, bridges and new facilities, becoming its key partner in much-needed infrastructure development. Observers say Xi's choice of Serbia and Hungary is designed to pull closer two European countries that are pro-Russia and large recipients of Chinese investment. Serbia's Western partners view the country as a Chinese hub at the gateway to the EU.\n\nIn 2023, China was Serbia's second-largest trading partner after the EU with a total trade exchange of $6.1 billion and among the top five investors, according to the latest figures by the national investment agency.

The US has apologised for what it called a \"mistaken\" bombing that killed three Chinese nationals and injured 20 others. Xi is expected to pay tribute to those killed at the site, which is now a Chinese cultural centre.\n\nAlso Read | AstraZeneca Withdraws COVID-19 Vaccine Worldwide, Cites Commercial Reasons Amid Side-Effect Row.\n\nDuring his visit to France, French President Emmanuel Macron pressed Xi Jinping on Russia's military action in Ukraine, trade disputes and human rights. Notably, Xi is on a six-day visit to Europe and after his Serbia visit, he will head to Hungary.\n\nSpeaking to VOA News, Francesco Sisci, an Italian sinologist, said that it appears that China is facing difficulties in its relations with European nations.\n\nSisci said, \"It's interesting that ... China didn't manage to secure more significant countries for Xi's visit to Europe. It seems that China is having greater difficulties in its ties with European countries, and it has good ties with two governments that have also good ties with Moscow. That is -- Europe is moving faster away from China as it sees it too close to Moscow.\"\n\nSerbia and Hungary have developed close ties with Russia and China under Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. China has been investing billions in various projects, including electric vehicles, railways, and factories, in Serbia and Hungary.\n\nJa Ian Chong, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said that Xi will try to stress China's role in supporting stability.\n\n\"Xi will probably try to stress the PRC's [People's Republic of China] role in supporting stability and maybe suggest but not openly accuse the United States of being destabilizing and unnecessarily aggressive,\" VOA News quoted Ja Ian Chong as saying.\n\nThe two nations like China have spoken against sanctions by the US and EU on Russia over its military action in Ukraine, which began in 2022, although Hungary has voted in favour of them.\n\nOrban, despite leading a nation that is both a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and EU member, has friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and held talks with him on the sidelines of the Belt and Road International Cooperation Summit Forum held in Beijing in October.\n\nUnlike other EU members, Hungary continues to purchase the majority of its fuel from Russia. Serbia is a candidate to join the European Union. Viktor Orban is the only leader who attended the Summit and met Xi Jinping.\n\nDragana Mitrovic, a political science professor at the University of Belgrade, said those ties have triggered tensions with Hungary's partners in the West.\n\nMitrovic said, \"In this moment of tense geopolitical competition and measuring economic and overall cooperation by strategic gains and losses, Hungary will continue to be under pressure from Brussels and Washington when pursuing cooperation with China,\" VOA News reported.\n\nUpon arriving in Serbia, Xi in a written statement stated, \"China and Serbia enjoy profound traditional friendship. Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xinhua reported.\n\nXi said he looks forward to taking this visit as an opportunity to hold talks with Aleksandar Vuvic on bilateral ties and other issues of mutual interest, renewing friendship, planning for cooperation, exploring development, and creating a new blueprint for the development of bilateral relations.\n\nHe said, \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\" Xi Jinping arrived in Serbia at the invitation of Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.

IRONCLAD FRIENDSHIP Xi is visiting Serbia after France, where President Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen pressed him to ensure more balanced trade with Europe and use his influence on Russia to end the war in Ukraine. During his first visit to Belgrade in 2016, the two countries signed a strategic partnership.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Serbia on Tuesday evening escorted by MIG-29 jets in a tightly secured visit coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of China's embassy in which three Chinese journalists were killed. Belgrade, after France, is the second stop on Xi's first visit to Europe in five years, which also includes Hungary. In Serbia, which is seen as China's most important partner in the Balkans, Xi is expected to discuss China\u00b4s multi-billion investment in the country and possible new deals.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic and government officials welcomed Xi at the Belgrade airport, where he was greeted by a military guard of honor and folk dancers. The two leaders will hold a meeting on Wednesday. On May 7, 1999, 20 Chinese nationals were wounded in the NATO attack, which prompted outrage in China and an apology from then U.S. President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe embassy was hit during a campaign against the then Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. \"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself,\" Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday.\n\n\"The friendship between China and Serbia which is soaked in blood that the two peoples spilled together has become a joint memory of the two peoples and will encourage both parties to make together huge steps forward,\" Xi said. The Belgrade streets were decorated with Chinese flags and placards as thousands of police officers were deployed to secure Xi and his 400-member entourage, the highest-level visit by a foreign leader in years.\n\nIRONCLAD FRIENDSHIP Xi is visiting Serbia after France, where President Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen pressed him to ensure more balanced trade with Europe and use his influence on Russia to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nDuring his first visit to Belgrade in 2016, the two countries signed a strategic partnership. Last year, Vucic signed 18 agreements with Xi in Beijing, including a free trade deal that should become operational in July. Both leaders insist on an ironclad partnership between their countries. Along with Hungary, which is Xi\u00b4s next stop, Serbia is Europe's firmest supporter of China's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nChina runs mines and factories across Serbia and has lent billions for roads, bridges and new facilities, becoming Serbia's key partner in much-needed infrastructure development. Observers say Xi's choice of Serbia and Hungary is designed to pull closer two European countries that are pro-Russia and large recipients of Chinese investment. Serbia's Western partners view the country as a Chinese hub at the gateway to the EU.\n\nIn 2023, China was Serbia's second-largest trading partner after the EU with a total trade exchange of $6.1 billion and among its top five investors, according to the national investment agency.

It will also see him visit Hungary on May 8-9.\n\nXi's first trip to Europe in five years is seen as part of his drive to increase Beijing's influence on the continent's economic and political affairs.\n\nVucic has promoted Chinese investment and trade and diplomatic ties for his Balkan nation of around 7 million as he has sought to balance outreach to Russia and China and the bucking of Western sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine war with his country's bid for eventual EU membership.\n\nSpeaking from a balcony of the presidential palace, Vucic thanked Xi for visiting \"little Serbia\" and said they were \"making history today even though it doesn't seem so to many.\"\n\nXi called it a \"truly two-sided and honest friendship,\" according to Serbian state television.\n\nLike Moscow, Beijing has supported Belgrade diplomatically in its refusal to recognize former province Kosovo's independence, while Belgrade has supported China's claims to Taiwan. \"Taiwan is China,\" Vucic said on May 8, citing the UN Charter.\n\nXi's visit was seemingly timed to coincide with the 25th anniversary of NATO's bombing of the former Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999, a deadly incident that has united Beijing and Belgrade in their criticism of Western intervention in the Balkans and around the world.\n\nChina has invested some $6 billion in Serbia in the past decade, putting the money into copper mines and a steel mill as well as major highway and infrastructure projects that have been criticized by some as nontransparent and overly risky deals between governments.\n\nChinese and Serbian officials were expected to sign more than 30 agreements in areas that Vucic suggested were in many cases aimed at boosting technology and innovation in Serbia.\n\nAhead of the Chinese president's arrival, Belgrade was decorated with flags of Serbia and China, and welcome messages were set up along the route from the airport to the city center in Serbian and Chinese.\n\nXi also made Serbia a stop in 2016, when he signed a free-trade agreement with Belgrade that alarmed skeptics of Chinese economic and political intentions in Europe.",

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIt was not immediately clear what a \"shared future\" meant, but it is unlikely to be met with approval from the EU.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAhead of the meeting, both sides expressed optimism that Xi's visit would further boost the \"ironclad\" friendly relations between China and the Balkan country.\n\nXi arrived in Serbia to a warm welcome on Tuesday evening from France, where he had a high-stakes state visit dominated by trade disputes and Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThousands of people chanting \"China-Serbia\" and waving flags were bused in from across Serbia to attend a welcoming ceremony for Xi on Wednesday in front of the Serbia Palace, in the new part of Belgrade where the talks were held.\n\nSerbia's populist president addressed the crowd from a balcony, calling Xi an \"ironclad\" friend. He said his visit to Serbia was \"historic\" because it opened the path for even closer ties.\n\n\"We are writing history today although it doesn't seem so to many,\" Vucic said. \"We thank President Xi. He hasn't come to Europe in five years and he has again chosen our little Serbia.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt the start of the official meeting on Wednesday, Xi said \"we are first-hand witnesses that the Serbian people view Chinese people as ironclad best friends.\"\n\n\"This is truly two-sided and truthful friendship ... I truly hail this and it really made an extremely deep impression on me,\" Xi said, according to the state RTS television.\n\nXi is traveling to Hungary later on Wednesday. Like Serbia, Hungary is seen as one of China's more friendly partners in Europe.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were visible throughout the Serbian capital. A huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nChina has poured billions of dollars into Serbia in investment and loans, particularly in mining and infrastructure. The two countries signed an agreement on a strategic partnership in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSome of those agreements, such as the free trade pact, are not in line with EU conditions for membership. Although Serbia formally wants to join the 27-nation bloc, it has been steadily drifting away from that path.\n\nSerbia, a landlocked nation in the heart of the Balkans, has been a key country in China's Belt and Road initiative designed to increase Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investment. Critics say it could serve as a Chinese Trojan horse and gateway to Europe.\n\nXi arrived in Serbia on a symbolic date -- the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by U.S. jets during NATO's air war over Kosovo, when three Chinese citizens were killed.\n\nThe incident has helped forge close political ties between China and Serbia.\n\nChinese companies run Serbia's biggest copper mine and a steel mill, and are also building scores of roads and highways across the country, along with a railway toward northern neighbor Hungary.\n\nIn 2014, Hungary and Serbia concluded an agreement with Beijing to modernize the railway between their capitals of Budapest and Belgrade, part of a Belt and Road plan to link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece to the south, an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe more than $2 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026, after numerous delays.\n\nIn 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia took semi-secret delivery of a sophisticated Chinese anti-aircraft system flown in on Chinese Air Force Y-20 transport planes.\n\nThe arms delivery over the territory of at least two NATO member states, Turkey and Bulgaria, was seen by experts as a demonstration of China's growing global reach.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ken Moritsugu contributed from Taipei, Taiwan.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Serbian Air Force sent two fighter jets to escort Xi's aircraft after it entered Serbia's airspace, Xinhua reported.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic and his wife, Tamara Vucic, welcomed Xi Jinping at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. Children welcomed Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan by presenting them with flowers and waving the national flags of China and Serbia. Xi arrived in Serbia after concluding his visit to France.\n\nIn a written statement after arriving in Serbia, Xi stated, \"China and Serbia enjoy profound traditional friendship. Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xinhua reported.\n\nXi said he looks forward to taking this visit as an opportunity to hold talks with Aleksandar Vuvic on bilateral ties and other issues of mutual interest, renewing friendship, planning for cooperation, exploring development, and creating a new blueprint for the development of bilateral relations.\n\nHe said, \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\" Xi said, \"It gives me great pleasure to pay a state visit to the Republic of Serbia at the warm invitation of President Vucic.\"\n\nHe further said, \"On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I would like to extend heartfelt greetings and best wishes to the friendly government and people of Serbia,\" he added.\n\nXi noted that the ties between the two nations have witnessed leapfrog development and achieved historic results since the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership in 2016, according to Xinhua report.\n\nHe said that China and Serbia have given each other firm support on issues related to their respective core interests and major concerns, He further said, \"We have jointly upheld international fairness and justice, and contributed our share to promoting world peace and development.\"\n\nBefore arriving in Serbia, Xi Jinping was on a two-day visit to France. During his visit, he held talks with his French counterpart at Elysee Palace in Paris on Monday as the two countries marked 60 years of diplomatic relations.\n\nAt a press conference, the two leaders called for \"a truce\" in Ukraine and other global conflicts during the Paris Olympic Games. Xi and Macron also discussed China's ongoing support for Russia's leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nMacron welcomed Chinese \"commitments\" to \"abstain from selling any weapons\" to Russia and \"closely control the export of dual-usage equipment,\" saying that such statements were \"reassuring,\" Politico reported.\n\nXi quoted by Xinhua, warned against \"smearing\" China over Ukraine and called on all parties to resume engagement and dialogue to build mutual trust. The Chinese President said that China and France should uphold independence and jointly prevent a \"new Cold War\" or bloc confrontation.\n\nA 10-point statement was released by the Elysee on the declaration between France and China on the situation in West Asia. This came just after Hamas officials gave their nod for a ceasefire deal for Gaza put forward by Qatari and Egyptian mediators.\n\nIn the statement, Macron and Xi \"expressed their opposition to an Israeli offensive on Rafah, which would lead to a humanitarian catastrophe on a new scale\".\n\nThe two heads of state stressed that an immediate and lasting ceasefire is urgently needed to allow the large-scale delivery of humanitarian aid and the protection of civilians in the Gaza Strip and called for \"immediate and unconditional release of all hostages\" and the guarantee of humanitarian access to meet their medical and other humanitarian needs as well as respect for international law with respect to all those detained.\n\nThey also reiterated their commitment to promoting a political and diplomatic settlement on the Iranian nuclear issue.

After his visit to Paris, Xi went to Belgrade to take a mass bath and commemorate, together with President Alexander Vucic, the 25th anniversary of the accidental bombing of his embassy in Belgrade by NATO.\n\nThe symbolic meaning of the visit is enormous, in a country where NATO bombings are the fact that generates the most consensus of social rejection. Serbian society, despite its possible accession to the EU, maintains a deep feeling against the Atlantic alliance since the 1999 campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force Slobodan Milosevic to end the deliberate repression of ethnic Albanians. in Kosovo.\n\nThe attack against the Chinese embassy occurred on the night between May 7 and 8. Five bombs fell on the diplomatic compound and caused the death of three Chinese journalists. Another twenty people from that country were injured, in an attack that generated deep rejection in China and forced the then president of the United States, Bill Clinton, to ask for forgiveness. Two of the journalists, Xu Xinghu (31 years old) and Zhu Ying (27 years old) were newly married. The third victim was Shao Yunhuan, 48, of the Chinese state news agency Xinhua. Her husband was one of those injured and went blind. Washington then claimed that the coup occurred by mistake and that the real target was the Yugoslav agency for military procurement, about 500 meters away. Afterwards, they agreed to compensate Beijing with 28 million dollars.\n\nOver the years, the episode has become an ingredient in the anti-Western rhetoric of Chinese nationalism and has been revived in recent times of rising tensions with the White House. Last year, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said that \"Beijing has neither forgotten nor forgiven the May 1999 bombing of its embassy in Belgrade.\" Xi expressed along the same lines in an article published this week by the Serbian newspaper Politika on the occasion of the trip. \"The Chinese people cherish peace, but will never allow a historical tragedy to be repeated,\" Xi wrote. \"The friendship between China and Serbia has been forged with the blood of our compatriots, which will remain in the shared memory of our two peoples.\"\n\nRelations between China and Serbia today are close, both politically and economically. In his speech, Vucic, who wants both Beijing and the Kremlin to continue not recognizing Kosovo's independence, reiterated that Belgrade considers Taiwan an integral part of China. In exchange for support to counter Kosovo's ambition for independence, Serbia has allowed in billions of euros of Chinese investment. \"We will have strong support from China in all issues addressed at the UN. Serbia is not infrequently under pressure from the great powers. Serbia will intensely oppose attempts at historical revision and historical memories,\" Vucic stressed yesterday, at a time when Belgrade is concerned about the possibility of the Council of Europe accepting Kosovo as a full member.\n\n\"Despite wanting to join the EU, Serbia does not want to give up having a good relationship with Russia and China. Both are countries that agree to defend the territorial unity of the State,\" explains Aljosa Ajanovic, from the Associaci\u00f3 Districte 11-City to City, which promotes rapprochement between Catalonia and the Balkans. \"Since Vucic has been in power, trade relations have intensified a lot. \"Serbia was one of the first countries in Europe to receive the Chinese vaccine and Beijing is a main investor in Serbia, which does not ask for as many human rights guarantees as the EU,\" she adds.\n\nAfter the EU, China is Serbia's second trading partner, which in turn is a member of the so-called New Chinese Silk Road, the massive infrastructure program with which the Asian giant wants to shore up its influence in the world. Beijing has mines and factories throughout Serbia, and has built bridges and roads thanks to the enthusiasm of Vucic, who last year signed a free trade agreement that comes into force in July and provides for the lifting, in ten years, of tariffs for a wide number of products. Yesterday, both signed around thirty new memoranda to intensify their cooperation. \"The respect and love that you will find here, in our Serbia, you will not find anywhere else,\" Vucic promised.",

It has now become one of the world's largest iron and steel makers and integrated service providers measured by production capacity.\n\nThe rebirth of the steel mill stands as a key epitome of the broader practical cooperation between the two countries.\n\nAs Chinese President Xi Jinping pays his second state visit to the European country in the coming days, expectations are running high that the ironclad friendship between the two nations will be further enriched and strengthened.\n\nMany big Chinese investment projects here were brought about by President Xi, former Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic said. \"He is a sincere friend of Serbia.\"\n\nAN ICON REBORN\n\nDuring his first state visit to Serbia in 2016, Xi offered a strong helping hand to the Smederevo Steelworks, ushering in a wave of Chinese support.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic clearly remembers how he, then as prime minister, approached Xi during the latter's visit with the idea of saving the struggling company. Xi assured him with a famous Chinese saying that \"promises must be kept, and actions must be resultful.\"\n\n\"What we pledge to do, such as introducing cutting-edge technology, ensuring local employment, and benefiting the wider community, must be achieved without fail,\" Xi told the workers when visiting the factory.\n\nVladan Mihailovic, executive director for production at the steelworks, described Xi's visit as a turning point. With Xi's support, China offered sustained assistance to Serbia to revive the factory.\n\n\"The president's commitments, especially regarding the modernization of production facilities, have become a reality,\" said Mihailovic.\n\nAbout 60 km away to the northwest of the steelworks nestles the Belgrade Centre railway station, the starting point of another Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation project Xi cares about -- the Belgrade-Novi Sad high-speed railway.\n\nAs a segment of the Serbia-Hungary railway, it began operations in March 2022 and has since been shuttling passengers between Serbia's two largest cities at speeds of up to 200 km per hour. Vucic dubbed it \"a gift for future generations.\"\n\nThe flourishing cooperation between Beijing and Belgrade within the framework of the BRI epitomizes the growing synergy between development strategies of the two countries, which has significantly bolstered bilateral economic and trade relations.\n\nAccording to Chinese customs statistics, the total trade volume between China and Serbia in 2023 reached 4.35 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 23.7 percent compared to the previous year.\n\nIn October last year, witnessed by Xi and Vucic, China and Serbia signed a free trade agreement in Beijing, the first one inked between China and a Central and Eastern European country. After the deal takes effect, more than 60 percent of taxable items will become tariff-free immediately, and the final import volume proportion of both sides with zero-tariff items will reach about 95 percent.\n\n\"China is one of the most important partners for Serbia's economic development,\" said Nenad Stekic, a research fellow with the Institute of International Politics and Economics, a Serbian think tank.\n\n\"Since we elevated our relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2016, the relationship has been really going on an upward trajectory across the board,\" he added.\n\nA FRIEND IN NEED\n\nBoth the steel mill and the iron rail bear witness to the special rapport between the two nations, which has been forged with blood and lives. In the face of difficulties and challenges, the Chinese and Serbian people have always supported each other through thick and thin.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc across the world, China extended timely help to Serbia. Providing Serbia with protective equipments, medical instruments and vaccines, China also dispatched a team of medical professionals to help it better contain the pandemic.\n\nIt was already late night hours when Chinese medical team landed at Belgrade's Nikola Tesla Airport. Vucic headed a group of senior officials to greet the experts. While handshaking was not advisable during the outbreak, the Serbian leader chose to elbow-bump with every member of the Chinese team. He also kissed a Chinese national flag in a show of gratitude for China's timely support.\n\nThe Chinese people \"have proven as friends in the most difficult times when we fight for lives of Serbian people,\" Vucic said.\n\nIn the following month, Serbia awarded its most prestigious military awards to the Chinese medical team members, recognizing their invaluable contribution to the country's battle against the pandemic.\n\nWhen China was facing difficulties, Serbia also rushed to help. After a massive earthquake flattened China's Wenchuan county in 2008, Serbia offered speedy assistance to China and provided a large amount of relief supplies to the people in the affected areas.\n\n\"A friend in need is a friend indeed. That's a great sentence,\" Vucic told Xinhua.\n\nA BOND IRONCLAD\n\n\"An ironclad friend\" is how Xi describes Serbia in China's foreign relations. In Chinese diplomatic discourse, the term conveys a special meaning.\n\nSerbia is proud of its ironclad friendship with China, and China has always treated Serbia as equal, Vucic told Xi during his visit to China to attend the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in October last year.\n\nAn ironclad friendship, commented Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China, implies close relations, close communication and close cooperation on the basis of true respect for each other's core interests. All these features apply to the China-Serbia relationship.\n\nTaking a stroll through Belgrade's Kalemegdan Park, a symbol of Serbia's resilience, heritage and natural beauty, during his 2016 visit, Xi expressed his profound respect for the country and its people.\n\n\"The Serbian people, with an indomitable spirit, have revived time and again in history like the phoenix nirvana, which the Chinese people admire very much,\" said the Chinese president, who maintains that all countries, regardless of size, are equal members of the international community and should coexist peacefully and learn from each other.\n\nGuided by Xi's philosophy, China firmly supports Serbia on issues concerning its core interests and major concerns, making their ironclad friendship a good example of equal treatment and mutual benefit between countries of different sizes.\n\nThe bond between the two countries is reinforced not only through diplomacy but also through mutual respect and understanding, emphasized Aleksandar Vulin, a former Serbian minister of defense and internal affairs.\n\n\"Serbia holds profound respect for the People's Republic of China, not merely due to its size, but owing to the exemplary leadership it embodies,\" he added. \"China knows how to talk and listen. China is a partner, not a commander. China does not dictate, China advises.\" Enditem", "source": {"uri": "en.people.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "People's Daily, China"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)\n\nBELGRADE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China and Serbia have decided on Wednesday to build a community with a shared future, an upgrade of their relations from the comprehensive strategic partnership established eight years ago.\n\nThe decision was declared by visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vucic, during their meeting in the Serbian capital.\n\nXi said the ironclad China-Serbia friendship has stood the test of changing international situation, and enjoys a firm political foundation that boasts profound history, as well as solid public support with extensive common interests.\n\nIn recent years, Xi said he and Vucic have jointly led the leapfrog development of bilateral relations and made historic achievements.\n\nIn particular, since the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Serbia was established in 2016, bilateral relations have grown richer in connotation, and continuously expanded in scope, becoming a model of friendly relations between China and European countries, he said.\n\nActions speak louder than words, Xi noted. He said the Chinese side is willing to work with Serbia to continue to stand together through thick and thin, share a common future, and uphold the spirit of the two countries' ironclad friendship.\n\nChina is also ready to join Serbia to maintain and develop the amity of the two countries, jointly safeguard the fundamental and long-term interests of both sides, pursue development and rejuvenation of their own country, and jointly advance the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, he said.\n\nXi stressed that Serbia is China's first comprehensive strategic partner in Central and Eastern Europe. Cooperation between the two sides has injected strong impetus into the two countries' respective development and revitalization, delivering tangible benefits to the two peoples, he said.\n\nUnder the new circumstances, Serbia has become the first European country to build a community with a shared future with China, which fully demonstrates the strategic, special and high-level nature of the bilateral relationship, he said.\n\nThe building of the China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era is an elevation of the two countries' ironclad friendship, and it also represents the shared values and goals of both sides, namely, seeking common development, achieving win-win cooperation and pursuing common progress, which is the shared vision of both countries and nations worldwide that uphold independence and strive for peace and development, Xi said.\n\nXi said that the two sides should deepen and expand high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and the cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries by building a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, thereby advancing the modernization of their respective nation.\n\nHe called on both sides to underscore the strategic significance of the bilateral ties, and grasp the overarching direction of the relationship. China supports Serbia in upholding independence and pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions, and also supports Serbia's efforts to safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Xi said.\n\nThe two sides should continue to firmly support each other, deepen strategic cooperation, and safeguard their respective political security and fundamental interests, he added.\n\nXi also urged the two countries to adhere to the practical nature of bilateral cooperation and bring benefits to the two peoples. High-quality Belt and Road cooperation between the two countries has yielded fruitful results, Xi noted.\n\nBoth sides, Xi said, should steadily promote cooperation in traditional areas like transportation and energy infrastructure, such as ensuring the timely completion of the entire Belgrade-Budapest railway project, jointly managing major cooperation projects, and creating more \"small yet smart\" projects for public well-being, so as to continue to deliver positive economic and social benefits.\n\nThe China-Serbia Free Trade Agreement will come into effect on July 1 this year, Xi noted, saying that the high-level mutual opening-up between China and Serbia will surely enter a new stage.\n\nChina will continue to import more high-quality agricultural products with Serbian features, and is ready to invite 300 young Serbian people to China for study and exchange in the next three years, he said.\n\nSerbia is welcome to deepen cultural and people-to-people exchanges in an all-round way, he added.\n\nThe Chinese leader called on Beijing and Belgrade to carry forward the innovative nature of bilateral relations, open up new prospects for cooperation, and make innovative cooperation a new growth point of bilateral ties.\n\nIn the next three years, Xi said, China will support 50 young Serbian scientists to carry out research exchange visits to China, and is willing to strengthen cooperation with Serbia in artificial intelligence (AI) to promote the rational development and application of AI for humanity.\n\nXi called on the two countries to jointly oppose hegemonism and power politics, as well as bloc politics and camp confrontation, uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, practice genuine multilateralism, and promote international fairness and justice.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping attends a welcome ceremony held by Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic prior to their talks in Belgrade, Serbia, May 8, 2024.

It will also see him visit Hungary on May 8-9.\n\nXi's first trip to Europe in five years is seen as part of his drive to increase Beijing's influence on the continent's economic and political affairs.\n\nVucic has promoted Chinese investment and trade and diplomatic ties for his Balkan nation of around 7 million as he has sought to balance outreach to Russia and China and the bucking of Western sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine war with his country's bid for eventual EU membership.\n\nSEE ALSO: What Is Behind Serbia And China's 'Ironclad Friendship'?\n\nSpeaking from a balcony of the presidential palace, Vucic thanked Xi for visiting 'little Serbia' and said they were 'making history today even though it doesn't seem so to many.'\n\nXi called it a 'truly two-sided and honest friendship,' according to Serbian state television.\n\nLike Moscow, Beijing has supported Belgrade diplomatically in its refusal to recognize former province Kosovo's independence, while Belgrade has supported China's claims to Taiwan. 'Taiwan is China,' Vucic said on May 8, citing the UN Charter.\n\nXi's visit was seemingly timed to coincide with the 25th anniversary of NATO's bombing of the former Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999, a deadly incident that has united Beijing and Belgrade in their criticism of Western intervention in the Balkans and around the world.\n\nChina has invested some $6 billion in Serbia in the past decade, putting the money into copper mines and a steel mill as well as major highway and infrastructure projects that have been criticized by some as nontransparent and overly risky deals between governments.\n\nChinese and Serbian officials were expected to sign more than 30 agreements in areas that Vucic suggested were in many cases aimed at boosting technology and innovation in Serbia.\n\nAhead of the Chinese president's arrival, Belgrade was decorated with flags of Serbia and China, and welcome messages were set up along the route from the airport to the city center in Serbian and Chinese.\n\nXi also made Serbia a stop in 2016, when he signed a free-trade agreement with Belgrade that alarmed skeptics of Chinese economic and political intentions in Europe.\n\nWith reporting by AP\n\nCopyright (c) 2018.

Serbian Air Force sent two fighter jets to escort Xi's aircraft after it entered Serbia's airspace, Xinhua reported. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and his wife, Tamara Vucic, welcomed Xi Jinping at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. Children welcomed Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan by presenting them with flowers and waving the national flags of China and Serbia. Xi arrived in Serbia after concluding his visit to France.\n\nIn a written statement after arriving in Serbia, Xi stated, \"China and Serbia enjoy profound traditional friendship. Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xinhua reported. Xi said he looks forward to taking this visit as an opportunity to hold talks with Aleksandar Vuvic on bilateral ties and other issues of mutual interest, renewing friendship, planning for cooperation, exploring development, and creating a new blueprint for the development of bilateral relations.\n\nHe said, \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\" Xi said, \"It gives me great pleasure to pay a state visit to the Republic of Serbia at the warm invitation of President Vucic.\" He further said, \"On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I would like to extend heartfelt greetings and best wishes to the friendly government and people of Serbia,\" he added.\n\nXi noted that the ties between the two nations have witnessed leapfrog development and achieved historic results since the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership in 2016, according to Xinhua report. He said that China and Serbia have given each other firm support on issues related to their respective core interests and major concerns, He further said, \"We have jointly upheld international fairness and justice, and contributed our share to promoting world peace and development.\"\n\nBefore arriving in Serbia, Xi Jinping was on a two-day visit to France. During his visit, he held talks with his French counterpart at Elysee Palace in Paris on Monday as the two countries marked 60 years of diplomatic relations. At a press conference, the two leaders called for \"a truce\" in Ukraine and other global conflicts during the Paris Olympic Games. Xi and Macron also discussed China's ongoing support for Russia's leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nMacron welcomed Chinese \"commitments\" to \"abstain from selling any weapons\" to Russia and \"closely control the export of dual-usage equipment,\" saying that such statements were \"reassuring,\" Politico reported. Xi quoted by Xinhua, warned against \"smearing\" China over Ukraine and called on all parties to resume engagement and dialogue to build mutual trust. The Chinese President said that China and France should uphold independence and jointly prevent a \"new Cold War\" or bloc confrontation.\n\nA 10-point statement was released by the Elysee on the declaration between France and China on the situation in West Asia. This came just after Hamas officials gave their nod for a ceasefire deal for Gaza put forward by Qatari and Egyptian mediators. In the statement, Macron and Xi \"expressed their opposition to an Israeli offensive on Rafah, which would lead to a humanitarian catastrophe on a new scale\".\n\nThe two heads of state stressed that an immediate and lasting ceasefire is urgently needed to allow the large-scale delivery of humanitarian aid and the protection of civilians in the Gaza Strip and called for \"immediate and unconditional release of all hostages\" and the guarantee of humanitarian access to meet their medical and other humanitarian needs as well as respect for international law with respect to all those detained. They also reiterated their commitment to promoting a political and diplomatic settlement on the Iranian nuclear issue. The Chinese leader held three-way talks with Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

He said China will stand shoulder to shoulder with Serbia, share weal and woe like passengers in the same boat, carry forward the spirit of the ironclad friendship, maintain and grow their friendship, and jointly safeguard fundamental and long-term interests of the two countries.\n\nAs the two sides pursue their respective national development and revitalization, China will join hands with Serbia to advance the building of a community with a shared future in the new era, he added.\n\nXi stressed that Serbia is China's first comprehensive strategic partner in Central and Eastern Europe, saying that their bilateral cooperation has injected strong impetus into their respective development and rejuvenation, and brought tangible benefits to the two peoples.\n\nUnder the new circumstances, Serbia has become the first European country to build with China a community with a shared future, which speaks volumes about the strategic, special and high-level China-Serbia relations, he said.\n\nThe China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, Xi said, is an upgrade of the ironclad friendship between China and Serbia, adding that it also represents their common values and objectives, namely, joint pursuit of development, win-win cooperation and mutual success.\n\nThese are the common aspirations of China, Serbia, and all countries that are committed to independence, peace and development, he added.\n\nBy building a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, the two sides should keep deepening and expanding high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and collaboration between China and Central and Eastern European countries, thus contributing to their respective modernization, Xi said.\n\nThe Chinese leader called on the two sides to highlight the strategic nature of the bilateral relationship and keep to its general direction, saying that China supports Serbia in upholding independence and pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions, and supports its efforts in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nThe two sides, Xi said, should continue to offer each other firm support, deepen strategic cooperation, and safeguard their respective political security and fundamental interests.\n\nHe urged China and Serbia to stay committed to practical cooperation and deliver welfare for the two peoples, saying that high-quality Belt and Road cooperation between China and Serbia has achieved remarkable results.\n\nThe two sides should steadily advance cooperation in traditional areas such as transportation and energy infrastructure, make sure the entire Serbian section of the Belgrade-Budapest railway go into operation as scheduled, jointly operate well their major cooperation projects, create more small and beautiful livelihood projects, and continue to generate positive economic and social impacts, he said.\n\nWith the China-Serbia Free Trade Agreement set to take effect on July 1 this year, the high-standard mutual opening up between China and Serbia will surely enter a new stage, Xi said, adding that China will continue to import more high-quality agricultural specialties from Serbia.\n\nThe Chinese side will invite 300 young Serbians to China on study and exchange programs in the next three years, said Xi, adding that China welcomes the opening of direct flights from Belgrade to Shanghai by the Serbian side so as to comprehensively deepen people-to-people exchanges.\n\nXi also called for opening up new prospects of cooperation with a focus on the innovation dimension in bilateral relations and making innovation cooperation a new growth driver in the relationship.\n\nChina will support 50 young Serbian scientists in taking part in scientific research exchanges in China in the next three years, Xi said, adding that China is ready to work with Serbia to strengthen cooperation on artificial intelligence (AI) and endeavor to ensure humanity properly develop and utilize AI.\n\nIt is important for China and Serbia to jointly reject hegemonism and power politics, and oppose bloc politics or bloc confrontation, Xi said, adding that the two sides should join hands to uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, practice true multilateralism, and promote international fairness and justice.\n\nFor his part, Vucic extended the warmest welcome to Xi and noted that China is Serbia's most sincere friend.\n\nAlthough Serbia is a small country, China always fully respects its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and provides valuable support for its economic and social development, he said.\n\nVucic hailed Xi as a great world leader. He said that under Xi's strong leadership, China has made remarkable achievements, and it has become a beacon of development and progress of the world and is playing an increasingly important leading role in international affairs.\n\nThe Communist Party of China seeks to enhance the well-being of not only the Chinese people, but also people across the world, he said, adding that the Serbian people are full of gratitude and respect for China, especially for President Xi, and feel truly proud to be an ironclad friend to such a great nation.\n\nSerbia firmly supports China's legitimate position on issues concerning its core interests including on Taiwan, he said, adding that there is but one China in the world, and that Serbia will, without hesitation, continue to unswervingly provide China with firm support.\n\nVucic noted that China's investment in and cooperation with Serbia have greatly facilitated the latter's economic and social development and improved Serbian people's living standards, saying that since 2016, in particular, thanks to the personal commitment and support by Xi, the HBIS Smederevo steel plant has had immensely positive socioeconomic impacts.\n\nThe transformative changes in the steel plant's development prospects have also boosted the confidence and raised the hope of the people, he added.\n\nSerbia's future is closely linked with China, he said, adding that Serbia looks forward to intensifying exchanges with China in all areas and at all levels, and to strengthening cooperation with China in various fields including infrastructure, new energy, innovation, artificial intelligence and people-to-people and cultural exchanges.\n\nSerbia will actively advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with China, and work to ensure that the Serbian sector of the Belgrade-Budapest railway will be completed as planned, he said.\n\nVucic said Serbia welcomes investment cooperation from more Chinese businesses and looks forward to opening more direct flights, adding that building on the entry-into-force of the bilateral Free Trade Agreement, Serbia is ready to expand economic and trade cooperation with China.\n\nThe announcement on deepening and elevating the comprehensive strategic partnership and building a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era marks a new milestone in the history of this bilateral relationship, he noted.\n\nSerbia firmly supports and will actively participate in the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative put forth by Xi, he said, adding that his country will stay in close strategic coordination with China in multilateral fora, jointly oppose hegemonism and power politics, uphold the purposes of the UN Charter, and defend international fairness and justice.\n\nAfter the talks, the two presidents signed the Joint Statement on Deepening and Elevating the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and Building a China-Serbia Community with a Shared Future in the New Era.

On the night of May 7, exactly 25 years ago, NATO bombed the Chinese embassy, killing three Chinese journalists, including one from Xinhua.\n\n\"The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself,\" Xi wrote in the article. \"The China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides.\"\n\nGordana, a local resident who didn't reveal her full name, referred to the bombing as a \"painful memory\" to her. \"The cooperation between China and Serbia holds the promise of providing my children with a better life than I experienced,\" she told Xinhua.\n\nPrecious moments of goodwill and friendship are a signature of Xi's short but significant stay in Serbia, which lasts no more than 24 hours.\n\nA telling moment was the grand welcoming ceremony held by Vucic on Wednesday morning with the impressive attendance of more than 10,000 Serbian people.\n\nCrowds were waving the national flags of both countries and chanting \"China! Serbia!\" with applause and cheers pervading the atmosphere.\n\n\"We are here to show our friendship with China, and we want our Chinese friends know that we cherish it very much,\" said Milos Tosic, a college professor present at the event. Tosic told Xinhua that it is not only his opinion, but one shared \"by all the people here today.\"\n\nAt a welcoming banquet around noon, Xi shared his nostalgic memory with Vucic, reminiscing about the Yugoslav film \"The Bridge\" and the song \"Bella Ciao,\" which have become the fondest memories in his youthful days.\n\n\"China will work together with the friendly people of Serbia and make tireless efforts to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era,\" Xi pledged in his concluding remarks at the banquet toast.\n\nFUTURE-ORIENTED PARTNERSHIP\n\nDuring the meeting with Vucic, Xi said the China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era is an upgrade of the ironclad friendship between China and Serbia, and it also represents their common values and objectives, namely, joint pursuit of development, win-win cooperation and mutual success.\n\nIn support of the building of the China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, Xi has announced six measures when he met the press together with Vucic. Notable among the measures are a free trade agreement between China and Serbia which will take effect on July 1 and an exchange program under which Serbian youths and young Serbian scientists are invited to visit China in the next three years.\n\n\"The sky is the limit,\" said Vucic, referring to the scope of cooperation with China.\n\n\"For Serbia, it obviously brings a great deal,\" said Aleksandar Pavic, a Serbian political expert. \"The opening of the Chinese market with the Free Trade Agreement, academic exchanges ... those are very, very important.\"\n\n\"China offers a hand of cooperation on an equal footing, and offers great opportunities without conditions,\" Pavic said. \"We've grown weary of the zero-sum game for far too long.\"\n\nThe substantial deals added new testimony to the special bond of ironclad friendship enjoyed by China and Serbia.\n\nPast years have seen leapfrog growth of China-Serbia cooperation. Two-way trade in 2023 surged to 4.35 billion U.S. dollars, Chinese customs statistics showed. In 2022, China became the largest source of direct investment for Serbia. After the bilateral free trade deal takes effect, more than 60 percent of taxable items will become tariff-free immediately, and the final import volume proportion of both sides with zero-tariff items will reach about 95 percent.\n\nUnder the framework of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative are flagship projects such as the Smederevo Steelworks and the high-speed railway between Belgrade and Budapest. An integral segment of the Belgrade-Budapest railway is the high-speed train linking Belgrade and Serbia's second-largest city Novi Sad, which has transported some 6.83 million passengers over the past two years.\n\nSerbia has long been known as \"the gateway to the Balkans\" on the European continent. \"Everything that has been done so far and will be done in the future can serve as an example to other countries in the region and throughout Europe to get involved as much as possible,\" said Aleksandar Mitic, a research fellow also with the institute.\n\n\"The principle of mutual benefit can really work,\" said Mitic.\n\nSerbia, undoubtedly, stands as a reliable partner for China in Europe, said Aleksandar Vojvodic, head engineer of the Clean Serbia Project of China Road and Bridge Corporation.", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_partnership", "type":

der Leyen urging Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi for his part warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go to Hungary, where China has invested heavily in vast

Xi completed a two-day trip to France, where he held talks with President Emmanuel Macron as the European Union takes a tougher stance on trade with China.\n\nBut in Serbia, Xi will aim to bolster economic and political ties with a country that's thrown open its arms to Chinese trade and investment. The president will finish up his five-day trip with a stop in Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban stands nearly alone among EU leaders in drawing closer to China.\n\nXi's visit also coincides with the 25th anniversary of the deadly US bombing of the Chinese embassy during the 1999 NATO operation aimed at pushing Yugoslav troops out of Kosovo. That event, which the White House later called a mistake and blamed on faulty maps, triggered widespread protests in China and cemented a more tense relationship with Washington.\n\nHe vowed to \"never forget\" the bombing in a Tuesday article published in Politika, Serbia's oldest daily newspaper. \"Twenty-five years ago today, NATO flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese journalists,\" Xi said.\n\nChinese and Serbian flags fluttered along the highway leading to the city center, ahead of the meetings on Wednesday, when the two sides are expected to sign as many as 30 agreements, the government in Belgrade said without elaborating.\n\nMeeting with Vucic, Xi's trip will highlight projects such as the new high-speed railway linking Belgrade to Budapest. Direct Chinese investment in Hungary and Serbia exceeds $15 billion with more coming, ranging from car battery plants in Hungary to copper mining in Serbia.\n\n\"We are completely open to Chinese investment,\" Serbia's Deputy Premier Sinisa Mali told state broadcaster RTS shortly before Xi's arrival. \"China is one of the two biggest powers in the world and Xi is the most important statesman coming to Serbia in the last several years.\"\n\nRead More: China's Billions Help Xi Make Useful Friends in Eastern Europe\n\nXi on Monday also met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who told him that the EU is prepared to deploy all tools available to defend its economies if China fails to offer fair access to its markets.

She said she hoped there would be \"results from this visit, something good for both parties\".\n\nThe first leg of Xi's visit in France saw meetings with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen urging Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi for his part warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go to Hungary, where China has invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing plants.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xinhua reported.\n\nXi said he looks forward to taking this visit as an opportunity to hold talks with Aleksandar Vuvic on bilateral ties and other issues of mutual interest, renewing friendship, planning for cooperation, exploring development, and creating a new blueprint for the development of bilateral relations.\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Ukrainian Secret Service Uncovers 'Russian Plots' Against Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHe said, \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\" Xi said, \"It gives me great pleasure to pay a state visit to the Republic of Serbia at the warm invitation of President Vucic.\"\n\nHe further said, \"On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I would like to extend heartfelt greetings and best wishes to the friendly government and people of Serbia,\" he added.\n\nXi noted that the ties between the two nations have witnessed leapfrog development and achieved historic results since the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership in 2016, according to Xinhua report.\n\nHe said that China and Serbia have given each other firm support on issues related to their respective core interests and major concerns, He further said, \"We have jointly upheld international fairness and justice, and contributed our share to promoting world peace and development.\"\n\nBefore arriving in Serbia, Xi Jinping was on a two-day visit to France. During his visit, he held talks with his French counterpart at Elysee Palace in Paris on Monday as the two countries marked 60 years of diplomatic relations.\n\nAt a press conference, the two leaders called for \"a truce\" in Ukraine and other global conflicts during the Paris Olympic Games. Xi and Macron also discussed China's ongoing support for Russia's leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nMacron welcomed Chinese \"commitments\" to \"abstain from selling any weapons\" to Russia and \"closely control the export of dual-usage equipment,\" saying that such statements were \"reassuring,\" Politico reported.\n\nXi quoted by Xinhua, warned against \"smearing\" China over Ukraine and called on all parties to resume engagement and dialogue to build mutual trust. The Chinese President said that China and France should uphold independence and jointly prevent a \"new Cold War\" or bloc confrontation.\n\nA 10-point statement was released by the Elysee on the declaration between France and China on the situation in West Asia. This came just after Hamas officials gave their nod for a ceasefire deal for Gaza put forward by Qatari and Egyptian mediators.\n\nIn the statement, Macron and Xi \"expressed their opposition to an Israeli offensive on Rafah, which would lead to a humanitarian catastrophe on a new scale\".\n\nThe two heads of state stressed that an immediate and lasting ceasefire is urgently needed to allow the large-scale delivery of humanitarian aid and the protection of civilians in the Gaza Strip and called for \"immediate and unconditional release of all hostages\" and the guarantee of humanitarian access to meet their medical and other humanitarian needs as well as respect for international law with respect to all those detained.\n\nThey also reiterated their commitment to promoting a political and diplomatic settlement on the Iranian nuclear issue. The Chinese leader held three-way talks with Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Serbia's Western partners view the country as a Chinese hub at the gateway to the EU.\n\nIn 2023, China was Serbia's second-largest trading partner after the EU with a total trade exchange of $6.1 billion and among its top five investors, according to the national investment agency.\n\n(Writing by Daria Sito-Sucic; Editing by Daniel Wallis)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albanians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slobodan_Milo\u0161evi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yugoslavia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politika", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_von_der_Leyen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ursula von der Leyen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belt and Road Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1999-05-07", "textStart": 219, "textEnd": 230}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

But China's position on Russia's war in Ukraine will also take center stage.\n\nChina has sought to carve out a larger diplomatic role around the Ukraine war, although EU officials have expressed doubts about the role Beijing can play in any future peace process given its close ties to Russia.\n\nSerbia and Hungary have both pushed back on sanctions against Russia and have stood against weapons deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nThe date chosen for Xi's visit to Serbia is symbolic, as it marks the 25th anniversary of the destruction of the Chinese Embassy building during the 1999 NATO bombing campaign.\n\nA large Chinese cultural center has been built at the former site of the embassy, and Xi is expected to visit a memorial there in honor of Chinese diplomats killed during the accidental strike.\n\nXi and Vucic are expected to discuss a wide range of topics, from political, economic, and technological issues to cooperation in the field of culture.\n\nThe Chinese president is coming to Belgrade six months after Vucic visited Beijing, during which Serbia and Chinese officials signed a free-trade agreement in the presence of the two leaders at the international \"Belt and Road\" forum.\n\nThe free-trade agreement between Serbia and China is set to enter into force in July, although it has been under scrutiny in Brussels.\n\nAhead of Xi's visit, Vucic said Serbia will accelerate projects in several spheres, including \"robotics, satellite technology, flying cars, among many other things.\"\n\nXi previously traveled to Serbia in June 2016, which marked the first visit of a Chinese president to Belgrade in 30 years.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She said she hoped there would be \"results from this visit, something good for both parties\".\n\nThe first leg of Xi's visit in France saw meetings with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen urging Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi for his part warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go to Hungary, where China has invested heavily in vast

They were further galvanized in 2016 by the first visit to Belgrade by a Chinese leader in three decades and joint resistance to Western-led responses to the COVID-19 pandemic that erupted in 2020.\n\n\"China sees in Hungary and Serbia the two most important partners in Europe, a kind of door that opens up space to a wider European market and to some strategic investments,\" said Vedran Dzihic, a senior lecturer at the University of Vienna and senior researcher at the Austrian Institute for International Affairs.\n\nMuch of China's cooperation with Serbia revolves around infrastructure, a focus of the massive Belt And Road Initiative that was adopted in 2013 as a linchpin of Xi's diplomatic and economic outreach around the world.\n\nSEE ALSO: Xi Heads To Europe Looking For A Larger Chinese Role In Ukraine\n\nDzihic said Beijing is seeking any path to the European market and to increase its influence on the continent.\n\nVucic has stressed the visit's potential to boost technological development in areas such as robotics and satellites. Ahead of Xi's trip, the Serbian president called it \"a way to keep pace with the world and further develop our best relations.\"\n\nThe Serbian government also announced recently it had adopted measures to improve cooperation with China in areas such as science, education, and innovation, as well as economic and technical cooperation in infrastructure.\n\nBut aside from any trade and economic benefits, Dzihic said, there is a political message underlying Serbia's hosting of Xi that is connected to broader efforts -- notably by Moscow and Beijing -- to challenge U.S. influence and potentially reshape the international order.\n\n\"[The message is] that Serbia is striving to work on deepening relations with actors outside the West and, in that sense, is a kind of autonomous player in the new geopolitical constellation,\" Dzihic said.\n\nAnniversary Of NATO Bombing\n\nXi's arrival on May 7 coincides with the 25th anniversary of NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in the Serbian capital, an event that united Belgrade and Beijing in outrage at Western policies and intervention during the Balkan wars of the 1990s.\n\nThe 1999 NATO air strikes, which targeted military and civilian infrastructure in Slobodan Milosevic's Yugoslavia, were the Western military alliance's response to the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and reports of atrocities by Serbian forces against the ethnic Albanian population.\n\nUniversity of Vienna lecturer Dzihic noted that the NATO bombardment is an ongoing source of anti-Western sentiment that perpetuates the idea of a \"conflict\" pitting the West against Russia, China, and other countries. He said it is a narrative \"in which Serbia, that is, the Serbian president, first tries to navigate between these two poles, and then relies on partners from the East once there is significant pressure from the West.\"\n\nDzihic said he believed the West had become \"much, much more critical of Vucic's regime than it was a few years ago.\"\n\nPresident Xi Jinping (left) with then-Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic at a groundbreaking ceremony for a Chinese cultural center in 2016, during the first visit by a Chinese leader to Belgrade in three decades.\n\nDuring his previous state visit to Serbia, in 2016, Xi laid a wreath at the monument in Belgrade to the three people killed and at least 20 others injured in the 1999 bombing of the Chinese Embassy, an incident for which Washington apologized. (A Chinese cultural center, which is among the largest in Europe, has since arisen at the site.)\n\nOn that same visit, Xi signed a Declaration on Strategic Partnership with Vucic's presidential predecessor and fellow SNS member, Tomislav Nikolic. In 2023, with Vucic unquestionably steering foreign policy, the two sides signed a free-trade agreement that critics feared created a new path for Chinese military exports to Europe. There were also fears the agreement would \"lock\" Serbia into a closer long-term relationship with Beijing and \"further distance\" the country from its European neighbors.\n\nMore than $5 billion in Chinese investments has flowed into Serbia in the past decade, according to Serbian Trade Minister Tomislav Momirovic.\n\nSEE ALSO: China In Eurasia Briefing: Previewing Xi's Big Europe Trip\n\nMany of those deals have been dogged by controversy. In some cases, local protests have targeted Chinese investors' hiring practices or environmental standards. Critics have also questioned the financing of infrastructure projects through Chinese loans agreed between the two governments without competitive bidding and whose terms remain undisclosed. The Export-Import Bank of China is now among Serbia's largest creditors.\n\nBut in one of the most recent polls to track Serbians' views of China, two-thirds of respondents said they welcomed Chinese investment, with young people more likely to respond positively. The same survey, published in October 2023 by a Belgrade-based nonprofit, the Institute for European Affairs, said three-quarters of Serbians regard China as a friendly country.\n\nVucic boasted during a visit to China last year that he was proud Serbia was \"the only country in Europe that had never joined declarations criticizing or attacking China on any issue.\"\n\nVuksanovic, the researcher at the Belgrade Center for Security Policy, described Serbia's key challenge as maintaining some sort of proportionality in its relations with China and the United States. He said Belgrade appeared to have found a formula whereby Washington is its dominant partner in the areas of security and, potentially, relations with its former province Kosovo, which declared independence over Serbian objections in 2008.\n\n\"They think they can maintain a balance with China as long as it is reduced exclusively to economic cooperation and high-level diplomatic exchange,\" Vuksanovic said, and \"as long as there are no deeper provocative moves toward Washington.\"\n\nWritten by Andy Heil based on reporting by RFE/RL Balkan Service correspondent Ljudmila Cvetkovic in Belgrade\n\nCopyright (c) 2018.

She said she hoped there would be \"results from this visit, something good for both parties\".\n\nThe first leg of Xi's visit in France saw meetings with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen urging Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi for his part warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go to Hungary, where China has invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing plants.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This was his first visit since 2019 when he visited the same three politically affable countries.\n\nCrowds of Serbian citizens and Chinese foreign workers turned out to greet Xi in the Belgrade city centre - a scene reminiscent of the days of Communist Yugoslavia, when comrades would visit Tito.\n\nChina's bilateral ties to Serbia stretch back to 1955, but in the years of the Cold War, Albania, rather than Yugoslavia, was China's best friend in Europe.\n\nToday, China is regarded as one of the key pillars for Serbia's foreign policy, alongside pursuit of European Union membership and friendly relations with the United States and Russia. These seemingly contradictory themes in Serbia's foreign policy can create tensions, which often come to the fore in the United Nations - including on the Kosovo question, which Serbia sees as a domestic political issue. China has backed Serbia's position on Kosovo, while Serbia has been a staunch supporter of the \"One China\" policy in multilateral settings. This mutual assistance in global forums has been a catalyst for Serbia and China to strengthen their relations in other areas.\n\nIn less than a decade, China has become Serbia's second largest foreign trade partner. The three largest exporting companies from Serbia are Chinese. China has heavily invested in Serbia's mining sector (Anglo-Australian Rio Tinto had exploration licenses revoked several years ago), with Serbia's top exports to China including ores and ash, copper, wood, electronic equipment and machinery, and boilers. A new agreement will potentially allow China's defence companies to export arms to Serbia, which will in turn become China's springboard to Eurasia and Africa for defence exports.\n\nXi and his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic have overseen more than two dozen bilateral agreements and Memoranda of Understanding between the two countries - covering economic relations, extradition agreements, tariff reductions, cultural relations and the media. Serbia's oldest newspaper Politika signed an agreement with the Chinese state media, while the national broadcaster Radio Television Serbia pledges to deepen its engagement with its Chinese counterparts. This will potentially open more space for Chinese soft power in Southeast Europe.\n\nProbably the most unexpected change of language for both Presidents from this latest meeting was a move from \"enhanced strategic relations\" to community relations. According to both delegations, building a \"community with a shared future\" means the highest level of engagement with China.\n\nChina offered 300 places for Serbian exchange students over the next three years, which the Serbian side described as a future bridge between the two countries and a long-term investment. In addition, there are 50 places for Serbian researchers to work in Chinese institutes. More direct flights between the two countries will likely foster the arrival of more Chinese tourists to Europe via Belgrade.\n\nA free trade agreement signed between Serbia and China was the first FTA by China signed with a Central and East European country, said to reduce or abolish customs duties on thousands of products, including lithium batteries, solar panels, and cars and machinery, as well as some agricultural and marine products. Vucic personally offered to serve exclusive Serbian wines to Xi during their official luncheon, highlighting how much emphasis Serbia is currently placing on its relations with China.\n\nOne of the key announcements during Xi's visit to Serbia was that the local leg of the Belgrade-Budapest railway is due to be completed by the end of the year, with the Hungarian part to be completed by 2026. The Belt and Road Initiative, while losing traction in the Baltics and Italy, is alive and well in the Balkans.", "source": {"uri": "lowyinstitute.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lowy Institute

Xi portrayed more trade with China as the inevitable direction, even as the European Union unleashes a salvo of trade probes into Beijing's booming green sectors.\n\nChina's cooperation with Central and Eastern European countries is a \"sign of the times and the general trend of development,\" Xi wrote in the Hungarian ruling party's newspaper, Magyar Nemzet. The eastern side of the European region provides a \"helpful addition to China-Europe relations,\" he added.\n\nThe Chinese leader's comments come as tensions between Beijing and Brussels soar, with Western European leaders calling on Xi's government stop flooding their markets with cheap exports that threaten jobs. Xi's support for Russia despite its war in Ukraine has thrown the relationship further off balance.\n\nAfter Xi landed in Belgrade on Tuesday night he was greeted by Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who has been a vocal supporter of Beijing. Xi earlier completed a two-day trip to France, where he held talks with President Emmanuel Macron as the EU takes a tougher stance on China's perceived national security risks.\n\n\"We are completely open to Chinese investment,\" Serbian Deputy Premier Sinisa Mali told state broadcaster RTS shortly before Xi's arrival. \"China is one of the two biggest powers in the world, and Xi is the most important statesman coming to Serbia in the last several years.\"\n\nIn Serbia, Xi will aim to bolster economic and political ties with a country that's thrown open its arms to Chinese trade and investment. He will finish up his five-day trip with a stop in Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban stands nearly alone among EU leaders in drawing closer to China.\n\nXi said in a statement after landing in Belgrade that China-Serbia cooperation \"serves the fundamental and long-term interests of both countries.\" He added that he looked forward to speaking with Vucic about relations between their nations \"and other issues of mutual interest.\"\n\nHis visit coincides with the 25th anniversary of the deadly US bombing of the Chinese embassy during the 1999 NATO operation aimed at pushing Yugoslav troops out of Kosovo. That event, which the White House later called a mistake and blamed on faulty maps, triggered widespread protests in China.\n\nXi vowed to \"never forget\" the bombing in an article published Tuesday in Politika, Serbia's oldest daily newspaper. \"Twenty-five years ago today, NATO flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese journalists,\" Xi said.\n\nChinese and Serbian flags fluttered along the highway leading to the city center ahead of the meetings on Wednesday, when the two sides are expected to sign as many as 30 agreements, the government in Belgrade said without elaborating.\n\nXi's trip will highlight projects such as the new high-speed railway linking Belgrade to Budapest. Direct Chinese investment in Hungary and Serbia exceeds $15 billion with more coming, ranging from car battery plants in Hungary to copper mining in Serbia.\n\nXi on Monday also met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who told him that the EU is prepared to deploy all tools available to defend its economies if China fails to offer fair access to its markets. She drove home the EU's position that heavily subsidized Chinese products such as electric vehicles and steel are flooding Europe.\n\n--With assistance from Jing Li, Philip Glamann, Zoltan Simon,

The six detainees and two family members who were picked up at the same time, despite having no links to Falun Gong, were all released without charges soon after Xi left Serbia on Wednesday evening, Markovic said.\n\nA police arrest warrant said Markovic's father was suspected of \"endangering persons under international protection.\"\n\nMarkovic said her father had no plans to protest the Chinese leader's visit and had been picked up because \"our government wants to please the Chinese in every way possible\" and was \"acting like the CCP,\" a reference to the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nChina routinely demands that foreign governments hosting a visit by Xi remove protesters and even posters connected to Falun Gong or affiliated organizations such as the Shen Yun dance troupe. Most European governments refuse, but Serbia has gone out of its way to show what Vucic on Wednesday described as \"its reverence and love\" for the Chinese leader.\n\nChina is Serbia's largest foreign investor, and increasingly close economic relations have helped expand a relationship forged before the collapse of Yugoslavia, whose capital was Belgrade, in the early 1990s, through a shared wariness of Western and Soviet power.\n\nThe 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing has come at a time when Xi's government is trying to steady relations with the United States and Western Europe. He had been expected to visit the bombed embassy site, which he visited on his last trip to Serbia in 2016 and is usually a mandatory stop for Chinese officials visiting Belgrade. But he had not appeared there before he left Belgrade Wednesday evening for his next stop, the Hungarian capital of Budapest, Europe's only other reliably China-friendly capital.\n\nHis decision to skip the former embassy site, now a Chinese cultural center that features a black, tombstone-like marble tablet mourning Chinese and Serbian \"martyrs,\" suggested a desire to avoid rekindling anti-American passions that at the time of the bombing in 1999 led to angry protests by tens of thousands of Chinese around the US Embassy in Beijing, some throwing bottles and rocks.\n\nHe did not ignore the bombing entirely but avoided anti-Western bombast.\n\n\"This we should never forget,\" Xi said in a statement published Tuesday by Politika, a Serbian newspaper, recalling that \"25 years ago today, NATO flagrantly bombed the Chinese Embassy.\" He said China's friendship with Serbia had been \"forged with the blood of our compatriots\" and \"will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples.\"\n\nBeijing's underlying suspicions about Western intentions, and the role of NATO, persist -- a point that surfaced in Chinese official and media comments about the anniversary. But Xi refrained from the aggrieved outrage voiced in Beijing by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.\n\n\"The Chinese people will never forget this barbaric atrocity committed by NATO and will never accept such tragic history repeating itself,\" Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the ministry, told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\nSerbia, which still harbors deep grievance over the defeat of Christian Serbs by Ottoman Turks in a battle in 1389, shares with China a view of itself as a righteous force wronged by hostile outsiders.\n\nSerbia and China are also bound by mutual support for each other's territorial claims -- China's to the breakaway island of Taiwan and Serbia's to Kosovo, formerly Serbian land declared an independent state after the NATO bombing campaign.\n\n\"Just as we have clear positions on the issue of Chinese integrity -- that Taiwan is China -- so they support the territory of Serbia without any reservation,\" Vucic, who was Serbia's information minister under President Slobodan Milosevic during the Kosovo war, said Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The two East European countries on his tour have both emerged as important allies of China in the region, and have benefited from inflows of Chinese investment.\n\nXi referred to the embassy bombing in an opinion piece published in the daily Politika on May 7, writing of the importance of peace as well as China's resolve to prevent such tragedies from recurring.\n\nThe bombing, during a campaign against Yugoslavia, resulted in the deaths of three Chinese journalists and injuries to twenty Chinese nationals. Then-US president Bill Clinton issued an apology in the aftermath of the incident, which sparked outrage in China.\n\nIn the comment piece, Xi also highlighted the enduring friendship between China and Serbia, forged through shared experiences and joint efforts.\n\n\"The friendship between China and Serbia which is soaked in blood that the two peoples spilled together has become a joint memory of the two peoples and will encourage both parties to make together huge steps forward,\" he wrote.\n\nBelgrade has been prepared to receive Xi with streets adorned with Chinese flags and placards, while thousands of police officers have been deployed to ensure security for the visiting delegation.\n\nAhead of Xi's arrival, several members of the Chinese delegation, including ministers and institutional representatives, have already arrived in Belgrade. Minister of Finance Sinisa Mali and Minister of Trade Tomislav Momirovic, greeted the Chinese delegation at Nikola Tesla airport.\n\nDuring his stay in Serbia, Xi is expected to engage in talks on China's investments in the country and potential new agreements with his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic.\n\nThe relationship between China and Serbia has seen several advances in recent years. In 2016, the two countries signed a strategic partnership, and last year witnessed the signing of 18 agreements during Vucic's visit to Beijing. These agreements included a free trade deal set to become operational in July, reflecting the deepening economic ties between the two nations.\n\nXi said he expected discussions with Serbian leaders to further strengthen bilateral cooperation.\n\nSerbia's alignment with China's Belt and Road Initiative has cemented its position as a key partner for China in Europe. Chinese investments in Serbia have contributed significantly to infrastructure development, with projects spanning mines, factories, roads and bridges.\n\nChina is currently Serbia's second most important economic partner following the EU. China was also the top foreign investor in Serbia in 2023, accounting for \u20ac1.37bn of the total \u20ac4.5bn.\n\nChinese companies have played an important role in Serbia's industrial sector, and are among the country's top exporters. Specifically, Serbia's top exporters were dominated by three Chinese-owned companies in 2023: Zijin Mining, Zijin Copper and the HBIS Group.\n\nOther recent collaborations include the establishment of yuan clearing arrangements and the inauguration of a new freight route linking China's Hebei province with Belgrade.\n\nXi's visit coincides with the installation of Serbia's new government, led by former defence minister Milos Vucevic.", "source": {"uri": "intellinews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Intellinews                        "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mali"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mali"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politika", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yugoslavia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Tesla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belt and Road Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zijin_Mining", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zijin Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renminbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebei", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hebei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hebei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/img_235600_Cropped.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 175, "textEnd": 180, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Based on ancient Chinese landscape paintings, the exterior walls of the building present the perfect combination of the art of painting and modern architecture. The road where the edifice is located is called \"Confucius Boulevard,\" while the square where the edifice is located is called \"China- Serbia Friendship Square.\" This edifice is the China Cultural Center in Belgrade.\n\nThe China Cultural Center in Belgrade. (Photo: Wang Wei)\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to the Republic of Serbia on June 17, 2016. During the visit, President Xi and the leaders of Serbia attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the China Cultural Center together. The two heads of state laid the foundation and exchanged sincere messages.\n\nThe building, which is like a beautiful ancient Chinese landscape painting drawn on the bank of the Danube River, is not only an important bridge and bond for cultural exchanges between the two countries, but also a witness to the ironclad friendship between China and Serbia during the development of the times.\n\nChina and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia formally established diplomatic relations in the early 1950s, ushering in a new page of friendship and cooperation between people in China and Serbia. For decades, the profound friendship and special bond between our peoples have withstood the passage of time and the long distance and become even stronger.\n\nCultural exchanges are an important part of China-Serbia relations and an inexhaustible driving force for the deepening development of bilateral relations.\n\nAt one time, famous films such as Walter defends Sarajevo, Most and so on inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of countless Chinese people, and the song of \"Bella ciao\" is still prevalent in China now.\n\nAt present, \"Chinese fever\" continues to heat up in Serbia. Many universities have set up Chinese departments, a Chinese popularization project was officially launched in 2012 in primary and secondary schools nationwide, and more and more Serbs have joined Confucius Institutes and Chinese teaching centers.\n\nA variety of cultural courses are being taught at the China Cultural Center in Belgrade, such as Tai Chi, calligraphy, Chinese language, guzheng (Chinese zither). These activities enable Serbian people to have an immersive experience of Chinese culture.\n\nTai Chi class at the China Cultural Center in Belgrade. (Photo: Shen Xiaoxiao/ People's Daily\uff09\n\nDubonjac Jovana, a 29-year-old girl who was born and raised in Serbia, is studying for a PhD in Chinese culture. She is also a volunteer teaching Chinese at the China Cultural Center in Belgrade. Learning Chinese not only creates more opportunities for her, but also provides many Serbs a window to take a look at the world, she said. \"Although China and Serbia are far away, the long history of China and Chinese culture is very attractive to many Serbs.\"\n\nIn recent years, the cooperation between China and Serbia in culture and tourism, and economy and trade has yielded fruitful results, while people between the two countries have become closer. In 2017, a mutual visa-free agreement between the two countries came into effect. In 2019, China became the country with the largest number of tourists to Serbia. Since China and Serbia signed an agreement recognizing the validity of driving licenses issued by each other and opened direct flights, personnel exchanges between the two countries have continued to increase. In 2023, China and Serbia signed a free trade agreement, injecting new momentum into bilateral relations.\n\nSerbia is China's first comprehensive strategic partner in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and the two countries have nurtured an ironclad friendship. President Xi Jinping has remarked on bilateral relations many times on different occasions, \"China and Serbia are 'ironclad friends' having stood together through thick and thin,\" \"The two countries enjoy high-level political mutual trust, and bilateral relations have withstood tests and become even stronger, setting a model for international relations,\" \"The ironclad China-Serbia friendship is most valuable and deserves to be firmly upheld and carried forward from generation to generation.\"\n\nIn May 2008, after an earthquake hit Wenchuan, China's Sichuan Province, Serbia mobilized a batch of tents from its military reserves to aid China's disaster areas and printed \"To the People of China\" on the outer package.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic greeted the Chinese medical expert team that arrived in Serbia to assist in combating the outbreak, kissing the Chinese flag to express his gratitude for the country's timely support. This scene deeply moved many Chinese people.\n\n\"Serbia is proud of its ironclad friendship with China.\" When meeting with President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing last October, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said that China has always respected and treated Serbia equally, and provided appreciated support to the country in times of difficulties. China's assistance and cooperation have helped Serbia maintain sound economic development and brought huge benefits to the Serbian people.\n\nYesterday's seeds, today's harvest. Under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, China and Serbia have forged a stronger bond. Cooperation projects between the two countries like the Hungary-Serbia railway, the Pupin Bridge on the Danube river in Belgrade, the E-763 highway, the Kostolac Power Plant, and HBIS Smederevo Steel Plant, have not only transformed the bilateral traditional friendship into practical cooperation results, but also brought more benefits to the two peoples.\n\n\"China attaches great importance to its relations with Serbia and values the profound tradition of China-Serbia friendship. China is ready to tap the potential of win-win cooperation by utilizing our complementarity so as to achieve steady and sustained growth of our relations,\" Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a signed article in the leading Serbian newspaper Politika under the title of \"Enduring Friendship and True Partnership\" in June, 2016.\n\nA Serbian proverb goes, \"Prijatelj je plod vremena\" (friends are the fruits of time). With the joint efforts of the two countries, the seeds of friendship are being planted one after another, yielding fruitful fruits for China-Serbia friendship.", "source": {"uri": "en.people.cn",

Countries like Laos, Pakistan and Thailand have also endorsed a high-level engagement of the kind with China.\n\n\"With this agreement, Serbia is leading the way in its relations with China,\" said Ivona Ladjevac, deputy director at the Institute for International Politics and Economics in Belgrade.\n\nAleksandar Mitic, a research fellow also with the institute said this improvement of strategic cooperation should be viewed very positively. \"It is not directed against anyone.\"\n\nSerbia has long been known as \"the gateway to the Balkans\" on the European continent. \"Everything that has been done so far and will be done in the future can serve as an example to other countries in the region and throughout Europe to get involved as much as possible,\" said Mitic. \"The principle of mutual benefit can really work.\"\n\nIn support of the building of the China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, Xi has announced six measures when he met the press together with Vucic. Notable among the measures are a free trade agreement between China and Serbia which will take effect on July 1 and an exchange program under which Serbian youths and young Serbian scientists are invited to visit China in the next three years.\n\n\"The sky is the limit,\" said Vucic, referring to the scope of cooperation with China.\n\n\"For Serbia, it obviously brings a great deal,\" said Aleksandar Pavic, a Serbian political expert. \"The opening of the Chinese market with the Free Trade Agreement, academic exchanges ... those are very, very important.\"\n\n\"China offers a hand of cooperation on an equal footing, and offers great opportunities without conditions,\" Pavic said. \"We've grown weary of the zero-sum game for far too long.\"\n\nThe substantial deals added new testimony to the special bond of ironclad friendship enjoyed by China and Serbia.\n\nPrecious moments of goodwill and friendship are a signature of Xi's short but significant stay in Serbia, which lasts no more than 24 hours.\n\nA telling moment was the grand welcoming ceremony held by Vucic on Wednesday morning with the impressive attendance of more than 10,000 Serbian people.\n\nCrowds were waving the national flags of both countries and chanting \"China! Serbia!\" with applause and cheers pervading the atmosphere.\n\n\"We are here to show our friendship with China, and we want our Chinese friends know that we cherish it very much,\" said Milos Tosic, a college professor present at the event. Tosic told Xinhua that it is not only his opinion, but one shared \"by all the people here today.\"\n\nAt a welcoming banquet around noon, Xi shared his nostalgic memory with Vucic, reminiscing about the Yugoslav film \"The Bridge\" and the song \"Bella Ciao,\" which have become the fondest memories in his youthful days.\n\n\"China will work together with the friendly people of Serbia and make tireless efforts to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era,\" Xi pledged in his concluding remarks at the banquet toast, opening up a vista for the two countries. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade_Nikola_Tesla_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_partnership", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strategic partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_visit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State visit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laos"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Laos"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free trade agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balkans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_flag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National flag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yugoslavia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 15}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1787, "textEnd": 1793}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Xi hailed the visit, which marks the second leg of his European tour, as the beginning of a \"new chapter\" in bilateral relations during his meeting with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe two countries pledged to deepen and enhance their comprehensive strategic partnership, announcing their intention to \"build a community with a shared future.\"\n\nThe two countries also signed 29 agreements to promote legal, regulatory and economic cooperation. Notably, Serbia is set to become the first European country in years to enter into a free trade agreement with China, with the deal signed last year expected to take effect on July 1.\n\n\"Eight years ago, Serbia became China's first comprehensive strategic partner in the Central and Eastern European region, and today Serbia is the first European country to build a community of destiny with China, fully reflecting the strategic, special and high level of China-Serbia relations,\" Xi said during a press conference after signing the agreement.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the EU would respond to Serbia getting even closer to China. Russia's war on Ukraine has pushed the integration of six Western Balkan countries, including Serbia, into the EU at the top of the 27-nation bloc's agenda.\n\nChina has claimed neutrality in the Ukraine conflict, but has refused to call the Russian assault an invasion and has been accused of bolstering Russia's military capacity. Serbia has condemned the Russian invasion but has refused to join international sanctions against Moscow.\n\nXi arrived in Serbia to a warm welcome on Tuesday evening from France, where he had a high-stakes state visit dominated by trade disputes and Russia's war in Ukraine. Thousands of people, chanting \"China-Serbia\" and waving flags, were transported from across Serbia to attend a welcoming ceremony for Xi in front of the Serbia Palace on Wednesday, held in the new part of Belgrade where the talks took place.\n\nPro-China sentiments were evident throughout the Serbian capital, with a large Chinese flag displayed on a skyscraper along the roadway from the airport into the city. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags adorned downtown and highway areas.\n\nChina has made significant investments in Serbia, pouring billions of dollars into sectors like mining and infrastructure through investments and loans. The two countries established a strategic partnership in 2016 and signed a free trade agreement last year. However, some agreements, including the free trade pact, do not align with EU membership conditions. Despite formally expressing a desire to join the 27-nation bloc, Serbia has been veering away from that path.\n\nSituated in the heart of the Balkans, Serbia holds strategic importance in China's Belt and Road initiative aimed at enhancing Beijing's influence in Europe through economic investments.

The president will finish up his five-day trip with a stop in Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban stands nearly alone among EU leaders in drawing closer to China.\n\nXi's visit also coincides with the 25th anniversary of the deadly US bombing of the Chinese embassy during the 1999 NATO operation aimed at pushing Yugoslav troops out of Kosovo. That event, which the White House later called a mistake and blamed on faulty maps, triggered widespread protests in China and cemented a more tense relationship with Washington.\n\nHe vowed to \"never forget\" the bombing in a Tuesday article published in Politika, Serbia's oldest daily newspaper. \"Twenty-five years ago today, NATO flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese journalists,\" Xi said.\n\nChinese and Serbian flags fluttered along the highway leading to the city center, ahead of the meetings on Wednesday, when the two sides are expected to sign as many as 30 agreements, the government in Belgrade said without elaborating.\n\nMeeting with Vucic, Xi's trip will highlight projects such as the new high-speed railway linking Belgrade to Budapest. Direct Chinese investment in Hungary and Serbia exceeds $15 billion with more coming, ranging from car battery plants in Hungary to copper mining in Serbia.\n\n\"We are completely open to Chinese investment,\" Serbia's Deputy Premier Sinisa Mali told state broadcaster RTS shortly before Xi's arrival. \"China is one of the two biggest powers in the world and Xi is the most important statesman coming to Serbia in the last several years.\"\n\nRead More: China's Billions Help Xi Make Useful Friends in Eastern Europe\n\nXi on Monday also met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who told him that the EU is prepared to deploy all tools available to defend its economies if China fails to offer fair access to its markets.

Countries like Laos, Pakistan and Thailand have also endorsed a high-level engagement of the kind with China.\n\n\"With this agreement, Serbia is leading the way in its relations with China,\" said Ivona Ladjevac, deputy director at the Institute for International Politics and Economics in Belgrade.\n\nAleksandar Mitic, a research fellow also with the institute said this improvement of strategic cooperation should be viewed very positively. \"It is not directed against anyone.\"\n\nSerbia has long been known as \"the gateway to the Balkans\" on the European continent. \"Everything that has been done so far and will be done in the future can serve as an example to other countries in the region and throughout Europe to get involved as much as possible,\" said Mitic. \"The principle of mutual benefit can really work.\"\n\nIn support of the building of the China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, Xi has announced six measures when he met the press together with Vucic. Notable among the measures are a free trade agreement between China and Serbia which will take effect on July 1 and an exchange program under which Serbian youths and young Serbian scientists are invited to visit China in the next three years.\n\n\"The sky is the limit,\" said Vucic, referring to the scope of cooperation with China.\n\n\"For Serbia, it obviously brings a great deal,\" said Aleksandar Pavic, a Serbian political expert. \"The opening of the Chinese market with the Free Trade Agreement, academic exchanges ... those are very, very important.\"\n\n\"China offers a hand of cooperation on an equal footing, and offers great opportunities without conditions,\" Pavic said. \"We've grown weary of the zero-sum game for far too long.\"\n\nThe substantial deals added new testimony to the special bond of ironclad friendship enjoyed by China and Serbia.\n\nPrecious moments of goodwill and friendship are a signature of Xi's short but significant stay in Serbia, which lasts no more than 24 hours.\n\nA telling moment was the grand welcoming ceremony held by Vucic on Wednesday morning with the impressive attendance of more than 10,000 Serbian people.\n\nCrowds were waving the national flags of both countries and chanting \"China! Serbia!\" with applause and cheers pervading the atmosphere.\n\n\"We are here to show our friendship with China, and we want our Chinese friends know that we cherish it very much,\" said Milos Tosic, a college professor present at the event. Tosic told Xinhua that it is not only his opinion, but one shared \"by all the people here today.\"\n\nAt a welcoming banquet around noon, Xi shared his nostalgic memory with Vucic, reminiscing about the Yugoslav film \"The Bridge\" and the song \"Bella Ciao,\" which have become the fondest memories in his youthful days.", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade_Nikola_Tesla_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_visit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State visit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laos"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Laos"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free trade agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balkans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_flag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National flag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yugoslavia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 152, "textEnd": 157}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1929, "textEnd": 1935}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Xi arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday to pay a state visit to Serbia. Photo: Xinhua\n\nOn Wednesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic at the Palace of Serbia in Belgrade. The two leaders decided to deepen and elevate the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Serbia, and build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era. For the two countries and peoples, this is a significant event. Over the past few decades, the two countries have understood, trusted, supported, and helped each other in times of adversity, becoming true friends and close brothers. The upgrading of the two countries' political relationship has come naturally, opening a new chapter in history.\n\nPresident Xi visited Serbia again after eight years, receiving a grand and warm welcome. The national flags of China and Serbia flew along the highway from Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport all the way to the city center of Belgrade. Banners showing \"Welcome President Xi\" and \"Warm welcome to endeared Chinese friends\" were prominently displayed. Thousands of Serbian people shouted \"China\" and \"Serbia\" in front of the Palace of Serbia, showing their genuine emotions, which deeply touched and moved the Chinese society.\n\nChina and Serbia enjoy \"ironclad friendship,\" which is extraordinary in the ever-changing international relations. The ironclad friendship between China and Serbia has been tempered by blood and fire. In 1999, NATO bombed the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; in 2008, China experienced a major earthquake in Wenchuan, Southwest China's Sichuan Province; in 2014, Serbia suffered severe floods; and in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. The two countries and their peoples always extend a helping hand without hesitation when the other is in need, and this true friendship of mutual assistance cannot be eroded by time. The fundamental reason lies in the mutual respect, equal treatment, and high mutual trust between the two countries.\n\nThe interaction between China and Serbia is phenomenal and should be a subject of research in international relations. For those obsessed with \"great power competition\" and \"clash of civilizations,\" it should especially stimulate their thinking and reflection. Despite the vast distance, different social systems, and diverse cultural backgrounds, China and Serbia are able to resonate and reach consensus on international affairs, national development, and national sentiments. They have formed a close interdependence on the basis of independence, which is a breath of fresh air in the current international community plagued by a \"trust deficit,\" setting an example for state-to-state relations.\n\nObserving the relationship between China and Serbia, two characteristics can be discerned. First, the interactions and cooperation between the two countries serve the well-being of both nations and their peoples. China and Serbia firmly support each other's core interests and major concerns. China supports Serbia's efforts to uphold national sovereignty and territorial integrity, opposing any interference in Serbia's internal affairs by external forces. Serbia steadfastly adheres to the one-China principle and supports China in safeguarding its own sovereignty and territorial integrity. On the core issue of safeguarding national unity and opposing territorial separatism, the two countries share a high degree of consensus.\n\nMeanwhile, cooperation between the two countries is deeply rooted at the grassroots level. Within just a few months of investment by a Chinese company, the Smederevo Steel Plant has turned losses into profits, ensuring job security for over 5,000 employees and now standing as Serbia's third-largest exporting enterprise. The municipal sewage treatment project \"Clean Serbia,\" undertaken by China Road and Bridge Corporation, will benefit 2.3 million Serbian citizens. As a key project under the framework of China's cooperation with Central and Eastern European countries in building the Belt and Road Initiative, the Belgrade-Novi Sad section of the Hungary-Serbia Railway in Serbia is bringing about \"revolutionary changes\" in Serbia's transportation sector. For the people of both countries, the cooperation is not empty talk but tangible win-win outcomes.\n\nSecond, China-Serbia cooperation, whether for the region or the globe, is a positive force. As ironclad friends and upholders of world peace, the two countries share similar positions on many significant international and regional issues. In international organizations such as the United Nations and various major multilateral events, they cooperate closely, jointly advocating for a fair and orderly multipolar world, and inclusive and equitable economic globalization. They practice genuine multilateralism. Confronted with the complex and tumultuous international landscape, both nations join hands to oppose hegemonism and power politics, striving to safeguard global peace, stability, and international fairness and justice.\n\nWhat sustains the development of relations between China and Serbia is a high degree of political mutual trust. Both countries do not allow ideological differences and value systems to create rifts, nor do they engage in \"de-risking\" or pan-politicization. Instead, they listen to each other's concerns, respect and support each other's development paths and national rejuvenation. It is on this foundation that mutual trust can continue to accumulate, mutual understanding can be cultivated, and the space and willingness for cooperation can grow. From politics, economics, to culture and society, the abundant fruits of China-Serbia exchanges are rooted in the political mutual trust.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping announced six measures to support the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future, as he jointly met the press with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Wednesday. This signifies the comprehensive expansion of the long-standing friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Serbia. A Chinese axiom goes, \"Friends are those who are like-minded\"; and Serbians would say, \"Friends are the greatest asset in life.\" Under the strategic guidance of the two countries' leaders, the ironclad friendship between China and Serbia will continue to flourish, benefiting the peoples of both nations, promoting world peace and development, and jointly advancing the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.", "source": {"uri": "en.people.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "People's Daily, China"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We should never forget it, Xi said, according to an English version of the article. The Sino-Serbian friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will remain in the common memory of the Chinese and Serbian people.\n\nThe district of Belgrade, where the former embassy was located, was decorated on Tuesday with Chinese and Serbian flags. At a small demonstration this week, two Serbian communist parties hung banners welcoming the Chinese president, including one suggesting similarities between Serbia and China: Kosovo is Serbia, Taiwan is China.\n\nBelgrade says its former province broke away illegally, while Beijing claims Taiwan as part of its territory and is working to bring it under its control.\n\nXi's European trip, which will also include Hungary, is seen by analysts as aimed at exploiting differences on the continent with Russia and the United States and potentially undermining NATO and EU unity on China.\n\nChinese academics have praised Macron's advocacy for a more independent European position on the world stage, while Serbia and Hungary are seen as more pro-Russian despite the war in Ukraine.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vui, who will host Xi, was former leader Slobodan Miloevi's propaganda minister during the NATO bombing of Belgrade.\n\nThe bombing remains a source of lingering resentment in Serbia toward NATO and the United States in particular, said Milos Damnjanovic, an analyst at BIRN, a Belgrade think tank. [It] creates a feeling of solidarity between China and Serbia.\n\nNATO said the Chinese embassy bombing was an accident during a war to protect Kosovars from Serbian aggression.\n\nChina is the largest foreign investor in Serbia and accounts for 8.5 percent of Belgrade's foreign loans, according to Branimir Jovanovic, a researcher at the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies.\n\nIn a way, it is a failure of the EU and the West in general that China occupies such a place, Jovanovic said. The West leaves a space in which China is more than willing to establish itself.\n\nThe EU adopted on Tuesday a 6 billion growth plan for the six countries of the Western Balkans. But the deal comes with conditions for Serbia, including an obligation to improve relations with Kosovo, making it less attractive than Chinese financing which does not include such conditions.\n\nSerbian European affairs expert Duan Relji called the EU package much ado about nothing, saying it represented a negligible 0.3 percent of the region's GDP and was so complex that it was practically unusable.\n\nChinese media widely covered Xi's trip to Europe. People's Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, quoted him as telling Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Monday that China's overcapacity problem did not exist in response to Western concerns about possible dumping of subsidized Chinese products.\n\nMacron and his wife had lunch with Xi and his wife at a mountain restaurant in the Pyrenees, near the village where the French president's grandmother is buried. The lunch was intended to be a more personal meeting, similar to a visit Macron made last year to Guangzhou for a tea ceremony with Xi in a city where the Chinese president's father had resided.\n\nDuring Xi's visit, French and Chinese companies signed deals, including metro construction contracts for Frances Alstom. Shares of French cognac makers Pernod Ricard and R\u00e9my Cointreau rose on Tuesday, after France was granted a temporary reprieve from threats of special Chinese tariffs on EU brandy imports.\n\nYanmei Xie, an analyst at Beijing consultancy Gavekal, argued that Xi's talks with Macron would do little to change the course of China-EU relations since structural tensions over trade and the war in Ukraine would persist.\n\nChina's importance as an export market for the EU is declining compared to that of the United States, Xie said.\n\nEurope will only become more aligned with the United States, both for security and economic growth, she said. Macron's attempt to establish a relationship with Xi in the Pyrenees will change nothing.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Its goal is to realize the aspiration of the two peoples for a better life. Its foundation and driving force come from the firm support and extensive participation of the two peoples,\" Xi told reporters during a joint press conference with Vucic.\n\nXi also announced six measures to support the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future.\n\nChina is ready to import more quality and distinctive agricultural products from Serbia. China welcomes Serbia to increase direct flights between Belgrade and Shanghai, and encourages airlines from both sides to launch direct flights between Belgrade and Guangzhou.\n\nThe Chinese side will aid 50 young Serbian scientists in exchange programs with China for the next three years and a total of 300 Serbian youths will be invited to study in China in the next three years, said Xi.\n\nChina supports Serbia in hosting Expo 2027, and will send a delegation to participate in the grand show. China encourages its enterprises to take part in the construction of relevant projects, Xi said.\n\nXi was greeted by tens of thousands of Serbians on Wednesday and a welcoming ceremony was held outside the Palace of Serbia before the meeting between the two leaders.\n\nChinese national flags and Chinese-language welcoming banners were hanging on landmark buildings in Belgrade on Wednesday.\n\nChinese and Serbian experts said the meeting between the two heads of state will continue to provide high-level guidance to the sound development of bilateral relationship for the years to come and further inject vitality into the time-weathered, ironclad friendship.\n\nIronclad friendship\n\nOn Tuesday, a signed article by President Xi titled \"May the Light of Our Ironclad Friendship Shine on the Path of China-Serbia Cooperation\" was published in Serbian media Politika.\n\nXi noted in the article that \"there has always been an affinity between Chinese and Serbian peoples despite the long distance between us. During the bitter Anti-Fascist War and our respective nation-building in the last century, the Chinese and Serbian peoples forged a strong friendship that extends through time and space.\"\n\n\"Amid the ongoing transformations unseen in a century in the world, our mutual support remains as strong as ever, our cooperation is closer, and our exchanges and mutual learning more substantive. Whatever changes in the international landscape, China and Serbia remain true friends and good partners. Our ironclad friendship is ever-growing, setting a model for state-to-state and people-to-people interactions,\" Xi wrote.\n\nXi said China and Serbia should always be good friends and treat each other with sincerity, good partners for win-win cooperation, play an exemplary role in promoting fairness and justice and strengthen the heart-to-heart connection between their two peoples.\n\nWith China's support, hundreds of kilometers of highways have been built, the fastest railway in Eastern Europe entered operation, and energy facilities keep renewing, Boyan Lalic, Director of the Belt and Road Institute Belgrade, told the Global Times Wednesday.\n\nThe China-built high-speed railway connecting Belgrade to Novi Sad, inexpensive and comfortable, has cut the previously 1.5-hour trip to just 36 minutes, making a two-city life possible for many young people seeking opportunities, the Global Times learned.\n\nThe railway is part of a more ambitious project linking Belgrade and Budapest, the capital of Hungary, which could finish construction as early as 2025. The project has created jobs, offered unique career experience and trainings, and has allowed people like Serbian engineer Aleksandra Milosavljevic to \"make really good friends with my Chinese colleagues.\"\n\nJoin hands on international stage\n\nThe China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides, Xi wrote.\n\nDong Yifan, a research fellow at the Institute of European Studies, China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that both China and Serbia adhere to independence and non-alignment in their strategic approaches, choosing to follow their own development paths and opposing hegemony. \"We share a strong consensus in international affairs.\"\n\nThe last stop of Xi's three-nation European trip is Hungary, during which a series of cooperation agreements are expected to be signed, according to media reports.\n\nBoth Serbia and Hungary are pillar countries in China-proposed BRI, and have long been at the forefront of European countries' relations with China with close cooperation, Dong said, adding that high-level diplomacy has played a key role in the two countries' relations with China.\n\nHe Zhigao, a research fellow with the Institute of European Studies of CASS, said that Serbia and Hungary \"stand out\" among European countries in regard to developing China ties partly because they can overcome some external restraints and make more independent decisions based on their own interests.", "source":

They were further galvanized in 2016 by the first visit to Belgrade by a Chinese leader in three decades and joint resistance to Western-led responses to the COVID-19 pandemic that erupted in 2020.\n\n\"China sees in Hungary and Serbia the two most important partners in Europe, a kind of door that opens up space to a wider European market and to some strategic investments,\" said Vedran Dzihic, a senior lecturer at the University of Vienna and senior researcher at the Austrian Institute for International Affairs.\n\nMuch of China's cooperation with Serbia revolves around infrastructure, a focus of the massive Belt And Road Initiative that was adopted in 2013 as a linchpin of Xi's diplomatic and economic outreach around the world.\n\nDzihic said Beijing is seeking any path to the European market and to increase its influence on the continent.\n\nVucic has stressed the visit's potential to boost technological development in areas such as robotics and satellites. Ahead of Xi's trip, the Serbian president called it \"a way to keep pace with the world and further develop our best relations.\"\n\nThe Serbian government also announced recently it had adopted measures to improve cooperation with China in areas such as science, education, and innovation, as well as economic and technical cooperation in infrastructure.\n\nBut aside from any trade and economic benefits, Dzihic said, there is a political message underlying Serbia's hosting of Xi that is connected to broader efforts -- notably by Moscow and Beijing -- to challenge U.S. influence and potentially reshape the international order.\n\n\"[The message is] that Serbia is striving to work on deepening relations with actors outside the West and, in that sense, is a kind of autonomous player in the new geopolitical constellation,\" Dzihic said.\n\nXi's arrival on May 7 coincides with the 25th anniversary of NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in the Serbian capital, an event that united Belgrade and Beijing in outrage at Western policies and intervention during the Balkan wars of the 1990s.\n\nThe 1999 NATO air strikes, which targeted military and civilian infrastructure in Slobodan Milosevic's Yugoslavia, were the Western military alliance's response to the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and reports of atrocities by Serbian forces against the ethnic Albanian population.\n\nUniversity of Vienna lecturer Dzihic noted that the NATO bombardment is an ongoing source of anti-Western sentiment that perpetuates the idea of a \"conflict\" pitting the West against Russia, China, and other countries. He said it is a narrative \"in which Serbia, that is, the Serbian president, first tries to navigate between these two poles, and then relies on partners from the East once there is significant pressure from the West.\"\n\nDzihic said he believed the West had become \"much, much more critical of Vucic's regime than it was a few years ago.\"\n\nDuring his previous state visit to Serbia, in 2016, Xi laid a wreath at the monument in Belgrade to the three people killed and at least 20 others injured in the 1999 bombing of the Chinese Embassy, an incident for which Washington apologized. (A Chinese cultural center, which is among the largest in Europe, has since arisen at the site.)\n\nOn that same visit, Xi signed a Declaration on Strategic Partnership with Vucic's presidential predecessor and fellow SNS member, Tomislav Nikolic. In 2023, with Vucic unquestionably steering foreign policy, the two sides signed a free-trade agreement that critics feared created a new path for Chinese military exports to Europe. There were also fears the agreement would \"lock\" Serbia into a closer long-term relationship with Beijing and \"further distance\" the country from its European neighbors.\n\nMore than $5 billion in Chinese investments has flowed into Serbia in the past decade, according to Serbian Trade Minister Tomislav Momirovic.\n\nMany of those deals have been dogged by controversy. In some cases, local protests have targeted Chinese investors' hiring practices or environmental standards. Critics have also questioned the financing of infrastructure projects through Chinese loans agreed between the two governments without competitive bidding and whose terms remain undisclosed. The Export-Import Bank of China is now among Serbia's largest creditors.\n\nBut in one of the most recent polls to track Serbians' views of China, two-thirds of respondents said they welcomed Chinese investment, with young people more likely to respond positively. The same survey, published in October 2023 by a Belgrade-based nonprofit, the Institute for European Affairs, said three-quarters of Serbians regard China as a friendly country.\n\nVucic boasted during a visit to China last year that he was proud Serbia was \"the only country in Europe that had never joined declarations criticizing or attacking China on any issue.\"\n\nVuksanovic, the researcher at the Belgrade Center for Security Policy, described Serbia's key challenge as maintaining some sort of proportionality in its relations with China and the United States. He said Belgrade appeared to have found a formula whereby Washington is its dominant partner in the areas of security and, potentially, relations with its former province Kosovo, which declared independence over Serbian objections in 2008.\n\n\"They think they can maintain a balance with China as long as it is reduced exclusively to economic cooperation and high-level diplomatic exchange,\" Vuksanovic said, and \"as long as there are no deeper provocative moves toward Washington.\"", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty"}, "authors":

succession of talks on Monday.\n\nMacron, joined initially by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, urged Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its war with Ukraine and asked Beijing to do all it could to end the conflict.\n\nXi, for his part, warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nChina has poured billions into Serbia and neighbouring Balkan countries, and last year Beijing and Belgrade signed a free trade agreement.\n\nSerbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told the RTS broadcaster that talks on Wednesday would centre on \"a great project.\" (Xinhua/AFP)", "source": {"uri": "news.rthk.hk", "dataType":

Alongside Hungary, Serbia has been a steadfast supporter of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), positioning itself as a pivotal partner in China's infrastructure agenda across Asia and Europe.\n\n\"Serbia became China's first strategic partner in Central and Eastern Europe eight years ago, and it becomes the first European country with which we shall build a community with shared future,\" said Xi during the visit.\n\nThe discussions between the two leaders covered a wide range of topics, including bilateral cooperation, the BRI, China's engagement with Central and Eastern Europe, and international and regional affairs. The two parties reached a broad consensus on these matters, affirming their commitment to deepening mutual cooperation.\n\n\"The two sides agreed that Serbia and China foster strong traditional friendship, intensive cooperation in specific areas, fruitful coordination on a multilateral level, and the development of bilateral relations has broad perspectives,\" said the Serbian presidency in a statement.\n\nLooking ahead, both countries expressed readiness to capitalise on the new phase of development of the BRI, with a focus on expanding cooperation in various sectors, including economy, trade, investment, technology and innovation.\n\nOn the political front, the two presidents expressed mutual support for each other's territorial integrity. Specifically, Belgrade made clear that it sees Taiwan as part of China, while Beijing considers Kosovo as part of Serbia.\n\nXi's visit took place on the 25th anniversary of the 1999 accidental Nato bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, an incident that prompted widespread condemnation and an apology from then US president Bill Clinton.\n\nSerbia's alignment with China's Belt and Road Initiative has cemented its position as a key partner for China in Europe. Chinese investments in Serbia have contributed significantly to infrastructure development, with projects spanning mines, factories, roads and bridges.\n\nChina is currently Serbia's second most important economic partner following the EU. China was also the top foreign investor in Serbia in 2023, accounting for \u20ac1.37bn of the total \u20ac4.5bn.\n\nChinese companies have played an important role in Serbia's industrial sector, and are among the country's top exporters. Specifically, Serbia's top exporters were dominated by three Chinese-owned companies in 2023: Zijin Mining, Zijin Copper and the HBIS Group.\n\nOther recent collaborations include the establishment of yuan clearing arrangements and the inauguration of a new freight route linking China's Hebei province with Belgrade.\n\nXi received a warm welcome within Serbia, with crowds gathering to greet him in Belgrade, which was decorated with Chinese flags and posters in honour of the visit.\n\nThe recent Western Balkans Regional Poll by the International Republican Institution (IRI) showed that Serbs see China as their second most important ally after Russia.\n\nHowever, concerns have been voiced by Western think-tanks about Chinese influence in Serbia, as well as via Serbia to the EU if and when the Western Balkan country join the bloc.\n\nA comment by Angelica Vascotto, pan-European fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), warned in January over Belgrade's low foreign policy alignment with the EU and questions over its commitment to European values. Failure to mediate and incentivise democratic recovery could allow other countries, including China, to exert influence in Serbia, potentially diverting the country away from its Western neighbours,

But China's position on Russia's war in Ukraine will also take center stage.\n\nChina has sought to carve out a larger diplomatic role around the Ukraine war, although EU officials have expressed doubts about the role Beijing can play in any future peace process given its close ties to Russia.\n\nSerbia and Hungary have both pushed back on sanctions against Russia and have stood against weapons deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nThe date chosen for Xi's visit to Serbia is symbolic, as it marks the 25th anniversary of the destruction of the Chinese Embassy building during the 1999 NATO bombing campaign.\n\nA large Chinese cultural center has been built at the former site of the embassy, and Xi is expected to visit a memorial there in honor of Chinese diplomats killed during the accidental strike.\n\nXi and Vucic are expected to discuss a wide range of topics, from political, economic, and technological issues to cooperation in the field of culture.\n\nThe Chinese president is coming to Belgrade six months after Vucic visited Beijing, during which Serbia and Chinese officials signed a free-trade agreement in the presence of the two leaders at the international \"Belt and Road\" forum.\n\nThe free-trade agreement between Serbia and China is set to enter into force in July, although it has been under scrutiny in Brussels.\n\nAhead of Xi's visit, Vucic said Serbia will accelerate projects in several spheres, including \"robotics, satellite technology, flying cars, among many other things.\"\n\nXi previously traveled to Serbia in June 2016, which marked the first visit of a Chinese president to Belgrade in 30 years.\n\nSource: https://www.rferl.org/a/serbia-china-xi-vucic-trade- russia-ukraine/32935464.html\n\nCopyright (c) 2024.

She said she hoped there would be \"results from this visit, something good for both parties\".\n\nThe first leg of Xi's visit in France saw meetings with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen urging Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi for his part warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go to Hungary, where China has invested heavily in vast

(Xinhua/Pang Xinglei)\n\nBELGRADE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping shared his special bond with the Serbian people on Wednesday, saying he enjoyed Yugoslav films and songs when he was young.\n\n\"The Yugoslav film The Bridge and the song Bella Ciao, which evoke strong patriotic and anti-Fascism sentiments, have been immensely popular in China through the years and became my companion in my youthful days,\" Xi said when attending a welcome banquet held by Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.\n\nThe Chinese people have always cherished a special bond of friendship with Serbia, he said, adding that Serbian athletes Novak Djokovic and Nikola Jokic, and movie director Emir Kusturica are household names in China.\n\nXi pointed out that Serbia, located on \"the west of the East, and east of the West,\" has long been known as \"the gateway to the Balkans.\"\n\nFor centuries, this land has been a meeting place of diverse civilizations on the Eurasian continent, which in many ways shaped the diligent, kind, and unyielding character of the Serbian people, he said.\n\nDuring a joint press conference with Vucic on Wednesday afternoon, Xi mentioned the warm greetings he had received in the country. On Tuesday evening, upon Xi's arrival, Vucic and his wife, leading a delegation of senior Serbian officials, went to the airport to greet him and his wife in person, which was very touching, Xi said.\n\nPrior to their meeting, Vucic accompanied Xi to the platform of the Palace of Serbia. On the square in front of the Palace, some 15,000 Serbian people were waving national flags of China and Serbia to express the warmest welcome to Xi. The Chinese leader waved to the crowd, which burst into jubilant, prolonged applause and cheers.\n\nLater in his meeting with Vucic, Xi said that he was deeply touched when he was greeted at the airport by President Vucic together with many senior government officials who held a grand welcoming ceremony for his visit.\n\nHe also said he was deeply moved by the genuine friendliness toward China from the Serbian people who are good friends of the Chinese people.\n\nIn a signed article published prior to his arrival in Serbia, he said \"There has always been an affinity between Chinese and Serbian peoples despite the long distance between us.\"\n\n\"During the bitter Anti-Fascist War and our respective nation-building in the last century, the Chinese and Serbian peoples forged a strong friendship that extends through time and space,\" said the article.", "source": {"uri": "en.people.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "People's Daily, China"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yugoslavia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_Liyuan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peng Liyuan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emir_Kusturica", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emir Kusturica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurasia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balkans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palace of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation-building", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nation-building"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 301, "textEnd": 306}], "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

She said she hoped there would be \"results from this visit, something good for both parties\".\n\nThe first leg of Xi's visit in France saw meetings with Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen urging Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi for his part warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go to Hungary, where China has invested heavily in vast battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing plants.\n\nbur-rox/ds/gv/smw\n\nMore from this section\n\nTrump fined $1,000 for gag order violation in hush money case as ex-employee recounts

der Leyen urging Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine and to do all it could to end the war.\n\nXi for his part warned the West not to \"smear\" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.\n\nEurope is concerned that while officially neutral over the Ukraine conflict, China is essentially backing Russia, which is using Chinese machine tools in arms production.\n\nAfter meeting with Vucic, Xi will go to Hungary, where China has invested heavily in vast

It is an incident China will never forget and has been a constant thorn in Sino-American relations.\n\nIn a statement published Tuesday in Serbia's leading daily newspaper Politika, Xi said that China's friendship with Serbia \"is soaked in the shared blood of the two nations.\" There were rumblings that he would take the opportunity to visit the former embassy, now a China Cultural Center, to pay his respects to the dead and make a political point -- that NATO is not a purely defensive alliance, and that China is far stronger now than it was then.\n\nSince Xi's previous visit to Serbia in 2016, relations between the two countries have intensified, with China emerging as Serbia's primary economic partner. China is the single largest investor in Serbia, and its second largest trade partner after the European Union. Last October, the two countries signed a free trade agreement, making Serbia China's first free-trade partner in central and eastern Europe.\n\nChinese investment in Serbia, which accounts for around a third of the country's total foreign direct investment, is concentrated in mining and manufacturing. Zijin Mining and Serbia Zijin Copper are now the second and third most profitable companies in Serbia. Chinese companies have also been involved in major infrastructure projects in Serbia, such as the Belgrade to Novi Sad high-speed railway and the Milo\u0161 the Great highway.\n\nIt is obvious why China is an important partner for Serbia -- it has invested billions in the country and has been a bulwark against the international recognition of Kosovo at the United Nations. It might be less clear, however, why Serbia is important for China. China's trade with Serbia is less than one-fortieth of its trade with Germany -- and yet it has chosen to visit Belgrade not Berlin.\n\nFor China, Serbia is a rare friend in Europe, and one which shares its worldview. Both countries sacralize state sovereignty and territorial integrity in international law. While China has always opposed Kosovo's independence, Vu\u010di\u0107 has been clear on his position on Taiwan. \"Taiwan is China. And it's up to you, what, when, how you're going to do it,\" he said in a recent interview.\n\nChina also sees Serbia as a gateway to Europe. As an EU candidate state, Serbia could become a conduit through which China could enter the European market. And by occupying a strategic position in the western Balkans, Serbia plays an important role in China's Belt and Road Initiative, connecting the Greek port of Piraeus, run by China's Cosco Shipping, to Hungary in the north.\n\nSerbia's courting of China does raise questions about Belgrade's commitment to EU accession. But after waiting to join the EU for more than two decades, Serbia has little to lose here. The sluggish accession talks and constant moving targets mean Serbia has been forced to look elsewhere to develop its economy and increase growth.\n\nAs the governor of the National Bank of Serbia recently remarked, \"this waiting room is turning into captivity.\" Instead of waiting around doing nothing, Serbia has \"dared to have its own path and to be different.\" Since 2009, Serbia has pursued a foreign policy which balances its relations between the US, EU, Russia and China.\n\nMuch like the former Yugoslavia, Serbia insists on its right to pursue an independent foreign policy. Serbia has refused to distance itself from Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and has continued to seek economic opportunities and diplomatic support from China.\n\nSo far this strategy has not served Serbia badly.\n\nSerbia's growth rate is among the highest in Europe (its estimated GDP was 4.6 percent for the first quarter of 2024), and its public debt to GDP ratio is among the lowest (and projected to decline to around 50 percent in 2024). Despite warnings from the EU that Chinese investment would create a debt trap, Serbia's total external debt was only around 65 percent of GDP at the end of 2023.\n\nIt is uncertain how long Serbia will be able to keep up its balancing act. The country faces pressure from the EU to impose sanctions on Russia and distance itself from China. Perhaps if the prospect of EU membership were more credible, the country would rethink its international leanings. For now, Serbia's alliance with China is serving it well.", "source": {"uri": "thespectator.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spectator World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations,\" Xinhua reported.\n\nXi said he looks forward to taking this visit as an opportunity to hold talks with Aleksandar Vuvic on bilateral ties and other issues of mutual interest, renewing friendship, planning for cooperation, exploring development, and creating a new blueprint for the development of bilateral relations.\n\nHe said, \"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations.\" Xi said, \"It gives me great pleasure to pay a state visit to the Republic of Serbia at the warm invitation of President Vucic.\"\n\nHe further said, \"On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I would like to extend heartfelt greetings and best wishes to the friendly government and people of Serbia,\" he added.\n\nXi noted that the ties between the two nations have witnessed leapfrog development and achieved historic results since the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership in 2016, according to Xinhua report.\n\nHe said that China and Serbia have given each other firm support on issues related to their respective core interests and major concerns, He further said, \"We have jointly upheld international fairness and justice, and contributed our share to promoting world peace and development.\"\n\nBefore arriving in Serbia, Xi Jinping was on a two-day visit to France. During his visit, he held talks with his French counterpart at Elysee Palace in Paris on Monday as the two countries marked 60 years of diplomatic relations.\n\nAt a press conference, the two leaders called for \"a truce\" in Ukraine and other global conflicts during the Paris Olympic Games. Xi and Macron also discussed China's ongoing support for Russia's leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nMacron welcomed Chinese \"commitments\" to \"abstain from selling any weapons\" to Russia and \"closely control the export of dual-usage equipment,\" saying that such statements were \"reassuring,\" Politico reported.\n\nXi quoted by Xinhua, warned against \"smearing\" China over Ukraine and called on all parties to resume engagement and dialogue to build mutual trust. The Chinese President said that China and France should uphold independence and jointly prevent a \"new Cold War\" or bloc confrontation.\n\nA 10-point statement was released by the Elysee on the declaration between France and China on the situation in West Asia. This came just after Hamas officials gave their nod for a ceasefire deal for Gaza put forward by Qatari and Egyptian mediators.\n\nIn the statement, Macron and Xi \"expressed their opposition to an Israeli offensive on Rafah, which would lead to a humanitarian catastrophe on a new scale\".\n\nThe two heads of state stressed that an immediate and lasting ceasefire is urgently needed to allow the large-scale delivery of humanitarian aid and the protection of civilians in the Gaza Strip and called for \"immediate and unconditional release of all hostages\" and the guarantee of humanitarian access to meet their medical and other humanitarian needs as well as respect for international law with respect to all those detained.\n\nThey also reiterated their commitment to promoting a political and diplomatic settlement on the Iranian nuclear issue. The Chinese leader held three-way talks with Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Or perhaps the date was chosen deliberately.\n\nMay 7 is the day NATO bombs hit the city's Chinese Embassy in 1999, killing three Chinese journalists and injuring more than 20 others. The strike took place during the war in Kosovo, after the Western military alliance intervened -- without a UN mandate -- to stop crimes against ethnic Albanians.\n\nAt the time, NATO said the embassy had been hit by mistake. China, however, has always doubted this explanation. In an op-ed for a Serbian newspaper on Tuesday, Xi wrote: \"We must not forget that 25 years ago today, NATO brazenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.\"\n\nSharing this event, China, with its population of over 1.4 billion, and Serbia, with 6.6. million inhabitants, have become allies in the fight against the US-led world order, maintaining friendly relations for years.\n\nTheir main interest: economic ties. Thanks to a huge Chinese loan equivalent to \u20ac3.2 billion ($3.4 million), Serbia is currently building 5,000 kilometers (about 3,100 miles) of sewers and 159 wastewater treatment plants, which even Belgrade is still lacking.\n\nChinese companies also operate a huge steelworks in central Serbia, a smelt mill and copper mine in the country's east and a tire plant in the north.\n\nChinese firms are also involved in the construction of a new district in the Serbian capital, including a state-of-the-art stadium, as Belgrade gears up to host the Expo 2027 exhibition. The whole project, which Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic hopes will boost his country's prestige, is expected to cost the equivalent of \u20ac17 billion.\n\nChinese companies have long used Serbia as a gateway to the EU market. Though the Balkan country has trade agreements with Brussels, it's not subject to all of the EU's strict rules, as it's not a member of the bloc.\n\nVucic, whom critics have described as an autocrat, keeps the media on a tight leash. There has been limited critical coverage of Chinese influence in Serbia, but plenty of positive reporting.\n\nThe Serbian president, TV cameras in tow, always tends to be present at the opening of Chinese-built infrastructure projects, such as a bridge in the Serbian capital, a new highway section or even a railway line between the Hungarian capital, Budapest, and Belgrade.\n\nThe Budapest-Belgrade line is to be extended via North Macedonia to the major Greek port of Piraeus, which has established itself as China's bridgehead to the EU market over the past 15 years. The idea is that it should be a major connector to China's Belt and Road Initiative, a massive global infrastructure project.\n\nStefan Vladisavljev of the Belgrade Fund for Political Excellence said China has become one of the \"pillars\" of infrastructure and economic development in Serbia over the past 15 years. This is in keeping with the Serbian government's narrative of wanting to provide progress, jobs and higher wages.\n\nAfter Germany, China is Serbia's second-largest trading partner. While the trade deficit with Germany amounted to half a billion euros last year, with China it equaled \u20ac3.4 billion.\n\nA free-trade agreement between Serbia and China, set to come into effect in July, aims to change this discrepancy. Vucic has said the main aim is to sell more vegetables, fruit, spirits and wine to the Chinese.\n\nThe \"steel friendship,\" as both Beijing and Belgrade have described their relationship, was bolstered at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vladisavljev, when China sent large quantities of face masks and, eventually, vaccines. These shipments have remained in people's minds. In contrast, said Vladisavljev, the aid sent by the EU to combat the virus, which amounted to more than \u20ac100 million, hardly got a mention in the media.\n\nThese increased ties with China come on top of Serbia's traditional strong relations with Russia, which Vucic has maintained despite officially wanting to lead his country into the EU.\n\nSerbia, which has refused to recognize the independence of neighboring Kosovo, has received support for this stance from Russia and China -- both veto powers in the UN Security Council.\n\nWhile Russia's support has tended to come with a political price, especially since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Chinese backing doesn't seem to have any strings attached.\n\nVladisavljev called China the \"phantom image of the ideal friend\" for Serbia, adding that it was a matter of economic and political support as well as the perception of China as a great power finally standing up to the West.\n\nHe said this was precisely what has raised suspicions in the EU and the US, explaining that the Balkans had always primarily been part of the West's zone of influence and that if Serbia were to be admitted into the EU, this would come with a \"hub of Chinese interests.\"\n\nIt seems, however, that most of Serbia supports Vucic's close relationship with China. According to recent public opinion polls, many Serbians consider China to be their country's second-closest ally, after Russia, with the EU and the US lagging far behind.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com",

According to NATO, there was an accident at the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, but the Chinese still doubt this. Even today, the majority of Serbs view the NATO intervention at that time as a crime committed by the West against Serbia.\n\nThe memory of the air raid 25 years ago is still important for China today, because it makes Serbia an ideological ally in the fight against the \"US-led West\". The two countries have maintained a close relationship in word and deed for years, with cooperation ranging from infrastructure projects to the presence of Chinese police in Serbia.\n\nSerbia as a gateway to the West\n\nRelations between China and Serbia are primarily about economics. Belgrade's wastewater, for example, still largely flows into the Danube and Drava. Serbia, on the other hand, is now building 5,000 kilometers of canals and 159 sewage treatment plants - with a 3.2 billion euro loan from China.\n\nToday there is a Chinese steel mill, a Chinese copper mine, a Chinese smelter and a Chinese tire factory in the middle of Serbia. But Chinese companies are building Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107's prestigious project, the new district for the 2027 World Expo in Belgrade and the new national stadium, which will cost a total of 17 billion euros.\n\nFor years, Serbia has served as a gateway to the continent for Chinese companies looking to expand into European markets. Although Serbia has trade agreements with the EU, it is not a member of the union, so the country is not subject to EU rules that prevent or at least slow Chinese expansion into Europe.\n\nAccordingly, Serbia is full of Chinese infrastructure developments: Chinese companies have built a new bridge in Belgrade and a new stretch of highway near the capital. However, their most important development is the reconstruction of the Budapest-Belgrade railway line, which they later plan to extend through North Macedonia to the port of Piraeus in Greece. Over the last fifteen years, Piraeus has developed into China's most important European bridgehead and an important stop on the planned new Silk Road.\n\n\"China has really become one of the pillars of Serbia's infrastructural and economic development over the last fifteen years,\" says political scientist Stefan Vladisavljev, a China expert at the Fund for Political Excellence think tank in Belgrade. The investments fit well into the Serbian government's central narrative of progress, job creation and wage growth.\n\nIt doesn't matter that the Chinese don't take environmental regulations too seriously - the Serbian leadership cares more about jobs. This is a sellable story in a country where most people live on less than 500 euros (about 194,000 HUF) a month and many jobs depend on the favor of the ruling party.\n\nChina is Serbia's second largest trading partner after Germany. But while the trade deficit with Germany is half a billion euros, the deficit with China was 3.4 billion euros last year - which means that the Serbs buy significantly more goods than they sell to the Chinese. This will change thanks to the free trade agreement between the two countries that comes into force in July, says Vu\u010di\u0107, whose main goal is to sell more vegetables, fruits, spirits and wine to the Chinese.\n\nAccording to Vladisavljev, relations between Belgrade and Beijing strengthened, especially at the beginning of the pandemic. At that time, the Chinese sent large quantities of vaccine doses and masks to Serbia, which the Serbian leadership has been talking about ever since. However, there is less talk about the fact that the EU sent more than a hundred million euros in aid to the country at the beginning of the epidemic.\n\nBecause this is also about big politics. While Vu\u010di\u0107 wants to officially introduce his country to the EU, he maintains good relations with Orthodox Russia and increasingly with China. In the UN Security Council, both major powers support Serbia in not recognizing the independence of the former Serbian province of Kosovo.\n\n\"The phantom image of the ideal friend\"\n\nBut there is a difference: While Russian aid comes with a political price - especially since Russia's attack on Ukraine - Beijing's aid appears to come without political conditions. \"For Serbia, China is the phantom image of an ideal friend,\" says Vladisavljev. It's about economic and political support and the perception of China as a great power that will finally stand up to the West.\n\nThat's exactly what the EU and the USA suspect, the political scientist continues. \"The Balkans have always been primarily part of the Western sphere of influence. Therefore, there is a fear that Serbia's possible accession to the EU will bring the extent of Chinese interests to Europe too,\" he said.\n\nSerbia and China also cooperate in the area of security policy. The Serbian army already has Chinese CH95 combat drones, which, according to experts, play a key role in the development of the Serbian Pegasus drone. The crown jewel, however, is the FK3 air defense system.\n\n\"The FK3 is very important because the Serbian army has never had such a system before. \"Its range is about 100 kilometers, which is a significant improvement compared to the old Soviet Neva systems that once formed our air defense,\" military expert Vlade Radulovi\u0107 recently told Deutsche Welle.\n\nIn addition to the army, the police of both countries are also cooperating. Chinese police have already patrolled Belgrade several times - officially to help Chinese tourists traveling there. In addition, there are already more than 1,000 Huawei-branded security cameras with facial recognition capabilities in Belgrade, the exact locations of which the Serbian police do not disclose.\n\nAccording to current laws, Serbian police are not allowed to use facial recognition software, but the government has tried several times to change the relevant law. One thing is certain: Belgrade is the first European city where smart cameras from China can be found everywhere. The placement of this by the Serbian leadership Safe city introduced with the name and is also intended to be an advertisement for Chinese surveillance technology.\n\nMost Serbs support Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107's alliance with China. All polls show that China is Serbia's second best friend and second most important ally - after Russia. Far fewer people like the EU and the USA.", "source": {"uri": "newsbeezer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "newsbeezer.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Addressing the audience, Serbia's President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 thanked Xi for choosing to visit Serbia: 'We are writing history today...[Xi] hasn't come to Europe in five years and he has again chosen our little Serbia.'\n\nThe visit has been choreographed to coincide with the 25 anniversary of Nato's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999. The strike killed three Chinese journalists and sparked mass protests across China. It is an incident China will never forget and has been a constant thorn in Sino-American relations.\n\nIn a statement published yesterday in Serbia's leading daily newspaper Politika, Xi said that China's friendship with Serbia 'is soaked in the shared blood of the two nations'. It is likely that he will take the opportunity to visit the former embassy, now a China Cultural Centre, to pay his respects to the dead and make a political point - that Nato is not a purely defensive alliance, and that China is far stronger now than it was then.\n\nSince Xi's previous visit to Serbia in 2016, relations between the two countries have intensified, with China emerging as Serbia's primary economic partner. China is the single largest investor in Serbia, and its second largest trade partner after the EU. Last October, the two countries signed a free trade agreement, making Serbia China's first free trade partner in central and eastern Europe.\n\nChinese investment in Serbia, which accounts for around a third of the country's total foreign direct investment, is concentrated in mining and manufacturing. Zijin Mining and Serbia Zijin Copper are now the second and third most profitable companies in Serbia. Chinese companies have also been involved in major infrastructure projects in Serbia, such as the Belgrade to Novi Sad high-speed railway and the Milo\u0161 the Great highway.\n\nIt is obvious why China is an important partner for Serbia - it has invested billions in the country and has been a bulwark against the international recognition of Kosovo at the UN. It might be less clear, however, why Serbia is important for China. China's trade with Serbia is less than one-fortieth of its trade with Germany, and yet it has chosen to visit Belgrade not Berlin.\n\nFor China, Serbia is a rare friend in Europe, and one which shares its worldview. Both countries sacralise state sovereignty and territorial integrity in international law. While China has always opposed Kosovo's independence, Vu\u010di\u0107 has been clear on his position on Taiwan. 'Taiwan is China. And it's up to you, what, when, how you're going to do it', he said in a recent interview.\n\nChina also sees Serbia as a gateway to Europe. As an EU candidate state, Serbia could become a conduit through which China could enter the European market. And by occupying a strategic position in the western Balkans, Serbia plays an important role in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), connecting the Greek port of Piraeus, run by China's Cosco Shipping, to Hungary in the north.\n\nSerbia's courting of China does raise questions about Belgrade's commitment to EU accession. But after waiting to join the EU for more than two decades, Serbia has little to lose here. The sluggish accession talks and constant moving targets mean Serbia has been forced to look elsewhere to develop its economy and increase growth.\n\nAs the governor of the National Bank of Serbia recently remarked, 'this waiting room is turning into captivity.' Instead of waiting around doing nothing, Serbia has 'dared to have its own path and to be different.' Since 2009, Serbia has pursued a foreign policy which balances its relations between the US, EU, Russia and China.\n\nMuch like the former Yugoslavia, Serbia insists on its right to pursue an independent foreign policy. Serbia has refused to distance itself from Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and has continued to seek economic opportunities and diplomatic support from China.\n\nSo far this strategy has not served Serbia badly.\n\nSerbia's growth rate is amongst the highest in Europe (its estimated GDP was 4.6 per cent for the first quarter of 2024), and its public debt to GDP ratio is amongst the lowest (and projected to decline to around 50 per cent in 2024). Despite warnings from the EU that Chinese investment would create a debt trap, Serbia's total external debt was only around 65 per cent of GDP at the end of 2023.\n\nIt is uncertain how long Serbia will be able to keep up its balancing act. The country faces pressure from the EU to impose sanctions on Russia and distance itself from China. Perhaps if the prospect of EU membership were more credible, the country would rethink its international leanings. For now, Serbia's alliance with China is serving it well.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

At a small demonstration this week two Serbian communist parties hung banners to welcome the Chinese president, including one suggesting similarities between Serbia and China: \"Kosovo is Serbia - Taiwan is China\".\n\nBelgrade claims its former province broke away illegally, while Beijing claims Taiwan as part of its territory and strives to bring it under its control.\n\nMr Xi's European trip will also include Hungary.\n\nChinese academics have praised Mr Macron's advocacy of a more independent European stance on the global stage, while Serbia and Hungary are seen as more pro-Russia despite the Ukraine war.\n\nSerbian president Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, who will host Mr Xi, was propaganda minister for former leader Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 during the Nato bombing of Belgrade.\n\nThe bombing remains a \"source of persistent resentment in Serbia towards Nato and the US in particular\", said Milos Damnjanovic, an analyst at BIRN, a Belgrade think tank. \"[It] creates a sense of solidarity between China and Serbia.\"\n\nNato has said the Chinese embassy bombing was an accident that happened during a war to protect Kosovans from Serbian aggression.\n\nChina is the biggest foreign investor in Serbia and accounts for 8.5 per cent of Belgrade's foreign loans, according to Branimir Jovanovic, a researcher at the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies. \"In a way this is a failure of the EU and the West in general that China is so prominent,\" Mr Jovanovic said. \"The West leaves space that China is more than willing to step into.\"\n\nMr Macron and his wife had lunch with Xi and his wife at a Pyrenees mountain restaurant close to the village where the French president's grandmother is buried. The lunch was intended as a more personal encounter, mirroring a visit Mr Macron made last year to Guangzhou for a tea ceremony with Xi in a city where the Chinese president's father had resided.\n\nDuring Mr Xi's visit French and Chinese companies signed deals including metro construction contracts for France's Alstom. Shares in French cognac makers Pernod Ricard and R\u00e9my Cointreau rose on Tuesday after France extracted a temporary reprieve from threatened Chinese special import tariffs on EU brandies.",

Amidst ongoing global trade disputes and the divisive situation in Ukraine, Xi's visit to Hungary symbolises a significant effort by China to bolster its relationship with Europe through one of its most cooperative EU member states.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic (R) stands next to Chinese President Xi Jinping during a welcome ceremony in Belgrade, on May 8, 2024. Chinese President Xi Jinping will hold talks with his Serbian counterpart in Belgrade on May 8, 2024. LEHTIKUVA / AFP\n\nXi arrived in Hungary from Serbia, where he visited on May 8. There, together with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, Chinese President announced a deepening of bilateral relations by agreeing to establish a \"community with a shared future.\" This agreement comes on the anniversary of the 1999 NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and underscores both countries' support for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty. The visit, part of Xi's first European tour in five years, also included the signing of 29 agreements aimed at enhancing legal, regulatory, and economic cooperation. Moreover, a significant free trade deal set to begin on July 1 will enable tariff-free exports of 95% of Serbian products to China over the next five to 10 years. This deal is notable as China has been the largest single investor in Serbia since 2020, with investments increasing thirtyfold over the last decade.\n\nDuring the talks in Serbia, a landmark decision was reached between the two countries to transform their comprehensive strategic partnership, established in 2016, into a community with a shared future. This upgrade signifies a profound deepening of ties between the two nations, heralding a new era of mutual cooperation and shared aspirations.\n\nChina and Serbia's shared vision includes the pursuit of national development and revitalisation. Xi emphasised the strategic nature of the bilateral relationship, noting that Serbia has become the first European nation to form such a community of shared future with China. \"We not only pursue our own development, but also strive to achieve common development with other countries in the world -- that is why I proposed the building of a community with a shared future for mankind,\" he commented. \"Together, we have set a fine example of building a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation,\" Xi said.\n\nThis community symbolises a mutual commitment to development, win-win cooperation, and mutual success, reflecting the common values and objectives of both nations.\n\nThe two leaders agreed to deepen and expand Belt and Road cooperation and collaboration between China and Central and Eastern European countries, contributing to their respective modernisation efforts. Xi assured continued support for Serbia in maintaining its independence, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity, highlighting the strategic cooperation and mutual support between the two nations.\n\nThe forthcoming China-Serbia Free Trade Agreement, effective from July 1, 2024, is set to further enhance economic ties. China also plans to import more high-quality agricultural specialties from Serbia, and cultural exchanges are expected to deepen, with initiatives such as inviting 300 young Serbians to China for study and exchange programs over the next three years.\n\nPresident Vucic expressed gratitude and respect for China, noting the significant socio-economic impacts of Chinese investments, such as the revitalisation of the HBIS Smederevo steel plant. He reaffirmed Serbia's support for China on critical issues, including Taiwan, emphasising that there is but one China in the world.\n\nBoth leaders stressed the importance of opposing hegemonism and power politics, upholding the principles of the UN Charter, and promoting international fairness and justice. They envision their strengthened partnership as a model of multilateralism and cooperation in addressing global challenges.\n\nThe talks in Belgrade concluded with the signing of the Joint Statement on Deepening and Elevating the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and Building a China-Serbia Community with a Shared Future in the New Era. This agreement paves the way for a future where both nations work closely to further their cooperation in various fields, including infrastructure, energy, innovation, and cultural exchanges.\n\nUpon his arrival to Hungary, Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, were greeted by Hungarian President Tamas Sulyok with full military honours. The Chinese flags adorned Budapest, reflecting the warm reception and the high importance placed on this visit by the Hungarian government. Later, Xi attended a state dinner hosted by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a key proponent of strengthening ties with Eastern powers including China and Russia.\n\nThis year marks the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Hungary, a milestone that underscores the depth and durability of their partnership. Over the decades, Hungary has become a crucial hub for Chinese investments. China has made significant investments in Hungary across various sectors, notably in the automotive industry, particularly in electric vehicle (EV) and battery manufacturing. This aligns with Hungary's aim to position itself as a global hub for EV manufacturing. China's contributions are visible in the establishment of several new businesses throughout Hungary since 2022, enhancing local infrastructure, technology, and employment.\n\nBesides the automotive sector, Chinese investments in Hungary extend to other important areas like rail and road infrastructure, nuclear energy, and logistics, which support Hungary's economic development and integration into global markets. The collaboration between the two nations also includes educational and research initiatives, aiming to foster innovation and technology transfer.\n\nThis influx of Chinese investment plays a critical role in Hungary's strategic goal of becoming a regional economic and logistical hub, balancing relations with both Eastern and Western markets.\n\nDuring his visit, Xi Jinping is set to engage in comprehensive talks with Orban, with expectations to sign at least 16 different agreements. These agreements aim to enhance cooperation across various domains, including rail and road infrastructure, nuclear energy, and the automotive industry, which are pivotal to Hungary's development strategy and economic interests.\n\nHungary's approach to foreign policy, particularly under Orban's leadership, has often put it at odds with Brussels, especially concerning issues like the proxy war in Ukraine and economic policies of the European Union. Orban's eastward-looking strategy, favouring closer ties with non-Western countries, provides a strategic advantage both for Hungary and for China to strengthen its foothold in Europe amidst broader geopolitical tensions.\n\nXi's visit also carries a broader message to the European Union. Amidst his engagements, including the initial leg of his tour in France where tensions were more palpable, Hungary represents a more congenial environment for China's diplomatic overtures. \"Together, we have set a fine example of building a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation,\" Xi said.\n\nPolitical analysts suggest that Hungary's welcoming stance serves as a model of the partnership China seeks to cultivate with European nations, especially those that might feel alienated within the EU framework.\n\nOn the streets of Budapest, public opinion is in favour of Hungary's independent foreign policy which puts the interests of the country first. Most citizens recognise the economic opportunities presented by Chinese investments, suggesting that similar investments would likely be welcomed across Europe despite geopolitical reservations.\n\nXi Jinping's visit to Serbia and Hungary not only reaffirms the strong bilateral relations but also illustrates China's strategic approach to cultivating alliances within Europe. By aligning with Hungary, China demonstrates its readiness to support and invest in European nations that share similar views on sovereignty and development, while potentially influencing broader EU dynamics. As Xi's tour concludes, the impact of these strengthened ties will likely resonate within the regional and global contexts, shaping future diplomatic, economic, and environmental dialogues across continents.\n\nHT", "source": {"uri": "helsinkitimes.fi", "dataType": "news", "title": "Helsinki Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Serbia",

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic welcomed visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping in Belgrade in a ceremony broadcast by the Tanjug news agency.\n\nThe plane carrying the Chinese leader touched down around 9:35 p.m. local time (7:35 p.m. GMT) at Belgrade Airport, where Xi got a red carpet welcome from Vucic, Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic.\n\nThe welcome reception of the Chinese delegation, led by Xi, is scheduled for May 8 in Belgrade. The ceremony on the occasion of the visit of the 400-strong Chinese delegation will take place at Palata Srbije (Palace of Serbia). A festive dinner will also be organized, at which the Chinese President will taste traditional Serbian dishes and wines, as well as enjoy a musical program in Serbian and Chinese.\n\nEarlier, the first plane carrying members of the Chinese delegation, ministers and representatives of various institutions, landed in Belgrade within the framework of Xi's two-day visit to Serbia.\n\nThe Chinese leader will be in Serbia on May 7-8 for a state visit, which, as the Chinese Foreign Ministry pointed out earlier, will be an important milestone for improving and revitalizing Chinese-Serbian relations. The presidents are expected to discuss the international and regional situation, ways to get bilateral relations to a higher level, as well as will chart a course for the development of bilateral ties.\n\nXi began his visit on the day marking the anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade by NATO aircraft. Ahead of the visit, the Chinese leader pointed out in an article for Politika that China would not forget the attack on the diplomatic mission in 1999, which killed three Chinese journalists.\n\nThe Chinese leader arrived in Belgrade from the city of Tarbes in southwestern France, where he was on a three-day state visit.\n\nEarlier, Serbian media reported that about 3,400 police officers would ensure the safety of the Chinese leader.

(HBIS Serbia/Handout via Xinhua)\n\nBELGRADE/BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Situated by the scenic Danube River, the Smederevo Steelworks had long been hailed as the pride of Serbia before it slid to bankruptcy more than two decades ago.\n\nThanks to the deepening of the high-quality Belt and Road cooperation between China and Serbia, the century-old factory made a remarkable comeback in 2016 when its Chinese partner arrived.\n\nIn just a couple of months, the steel mill started turning a profit. It has now become one of the world's largest iron and steel makers and integrated service providers measured by production capacity.\n\nThe rebirth of the steel mill stands as a key epitome of the broader practical cooperation between the two countries.\n\nAs Chinese President Xi Jinping is about to pay his second state visit to the European country, expectations are running high that the ironclad friendship between the two nations will be further enriched and strengthened.\n\nMany big Chinese investment projects here were brought about by President Xi, former Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic said. \"He is a sincere friend of Serbia.\"\n\nDuring his first state visit to Serbia in 2016, Xi offered a strong helping hand to the Smederevo Steelworks, ushering in a wave of Chinese support.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping (C), accompanied by then Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic and then Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic, talks with workers at the dining hall of a steel mill in Smederevo, Serbia, June 19, 2016. (Xinhua/Ma Zhancheng)\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic clearly remembers how he, then as prime minister, approached Xi during the latter's visit with the idea of saving the struggling company. Xi assured him with a famous Chinese saying that \"promises must be kept, and actions must be resultful.\"\n\n\"What we pledge to do, such as introducing cutting-edge technology, ensuring local employment, and benefiting the wider community, must be achieved without fail,\" Xi told the workers when visiting the factory.\n\nVladan Mihailovic, executive director for production at the steelworks, described Xi's visit as a turning point. With Xi's support, China offered sustained assistance to Serbia to revive the factory.\n\n\"The president's commitments, especially regarding the modernization of production facilities, have become a reality,\" said Mihailovic.\n\nAbout 60 km away to the northwest of the steelworks nestles the Belgrade Centre railway station, the starting point of another Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation project Xi cares about -- the Belgrade-Novi Sad high-speed railway.\n\nAs a segment of the Serbia-Hungary railway, it began operations in March 2022 and has since been shuttling passengers between Serbia's two largest cities at speeds of up to 200 km per hour. Vucic dubbed it \"a gift for future generations.\"\n\nThe flourishing cooperation between Beijing and Belgrade within the framework of the BRI epitomizes the growing synergy between development strategies of the two countries, which has significantly bolstered bilateral economic and trade relations.\n\nAccording to Chinese customs statistics, the total trade volume between China and Serbia in 2023 reached 4.35 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 23.7 percent compared to the previous year.\n\nIn October last year, witnessed by Xi and Vucic, China and Serbia signed a free trade agreement in Beijing, the first one inked between China and a Central and Eastern European country. After the deal takes effect, more than 60 percent of taxable items will become tariff-free immediately, and the final import volume proportion of both sides with zero-tariff items will reach about 95 percent.\n\n\"China is one of the most important partners for Serbia's economic development,\" said Nenad Stekic, a research fellow with the Institute of International Politics and Economics, a Serbian think tank.\n\n\"Since we elevated our relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2016, the relationship has been really going on an upward trajectory across the board,\" he

We have enormous respect for China,\" Vucic said at a press conference with Xi.\n\nThe joint statement is a strategically important direction for development of bilateral relations, as well as for our view of the world, Vucic said.\n\nHe noted that Serbia supported the One China principle and that, for Serbia, any questions asked about Taiwan, Xinjiang or Hong Kong were internal affairs of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"It is a question for the People's Republic of China.

Our exports to China have risen by 140 times in the past ten years. Our goods trade, direct trade between our countries, rose by as much as eight times in the past ten years.

He said the Chinese side is willing to work with Serbia to continue to stand together through thick and thin, share a common future, and uphold the spirit of the two countries' ironclad friendship.\n\nChina is also ready to join Serbia to maintain and develop the amity of the two countries, jointly safeguard the fundamental and long-term interests of both sides, pursue development and rejuvenation of their own country, and jointly advance the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, he said.\n\nXi stressed that Serbia is China's first comprehensive strategic partner in Central and Eastern Europe. Cooperation between the two sides has injected strong impetus into the two countries' respective development and revitalization, delivering tangible benefits to the two peoples, he said.\n\nUnder the new circumstances, Serbia has become the first European country to build a community with a shared future with China, which fully demonstrates the strategic, special and high-level nature of the bilateral relationship, he said.\n\nThe building of the China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era is an elevation of the two countries' ironclad friendship, and it also represents the shared values and goals of both sides, namely, seeking common development, achieving win-win cooperation and pursuing common progress, which is the shared vision of both countries and nations worldwide that uphold independence and strive for peace and development, Xi said.\n\nXi said that the two sides should deepen and expand high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and the cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries by building a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, thereby advancing the modernization of their respective nation.\n\nHe called on both sides to underscore the strategic significance of the bilateral ties, and grasp the overarching direction of the relationship. China supports Serbia in upholding independence and pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions, and also supports Serbia's efforts to safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Xi said.\n\nThe two sides should continue to firmly support each other, deepen strategic cooperation, and safeguard their respective political security and fundamental interests, he added.\n\nXi also urged the two countries to adhere to the practical nature of bilateral cooperation and bring benefits to the two peoples. High-quality Belt and Road cooperation between the two countries has yielded fruitful results, Xi noted.\n\nBoth sides, Xi said, should steadily promote cooperation in traditional areas like transportation and energy infrastructure, such as ensuring the timely completion of the entire Belgrade-Budapest railway project, jointly managing major cooperation projects, and creating more \"small yet smart\" projects for public well-being, so as to continue to deliver positive economic and social benefits.\n\nThe China-Serbia Free Trade Agreement will come into effect on July 1 this year, Xi noted, saying that the high-level mutual opening-up between China and Serbia will surely enter a new stage.\n\nChina will continue to import more high-quality agricultural products with Serbian features, and is ready to invite 300 young Serbian people to China for study and exchange in the next three years, he said.\n\nSerbia is welcome to deepen cultural and people-to-people exchanges in an all-round way, he added.\n\nThe Chinese leader called on Beijing and Belgrade to carry forward the innovative nature of bilateral relations, open up new prospects for cooperation, and make innovative cooperation a new growth point of bilateral ties.\n\nIn the next three years, Xi said, China will support 50 young Serbian scientists to carry out research exchange visits to China, and is willing to strengthen cooperation with Serbia in artificial intelligence (AI) to promote the rational development and application of AI for humanity.\n\nXi called on the two countries to jointly oppose hegemonism and power politics, as well as bloc politics and camp confrontation, uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, practice genuine multilateralism, and promote international fairness and justice.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Yet on the ground in Serbia, one of the three countries Xi is visiting, the focus is more on potential economic benefits from ties with China, such as infrastructure and business investment, areas that are welcomed by local politicians and citizens alike, Forbes Serbia Editor Ivan Radak said in an interview.\n\n\"It's easier\" for Serb leaders to announce new infrastructures projects with China that get built in a relatively short period of time than engage in drawn-out discussions with bureaucratic European institutions, Radak said by phone from Belgrade.\n\n\"From the point of view of ordinary people, it's better to develop something with Chinese. For them, of course, it's better to have a highway and not to have it, and so they welcome this,\" he said. China investment, which has been undertaken by both state-owned and private sector companies, is also welcomed for boosting manufacturing and creating jobs, Radak said.\n\nChina, the world's second-largest nation with a population of 1.4 billion, has searched the world for growth and influence following its explosive growth in recent decades, and capital inflows into landlocked Serbia have turned the Asia economic powerhouse into one of the country's largest foreign investors.\n\nThe contrasting heft of China and Serbia is striking: Serbia's population of nearly seven million is less than a third of the city of Shanghai alone; Serbia's per capital income is less than half of Shanghai's. Both have notably sought to keep up ties to Russia during the latter's invasion of the Ukraine.\n\nXi visited the country on Wednesday as part of a European trip that is taking him to France and Hungary. The Chinese leader met with Serbian President Aleksander Vucic, who said, \"We are writing history today.\" The two countries signed 29 agreements this week in Belgrade, media reported. Xi also used the visit to call attention to the 25 anniversary of the U.S. bombing of China's embassy in the Balkan city in 1999. The U.S. has said it was a mistake and apologized.\n\nOver the subsequent quarter century, once economically lagging China's investment in Serbia has \"reached the level of the combined investment of all 27 European Union member states, solidifying the multifaceted nature\" of the Serb-China relationship, according to a report by CHOICE, a China research group run by Prague-based think tank Association for International Affairs.\n\nProminent Chinese investors include HBIS Group, which took over a struggling steel operation once owned by U.S. Steel and today employs 5,000, and units of Zijin Mining, one of China's largest mining companies. Zijin Mining agreed to invest $1.26 billion in a copper mining complex in Bor in 2018, in exchange for a 63% stake, according to Reuters. It later opened a Cukaru Peki copper and gold mine in 2021, the news agency reported. Minth, a Chinese auto parts maker controlled by Chinese billionaire Chin Jong Hwa, has invested more than $100 million in Serbia. The Serbian welcome for Chinese infrastructure projects contrasts with criticism elsewhere that that Chinese construction under its \"One Belt, One Road\" program unfairly burdens recipients with debt.\n\nChina-Serb trade is poised to grow further with following a China-Serbia Free Trade Agreement set to take effect on July 1. Trade between China and Serbia is still in China's favor, but Serbia's exports currently account for about 20% compared with an earlier low only 3%, noted Radak, a former reporter at daily newspapers Danas and Blic who has more than two decades of experience in economic journalism and communications. He also worked for the non-governmental organization NALED, which focuses on improving Serbia's business environment.\n\nOpinion varies in Serbia whether the agreement is a good idea, Radak said. \"Some say Chinese companies will benefit more than Serbian companies because we are too small when it comes to production volumes and too far from China\" to seize opportunities in China, he said, adding that Serb exports to China are largely commodities and goods from Chinese-owned factories. \"A lack of information about China's market\" also holds Serbian businesses back, Radak believes.\n\nForbes Serbia is one of more than 40 overseas editions of Forbes. It was launched under a licensing agreement between Forbes Media and United Media in 2023.\n\nSee related posts:\n\nNew Pew Survey Underscores Negative U.S. Views Of China Amid Strains", "source":

Following talks with Xi, Vucic praised what he called the Chinese leader's teachings and took pride in saying he had invited him to visit more times than any other world leader.\n\nSerbia has been a haven of pro-Chinese sentiment at a time when Beijing is facing headwinds in Europe, including criticism of its support for Russia following the invasion of Ukraine and trade practices that have undermined Europe's critical industries. Hungary, where the Chinese leader arrived late Wednesday, is poised to outdo Serbia's fanfare as both vie for Chinese investments to boost their modest economies.\n\nXi arrived in Serbia on the symbolically important 25th anniversary of bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, during the Atlantic bloc's 2\u00bd-month bombing campaign on Serbia. The midnight bombing of the embassy, which Washington at the time said was a mistake, killed three Chinese citizens and sparked riots in Beijing. Since then, Beijing has held out the strike to criticize the alliance, using it as Exhibit A to imply that NATO is responsible for provoking Russia into a war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Chinese-Serbian friendship has been forged through our extraordinary fight together to promote world peace and development and forged with the blood and lives of our two people,\" Xi said at a signing ceremony for bilateral agreements that spanned cultural and scientific exchanges as well as a free-trade agreement on some agricultural goods.\n\nXi didn't make a publicized visit to the embassy, unlike the last time he was in Serbia when he laid a wreath at the compound. In a letter in Serbian newspaper Politika, he condemned the \"flagrant\" strike, writing, \"the Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\"\n\nVucic called tensions between Taiwan and China an internal issue, reiterating his support for Beijing's One China policy, which holds that Taiwan is part of China. The Serbian leader sought to draw parallels with Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008 but is still claimed by Serbia.\n\nXi's stop in Serbia comes after a two-day visit in France, where the Chinese leader and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed Ukraine and trade. The two also jointly expressed support for the idea of a truce during the Summer Olympics, which will be held in Paris this year.\n\nIn Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban is expected to showcase his efforts to attract Chinese investment despite Washington's efforts to curb Beijing's ties more broadly in Europe.\n\nOrban was the first European Union leader to sign a Belt and Road contract with China, and the scope of the relationship has ballooned in recent years with more than $16 billion dollars of continuing investment projects in Hungary.\n\nChina-based Contemporary Amperex Technology is building a $7.8 billion electric-vehicle battery plant in Hungary. BYD, China's top-selling electric-vehicle maker, is likewise building a manufacturing plant in Hungary's southern city of Szeged. China watchers say another plant may be on the table for Xi's visit on Thursday and Friday.\n\nOrban has given China a place inside the central European automotive-supply chain while throwing his weight behind Beijing-led construction on a rail link meant to connect Hungary and the Serbian capital, Belgrade, easing the transport of goods to the heart of Europe.\n\n\"Orban is putting his bets on China, it has been very clear that the government wants to turn the country into a logistical hub,\" said Tamas Matura, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. \"They also believe in manufacturing, industry and the re-industrialization of the country, which the Chinese are only too happy to help with.\"", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The two leaders decided to deepen and elevate the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Serbia, and build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era. For the two countries and peoples, this is a significant event. Over the past few decades, the two countries have understood, trusted, supported, and helped each other in times of adversity, becoming true friends and close brothers. The upgrading of the two countries' political relationship has come naturally, opening a new chapter in history.\n\nPresident Xi visited Serbia again after eight years, receiving a grand and warm welcome. The national flags of China and Serbia flew along the highway from Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport all the way to the city center of Belgrade. Banners showing \"Welcome President Xi\" and \"Warm welcome to endeared Chinese friends\" were prominently displayed. Thousands of Serbian people shouted \"China\" and \"Serbia\" in front of the Palace of Serbia, showing their genuine emotions, which deeply touched and moved the Chinese society.\n\nChina and Serbia enjoy \"ironclad friendship,\" which is extraordinary in the ever-changing international relations. The two countries and their peoples always extend a helping hand without hesitation when the other is in need, and this true friendship of mutual assistance cannot be eroded by time. The fundamental reason lies in the mutual respect, equal treatment, and high mutual trust between the two countries.\n\nThe interaction between China and Serbia is phenomenal and should be a subject of research in international relations. Despite the vast distance, different social systems, and diverse cultural backgrounds, China and Serbia are able to resonate and reach consensus on international affairs, national development, and national sentiments. They have formed a close interdependence on the basis of independence, which is a breath of fresh air in the current international community, setting an example for state-to-state relations.\n\nObserving the relationship between China and Serbia, two characteristics can be discerned. First, the interactions and cooperation between the two countries serve the well-being of both nations and their peoples. China and Serbia firmly support each other's core interests and major concerns. China supports Serbia's efforts to uphold national sovereignty and territorial integrity, opposing any interference in Serbia's internal affairs by external forces. Serbia steadfastly adheres to the one-China principle and supports China in safeguarding its own sovereignty and territorial integrity. On the core issue of safeguarding national unity and opposing territorial separatism, the two countries share a high degree of consensus.\n\nMeanwhile, cooperation between the two countries is deeply rooted at the grassroots level. Within just a few months of investment by a Chinese company, the Smederevo Steel Plant has turned losses into profits, ensuring job security for over 5,000 employees and now standing as Serbia's third-largest exporting enterprise. The municipal sewage treatment project \"Clean Serbia,\" undertaken by China Road and Bridge Corporation, will benefit 2.3 million Serbian citizens. As a key project under the framework of China's cooperation with Central and Eastern European countries in building the Belt and Road Initiative, the Belgrade-Novi Sad section of the Hungary-Serbia Railway in Serbia is bringing about \"revolutionary changes\" in Serbia's transportation sector. For the people of both countries, the cooperation is not empty talk but tangible win-win outcomes.\n\nSecond, China-Serbia cooperation, whether for the region or the globe, is a positive force. As ironclad friends and upholders of world peace, the two countries share similar positions on many significant international and regional issues. In international organizations such as the United Nations and various major multilateral events, they cooperate closely, jointly advocating for a fair and orderly multipolar world, and inclusive and equitable economic globalization. They practice genuine multilateralism. Confronted with the complex and tumultuous international landscape, both nations join hands to oppose hegemonism and power politics, striving to safeguard global peace, stability, and international fairness and justice.\n\nWhat sustains the development of relations between China and Serbia is a high degree of political mutual trust. They listen to each other's concerns, respect and support each other's development paths and national rejuvenation. It is on this foundation that mutual trust can continue to accumulate, mutual understanding can be cultivated, and the space and willingness for cooperation can grow. From politics, economics, to culture and society, the abundant fruits of China-Serbia exchanges are rooted in the political mutual trust.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping announced six measures to support the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future, as he jointly met the press with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Wednesday. This signifies the comprehensive expansion of the long-standing friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Serbia. A Chinese axiom goes, \"Friends are those who are like-minded\"; and Serbians would say, \"Friends are the greatest asset in life.\" Under the strategic guidance of the two countries' leaders, the ironclad friendship between China and Serbia will continue to flourish, benefiting the peoples of both nations, promoting world peace and development, and jointly advancing the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.", "source": {"uri": "taiwannews.com.tw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taiwan News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Responding to their previous letter, Xi encouraged them to make new contributions to the China-Serbia friendship.\n\nThirty Serbian workers from the steel plant wrote a letter to Xi, explaining recent developments at the plant and expressing their gratitude for his support in the rebirth of the iconic factory.\n\nEstablished in 1913 in the city of Smederevo, the steel plant was once hailed as \"the pride of Serbia.\" Since the late 1990s, however, the plant was on the verge of closure until Chinese investment arrived in 2016. In the same year, Xi visited the plant and met with its workers.\n\nThanks to China's advanced technology and management systems, the plant became profitable and has now become one of the three biggest exporters in Serbia.\n\nAn ironclad friendship\n\nXi arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday to pay his second state visit to Serbia, and expectations are running high that the ironclad friendship between the two nations will be further enriched and strengthened.\n\nIn a signed article published on Tuesday on Serbia's media, Xi said China and Serbia remain true friends and good partners, regardless of changes in the international landscape.\n\n\"Our ironclad friendship is ever-growing, setting a model for state-to-state and people-to-people interactions,\" Xi said in the article.\n\nXi noted in the article that the two countries should promote multidimensional people-to-people and cultural exchanges and diversify sub-national cooperation.\n\n\"We should make good use of the combined effect of 'mutual visa exemption plus direct flights,' as well as our respective cultural centers, to promote cooperation in education, sports, culture and tourism,\" Xi said, adding that more opportunities for the youth should be created so that the China-Serbia friendship can be carried forward from generation to generation.\n\nMomentum of cooperation\n\nSerbia is China's first free trade partner in Central and Eastern Europe. In 2023, China became Serbia's largest source of foreign investment and its second-largest trading partner. Serbian honey, red wine, beef, lamb and other agricultural products have grown popular among Chinese consumers.\n\n\"Our thriving cooperation in trade and economic relations, industrial chain and infrastructure development lends a great boost to our respective process of modernization,\" Xi said in the article.\n\nThe Chinese president said the two countries should further unleash the potential of mutually beneficial cooperation, deliver on the mid-term action plan for cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, and build more flagship projects.\n\n\"We should expand cooperation in technological innovation, advanced manufacturing, green energy, digital economy, artificial intelligence and other emerging areas,\" he said.\n\nIn a written speech upon his arrival in the Serbian capital of Belgrade, Xi said he looks forward to having an in-depth exchange of views with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on the bilateral relationship and other issues of mutual interest.\n\n\"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations,\" Xi said in the speech.", "source": {"uri": "aap.com.au",

It has now become one of the world's largest iron and steel makers and integrated service providers measured by production capacity.\n\nThe rebirth of the steel mill stands as a key epitome of the broader practical cooperation between the two countries.\n\nAs Chinese President Xi Jinping is about to pay his second state visit to the European country, expectations are running high that the ironclad friendship between the two nations will be further enriched and strengthened.\n\nMany big Chinese investment projects here were brought about by President Xi, former Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic said. \"He is a sincere friend of Serbia.\"\n\nDuring his first state visit to Serbia in 2016, Xi offered a strong helping hand to the Smederevo Steelworks, ushering in a wave of Chinese support.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic clearly remembers how he, then as prime minister, approached Xi during the latter's visit with the idea of saving the struggling company. Xi assured him with a famous Chinese saying that \"promises must be kept, and actions must be resultful.\"\n\n\"What we pledge to do, such as introducing cutting-edge technology, ensuring local employment, and benefiting the wider community, must be achieved without fail,\" Xi told the workers when visiting the factory.\n\nVladan Mihailovic, executive director for production at the steelworks, described Xi's visit as a turning point. With Xi's support, China offered sustained assistance to Serbia to revive the factory.\n\n\"The president's commitments, especially regarding the modernization of production facilities, have become a reality,\" said Mihailovic.\n\nAbout 60 km away to the northwest of the steelworks nestles the Belgrade Centre railway station, the starting point of another Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation project Xi cares about -- the Belgrade-Novi Sad high-speed railway.\n\nAs a segment of the Serbia-Hungary railway, it began operations in March 2022 and has since been shuttling passengers between Serbia's two largest cities at speeds of up to 200 km per hour. Vucic dubbed it \"a gift for future generations.\"\n\nThe flourishing cooperation between Beijing and Belgrade within the framework of the BRI epitomizes the growing synergy between development strategies of the two countries, which has significantly bolstered bilateral economic and trade relations.\n\nAccording to Chinese customs statistics, the total trade volume between China and Serbia in 2023 reached 4.35 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 23.7 percent compared to the previous year.\n\nIn October last year, witnessed by Xi and Vucic, China and Serbia signed a free trade agreement in Beijing, the first one inked between China and a Central and Eastern European country. After the deal takes effect, more than 60 percent of taxable items will become tariff-free immediately, and the final import volume proportion of both sides with zero-tariff items will reach about 95 percent.\n\n\"China is one of the most important partners for Serbia's economic development,\" said Nenad Stekic, a research fellow with the Institute of International Politics and Economics, a Serbian think tank.", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "President of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_mill", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steel mill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_visit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State visit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smederevo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smederevo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Smederevo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belt and Road Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomislav_Nikoli\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tomislav Nikoli\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free trade agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High-speed rail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_and_Eastern_Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central and Eastern Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 18, "textEnd": 23}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Politika is 50 per cent state owned.\n\nThe Serbian President's media advisor Suzana Vasiljevic and Shen Haixiong signed a memorandum of understanding between the President's media office and China Media Group.\n\nAdditionally, the director general of the privatized news agency Tanjug Manja Grcic and the director of Xinhua news agency Fu Hua signed an agreement on exchange of news and cooperation.\n\nChina Media Group is a media conglomerate established in 2018, by merging China Central Television, China National Radio and China Radio International.\n\nAccording to Reporters Without Borders, major Chinese media groups, including Xinhua News Agency, China Central Television and China National Radio are \"state-owned and directly controlled by the authorities\" while Radio China International is among those that \"spread the regime's propaganda all around the world\".\n\nXi Jinping's visit saw around 30 different deals, protocols or memorandums of understanding reached in various areas from infrastructure, trade and agriculture to education. Serbia and China also signed a contract about extradition.\n\nThe two presidents signed a joint statement \"on deepening and raising the comprehensive strategic partnership and building the community of Serbia and China with a common future in the new era\".\n\nXi Jinping said this community will \"open a new chapter in the history of Sino-Serbian relations\".\n\n\"Eight years ago Serbia became China's first comprehensive strategic partner in Central and Eastern Europe, today Serbia is becoming the first European country where we will build a community with a common future. This speaks volumes about the strategic special relations that are at an extremely high level between our two countries.\" Xi Jinping told the media in Belgrade after signing the statement.\n\nXi Jinping, who already visited France on his European tour, will also visit Hungary on Thursday, where it is expected at least 16 deals will be signed. According to Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 the two countries would start a co-operation programme \"encompassing the entire portfolio of nuclear energy\".\n\nIn the latest joint activity with China, in January Serbia and China established an Association for Promotion of the Economy, Trade, Culture and Tourism. Then Serbian Culture Minister Maja Gojkovic said at the opening ceremony that Serbia is committed to global development initiatives started by China.\n\nPrior to this, as a huge step forward in cooperation, in October 2023, at the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, in Beijing, the two countries signed a free trade deal. President Aleksandar Vucic announced the deal should be in force by July.\n\nChina's Belt and Road Initiative has had a large impact in the Balkans. An analysis by BIRN in 2021 said at least 61 projects in Serbia had been, or were being implemented by, or in cooperation with, Chinese entities over a decade, worth at least 18.7 billion euros.\n\nIn Serbia these projects, in infrastructure, culture but also privatization, have been criticised for a lack of transparency and there have been allegations about corruption, workers rights abuse and neglect of environmental protection.\n\nAccording to BIRN's estimate, at the end of 2021, 135 projects worth at least 32 billion euros in the Balkan region were linked to China in some way.\n\nBeside all of this, there is a cooperation between two countries on the weapons trade. In April 2022, during a public military drill, Serbia showed off the newly delivered Chinese air defence system HQ-22 (FK-3).", "source": {"uri": "balkaninsight.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The incident occurred during Operation Allied Force, which was triggered by the Racak massacre during the Kosovo War, ultimately seeing the withdrawal of the Yugoslav Army and an end to the conflict.\n\nHowever, the incident, which the US claimed was an accident, \"is one of the elements on which the Chinese have based their anti-Western narrative over the last 25 years,\" Stefan Vladisavljev, an analyst at the Belgrade Fund for Political Excellence (BFPE), told Euractiv.\n\nHe added, \"Visiting Belgrade on this occasion is a way for President Xi to affirm the ties that unite China and Serbia, but above all, Beijing's new role in the world order.\"\n\nBeijing has become Belgrade's second-largest trading partner, and by 2021, Chinese imports into Serbia were worth \u20ac3.6 billion (up 26.9% in 2020), even though the EU still accounts for 60% of the country's trade.\n\nChinese investments are concentrated in strategic sectors such as the automotive industry, the copper and gold mines in the Bor region, bought by the Chinese giant Zijin Mining Group in 2018, and the Smederevo steelworks, which came under the control of the Chinese group HBIS in 2016 for \u20ac46 million.\n\nNew contracts will likely be announced during Xi's visit to Serbia concerning the construction of the Belgrade metro and the 2027 international exhibition in the Serbian capital.\n\nVu\u010di\u0107 had already signed a free trade agreement with his Chinese counterpart last year -due to enter force on 1 July and to expire when Serbia joins the EU one day - covering thousands of products from both countries, including Serbian honey and wine.\n\nIn 2009, Belgrade had already signed a framework agreement with Beijing on infrastructure, exempting Chinese companies from going through restrictive calls for tender to bid for public contracts.\n\nThis provision has been denounced by Serbian civil society, which points to the opacity of the contracts signed by the Chinese - often financed by loans granted by banks that are also Chinese - and repeated attacks on the environment, for example, during the expansion of the Drmno lignite mine, which supplies the Kostolac power station near the Danube.\n\nAs Russia's war in Ukraine continues and Moscow's influence is felt throughout the continent, many fear what impact that could have on regions with a history of instability, such as the Western Balkans.\n\nIn late 2023, the EU announced the \u20ac6 billion Growth Plan for the Western Balkans to link funds to reforms and boost the regions ties to the European single market.\n\nHowever, public opinion in Serbia remains unconvinced, with only 33% of recent survey respondents saying they favour EU membership, the lowest percentage in a region where countries like Kosovo and Albania enjoy over 90% approval rates.\n\nWhile Serbia is a candidate for EU membership there has been little progress and earlier this year, the European Commission made changes to Serbia's negotiation conditions, insisting that it stop obstructing Kosovo's efforts to join international organisations including the Council of Europe and the EU.\n\nIn December 2023, then-prime minister Ana Brnabic wrote a letter to the Commission stating that the country would not implement several of the agreements made under the EU-backed dialogue.\n\nBelgrade has also refused to align itself with the EU's foreign policy regarding Russia and has strengthened economic and diplomatic ties with a series of high-level visits and agreements.\n\nA 2023 survey by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy found that 42% of Serbians believe they should rely on Russia, with almost 8% (third position) believing they should rely on China regarding international relations. Only some 25% had faith in the EU.\n\nAnother recent survey, found that over 75% of Serbs consider China \"friendly\", and 64% believe that relations between Serbia and China will improve.\n\nThese figures have been rising steadily since the COVID-19 pandemic, when the EU failed to provide fast and adequate support to candidate countries while Chinese planes were delivering surgical masks and gloves to Belgrade airport.\n\nBack then, street walls and placards in Serbia were covered with large signs proclaiming, \"Thank you, Brother Xi\".\n\nChinese political rhetoric emphasising the territorial integrity of states has also resonated in Serbia considering the ongoing dispute with Kosovo.\n\nIn February 2024, Vu\u010di\u0107 explained in an interview with Chinese television CGTN: \"For us, it's very simple. Taiwan is China. And it's up to you to see what, when and how you're going to do it.\"", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Twenty other people were injured in the incident, which has burdened relations between the two powers ever since.\n\nThe Western military alliance had launched the air war in March that year to force then Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a brutal onslaught against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo.\n\nThe U.S. at the time apologized and said the embassy bombing was a mistake that happened due to faulty intelligence. The intended target, Washington said, was the headquarters of a Serbian state arms exporter located on the same street, a few blocks away.\n\n\"Imagine that somebody would, even by accident, strike an American Embassy somewhere around the world. The reaction would be immediate,\" said Sven Biscop, a professor of European foreign and security policy at the Ghent University and Egmont Institute.\n\n\"So for a country like China, it is also clear that this is a big thing,\" he added. \"And, of course, it has not been forgotten.\"\n\nWorkers hang on ropes to install a giant Chinese national flag on a skyscraper that is a symbolic gateway leading into the city from the airport, in Belgrade, Serbia, Saturday, May 4, 2024.

(AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic)\n\nAngry protesters in China stormed U.S. diplomatic installations as the bombing fueled anti-American sentiments and speculation that the attack was intentional rather than accidental. Mistrust over the incident has endured to this day.\n\n\"We will probably never really conclusively know either way,\" Biscop said. \"But one thing is sure. In war, incidents like that do happen, and I usually tend to go for the most simple explanation rather than try to invent complicated theories.\"\n\nWhile straining Beijing's relations with the U.S., the embassy bombing brought China and Serbia closer together. China has emerged as Serbia\u00b4s largest provider of foreign direct investment and its second-largest trading partner after the European Union.\n\nBeijing opposed the NATO bombing campaign and has since backed Belgrade's bid to counter the Western-backed push for independence in Kosovo, a former Serbian province. In return, Serbia has been a loyal ally to Beijing and has opened its doors without restraint to billions of dollars of Chinese investment, even as it formally seeks EU membership.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible ahead of Xi's visit on Tuesday and Wednesday. In Belgrade, a huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nXi will arrive from France and proceed from Serbia to Hungary as part of his first European tour in five years.\n\nHe is expected to visit the site of the former embassy on the anniversary date and pay his respects to the bombing victims. A Chinese cultural center now stands at the spot where the embassy was once located.\n\nThe sprawling complex reportedly includes a Confucius Institute, workshops, exhibitions, offices, residential space and a hotel. It is seen as a symbol of China's growing influence in Serbia and across Europe.\n\nNear the institute, a group of visitors from China last weekend bowed in front of a simple black-marble monument and laid flowers in honor of the victims of the 1999 bombing. An inscription on the monument in both Chinese and English reads: \"Honor Martyrs, Cherish Peace.\"\n\nSylvain Plazy contributed to this report from Brussels.\n\nChinese flags fly on lampposts, days before the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in Belgrade, Serbia, Wednesday, May 1, 2024.

The incident occurred during Operation Allied Force, which was triggered by the Racak massacre during the Kosovo War, ultimately seeing the withdrawal of the Yugoslav Army and an end to the conflict.\n\nHowever, the incident, which the US claimed was an accident, \"is one of the elements on which the Chinese have based their anti-Western narrative over the last 25 years,\" Stefan Vladisavljev, an analyst at the Belgrade Fund for Political Excellence (BFPE), told Euractiv.\n\nHe added, \"Visiting Belgrade on this occasion is a way for President Xi to affirm the ties that unite China and Serbia, but above all, Beijing's new role in the world order.\"\n\nEconomic ties\n\nBeijing has become Belgrade's second-largest trading partner, and by 2021, Chinese imports into Serbia were worth \u20ac3.6 billion (up 26.9% in 2020), even though the EU still accounts for 60% of the country's trade.\n\nChinese investments are concentrated in strategic sectors such as the automotive industry, the copper and gold mines in the Bor region, bought by the Chinese giant Zijin Mining Group in 2018, and the Smederevo steelworks, which came under the control of the Chinese group HBIS in 2016 for \u20ac46 million.\n\nNew contracts will likely be announced during Xi's visit to Serbia concerning the construction of the Belgrade metro and the 2027 international exhibition in the Serbian capital.\n\nVu\u010di\u0107 had already signed a free trade agreement with his Chinese counterpart last year -due to enter force on 1 July and to expire when Serbia joins the EU one day - covering thousands of products from both countries, including Serbian honey and wine.\n\nIn 2009, Belgrade had already signed a framework agreement with Beijing on infrastructure, exempting Chinese companies from going through restrictive calls for tender to bid for public contracts.\n\nThis provision has been denounced by Serbian civil society, which points to the opacity of the contracts signed by the Chinese - often financed by loans granted by banks that are also Chinese - and repeated attacks on the environment, for example, during the expansion of the Drmno lignite mine, which supplies the Kostolac power station near the Danube.\n\nPublic opinion unconvinced by EU\n\nAs Russia's war in Ukraine continues and Moscow's influence is felt throughout the continent, many fear what impact that could have on regions with a history of instability, such as the Western Balkans.\n\nIn late 2023, the EU announced the \u20ac6 billion Growth Plan for the Western Balkans to link funds to reforms and boost the regions ties to the European single market.\n\nHowever, public opinion in Serbia remains unconvinced, with only 33% of recent survey respondents saying they favour EU membership, the lowest percentage in a region where countries like Kosovo and Albania enjoy over 90% approval rates.\n\nWhile Serbia is a candidate for EU membership there has been little progress and earlier this year, the European Commission made changes to Serbia's negotiation conditions, insisting that it stop obstructing Kosovo's efforts to join international organisations including the Council of Europe and the EU.\n\nIn December 2023, then-prime minister Ana Brnabic wrote a letter to the Commission stating that the country would not implement several of the agreements made under the EU-backed dialogue.\n\nBelgrade has also refused to align itself with the EU's foreign policy regarding Russia and has strengthened economic and diplomatic ties with a series of high-level visits and agreements. Ties with Russia, China\n\nA 2023 survey by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy found that 42% of Serbians believe they should rely on Russia, with almost 8% (third position) believing they should rely on China regarding international relations. Only some 25% had faith in the EU.\n\nAnother recent survey, found that over 75% of Serbs consider China \"friendly\", and 64% believe that relations between Serbia and China will improve.\n\nThese figures have been rising steadily since the COVID-19 pandemic, when the EU failed to provide fast and adequate support to candidate countries while Chinese planes were delivering surgical masks and gloves to Belgrade airport.\n\nBack then, street walls and placards in Serbia were covered with large signs proclaiming, \"Thank you, Brother Xi\".\n\nChinese political rhetoric emphasising the territorial integrity of states has also resonated in Serbia considering the ongoing dispute with Kosovo.\n\nIn February 2024, Vu\u010di\u0107 explained in an interview with Chinese television CGTN: \"For us, it's very simple. Taiwan is China. And it's up to you to see what, when and how you're going to do it.\"", "source": {"uri": "girodivite.it", "dataType": "news", "title": "girodivite.it"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

After all, it is not often that Serbia finds itself as part of a three-stop tour by an international leader of such stature.\n\nBut Serbia has been deepening its relationship with China in recent years, even as it continues with negotiations to join the European Union.\n\nMr Xi is likely to use his trip to highlight his criticisms of Nato. His visit coincides with the 25th anniversary of the US airstrikes on China's embassy in Belgrade. And in an editorial for the Serbian newspaper, Politika, the president made it clear that feelings over that incident still run high.\n\n\"We should never forget,\" he wrote. \"The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\"\n\nThat kind of rhetoric resonates in Serbia, where the vast majority of people oppose Nato membership. That is a key factor in why this stop on Mr Xi's European tour makes perfect sense.\n\nCommercial connections are also a factor. The two countries signed a free trade agreement last year, building on a \"comprehensive strategic partnership\" in 2016 - the year of Mr Xi's previous visit to Serbia.\n\nChina now claims to be the largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Serbia. Its ambassador, Li Ming, says that Hisense, along with mining company Zijin and tyre manufacturer Linglong, provide 20,000.\n\nUN trade figures actually put China in fifth place on the foreign direct investment list, behind Germany, Italy, the US and Russia.\n\nNonetheless, the Chinese investments are eye-catching - and only likely to increase. Serbia has just taken delivery of its first Chinese electric high-speed trains. They will eventually run alongside Swiss-made rolling stock on the Belgrade-Budapest railway, which is being reconstructed with Chinese expertise and finance.\n\nAnd that is just the start. Serbia's infrastructure minister, Goran Vesic, says Chinese partners will work on other infrastructure, including roads, bridges, tunnels and sewage. \"There is really a lot of room for co-operation with Chinese companies,\" he told Serbia's national broadcaster, RTS.\n\nNo wonder Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, is planning to personally serve the finest wines his country has to offer to his Chinese counterpart during a banquet in Mr Xi's honour.\n\nNoting that within five years Serbian wine will face no import tariffs in China, Mr Vucic told China Central Television that Serbian wines were \"not as expensive as [those] in France\" and that he believed Mr Xi was \"going to like\" his selections.\n\nThis was perhaps a gentle dig at Emmanuel Macron, who hosted Mr Xi for the first stop on his European trip. The French president's offering was a bottle of R\u00e9my Martin Louis XIII cognac, which would cost the best part of \u20ac5,000 in Belgrade.\n\nA trip to the Pyrenees was also included in the charm offensive - to sweeten pleas by Mr Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for Mr Xi to ensure more balanced trade with Europe and influence Russia's President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nAfter Belgrade, the next stop for China's president will be Budapest, where he will meet his strongest ally among the leaders of EU member states, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\n\nChinese investments are also a strong factor there - with a factory for electric car giant BYD among the projects that buttress Mr Orban's resistance to the EU consensus on everything from migration to providing arms to Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Serbia received the votes of 81 countries, 70 favored Spain, and another 3 abstained.\n\nThe World Expo is the largest international event that allows participating countries to present themselves to the world by showcasing the latest developments in technology and science, cultural achievements and new architectural masterpieces.

This we should never forget. The China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples,\" the Financial Times (FT) quoted Xi as saying.\n\nThe London daily said that the Belgrade neighborhood home to the former embassy was on Tuesday decked in Chinese and Serbian flags and that the activists of the League of Socialist Youth of Yugoslavia (SKOJ) and New Communist Party of Yugoslavia (NKPJ) on Monday hung banners outside the Chinese Cultural Center, now at this site, to welcome the Chinese president, including one suggesting similarities between Serbia and China: \"Kosovo is Serbia -- Taiwan is China,\" and one saying the street of \"Chinese victims of the NATO aggression.\"\n\nThe Chinese president ended his visit to France and is due in Serbia on Tuesday evening for a two-day visit as part of his mini European tour, during which he will also visit Hungary.\n\nOn the second day of the Chinese president's state visit, French President Emmanuel Macron and Xi headed to the Pyrenees for a private part of the visit, during which they were able to discuss more directly the war in Ukraine and trade disputes.\n\nAnalysts believe that Xi's European trip aims to exploit differences on the continent towards Russia and the US and to potentially undermine the unity of NATO and the EU on China.\n\nChinese academics have praised Macron's advocacy of a more independent European stance on the global stage, while Serbia and Hungary are seen as more pro-Russia despite the Ukraine war, reported the daily.\n\nThe Financial Times said that China is the biggest foreign investor in Serbia and accounts for 8.5 per cent of Belgrade's foreign loans, according to Branimir Jovanovic, a researcher at the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies.\n\n\"In a way this is a failure of the EU and the west in general that China is so prominent. The west leaves space that China is more than willing to step into,\" Jovanovic said.\n\nThe FT reported that the EU on Tuesday adopted a \u20ac6bn growth package for the six countries of the western Balkans, but which comes with strings attached for Serbia, including a requirement to improve relations with Kosovo, making it less attractive than Chinese funding that comes without such conditions.\n\nEU affairs expert Dusan Reljic told the FT that the EU package was \"much ado about nothing\", saying it amounted to a negligible 0.3 per cent of the region's GDP and was so complex as

Serbia does not represent such a significant market for China as the EU does. But China is very important for Serbia, and in that sense, they are developing relations, hoping for new investments,\" Sretenovic emphasizes, also noting that it is good, but caution is needed on how investments will be repaid to avoid falling into debt servitude.\n\nHe highlights that, symbolically, Xi Jinping is arriving on a tragic date, the 25th anniversary of Serbia's bombing by NATO, \"which is controversial from the perspective of international law,\" and on the tragic date when the Chinese embassy was bombed.\n\n\"These are also important signals. China is showing Serbia support both symbolically and politically, and Serbia hopes that this Chinese step will contribute to slowing down, if not stopping, the tendency of Western countries to challenge the integrity of Serbian territory and Serbian presence in its southern province of Kosovo and Metohija,\" he says.\n\nHe points out that using such strong words in international relations as \"ironclad friendship\" hides a certain policy behind them, and Serbia must be aware of that.\n\nRegarding Serbia's significance to China, Sretenovic reminds us that China's view of Serbia is tied to a global perspective China has towards Europe as a continent, not just the EU, and it involves the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\n\"China wants to project its influence, strength, and economy globally, especially to Asian, African, and European countries. In that sense, Serbia represents a small but significant link that, due to its geographical position, connects Asia, Africa, and Europe. Through Serbian territory, Chinese economic influence can flow, as China in Europe owns a very significant port it acquired, which is the Port of Piraeus in Greece,\" Sretenovic says.\n\nHe adds that Chinese investments are significant not only in Serbia but also in Hungary.\n\n\"At a time when two significant EU countries are withdrawing from the Belt and Road Initiative, I'm primarily referring to Italy's withdrawal and Poland's withdrawal, Hungary remains a significant lever for China, and its southern neighbor Serbia and Serbian southern neighbor Greece represent that wing that, according to Chinese estimates, can play a significant role in further developing Chinese investments and economic penetration,\" he explains.\n\nHe warns that for small countries, it is important that China's economic presence does not bring along too much political influence in the internal politics of these countries.\n\n\"Serbian politicians need to be wise and utilize all the benefits of the support Serbia currently has, but also be aware that Chinese investments and Chinese political influence domestically must be placed within certain legal frameworks and not exceed a level that would bring benefit to Serbia,\" he concludes.\n\nSretenovic, however, reminds us that this does not apply to China's foreign policy influence because China supports Serbia's integrity, just as Serbia supports China's integrity regarding Taiwan.\n\n\"So, a balance, a common interest has been established on the foreign policy level, which may not bring concrete benefits in the field, but at least at the level of international law, symbolism, setting some limits to the omnipotence of Western countries - it can play a role,\" Sretenovic believes.\n\nChina is a partner but also a competitor of the EU\n\nHe also notes that France needs China as a significant European country, one of the two engines of the EU (alongside Germany), and that the discussions in Paris were mostly about economic relations, where, he says, significant problems exist.\n\n\"But strategically, China needs the EU because China is the only factor that can influence Russia at the moment in terms of calming the war in Ukraine, if not stopping it,\" he explains.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, China is a partner of the EU but also a competitor who, as he says, floods the European market with goods, and intervenes with the state in its economic affairs, \"which is unacceptable from the perspective of the EU's liberal economy,\" and does not respect some EU rules on production quality, copyrights, etc.\n\nThe visit to France is also symbolic, according to Sretenovic, as it happened on the 60th anniversary of the establishment of Franco-Chinese bilateral relations in 1964, when France, after a very difficult period after the wars in Indochina and Algeria, recognized communist China.", "source": {"uri": "kosovo-online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kosovo Online"}, "authors": [],

The People's Daily, the Communist party mouthpiece, quoted him as telling Macron and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Monday that there was \"no such thing as China's overcapacity problem\" in response to western concern over the possible dumping of subsidised Chinese goods.\n\nIn a separate interview, Beijing's ambassador to Hungary extolled the country's key role in the Chinese infrastructure scheme, the Belt and Road Initiative, in Europe, acting as a rail distribution hub for freight from China.\n\nHe also touted a high-speed railway between Belgrade and Budapest built with Chinese companies.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And there is no need to let a historical event dominate the current China-Serbia relations and China-EU relations,\u201d he said.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South

Such friendship is characterized by profound historical roots, solid political foundation, extensive common interests and strong popular support.\n\n-- Over the past few years, under the leadership of Xi and Vucic, the bilateral relationship has leapfrogged with historic progress, and since the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2016, in particular, the bilateral relationship has been enriched in substance and expanded in scope, which has become an example for China's friendly relations with other European countries.\n\n-- Actions speak louder than words. China will stand shoulder to shoulder with Serbia, share weal and woe like passengers in the same boat, carry forward the spirit of the ironclad friendship, maintain and grow their friendship, and jointly safeguard fundamental and long-term interests of the two countries.\n\n-- As the two sides pursue their respective national development and revitalization, China will join hands with Serbia to advance the building of a community with a shared future in the new era.\n\n-- Serbia is China's first comprehensive strategic partner in Central and Eastern Europe. Their bilateral cooperation has injected strong impetus into their respective development and rejuvenation, and brought tangible benefits to the two peoples.\n\n-- Under the new circumstances, Serbia has become the first European country to build with China a community with a shared future, which speaks volumes about the strategic, special and high-level China-Serbia relations.\n\n-- The China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era is an upgrade of the ironclad friendship between China and Serbia. It also represents their common values and objectives, namely, joint pursuit of development, win-win cooperation and mutual success. These are the common aspirations of China, Serbia, and all countries that are committed to independence, peace and development.\n\nON COOPERATION AND PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE EXCHANGES\n\n-- Standing at a new historical starting point, China will work with Serbia to jointly stay committed to the original aspiration and forge ahead together to open up a new vista in China-Serbia cooperation with stronger momentum, greater scope, and higher quality.\n\n-- By building a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, the two sides should keep deepening and expanding high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and collaboration between China and Central and Eastern European countries, thus contributing to their respective modernization.\n\n-- High-quality Belt and Road cooperation between China and Serbia has achieved remarkable results. The two sides should steadily advance cooperation in traditional areas such as transportation and energy infrastructure, make sure the entire Serbian section of the Belgrade-Budapest railway go into operation as scheduled, jointly operate well their major cooperation projects, create more small and beautiful livelihood projects, and continue to generate positive economic and social impacts.\n\n-- China supports Serbia in upholding independence and pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions, and supports its efforts in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The two sides should continue to offer each other firm support, deepen strategic cooperation, and safeguard their respective political security and fundamental interests.\n\n-- It is important for China and Serbia to jointly reject hegemonism and power politics, and oppose bloc politics or bloc confrontation. The two sides should join hands to uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, practice true multilateralism, and promote international fairness and justice.\n\n-- With the China-Serbia Free Trade Agreement set to take effect on July 1 this year, the high-standard mutual opening up between China and Serbia will surely enter a new stage.\n\n-- China will continue to import more high-quality agricultural specialties from Serbia.\n\n-- China supports Serbia in hosting Expo 2027, and will send a delegation to participate in the grand show. China encourages its enterprises to take part in the construction of relevant projects.\n\n-- China will support 50 young Serbian scientists in taking part in scientific research exchanges in China in the next three years. It is ready to work with Serbia to strengthen cooperation on artificial intelligence (AI) and endeavor to ensure humanity properly develop and utilize AI.\n\n-- China will invite 300 young Serbians to China on study and exchange programs in the next three years.\n\n-- China welcomes the opening of direct flights from Belgrade to Shanghai by the Serbian side so as to comprehensively deepen people-to-people exchanges, and encourages airlines from both sides to launch direct flights between Belgrade and Guangzhou. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013Serbia_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China\u2013Serbia relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_visit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State visit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_and_Eastern_Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central and Eastern Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belt and Road Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free trade agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charter of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Territorial integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hegemony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nation state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 15}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 4253, "textEnd": 4259}], "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

He has defied the recent European tendency to target China as a \"systemic rival\" and offered his support for Beijing's proposals against major-power competition and for peace and cooperation.\n\nWith long-standing cordiality dating back to the era of socialist Yugoslavia, the friendship between China and present-day Serbia has stood the test of dramatic geopolitical changes. The Chinese leader's visit will only cement and upgrade what has already been in his own words an example of fine state-to-state relations, making the friendship between the two countries even more dynamic.\n\nThe relationship between the two countries carries very special significance today as both countries seek to carry forward their traditional friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation amid the increasing global volatility.\n\nIn addition to expanding their common interests in economic and trade cooperation, the two countries have also sought and found broad common ground on regional and global affairs.\n\nThe importance the Chinese leader attaches to the bilateral relationship is obvious in the title of his signed article published in a local newspaper, Politika: \"Let the Light of Ironclad Friendship Illuminate the Road of China-Serbia Cooperation\".\n\nSuch amity has prospered particularly under the Chinese president's own watch. It was during his first visit to Belgrade in 2016 that the two countries established a strategic partnership. Last year, he and visiting President Vucic witnessed the signing of dozens of new cooperation agreements in Beijing, including a free trade deal expected to take effect in July.\n\nChina was Serbia's second-largest trading partner, after the European Union, last year with a total trade exchange of $6.1 billion, and it was among its top five investors. Serbia is a firm supporter of the Belt and Road Initiative. China-financed infrastructure projects under the framework of the initiative have become key development boosters of the country.\n\nSerbian enthusiasm for Chinese economic and trade connections stands in sharp contrast with the noise in Europe for \"de-risking\" from China. That the Chinese president's arrival in Serbia coincided with the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy has been widely interpreted as a pointed message on the growing unease between Beijing and the bloc that, encouraged by Washington, is seeking to extend its tentacles to the Asia-Pacific region citing \"systematic challenges\" posed by China.\n\n\"The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself,\" the Chinese leader said in the Politika article.\n\nThere is concern that the EU's growing unease about China's development momentum may be recklessly exploited by the string-puller of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to a crisis-causing degree.\n\nBeijing looks forward to taking Xi's visit as an opportunity to keep relations with Europe on the right track of healthy development, so that the latter can view its relationship with China more objectively.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn",

In China, we say that great geographical distances cannot separate people when there are mutual affinities,\" the Chinese president said.\n\nXi said that Serbia was committed to independence and defended its sovereignty, territorial integrity and national dignity, and that the country deserves the respect of the international community.\n\n\"The steely friendship between our countries has only strengthened, even in this changing international dynamic. This friendship is rooted in history, and indeed it enjoys strong political foundations, common interests and firm support of the people,\" Xi said.\n\nIn the end, he said that China wants to work with Serbia and continue in the spirit of \"steel friendship\".\n\n\"We will work together with Serbia, to defend our fundamental and long-term, long-term interests. And when it comes to various international developments, we want to build that community with a common future in the new era and this is part of our efforts to contribute to the community for a common future for the whole of humanity,\" the Chinese president concluded, AA writes.\n\nPhoto: Anadolu Agency", "source": {"uri": "sarajevotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sarajevo Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Territorial integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free trade agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anadolu_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anadolu Agency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://sarajevotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/D824DB50-BFE3-4B1F-8236-49579F9CA796.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

We must never forget this.\"\n\nHe said the \"friendship of China and Serbia\" was \"soaked in the shared blood of the two nations\" and \"the close cooperation between\" them since his last visit there eight years ago.\n\nRelated: Xi's European tour: where is Chinese leader going and what are visit's aims?\n\nXi is spending the majority of his trip to Europe in Serbia and Hungary, which are seen as China-friendly, unlike most of the EU which sees Beijing as a trade and political rival.\n\nWhile the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, restated the EU's readiness to impose tariffs on cheap Chinese imports including electric cars after her talks with Xi on Monday, Xi can expect full support in Belgrade, and in Budapest when he travels there later this week.\n\nBefore leaving France, Xi visited the Pyrenees with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. He said he would welcome more high-level talks on trade frictions, but denied there was a Chinese \"overcapacity problem\", casting doubt on how much progress could eventually be achieved on trade.\n\nAfter watching traditional dancers perform under the snowy peaks, the two leaders ate locally grown ham, lamb, cheese and blueberry pie. Macron gave Xi a woollen blanket made in the Pyrenees, a Tour de France jersey and armagnac from the nearby south-western region.\n\nFrench brandy is at risk of being hit by Chinese trade sanctions after Beijing opened an anti-dumping investigation into European brandy, seen as retaliation against the EU's mounting number of inquiries into alleged Bejing subsidies for exported electric cars, solar panels, wind turbines and medical devices.\n\nFrench and Chinese companies concluded some agreements on Monday in areas including energy, finance and transport on the sidelines of Xi's visit, but most were agreements to cooperate or renewed commitments to work together, and there were no significant deals.\n\nEuropean hopes of an Airbus plane order to coincide with Xi's visit appear to have been dashed, with the two sides agreeing only to expand cooperation.\n\nA European diplomat said Xi was the winner of the visit, having \"cemented his image as the 'ruler of the world' where westerners are begging him to solve European problems in Ukraine\".\n\nSerbia and Hungary are supporters of Xi's signature belt and road initiative to build ports, railways and power plants around the world as a way of boosting soft power and economic growth. Direct Chinese investment in the two countries exceeds \u20ac15bn, with more coming including China's first electric car factory in the EU, which will be built in Hungary.\n\nXi is expected to highlight a new high-speed train service between Belgrade and Budapest that is being built by China Railway, underlining the willingness of the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, to do business with Beijing.\n\nOn the political side, all eyes will be on Vu\u010di\u0107 and the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's east-west balancing act, with both countries also considered friendly towards Russia's Vladimir Putin.\n\nLast year Orb\u00e1n reaffirmed his commitment to bilateral ties with Russia when he met Putin on the sidelines of a belt and road conference in Beijing, causing outrage in the EU.\n\nXi heaped praise on Vu\u010di\u0107 in his letter in Politika, talking about their \"meetings, telephone conversations and exchange of letters\" and noting China's position \"as the largest source of foreign investment and Serbia's second largest trade partner\".", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors":

The bond between the two nations continues to strengthen with frequent exchanges between their leaders. As Chinese President Xi Jinping pays his second state visit to the European country in the coming days, expectations are running high that the ironclad friendship between the two nations will be further enriched and strengthened.\n\nBefore the significant visit, Global Times reporters Shan Jie, Xie Wenting and Zhao Juecheng (GT) interviewed Chinese Ambassador to Serbia Li Ming (Li). The ambassador offers a profound look at the robust China-Serbia relations, underscored by a shared history and a vibrant cultural exchange, while emphasizing Serbia's integral role in the Belt and Road Initiative and the impact of the China-Serbia Free Trade Agreement on economic collaboration.\n\nGT: You have been serving as the Chinese Ambassador to Serbia since last September. What impressions has Serbia made on you during these past months? As the current Chinese ambassador, what message would you like to convey to the local people?\n\nLi: Serbia is a uniquely charming country. Situated in Central and Eastern Europe in the Balkan region, it boasts a rich history and vibrant culture where Eastern and Western civilizations have met and mingled over millennia, producing significant achievements in human civilization. Additionally, Serbia is blessed with splendid natural beauty, from its vast plains and river valleys to its mountainous landscapes, all captivating to behold.\n\nWhat impressed me most was the warmth of Serbian people and their profound friendship with the Chinese people. Both countries view each other as \"ironclad friends,\" a bond not only rooted in our historical traditions but also thriving anew in the new era.\n\nUpon arriving in Serbia, I was pleased to witness numerous fruitful Chinese-Serbian collaborations taking root and flourishing, and to feel the warm, friendly support of the Serbian people for our bilateral cooperation.\n\nAs President Xi has stated, \"The modernization we are pursuing is not for China alone, but for all developing countries through our joint efforts.\" I am confident that under the careful guidance and leadership of our heads of state, China-Serbia relations will continue to yield fruitful outcomes in the new era, bringing tangible benefits to both peoples and setting a model for the region and the world.\n\nGT: How do you evaluate the current state of China-Serbia relations? In which areas do you plan to deepen cooperation?\n\nLi: China and Serbia are close friends and partners, sharing an ironclad friendship that has endured through history and remains vibrant amid global changes. The frequent interactions between our leaders have charted the course for our relationship. In recent years, President Xi and President Aleksandar Vucic have met multiple times and maintained a close communication. In October 2023, President Vucic led the largest-ever Serbian delegation to China for the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. Under the strategic guidance of both leaders, our comprehensive strategic partnership maintains robust development, with close exchanges at all levels and unwavering mutual support on issues of core interest and major concern, deepening political trust.\n\nOur economic and trade cooperation has strengthened both economies. Bilateral trade continues to grow, with China being Serbia's largest source of imports, second-largest trading partner, and a significant direct investor. Serbian Zijin Mining Group, HeSteel Group (HBIS) Group Serbia Iron & Steel, and Serbian Zijin Copper company, all Chinese-funded enterprises, rank among Serbia's top exporters. Under the Belt and Road Initiative, our infrastructure projects stand out, including the Belgrade Zemun-Borca Bridge, the first bridge built by a Chinese company in Europe, and the E763 highway, the first highway constructed by a Chinese company in Europe. The Hungary-Serbia railway, a flagship BRI project, marks China's first high-speed rail project in Europe and the first in the Central and Eastern European region.\n\nCultural exchanges have also bridged our friendship. The traditional bond between our countries has been strengthened by reciprocal visa exemptions, mutual driving license recognition, and direct flights. The interest in Chinese culture remains high in Serbia. The Spring Festival of the Year of the Dragon saw the Chinese Embassy in Serbia host a series of popular \"Happy Spring Festival\" events. With the establishment of the Chinese Cultural Center in Belgrade, China-Serbia cultural exchanges have gained a new platform.\n\nChina will continue to work with Serbia, guided by the important consensus of our leaders, leveraging mechanisms such as the China-Serbia Free Trade Agreement and the Belt and Road mid-term action plan. We will deepen cooperation in traditional fields and accelerate development in digital and green economies, exploring new potential in innovation, new energy, biotechnology, and environmental protection. Recently, Chinese automakers Chery, Geely, and Lynk & Co showcased their products at the Belgrade Motor Show, adding highlights to China-Serbia economic and trade cooperation. I believe the scope of our collaborative endeavors will only expand, broadening the path of cooperation between the two countries.\n\nGT: In your view, how has the BRI impacted China-Serbia relations and cooperation? Please detail two successful cooperation projects you have observed.\n\nLi: Serbia is a key partner in the BRI, being among the first European countries to sign a cooperation agreement with China. The integration of the BRI into Serbia's national development over the last decade serves as a model for the international community. Projects like the Hungary-Serbia railway, the Belgrade Ring Road, the Sava River Bridge, and the Smederevo steel plant have significantly improved the daily lives of locals, boosting employment, trade, and investment, and injecting new vigor into Serbia's development. Among these, the Smederevo steel plant and the Hungary-Serbia railway stand out as exemplary cases.\n\nThe Smederevo steel plant, once hailed as the pride of Serbia and boasting over a century of history, faced closure due to mismanagement. In 2016, under the BRI, China's HBIS signed with the Serbian government to establish HBIS Group Serbia Iron & Steel. In less than six months, the steel plant turned profitable after seven years of losses, becoming Serbia's largest exporter for four consecutive years. Importantly, all 5,000 Serbian employees were retained, rekindling hope for thousands of families and exemplifying the success of China-Serbia cooperation under the Belt and Road framework.\n\nIn 2013, the Hungary-Serbia railway project was announced shortly after the implementation of the BRI. In 2022, the Belgrade-Novi Sad section of the Hungary-Serbia railway was completed and opened to traffic, reducing the travel time between the two cities from 90 minutes to 30 minutes. Over the last two years, the Belgrade-Novi Sad section has transported over 7 million passengers.\n\nExcited about the project, President Vucic said, \"This is a significant change for the Serbian people and the entire country.\" The Serbia section of the Hungary-Serbia railway line is expected to be completed by the end of 2024, and it is believed that it will become the \"road to happiness\" and \"road to prosperity\" for the Serbian people, as well as a road of friendship between China and Serbia.\n\nUnder the guidance of the BRI, China and Serbia will continue to uphold the principle of planning together, building together and benefiting together, focusing on connectivity and achieving new brilliant results in policy communication, facility connectivity, trade facilitation, financial integration, and people-to-people bonds.\n\nGT: What new impetus has the China-Serbia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) injected into the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries and what has it achieved?\n\nLi: The China-Serbia FTA is the first free trade agreement signed between China and a Central and Eastern European country, and it is also the 22nd free trade agreement signed by China. Serbia has become China's 29th free trade partner globally.\n\nAfter the agreement comes into effect, both countries' citizens and businesses will benefit from it. Serbian producers and traders can actively utilize the free trade arrangement between the two countries to access major consumer markets worldwide, and attract Chinese and European investors to invest in Serbia.\n\nSerbia has made high-level commitments in sectors such as manufacturing, construction, and information communication, providing Chinese companies with greater certainty and broader opportunities to explore the Serbian market and even the Central and Eastern European markets.\n\nThe China-Serbia FTA will help both sides to achieve high-level mutual openness, establish new institutional arrangements for bilateral economic and trade cooperation, create a more favorable, convenient, transparent, and stable business environment for businesses from both countries, and inject new momentum into promoting high-quality joint construction of the BRI and deepening the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Serbia.\n\nGT: Please introduce the Belgrade China Cultural Center to our readers. How do you feel about the cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries? What activities can we look forward to in the near future?\n\nLi: The Belgrade China Cultural Center holds a very special position and significance among the dozens of Chinese cultural centers overseas. It stands on the site of the former Chinese Embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Belgrade, which was bombed by NATO in 1999, symbolizing the rebirth and indomitable spirit of the Chinese nation. It bears witness to the deep friendship forged by the Chinese and Serbian people with blood and life, and also demonstrates the Chinese people's love for peace and their national character of not fearing power.\n\nThe cultural center has now started operating, becoming a convenient window for the Serbian people to learn about China and experience Chinese culture. It has become a new platform for telling Chinese stories and showcasing China's images, as well as a bridge for promoting cultural exchanges and mutual learning between China and Serbia.\n\nThe cultural center not only provides opportunities for Chinese cultural displays and teaching such as calligraphy, tea art, musical instruments, dance, and martial arts, but also focuses on building its own cultural brand activities. In May 2024, the center will host the first \"Tea and the World\" event in conjunction with International Tea Day, followed by the first China-Serbia Dragon Boat Festival, the 2024 Chinese Film Week, and the \"Hello! China\" tourism promotion event.\n\nGT: What exemplary role and positive impact have China-Serbia relations played on the cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European (CEE) Countries?\n\nLi: As an important country in Central and Eastern Europe, Serbia is walking hand in hand with China, and bilateral relations are steadily developing. This not only sets an example for cooperation between China and CEE countries under the BRI, but also injects more stability into China's relations with Central and Eastern European countries. The successful practice of China-Serbia cooperation fully proves that China and CEE countries can become good friends and partners in the process of jointly moving toward modernization.\n\nChina is willing to work together with countries in Central and Eastern Europe to firmly grasp the overall direction and main tone of the development of bilateral relations from a strategic height, respect each other, achieve mutual benefit and win-win results, and promote regional peace, stability, and prosperity.\n\nGT: What's your take on President Vucic's recent remarks on the Taiwan question? How have China and Serbia supported each other on issues concerning each other's core interests?\n\nLi: At the beginning of this year, in an interview with China's state news agency, President Vucic used 10 seconds to illustrate Serbia's firm position of adhering to the one-China principle, and then in an interview with the media, he clearly stated that Taiwan belongs to China.\n\nPresident Vucic's remarks on the Taiwan question not only spoke to the just call of the international community, but also strongly demonstrated, once again, that China and Serbia have always firmly supported each other's core interests and major concerns, and firmly supported each other's development path choice.\n\nChina and Serbia are true friends and good partners who trust each other. Over the years, Serbia has firmly supported China on issues related to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and human rights, and China has always firmly supported Serbia in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity. China is willing to continue to respect, support, trust, and treat each other as equals with Serbia and push forward the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries.\n\nhttps://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202405/1311545.shtml\n\nView original

They were with us in the worst moment, they were with us 25 years ago when our country was bombed, paying a high price along with us when they lost their people,\" Vucic said recalling the 1999 NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy.", "source": {"uri": "n1info.rs", "dataType": "news", "title": "N1"}, "authors": [{"uri": "n1_belgrade@n1info.rs", "name": "N1 Belgrade", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(diplomacy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Protocol (diplomacy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palace of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_of_honour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard of honour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N1_(TV_channel)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "N1 (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chinese people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO bombing of Yugoslavia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bombing_of_the_Chinese_embassy_in_Belgrade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://n1info.rs/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/08/1715159774-2024-05-08T085810Z_881411000_RC28M7AEAOFP_RTRMADP_3_EU-CHINA-SERBIA-1200x800.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Such friendship is characterized by profound historical roots, solid political foundation, extensive common interests and strong popular support.\n\n-- Over the past few years, under the leadership of Xi and Vucic, the bilateral relationship has leapfrogged with historic progress, and since the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2016, in particular, the bilateral relationship has been enriched in substance and expanded in scope, which has become an example for China's friendly relations with other European countries.\n\n-- Actions speak louder than words. China will stand shoulder to shoulder with Serbia, share weal and woe like passengers in the same boat, carry forward the spirit of the ironclad friendship, maintain and grow their friendship, and jointly safeguard fundamental and long-term interests of the two countries.\n\n-- As the two sides pursue their respective national development and revitalization, China will join hands with Serbia to advance the building of a community with a shared future in the new era.\n\n-- Serbia is China's first comprehensive strategic partner in Central and Eastern Europe. Their bilateral cooperation has injected strong impetus into their respective development and rejuvenation, and brought tangible benefits to the two peoples.\n\n-- Under the new circumstances, Serbia has become the first European country to build with China a community with a shared future, which speaks volumes about the strategic, special and high-level China-Serbia relations.\n\n-- The China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era is an upgrade of the ironclad friendship between China and Serbia. It also represents their common values and objectives, namely, joint pursuit of development, win-win cooperation and mutual success. These are the common aspirations of China, Serbia, and all countries that are committed to independence, peace and development.\n\nON COOPERATION AND PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE EXCHANGES\n\n-- Standing at a new historical starting point, China will work with Serbia to jointly stay committed to the original aspiration and forge ahead together to open up a new vista in China-Serbia cooperation with stronger momentum, greater scope, and higher quality.\n\n-- By building a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, the two sides should keep deepening and expanding high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and collaboration between China and Central and Eastern European countries, thus contributing to their respective modernization.\n\n-- High-quality Belt and Road cooperation between China and Serbia has achieved remarkable results. The two sides should steadily advance cooperation in traditional areas such as transportation and energy infrastructure, make sure the entire Serbian section of the Belgrade-Budapest railway go into operation as scheduled, jointly operate well their major cooperation projects, create more small and beautiful livelihood projects, and continue to generate positive economic and social impacts.\n\n-- China supports Serbia in upholding independence and pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions, and supports its efforts in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The two sides should continue to offer each other firm support, deepen strategic cooperation, and safeguard their respective political security and fundamental interests.\n\n-- It is important for China and Serbia to jointly reject hegemonism and power politics, and oppose bloc politics or bloc confrontation.

The sweet scenes that prevailed during my last visit eight years ago remain very much alive in my mind,\" Xi wrote in a signed article published in the Serbian newspaper Politika on Tuesday.\n\nXi said he will work with his Serbian friends during his visit to \"bring out the best in our ironclad friendship and take real efforts to deliver more benefits to our two peoples, advance world peace and development, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind\".\n\nHe said the long-lasting friendship and win-win cooperation between China and Serbia make it clear that a stronger bilateral relationship conforms with the trend of history and serves the best interests of the two peoples.\n\nLast year, China was Serbia's largest source of foreign investment and its second-largest trading partner, with bilateral trade volume registering at $4.35 billion.\n\nIn 2016, a century-old Serbian steel mill that was about to slide into bankruptcy made a remarkable comeback after receiving Chinese investment through the deepening high-quality Belt and Road cooperation between China and Serbia. The mill has now become one of the three biggest export companies in Serbia.\n\nXi said the thriving cooperation between the two countries in trade and economic relations, industrial chain and infrastructure development gives a great boost to their respective process of modernization.\n\n\"On the new journey of the new era, the China-Serbia comprehensive strategic partnership has more potential for further growth,\" he wrote, calling on the two countries to always be good friends and good partners.\n\nThe Chinese and Serbian peoples, though far apart geographically, have forged a strong friendship during the bitter Anti-Fascist War and their respective nation-building in the last century.\n\n\"Amid the ongoing transformations unseen in a century in the world, our mutual support remains as strong as ever, our cooperation is closer, and our exchanges and mutual learning more substantive,\" Xi wrote.\n\nXi called on China and Serbia, which hold similar positions on many major international and regional issues, to play an exemplary role in promoting fairness and justice.\n\nMultilateralism stressed\n\n\"Facing a fluid and turbulent world, ... we should practice true multilateralism, and endeavor to maintain world peace and stability and safeguard international fairness and justice,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Chinese president also stressed the need to promote multidimensional people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and diversify subnational cooperation between the two countries for their friendship to shine even brighter.\n\n\"We should create more opportunities for our youth so that the China-Serbia friendship will be carried forward from generation to generation,\" he wrote.\n\nAs this year marks the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of the former Chinese embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999 which killed three Chinese journalists, Xi said Chinese people cherish peace, and will never allow such tragic history to repeat.\n\n\"The China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides,\" he wrote.\n\nJust like flowers in spring will turn into fruit in autumn, Xi said the tree of the China-Serbia friendship will grow tall and sturdy and bear more fruit for the two peoples.\n\n\"This is what we expect and what we hope to witness together,\" he wrote.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Serbia is one of the stops of President Xi's ongoing visit to Europe. What is the significance of this visit? Three Serbian scholars shared their views with Global Times.\n\nBojan Lalic, director of the Belt and Road Institute in Belgrade\n\nSerbia and China are strengthening their ironclad friendship every day, which inseparably binds the industries, universities and cultural heritage of the two nations. Our relationship has stood the test of time only because we understand that these pillars must not be separated. There is no economic progress without education and culture.\n\nSerbia joined the BRI very early. In 2021, the Belt and Road Institute was established by the Government of the Republic of Serbia, University of Novi Sad and Serbian Chamber of Commerce and Industry with the aim of in-depth study of the initiative's developments and transforming policies, conclusions and guidelines into actionable measures. Besides major Chinese companies in Serbia, the Chinese Culture Center in Belgrade, Confucius Institutes, and the future China-Serbia Industrial Park, the Institute represents the driver of ecosystem development for Belt and Road Cooperation in the next decade. President Aleksandar Vucic has emphasized on several occasions that the strategic role of cooperation in the BRI for Serbia represents an important catalyst and framework for future development.\n\nKatarina Zakic, head of Regional Centre for Belt and Road, Institute of International Politics and Economics in Belgrade, on these issues\n\nIn Serbian we use a term to describe a strong and enduring friendship - we call it \"steel friendship.\" Steel is known for its strength, durability and ability to withstand the test of time. By using this slogan, we are emphasizing the strong relationship between our two countries, one that can endure changing conditions and challenges and is difficult to destroy. Like any friendship, our relationship is built on trust, loyalty and sincerity.\n\nChina was a Serbian friend during challenging times in history, and the Serbian people have never forgotten this. The establishments of China-Serbia strategic partnership in 2009 and the comprehensive strategic partnership in 2016 were not sudden events but rather the official signal that China-Serbia relationship is constantly improving and that both sides are committed to the further development of diplomatic relations.\n\nIvona Ladjevac, Deputy Director at Institute of International Politics and Economics in Belgrade\n\nFrom the moment of establishing diplomatic relations, both the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and later the Republic of Serbia as its successor, paid significant attention to developing their relations with the People's Republic of China. For Serbia, there is no doubt that China is one of the major players in international relations. The two countries developed their relations based on the principles of equality and mutual respect without interfering in each other's internal affairs, which over the decades proved to be a tried and tested recipe for building friendly relations.\n\nA developing China can bring more not only to Serbia and Europe but also to the entire world, due to the rich experience it gained in the process of modernization. China became a model country for all countries that are not satisfied with \"one model fits all\" solutions.\n\nView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-times-china-and-serbia-maintain-ironclad-friendship-with-more-to-come-302140103.html", "source": {"uri": "streetinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StreetInsider.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belt and Road Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Global Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cultural heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_International_Politics_and_Economics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institute of International Politics and Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Novi_Sad", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Novi Sad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Chamber_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbian Chamber of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confucius Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernization_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Modernization theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Friendship", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Friendship", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

"China's leader is touring European countries seen as most sympathetic to Beijing.\n\nBy RFA Mandarin 2024.05.07 -- Xi Jinping's tour of potential sympathizers in Europe took a gloomy turn Tuesday, as the Chinese president headed to Serbia with an apparent warning to the United States on the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of Beijing's Embassy in its capital, Belgrade.\n\n\"Twenty-five years ago today, NATO flagrantly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese journalists,\" Xi wrote in the Serbian daily Politika prior to his arrival on a flight from Paris.\n\n\"This we should never forget,\" Xi wrote. \"The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\"\n\nThree Chinese journalists were killed and 20 Chinese nationals were wounded in the May 7, 1999, attack during the Kosovo War, which prompted outrage in China and an apology from then-U.S. President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe embassy was hit during a campaign against the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\nThe United States blamed the bombing on a CIA mapping error.\n\nXi's warnings about the \"flagrant\" NATO aggression come as Beijing steadfastly stands by Moscow amid its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nChina has repeatedly amplified Russian claims its invasion of Ukraine was forced by the expansion into Eastern Europe of NATO, which the United States and other NATO members insist is a defensive pact but Moscow slams as a threat to its \"legitimate security interests.\"\n\nEuropean tour\n\nXi's visit to Serbia is the second stop of three in Europe - after France and before Hungary - as Beijing tries to cleave off the continent from decades of geopolitical alliance with Washington.\n\nIn Politika, Xi also hailed the \"iron-clad friendship\" between China and Serbia, which he said was \"forged with the blood of our compatriots.\"\n\nChina has poured billions into Serbia and neighboring Balkan countries - in particular into mining and manufacturing sectors - and last year Beijing and EU-applicant Belgrade signed a free trade agreement.\n\nOn Monday in Paris, Xi met French President Emmanuel Macron, who has publicly promoted the idea of France and the European Union pursuing geopolitical \"strategic autonomy\" from the United States.\n\nLast year, speaking about a potential dispute over Taiwan between Beijing and Washington, Macron said Europe should not allow itself to become a U.S. \"vassal\" and be drawn into any conflict.\n\nIn Paris, crowds of protesters turned out on the streets to greet Xi, wave flags and express their anger over China's persecution of Tibetans and Uyghurs as well as its clampdown on freedoms in Hong Kong.\n\nXi next travels to Hungary, whose authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been a thorn in the side of NATO as it attempts to support Ukraine's defense against the invasion by Russian forces.\n\nUnlike Serbia, Hungary is also a member of the European Union and NATO, and has blocked several EU resolutions critical of China in recent years, including about Beijing's crackdown in Hong Kong.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_pike@globalsecurity.org", "name": "John Pike",

This we should never forget,\u201d Xi wrote in an article placed in Serbian newspaper Politika on Tuesday.\n\nIn an online briefing on Wednesday to mark the end of his tenure in Belgrade, Gabriel Escobar, Washington\u2019s outgoing special envoy for the Western Balkans, criticised the timing of Xi\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cThe visit was timed to increase tensions between Serbia and the rest of the Western community, and it\u2019s unhelpful,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe \u2013 the United States has said that the bombing of the Chinese embassy in 1999, was an accident,\u201d Escobar explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve apologised. I believe we\u2019ve actually even paid reparations to the families. But... I do believe that the timing of the visit was unfortunate but deliberate.\u201d\n\nThe strike was part of Nato\u2019s military campaign in the former Yugoslavia, setting off a diplomatic crisis between Beijing and Washington as well as the biggest anti-US protests across China in decades.\n\nThe US and its Nato allies insisted the \u201centirely unintended\u201d strike had meant to target a Yugoslav military facility and the embassy had been misidentified in a \u201ctragic mistake\u201d.\n\nHowever, many in China \u2013 including government officials \u2013 rejected that characterisation and remain unconvinced.\n\nChina has maintained close ties with Serbia since siding with the former Yugoslavia against Nato\u2019s air campaign in the 1990s.\n\nOn Wednesday, Xi reaffirmed his \u201cironclad\u201d support for Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, with the two leaders backing each other\u2019s territorial claims over Taiwan and Kosovo, respectively.\n\nChina, as part of the United Nations\u2019 Security Council, has helped ensure that Kosovo, which the Serbian government views as a breakaway province, from receiving official recognition at the body.\n\n\u201cWe have a clear and simple position regarding Chinese territorial integrity. Yes, Taiwan is China,\u201d Vucic said on Wednesday, addressing a crowd estimated to number 20,000 people, alongside the Chinese leader.\n\nThe pair signed an agreement boosting their strategic partnership to a \u201ccommunity with a shared future in new era\u201d, while a free-trade agreement is set to kick in on July 1.\n\nSerbia is a candidate country for European Union membership, but the EU did not immediately respond to questions about whether Belgrade\u2019s expanded ties with Beijing would affect relations with Brussels.\n\nXi will travel to Hungary on Wednesday evening for two days of pageantry with another of its close allies in Europe, Prime Minister Viktor Orban. He landed in Serbia following two days of talks with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe long-standing Hungarian leader has been a stumbling block to European unity over Ukraine and a strong backer of Chinese positions on human rights and economic issues.\n\nIn a separate article in the pro-Orban newspaper Magyar Nemzet on Wednesday, Xi wrote that \u201cChina and Hungary share similar views and positions close to each other on international and regional issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have embarked on the right path of independent and autonomous friendly foreign relations of sovereign countries,\u201d he continued.\n\nEscobar, who is imminently departing from his role as deputy assistant secretary of the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, said that Xi had chosen countries \u201cthat are open to challenging the unity of the Euro-Atlantic community\u201d.\n\nThe Biden administration has had a troubled relationship with populist Orban, who has openly expressed his wish to see former President Donald Trump to win in November\u2019s US election.\n\n\u201cWe caution all of our partners and all of our interlocutors to be very aware of China\u2019s agenda in Europe and China\u2019s agenda with regard to the Euro-Atlantic community,\u201d Escobar said.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It took place in the context of the larger NATO military operation against Yugoslav authorities at the time, which NATO leaders justified as necessary to end an ongoing ethnic cleansing campaign by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, then led by Slobodan Milosevic.\n\nXi made clear prior to arriving in Serbia that he did not view NATO countries as allies or the NATO agenda as necessarily compatible with China's by acknowledging the anniversary. the dictator honored those killed in an article published in the Serbian newspaper Politika on Tuesday, insisting, \"we should never forget this.\"\n\n\"Twenty-five years ago, NATO bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese reporters: Shao Yunhuan, Xu Xinghu and his wife Zhu Ying,\" Xi wrote, according to a translation of the article published by the Russian news agency Tass. \"We should never forget this. The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such a tragic incident to happen again.\"\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry marked the anniversary by condemning the \"barbaric\" attack and suggesting that NATO could act similarly in the future.\n\n\"25 years ago, the US-led NATO forces illegally attacked the sovereign state of Yugoslavia without the authorization of the UN Security Council, killing thousands of innocent civilians, including three Chinese journalists,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told reporters during his regular briefing on Tuesday.\n\n\"The Chinese people will never forget this barbaric atrocity committed by NATO and will never accept such tragic history repeating itself,\" he asserted. \"Each year, commemorative events are held by Serbia and the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.\"\n\nThe South China Morning Post suggested that Xi was \"expected to join the commemorations\" in Belgrade of the bombing, though the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not offer details of his itinerary. Foreign policy experts suggested that the emphasis on remind the world of the bombing was an attempt to clarify that China has no interest in supporting NATO countries in their current endeavor of opposing Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. China is one of Russia's closest allies and a prominent buyer of Russian oil, but also maintains friendly relations with Ukraine, a member of China's predatory Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that has invited Beijing to help rebuild after the war.\n\nThe bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade served no overt military or geopolitical purpose and the administration of leftist then-President Bill Clinton declared it entirely an error. In a letter to Chinese authorities in June 1999, top State Department official Thomas Pickering said plainly, \"the attack was a mistake.\"\n\n\"Let me emphasize: no one targeted the Chinese Embassy. No one, at any stage in the process, realized that our bombs were aimed at the Chinese Embassy,\" Pickering said, claiming that military officials had used incorrect maps in an attempt to target Yugoslavia's Federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement (FDSP) at the site that actually held the Chinese diplomatic post.\n\nChina's response at the time - under President Jiang Zemin, the Communist Party leader tasked with rehabilitating China's image after the Tiananmen Square massacre - was to condemn the act, but ultimately take little other action. Clinton, in turn, made up for the strike by spearheading efforts that eventually led to China joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) under highly favorable conditions.\n\n\"Today China embraces principles of economic openness, innovation and competition that will bolster China's economic reforms and advance the rule of law,\" Clinton said in November 1999, six months after the bombing, a statement that contradicted the communist reality of the country both then and now.\n\nAt press time, Xi is in France, culminating a visit that began on Sunday and featured a lavish dinner hosted by President Emmanuel Macron on Monday. While reports prior to his visit suggested Macron would use his time with Xi to galvanize support for Ukraine, Xi spent much of Monday in a meeting with Macron and European Union President Ursula von der Leyen, reportedly discussing expanding Chinese economic influence in Europe. The Ukraine invasion appeared in passing mentions in statements from the parties involved.\n\nIn addition to France and Serbia, Xi will also visit Hungary in the last leg of his Europe tour.\n\nThe tour is Xi's first in Europe in five years - since the onset of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, caused in large part by Chinese government policies - and heavily focused on economic ties. Xi reportedly chose France as the first stop as it is the first country on the continent to establish diplomatic ties with the Communist Party.\n\nChina's close relationship with Russia, one of Serbia's top allies, and distaste for NATO has made it a longtime friendly state in the eyes of Serbian officials. According to the Serbian newspaper Telegraf, Belgrade is preparing a massive ceremonial welcome for Xi, including a Chinese delegation of over 400 people and an aerial escort by Serbian MiG-29 warplanes.\n\nSerbian officials have also draped much of the city of Belgrade in massive Chinese communist flags.\n\nXi is expected to remain in Serbia for two days before heading to Budapest.",

Chinese leader Xi Jinping's visit to European ally Serbia on Tuesday falls on a symbolic date: the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during NATO's air war over Kosovo.\n\nBELGRADE, Serbia (AP) -- Chinese leader Xi Jinping's visit to European ally Serbia on Tuesday falls on a symbolic date: the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during NATO's air war over Kosovo.\n\nU.S. jets dropped five bombs on the Chinese Embassy compound in the Serbian capital on May 7, 1999, setting it ablaze and killing three Chinese nationals. Twenty other people were injured in the incident, which has burdened relations between the two powers ever since.\n\nThe Western military alliance had launched the air war in March that year to force then Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a brutal onslaught against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo.\n\nThe U.S. at the time apologized and said the embassy bombing was a mistake that happened due to faulty intelligence. The intended target, Washington said, was the headquarters of a Serbian state arms exporter located on the same street, a few blocks away.\n\n\"Imagine that somebody would, even by accident, strike an American Embassy somewhere around the world. The reaction would be immediate,\" said Sven Biscop, a professor of European foreign and security policy at the Ghent University and Egmont Institute.\n\n\"So for a country like China, it is also clear that this is a big thing,\" he added. \"And, of course, it has not been forgotten.\"\n\nAngry protesters in China stormed U.S. diplomatic installations as the bombing fueled anti-American sentiments and speculation that the attack was intentional rather than accidental. Mistrust over the incident has endured to this day.\n\n\"We will probably never really conclusively know either way,\" Biscop said. \"But one thing is sure. In war, incidents like that do happen, and I usually tend to go for the most simple explanation rather than try to invent complicated theories.\"\n\nWhile straining Beijing's relations with the U.S., the embassy bombing brought China and Serbia closer together. China has emerged as Serbia's largest provider of foreign direct investment and its second-largest trading partner after the European Union.\n\nBeijing opposed the NATO bombing campaign and has since backed Belgrade's bid to counter the Western-backed push for independence in Kosovo, a former Serbian province. In return, Serbia has been a loyal ally to Beijing and has opened its doors without restraint to billions of dollars of Chinese investment, even as it formally seeks EU membership.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible ahead of Xi's visit on Tuesday and Wednesday. In Belgrade, a huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nXi will arrive from France and proceed from Serbia to Hungary as part of his first European tour in five years.\n\nHe is expected to visit the site of the former embassy on the anniversary date and pay his respects to the bombing victims. A Chinese cultural center now stands at the spot where the embassy was once located.\n\nThe sprawling complex reportedly includes a Confucius Institute, workshops, exhibitions, offices, residential space and a hotel. It is seen as a symbol of China's growing influence in Serbia and across Europe.\n\nNear the institute, a group of visitors from China last weekend bowed in front of a simple black-marble monument and laid flowers in honor of the victims of the 1999 bombing. An inscription on the monument in both Chinese and English reads: \"Honor Martyrs, Cherish Peace.\"\n\nSylvain Plazy contributed to this report from Brussels.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com",

"Xi Jinping's tour of potential sympathizers in Europe took a gloomy turn Tuesday, as the Chinese president headed to Serbia with an apparent warning to the United States on the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of Beijing's Embassy in its capital, Belgrade.\n\n\"Twenty-five years ago today, NATO flagrantly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese journalists,\" Xi wrote in the Serbian daily Politika prior to his arrival on a flight from Paris.\n\n\"This we should never forget,\" Xi wrote. \"The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\"\n\nThree Chinese journalists were killed and 20 Chinese nationals were wounded in the May 7, 1999, attack during the Kosovo War, which prompted outrage in China and an apology from then-U.S. President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe embassy was hit during a campaign against the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n\nThe United States blamed the bombing on a CIA mapping error.\n\nXi's warnings about the \"flagrant\" NATO aggression come as Beijing steadfastly stands by Moscow amid its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nChina has repeatedly amplified Russian claims its invasion of Ukraine was forced by the expansion into Eastern Europe of NATO, which the United States and other NATO members insist is a defensive pact but Moscow slams as a threat to its \"legitimate security interests.\"\n\nEuropean tour\n\nXi's visit to Serbia is the second stop of three in Europe - after France and before Hungary - as Beijing tries to cleave off the continent from decades of geopolitical alliance with Washington.\n\nIn Politika, Xi also hailed the \"iron-clad friendship\" between China and Serbia, which he said was \"forged with the blood of our compatriots.\"\n\nChina has poured billions into Serbia and neighboring Balkan countries - in particular into mining and manufacturing sectors - and last year Beijing and EU-applicant Belgrade signed a free trade agreement.\n\nOn Monday in Paris, Xi met French President Emmanuel Macron, who has publicly promoted the idea of France and the European Union pursuing geopolitical \"strategic autonomy\" from the United States.\n\nLast year, speaking about a potential dispute over Taiwan between Beijing and Washington, Macron said Europe should not allow itself to become a U.S. \"vassal\" and be drawn into any conflict.\n\nIn Paris, crowds of protesters turned out on the streets to greet Xi, wave flags and express their anger over China's persecution of Tibetans and Uyghurs as well as its clampdown on freedoms in Hong Kong.\n\nXi next travels to Hungary, whose authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been a thorn in the side of NATO as it attempts to support Ukraine's defense against the invasion by Russian forces.", "source": {"uri": "rfa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Free Asia"},

That event sparked widespread anti-US protests across China and cemented Beijing's mistrust of US-led groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nRead more: Xi to Visit Serbia Near Anniversary of 1999 Embassy Bombing\n\nXi's visit to Serbia exactly a quarter of a century after the bombing is part of three-leg tour that includes stops in France and Hungary. The Chinese leader is trying to convince European nations that his nation's huge economy is too large to turn away from, as Brussels unleashes a salvo of trade probes and aligns with Washington on concerns over China's over capacity and national security risks.\n\nAdding to the political theater, Xi will be in Europe on the same day Russian President Vladimir Putin is inaugurated into his fifth term, as concern grows in Western Europe over his war in Ukraine.\n\nXi's NATO criticism helps explain his government's rationale for supporting the Kremlin in the wake of its invasion. Chinese officials have referred to the Belgrade bombing multiple times in recent years, as Beijing signaled solidarity with Russia's position that NATO aggression on its borders necessitated the war.\n\nThe US and European leaders have urged Xi to use his relationship with Putin to bring an end to what German Chancellor Olaf Scholz recently branded an \"insane\" war during a trip to Beijing.\n\nXi told his French counterpart in Paris on Monday that he opposes the war in Ukraine \"being used to place responsibility on a third country, tarnish its image and incite a new Cold War.\" President Emmanuel Macron reiterated there cannot be security in Europe without security in Ukraine.\n\nTies between China and Serbia, which is not an EU member, have strengthened under Xi, even as Beijing's broader relationship with Europe frays over human-rights issues and trade spats.\n\nIn the Politika article, Xi wrote that the friendship between Beijing and Belgrade was \"forged with the blood of our compatriots,\" but would only \"grow tall and sturdy.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This is what makes summer the season of hope. I will pay a state visit to the Republic of Serbia at the invitation of President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107. This will be my second visit to your country, a land of beauty and legends, as President of the People's Republic of China. The sweet scenes that prevailed during my last visit eight years ago remain very much alive in my mind. The close cooperation between our two countries over the past eight years has delivered fruitful outcomes. I look forward to meeting with President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 and other Serbian leaders and friends to renew our friendship, explore ways of cooperation, and make the ironclad friendship between China and Serbia more dynamic.\n\nThere has always been an affinity between Chinese and Serbian peoples despite the long distance between us. During the bitter Anti-Fascist War and our respective nation-building in the last century, the Chinese and Serbian peoples forged a strong friendship that extends through time and space. Amid the ongoing transformations unseen in a century in the world, our mutual support remains as strong as ever, our cooperation is closer, and our exchanges and mutual learning more substantive. Whatever changes in the international landscape, China and Serbia remain true friends and good partners. Our ironclad friendship is ever-growing, setting a model for state-to-state and people-to-people interactions.\n\nOur two countries have always respected and trusted each other. President Vu\u010di\u0107 and I have developed a good working relationship through our meetings, phone calls, and exchanges of letters. Our two countries have also maintained frequent exchanges at all levels and in all areas. We fully appreciate and respect the development paths that our respective nation has chosen. We uphold fairness and justice, firmly support each other on issues that bear on our respective core interests and are of major concern to us. We have kept close and smooth coordination and collaboration at the bilateral and multilateral levels. We have built an ever stronger comprehensive strategic partnership that is delivering tangible outcomes.\n\nOur two countries have stayed committed to mutual benefit. Serbia is China's first free trade partner in Central and Eastern Europe. Last year, China was Serbia's largest source of foreign investment and its second largest trading partner. Our thriving cooperation in trade and economic relations, industrial chain, and infrastructure development lends a great boost to our respective process of modernization. In 2016, I visited the Smederevo steel plant of HBIS Serbia, which has become one of the three biggest export companies in Serbia. Serbian honey, red wine, beef, lamb and other agricultural products are very popular among Chinese consumers.\n\nOur two countries have always helped each other. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, I spoke with President Vu\u010di\u0107 twice on the phone and we agreed on a collaborative response to the pandemic. China provided assistance, prioritized the provision of multiple shipments of protective medical supplies, and sent medical experts to Serbia. On its part, Serbia provided full support to China in implementing its \"Spring Sprout\" program to vaccinate Chinese citizens living and working in Serbia. Nongovernmental organizations in Serbia voluntarily donated masks and other supplies to the Chinese people. Our mutual support in challenging times testifies to our invaluable brotherly friendship.\n\nOur two countries have always been learning from each other. We are both committed to delivering a better life for our peoples and making our countries strong and prosperous. We have implemented many programs to share experience in governance, and have enhanced exchanges between our political parties. Our peoples have warm feelings toward each other, as evidenced by the robust cultural, sports, tourism and people-to-people exchanges. Nikola Joki\u0107, the Serbian basketball superstar, personally cheered on players of Chinese rural basketball games. China and Serbia have agreed on a mutual visa-free arrangement for ordinary passport holders, which facilitates people-to-people exchanges and bilateral cooperation.\n\nA Chinese axiom goes, \"Friends are those who are like-minded.\" And Serbians would say, \"Friends are the greatest asset in life.\" The long-lasting friendship and win-win cooperation between China and Serbia makes it clear to us that a stronger bilateral relationship conforms with the trend of history and serves the best interests of our two peoples. It also helps promote our common progress. On the new journey of the new era, the China-Serbia comprehensive strategic partnership has more potential for further growth. During my upcoming visit, I will work with my Serbian friends to bring out the best in our ironclad friendship and take real efforts to deliver more benefits to our two peoples, advance world peace and development, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\nWe should always be good friends and treat each other with sincerity. We will deepen and expand our comprehensive strategic partnership. We will continue to show each other understanding, trust, support and assistance. We will remain steadfast in supporting each other on issues that bear on our respective core interests and are of major concern to us. China respects and supports the development path that the Serbian people have chosen of their own will. We support Serbia's efforts to uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and oppose any attempt by any forces to interfere in Serbia's internal affairs.\n\nWe should always be good partners for win-win cooperation. China is striving for its modernization in all respects through high-quality development, and moving faster to develop new quality productive forces. Serbia has achieved remarkable economic and social development in recent years. Our two countries should further unleash the potential of our mutually beneficial cooperation. We should deliver on the midterm action plan for Belt and Road cooperation, and build more flagship projects. We should expand cooperation in technological innovation, advanced manufacturing, green energy, digital economy, artificial intelligence and other emerging areas. We should share development opportunities and create a better future together.\n\nWe should always play an exemplary role in promoting fairness and justice. As ironclad friends and defenders for world peace, China and Serbia hold similar positions on many major international and regional issues. Facing a fluid and turbulent world, we should step up coordination and cooperation in the United Nations and other international organizations, and advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. We should practice true multilateralism, and endeavor to maintain world peace and stability and safeguard international fairness and justice.\n\nWe should always strengthen the heart-to-heart connection between our two peoples. Our ironclad friendship has withstood the test of blood and fire, and shines even brighter in the new era. We should promote multi-dimensional people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and diversify subnational cooperation. We should make good use of the combined effect of \"mutual visa exemption plus direct flights\" as well as our respective cultural centers to promote cooperation in education, sports, culture and tourism. We should create more opportunities for our youth so that the China-Serbia friendship will be carried forward from generation to generation.\n\nTwenty-five years ago today, NATO flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese journalists -- Ms. Shao Yunhuan, Mr. Xu Xinghu and his wife Zhu Ying. This we should never forget. The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself. The China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides.\n\nWhile looking back at the journey our two countries have traveled together, we also look forward to the promising future we aspire to embrace. We have now come to a new historic milestone. We on the Chinese side are ready to work hand in hand with our Serbian friends to make our shared aspiration and common progress a reality. Together we will write a new chapter in the development and rejuvenation of our nations. Together we will build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era. Flowers in spring will turn into fruits in autumn. The tree of China-Serbia friendship will grow tall and sturdy and bear more fruits for our two peoples. This is what we expect and what we hope to witness together.\n\n\u041f\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u0432\u0443 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442 //= __('Enter the code from above') ?> //= md5($code) ?> //= $code ?> \u041f\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0459\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440 \u041c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u0443 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430. \u0420\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0435 ONLINE \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e \u0434\u0430 - \u0443\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e \u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0443\u043c\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435 - \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0458\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0438 \u0441\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0436\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0458\u0443 \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043d \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442, \u0443\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0447\u0443\u043d \u0430\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0438/\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0447\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0435 \"\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0435\" \u043a\u0430\u043e \u0438 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0432\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u045a\u0443, \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a, \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440 \u043c\u0440\u0436\u045a\u0435, \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0435 \u0443\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0458. \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0437\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043b\u0438\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u0458\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0458\u0430\u0432\u0459\u0443\u0458\u0435\u043c\u043e. \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 ONLINE \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a\u0432\u0443 \u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0443 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u045a\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u043b\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0430\u045b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u045a\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0458\u0430\u0432\u0459\u0438\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435. \u0420\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0446\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u0443 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430. \u0412\u0430\u0448 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0432\u0438\u0448\u0435 1.000 \u043f\u043e\u0458\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430, \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u045a\u0435\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0430\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u0441\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430.

China supports the Serbian government in its measures to protect the country's territorial integrity on the Kosovo issue, Chinese President Xi Jinping said at a joint press conference with his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic after signing joint documents.\n\n\"China supports Serbia in safeguarding its independence as well as following the development path that suits its national interests. China also supports Serbia's efforts to safeguard its own sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Kosovo issue,\" Xi said.\n\nXi Jinping is on a state visit to Serbia on May 7-8. He began his visit to the republic on the 25th anniversary of the NATO Air Force's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. On May 7, 1999, North Atlantic Alliance aircraft struck the Chinese embassy building in Belgrade during a military operation against Yugoslavia.\n\nEarlier, the Serbian leader stressed that Belgrade has fully realized that the United States and the European Union will continue to stand idly by as regards the aggressive policy of the Kosovo authorities towards the Serbian population. In this regard, according to Vucic, Serbia will be forced to change its approach to the Kosovo issue.\n\nThe Brussels agreements on the normalization of relations between Belgrade and Pristina were concluded on April 19, 2013. According to them, the Community of Serb Municipalities, a self-governing body for Serbs living in the unrecognized republic, is to be established in Kosovo. Vucic has repeatedly stated that his country has fulfilled its part of the Brussels agreements, while the Kosovars only started drafting the Community of Serb Municipalities charter and then suspended the process.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Territorial integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yugoslavia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_visit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State visit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_Serb_Municipalities", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Community of Serb Municipalities"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pristina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pristina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pristina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "dateEnd": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 592, "textEnd": 599}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 15}, {"amb": false, "date": "1999-05-07", "textStart": 731, "textEnd": 742}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-04-19", "textStart": 1321, "textEnd": 1335}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

In a signed article published Tuesday in Serbian newspaper Politika, Xi said NATO blatantly bombed the embassy, killing three journalists Shao Yunhuan, Xu Xinghu and his wife Zhu Ying.\n\nWe should never forget it. The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such a tragic story to happen again. The China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will remain in the common memory of the Chinese and Serbian people and inspire us to take great strides forward, Xi wrote.\n\nBeijing has been increasingly at odds with NATO in recent years, repeatedly accusing it of practicing a Cold War mentality and creating confrontation in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe possible extension of the Aukus security treaty between the United States, Britain and Australia has also drawn the ire of China, which has warned the act would create a NATO-like bloc in the region against it .\n\nThe country has also accused the eastward expansion of transatlantic groups of fueling the war in Ukraine, citing the Belgrade embassy bombing as a precedent.\n\nXi is also expected to celebrate the opening of the Chinese Cultural Center, one of the largest in Europe and built on the site of the former embassy, and the trip will highlight the close relations between Beijing and Belgrade.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry said Xi would discuss improving relations between the two sides during his meeting with his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vui.\n\nBeijing considers Serbia an ironclad friend, a title it has only offered to a handful of its most trusted countries, such as Pakistan and Cambodia.\n\nChina was also Serbia's second-largest arms supplier between 2020 and 2023, behind Russia, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nVladisavljev said promoting close ties with Russia became less popular in Serbia after Ukraine's invasion, leaving a void that China could fill.\n\nSerbia is a safe choice [for the trip], he said. This is a visit to a friendly country, where the Chinese president will be warmly welcomed.\n\nHe said both sides should celebrate the milestones achieved, but they should also announce a new joint project.\n\nHe also hopes Vui will use Xi's visit, which he described as one of the highest-profile visits in years, to try to secure a much-needed political victory on the national stage.\n\nAccording to him, this is due to the development of several scenarios that were considered a loss, especially the one regarding relations with Kosovo.\n\nMeanwhile, Serbia has struggled to counter broad support across Europe for Kosovo's membership in international institutions such as the Council of Europe, fearing that this amounts to recognition of its independence .\n\nThe two countries can also support each other on territorial issues, with neither country recognizing the independence of Kosovo or Taiwan.\n\nEconomic ties are also strong, with China becoming Serbia's second largest trading partner, behind Germany, according to official Serbian figures.\n\nThe two countries signed a free trade agreement last year after just a few months of negotiations and China is now the country's main source of foreign investment.\n\nBelgrade was one of the first European countries to join the Belt and Road Initiative and has become an important hub and gateway to Europe for the global infrastructure development strategy.\n\nAmong the highest-profile investments that resulted were a previously loss-making steel mill in Smederevo, which began generating profits six months after being bought by Hebei's HBIS Group, and the flagship rail link between Belgrade and the Hungarian capital. Budapest.\n\nWang, of Renmin University, said the railway would be a priority for Xi's European tour.\n\nThe Hungary-Serbia railway represents a huge boost for European infrastructure, he said. In the future, cooperation between China and Europe in investment, manufacturing and localization will also need to be strengthened.\n\nHungary will be the final stop on Xi's European tour, between Wednesday and Friday. This is his first visit as head of state.\n\nAs the EU and NATO have both taken a tougher line on Beijing, Hungary's support as a member of both groups has become increasingly important to China.\n\nChina's top diplomat, Wang Yi, last week urged Hungary to promote a rational and friendly view of China after it assumes the bloc's rotating presidency in July.\n\nThe EU's perception of China has changed, said Shi Zhiqin, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University.\n\nIf everything emphasizes security, that is, it becomes too secure and politicized, then many opportunities for cooperation will be lost, which is not in line with the current trend of globalization, he said. he declared.\n\nFollowing a recent visit to Beijing, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto announced additional funding for railway projects under the Belt and Road Initiative, as well as an investment of 22 million dollars from Chinese state-owned Fiberhome Telecom Tech to build a base in the country for the production of optical cables. .\n\nShi said he hoped the tour would deepen existing relations with Serbia and Hungary and lead to even better cooperation in the future.\n\nEarlier this week, Xi was in France to mark the 60th and 75th anniversaries of China's establishment of diplomatic relations with Paris and Budapest, respectively.\n\nBut beyond this symbolism, Vladisavljev said the entire visit would provide a litmus test for the current state of Europe's perception of China.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

However, during the late 1990s, declining competitiveness and poor management pushed the plant to the verge of closure.\n\nIn 2016, China's HBIS Group acquired the Smederevo Steel Mill. It was later renamed Hesteel Serbia.\n\nJust in a couple of months, the steel mill began to make profit thanks to China's advanced technology and management systems, ensuring job security for over 5,000 employees and bringing peace and prosperity to thousands of families.\n\nRecently, 30 Serbian workers from the steel mill wrote a letter to President Xi Jinping, introducing the recent development of the mill and expressing their gratitude for his support in facilitating the project's success.\n\nOn April 29, Xi replied to the Serbian workers of the Hesteel Serbia, encouraging them to make new contributions to the China-Serbia friendship.\n\n\"I didn't expect President Xi Jinping to reply so quickly!\" exclaimed Nenad Cvetanovic, a steel plant worker.

However, during the late 1990s, declining competitiveness and poor management pushed the plant to the verge of closure.\n\nIn 2016, China's HBIS Group acquired the Smederevo Steel Mill. It was later renamed Hesteel Serbia.\n\nJust in a couple of months, the steel mill began to make profit thanks to China's advanced technology and management systems, ensuring job security for over 5,000 employees and bringing peace and prosperity to thousands of families.\n\nRecently, 30 Serbian workers from the steel mill wrote a letter to President Xi Jinping, introducing the recent development of the mill and expressing their gratitude for his support in facilitating the project's success.\n\nOn April 29, Xi replied to the Serbian workers of the Hesteel Serbia, encouraging them to make new contributions to the China-Serbia friendship.\n\n\"I didn't expect President Xi Jinping to reply so quickly!\" exclaimed Nenad Cvetanovic, a steel plant worker.

During the visit, President Xi attended a grand welcoming ceremony held by President Vu\u010di\u0107 and the two presidents held talks before jointly meeting the press. The two heads of state announced the decision of deepening and upgrading the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Serbia and of building a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era.\n\nPresident Xi noted that the ironclad friendship between China and Serbia has stood the test of changing international environment with its deep roots in history, solid political foundation, extensive common interests and great affinity between the two peoples. In recent years, bilateral relations have achieved leapfrog development and historical results. Under the new circumstances, Serbia becomes the first European country to build a community with a shared future with China. This speaks volumes about the strategic, special and high-level relationship between the two countries. The two sides should focus on the strategic nature of the relations between the two countries and grasp the general direction of the bilateral relationship; adhere to the pragmatic nature of the cooperation between the two countries for the benefit of the people of the two countries; carry forward the innovative nature of the relations between the two countries, open up new prospects for cooperation, and turn innovative cooperation into a new growth point of the bilateral relations.\n\nPresident Xi announced the first batch of six practical steps China will take to support the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era. First, as a result of the two sides' joint efforts, the China-Serbia Free Trade Agreement will take effect on July 1 this year. Second, China supports Serbia in hosting the Specialized Expo 2027, and will send a delegation to attend the event. Chinese businesses will also be encouraged to take part in relevant construction projects. Third, China will import more high-quality agricultural specialties from Serbia. Procedures for the export of dried plums and blueberry to China have already been completed, and the restrictions related to highly pathogenic avian influenza have been lifted. Fourth, China will support 50 young Serbian scientists in taking part in scientific research exchange in China in the next three years. Fifth, China will invite 300 young Serbians to study in China in the next three years. Sixth, China welcomes the opening of direct flights from Belgrade to Shanghai by Serbia, and encourages the two countries' airlines to open direct flights from Belgrade to Guangzhou.\n\nThe two presidents signed the Joint Statement on Deepening and Elevating the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and Building a China-Serbia Community with a Shared Future in the New Era. They also witnessed the exchange of multiple cooperation documents including on Belt and Road cooperation, green development, digital economy, e-commerce, infrastructure, economic and technical cooperation, information and communication, agri-food, and the media.\n\nAs President Xi Jinping stressed, the China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era is an upgrade of the ironclad friendship between China and Serbia. It also represents our common values and objectives, namely joint pursuit of development, win-win corporation and mutual success. These are the common aspirations of China, Serbia, and all countries that are committed to independence, peace and development. China will work with Serbia, share weal and woe like passengers in the same boat, carry forward the spirit of the ironclad friendship, maintain and grow our friendship, and jointly safeguard the fundamental and long-term interests of the two countries. As the two sides pursue their respective national development and revitalization, China will join hands with Serbia to advance the building of a community with a shared future in the new era.\n\nTV Asahi: A video footage that was shot by a drone over a Japanese destroyer of Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force was shared online in China. However, flying a drone over the Self-Defense Forces' bases without permission is prohibited by law in Japan. Sources at Japan's Defense Ministry said the footage is likely to be authentic. What's your comment?\n\nLin Jian: I don't know where the footage you mentioned came from.\n\nChina Review News: International Monetary Fund First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath said on May 7 that escalating tensions between the US and China have caused global ripples and countries are reevaluating their trading and investment partners based on economic and national security concerns, leaving the world divided into three blocs: a US leaning bloc, a China leaning bloc, and a bloc of nonaligned countries. The trend of economic fragmentation may lead to a broad retreat from the rule-based global trading system and a significant reversal of the gains from economic integration. She mentioned that the US and China need pragmatic steps to rebuild trust. The first step is to keep open the lines of communication. Dialogue between the US and China can help prevent the worst outcomes from occurring. What's China's comment?\n\nLin Jian: As President Xi Jinping stressed, we live in an interdependent world and rise and fall together. With their interests deeply intertwined, all countries need to build maximum consensus for win-win and all-win outcomes. This is the basic starting point for China to view the world and the China-US relationship. To overstretch the concept of national security, and weaken or sever one's economic ties with other countries leads nowhere, and will only destabilize global industrial and supply chains, disrupt international trade order, and end up harming one's own interests. The US needs to act on its commitment of not seeking to hold back China's economic growth and create an enabling environment for its relations with China and cooperation in various fields.\n\nThe world economy faces the risk of fragmentation and confrontation, but more importantly, it is presented with opportunities for solidarity and cooperation. The course of history will be shaped by the choices we make. In the face of rising unilateralism and protectionism, China advocates a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. We will always choose solidarity and cooperation, and stand on the side of openness and mutual benefit. We stand ready to work with the rest of the world to uphold the international system with the UN at its core and the multilateral trading system centered on the WTO, and strive for a world with a common purpose and a shared pursuit for global development.\n\nChina Daily: It is reported that the elected-leader Lai Ching-te of the Taiwan region said that he looks forward to strengthening cooperation with Japan after May 20 and that any contingency for Taiwan is a contingency for Japan and vice versa. What's China's comment?\n\nLin Jian:\u2002\"Any contingency for Taiwan is a contingency for Japan.\" This is a dangerous but apparently miscalculated notion preached by some in Japan. By repeating and hyping that rhetoric, the DPP authorities are essentially telling the world that their underlying logic is to ingratiate themselves with Japan, sell Taiwan out and seek \"Taiwan independence\" through soliciting foreign support. It once again reminds people that \"Taiwan independence\" and foreign interference are the biggest undermining factor for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Let me stress that the one-China principle is a universal consensus. No separatist attempt for \"Taiwan independence\" will get anywhere, whatever its form or pretext.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"},

This is what makes summer the season of hope. I will pay a state visit to the Republic of Serbia at the invitation of President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107. This will be my second visit to your country, a land of beauty and legends, as President of the People's Republic of China. The sweet scenes that prevailed during my last visit eight years ago remain very much alive in my mind. The close cooperation between our two countries over the past eight years has delivered fruitful outcomes. I look forward to meeting with President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 and other Serbian leaders and friends to renew our friendship, explore ways of cooperation, and make the ironclad friendship between China and Serbia more dynamic.\n\nThere has always been an affinity between Chinese and Serbian peoples despite the long distance between us. During the bitter Anti-Fascist War and our respective nation-building in the last century, the Chinese and Serbian peoples forged a strong friendship that extends through time and space. Amid the ongoing transformations unseen in a century in the world, our mutual support remains as strong as ever, our cooperation is closer, and our exchanges and mutual learning more substantive. Whatever changes in the international landscape, China and Serbia remain true friends and good partners. Our ironclad friendship is ever-growing, setting a model for state-to-state and people-to-people interactions.\n\nOur two countries have always respected and trusted each other. President Vu\u010di\u0107 and I have developed a good working relationship through our meetings, phone calls, and exchanges of letters. Our two countries have also maintained frequent exchanges at all levels and in all areas. We fully appreciate and respect the development paths that our respective nation has chosen. We uphold fairness and justice, firmly support each other on issues that bear on our respective core interests and are of major concern to us. We have kept close and smooth coordination and collaboration at the bilateral and multilateral levels. We have built an ever stronger comprehensive strategic partnership that is delivering tangible outcomes.\n\nOur two countries have stayed committed to mutual benefit. Serbia is China's first free trade partner in Central and Eastern Europe. Last year, China was Serbia's largest source of foreign investment and its second largest trading partner. Our thriving cooperation in trade and economic relations, industrial chain, and infrastructure development lends a great boost to our respective process of modernization. In 2016, I visited the Smederevo steel plant of HBIS Serbia, which has become one of the three biggest export companies in Serbia. Serbian honey, red wine, beef, lamb and other agricultural products are very popular among Chinese consumers.\n\nOur two countries have always helped each other. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, I spoke with President Vu\u010di\u0107 twice on the phone and we agreed on a collaborative response to the pandemic. China provided assistance, prioritized the provision of multiple shipments of protective medical supplies, and sent medical experts to Serbia. On its part, Serbia provided full support to China in implementing its \"Spring Sprout\" program to vaccinate Chinese citizens living and working in Serbia. Nongovernmental organizations in Serbia voluntarily donated masks and other supplies to the Chinese people. Our mutual support in challenging times testifies to our invaluable brotherly friendship.\n\nOur two countries have always been learning from each other. We are both committed to delivering a better life for our peoples and making our countries strong and prosperous. We have implemented many programs to share experience in governance, and have enhanced exchanges between our political parties. Our peoples have warm feelings toward each other, as evidenced by the robust cultural, sports, tourism and people-to-people exchanges. Nikola Joki\u0107, the Serbian basketball superstar, personally cheered on players of Chinese rural basketball games. China and Serbia have agreed on a mutual visa-free arrangement for ordinary passport holders, which facilitates people-to-people exchanges and bilateral cooperation.\n\nA Chinese axiom goes, \"Friends are those who are like-minded.\" And Serbians would say, \"Friends are the greatest asset in life.\" The long-lasting friendship and win-win cooperation between China and Serbia makes it clear to us that a stronger bilateral relationship conforms with the trend of history and serves the best interests of our two peoples. It also helps promote our common progress. On the new journey of the new era, the China-Serbia comprehensive strategic partnership has more potential for further growth. During my upcoming visit, I will work with my Serbian friends to bring out the best in our ironclad friendship and take real efforts to deliver more benefits to our two peoples, advance world peace and development, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\nWe should always be good friends and treat each other with sincerity. We will deepen and expand our comprehensive strategic partnership. We will continue to show each other understanding, trust, support and assistance. We will remain steadfast in supporting each other on issues that bear on our respective core interests and are of major concern to us. China respects and supports the development path that the Serbian people have chosen of their own will. We support Serbia's efforts to uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and oppose any attempt by any forces to interfere in Serbia's internal affairs.\n\nWe should always be good partners for win-win cooperation. China is striving for its modernization in all respects through high-quality development, and moving faster to develop new quality productive forces. Serbia has achieved remarkable economic and social development in recent years. Our two countries should further unleash the potential of our mutually beneficial cooperation. We should deliver on the midterm action plan for Belt and Road cooperation, and build more flagship projects. We should expand cooperation in technological innovation, advanced manufacturing, green energy, digital economy, artificial intelligence and other emerging areas. We should share development opportunities and create a better future together.\n\nWe should always play an exemplary role in promoting fairness and justice. As ironclad friends and defenders for world peace, China and Serbia hold similar positions on many major international and regional issues. Facing a fluid and turbulent world, we should step up coordination and cooperation in the United Nations and other international organizations, and advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. We should practice true multilateralism, and endeavor to maintain world peace and stability and safeguard international fairness and justice.\n\nWe should always strengthen the heart-to-heart connection between our two peoples. Our ironclad friendship has withstood the test of blood and fire, and shines even brighter in the new era. We should promote multi-dimensional people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and diversify subnational cooperation. We should make good use of the combined effect of \"mutual visa exemption plus direct flights\" as well as our respective cultural centers to promote cooperation in education, sports, culture and tourism. We should create more opportunities for our youth so that the China-Serbia friendship will be carried forward from generation to generation.\n\nTwenty-five years ago today, NATO flagrantly bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese journalists-Ms. Shao Yunhuan, Mr. Xu Xinghu and his wife Zhu Ying. This we should never forget. The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself. The China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides.\n\nWhile looking back at the journey our two countries have traveled together, we also look forward to the promising future we aspire to embrace. We have now come to a new historic milestone. We on the Chinese side are ready to work hand in hand with our Serbian friends to make our shared aspiration and common progress a reality. Together we will write a new chapter in the development and rejuvenation of our nations. Together we will build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era. Flowers in spring will turn into fruits in autumn. The tree of China-Serbia friendship will grow tall and sturdy and bear more fruits for our two peoples. This is what we expect and what we hope to witness together. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Over the past decade, the two countries have carried out extensive cooperation in culture, education, tourism, sports, and other fields, building a solid foundation for people-to-people exchanges.\n\nA math class is given in an intelligent classroom at the Center for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence in Education in Belgrade, Serbia. (People's Daily/Liu Zhonghua)\n\nNestling among green trees, a three-story white teaching building stands at the Faculty of Teacher Education, University of Belgrade. On an exterior wall of the building, there are national flags of China and Serbia.\n\nDanimir Mandic, dean of the Faculty of Teacher Education, University of Belgrade, told People's Daily, \"With the help of our Chinese friends, we now have one of the most advanced digital education and artificial intelligence (AI) technology laboratory in the Balkan region.\"\n\nThe laboratory Mandic referred to is the Center for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence in Education (hereafter referred to as \"the Center\") located in the white teaching building. In January 2020, NetDragon Websoft Holdings Ltd., a leading Chinese education and gaming provider, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Serbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development to collaborate on projects related to educational software, hardware, value-added services, and online intelligent learning platforms, with an aim to make Serbia's education more intelligent and digitalized. The Center is one of the important components of such collaboration.\n\nIn an intelligent classroom of the Center, People's Daily reporters experienced one of the most cutting-edge technologies: with the help of virtual reality goggles, tasks such as circuit testing and reagent handling in physical and chemical experiments can be simulated by operating the controller; upon detection of mis-operations, notifications are displayed on a screen, ensuring authenticity and safety.\n\nThere is an innovative educational lab within the Center, equipped with a variety of educational tools, such as intelligent homework assessment and analysis software, language learning software, and sandbox games. It also comes with an AI assistant that answers students' questions.\n\nYoung Serbians learn to cook Chinese dishes at the Chinese Cultural Center in Belgrade, Serbia. (People's Daily/Xie Yahong)\n\nMandic said that since the establishment of the Center, the Chinese side has fully leveraged its technological advantages to support Serbia in developing local educational resources with the help of AI assistants and robots.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Serbian version of an online learning software co-developed by China and Serbia played a crucial role in enabling remote teaching at major Serbian universities and ensuring the learning of students.\n\nThe Center has also established cloud technology partnership with Chinese companies such as Huawei. Mandic said that in the previous semester, many primary schools in Serbia started using smart screens manufactured by China, which has greatly enhanced students' digital skills.\n\nIn a cooking classroom at the Chinese Cultural Center in Belgrade (hereafter referred to as \"the Chinese Cultural Center\"), an engaging cooking class was staged, during which a Chinese chef demonstrated his expertise in cooking authentic Chinese dishes and made Kung Pao Chicken on the spot.\n\nIn May 2023, a Luban Workshop was established at the Chinese Cultural Center by Tourism College of Zhejiang and Academy of Applied Studies Belgrade. It is reported that both China and Serbia are working on localizing Chinese cooking textbooks and integrating relevant courses into the local vocational education system. They also plan to provide professional training in Chinese cuisine development and production, along with catering services for Chinese restaurant staff in Serbia.\n\nA student wearing traditional Chinese costume poses for a picture at the first traditional Chinese clothing festival held by the Confucius Institute at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia, in September 2023. (Photo courtesy of the Confucius Institute at the University of Novi Sa)\n\nIn recent years, the cultural and tourism cooperation between China and Serbia has achieved fruitful results, strengthening the bond between the two peoples. Two years after the visa exemption agreement between the two countries came into effect in 2017, China became the largest source of inbound tourists for Serbia.

Something that MAIN STREAM MEDIA DOESN'T LIKE TO REPORT ABOUT AND DIDN'T REPORT ABOUT.\n\nFuture Chinese ambassador Chen Bo visited me in Novo mesto city when I was in the\n\nsecond or third grade of high school at the age 16 when I selected her and some other Chinese female as a potential girlfriend I would want to date. That was back in 1986.\n\nChen Bo then appeared at times in the background of MK Ultra - After 1992/1993 Belgrade incident https://ausertimes.blogspot.com/2024/05/it-appears-to-me-china-is-in-search-of.html which alarmed entire Serbian parliament, the two Chinese sexy babes with whom I had a great time were dismissed - the two were most likely sent back to China and what made me extremely disappointed as I no longer would see them. But Chinese government officials went on to suggest me to worry not as they have replacement for the two which was Chen Bo who begun to travel to Belgrade often times whenever I was brought to Chinese embassy in Belgrade. She appeared to me more and more was there to witness about my failed attempts to jump in the pants of other girls and what made me feel just to waste more time. Game without results which begun to anger me. She had me at the university in China but nothing ever happened and I eventually got tired of seeing her due to number of other females. Chinese supplied Serbian politicians on frequent bases with Chinese beauty and not for marriages, but just for a good time - entertainment. And while got as many as they wanted, I was told I have to marry first one that is offered what I further disagreed with.\n\nBased on her account, she offered me marriage in China upon graduation but I no longer was interested - I got to meet her father and mom who got quite angry with me.\n\nOn a night of bombing, she and the rest of the Chinese staff were hiding in the designated area of the building where told to hide during bombing campaign at least two months ahead of the bombing - their boss was a male Chinese who was extremely loud even aggressive with everybody - including own workers who had to learn to listen/obey due to what one gestured me their lives/survival - he was right.\n\nShe was promoted from assistant ambassador into ambassador based on the personal sacrifice on the night of bombing is what I was told/repeated - due to bravery she passed what Chinese side referred to as the test.\n\nAs for Ljubi\u0161a Risti\u0107 - a tall slender man with mustaches exactly as you see. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 employed one in 1995 to deliver me at Chinese embassy after I no longer was willing to put up with violence(two ultra aggressive chetniks were fired - one appeared to me was even a regular drunk - a police officer who would at times even get to sleep with some Chinese lady if lucky enough). Once Risti\u0107 was given to me, I tried to employ Risti\u0107 but he demanded from me to simply marry one which I refused on what he proceeded to yell at me that I am wasting his time that he is serious family man etc. Man who have no time to loose with guys like myself while also flirting on the side with ladies - Risti\u0107 was a married man. I think Risti\u0107 got married probably in 1990 or something like this and has one daughter and perhaps one more or even two kids ...Risti\u0107 must have been involved for already very very long time probably since his military service...Risti\u0107 claimed me have pulled wounded people from the embassy - saved lives and went on to claim that whole thing was videorecorded and i shouldn't bother to say anything for that matter that would defer from official account.\n\nChen Bo had a room on the third floor, but in reality a Chinese ambassador at the time also had house rented for Chinese staff right next door to embassy. Just so you know...they owned more than Chinese embassy ;)\n\nI liked that Chinese male ambassador and he liked me, but he was afraid to get to close to me and was concentrated instead on work.\n\nFrom https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3262053/xi-jinping-skips-site-1999-nato-bombing-serbia-visit-seen-calculated-move-avoid-stoking-tension-west\n\nVisit 'shows Xi does not want to overly irritate the US, or put his Serbian hosts in a difficult position' with the EU, says analystBut timing the visit to coincide with the anniversary of deaths of three Chinese journalists is in itself viewed as a message to US-led WestShi Jiangtao+ FOLLOWPublished: 6:30pm, 9 May 2024Chinese President Xi Jinping inspects the Serbian Army honour guard during a welcome ceremony in Belgrade on Wednesday.

Serbian hosts in a difficult position' with the EU, says analystBut timing the visit to coincide with the anniversary of deaths of three Chinese journalists is in itself viewed as a message to US-led WestShi Jiangtao+ FOLLOWPublished: 6:30pm, 9 May 2024Why you can trust SCMPListen to this articleA decision by President Xi Jinping not to visit China's former embassy in Belgrade on the 25th anniversary of Nato's bombing of the site has been described as a \"calculated move\" to avoid stoking tensions with the US-led West.The omission from Xi's itinerary of the bombing site, which he toured during his first state visit to Serbia in 2016, came as a surprise to many watching the Chinese leader's trip to Serbia this week.\n\nThree Chinese journalists were killed when US-led Nato used missiles to attack the embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, prompting a major crisis between Beijing and Washington, which the latter insisted was a \"tragic mistake\".\n\nDeng Yuwen, former deputy editor of the Communist Party's flagship newspaper Study Times, said Xi's no-show at the bombing site was due, in part, to his tight schedule during the Serbian visit.\n\n\"But, of course, it also shows Xi does not want to overly irritate the US, or put his Serbian hosts in a difficult position,\" he said. \"If Xi went ahead with a speech commemorating the anniversary on top of a much-anticipated visit to the site, the European Union would probably put pressure on Serbia.\"\n\nWhile Serbia is seen as one of the most China-friendly countries in Europe, especially after Nato's bombing of the former Yugoslavia between March and June 1999, it is one of the six Western Balkan countries applying for EU membership.\n\nShen Dingli, an expert on international relations in Shanghai, said Beijing obviously did not want to embarrass Belgrade, which \"would join the EU and Nato sooner or later\".\n\n\"It is clear that China does not want to further alienate itself at a time when Beijing has already edged closer toward Russia during Moscow's invasion of Ukraine,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ausertimes.blogspot.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This comes after Xi timed his arrival in Serbia on Tuesday to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the bombing, where US missiles killed three Chinese journalists in a strike the White House later called a mistake and blamed on faulty maps.\n\nThe Chinese leader penned an op-ed published in Serbia's Politika newspaper on the day of his arrival vowing to \"never forget\" the attack, raising expectations that he might visit the site of the US bombing. The omission of a public visit could signal some restraint from Beijing as it seeks to prevent ties with the West from deteriorating further.\n\nRelations between China and the US have stabilized over the past year, as a series of diplomatic exchanges put guardrails on a relationship rocked by disagreements over trade and human rights issues.\n\nXi's Serbia visit is part of a three-leg tour that included stops in France and Hungary aimed at promoting his country's potential as a trade partner. He last visited Serbia in 2016, when he became China's first leader to pay his respects at the site of the former embassy.\n\nDuring his latest stay in Belgrade, Xi portrayed more trade with China as an inevitable direction of progress as both countries signed a total of 28 agreements to cooperate on e-commerce, geology and minerals, and other areas.\n\nXi landed in Hungary on Wednesday, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban is seeking to expand economic ties with China, including by broadening Hungary's participation in the Belt and Road Initiative to include further rail modernization projects as well as the financing of a new crude pipeline connecting it with Serbia.", "source": {"uri": "thestandard.com.hk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO bombing of Yugoslavia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramount leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politika", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belt and Road Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.thestandard.com.hk/images/instant_news/20240509/20240509161656contentPhoto1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

We should never forget it, he added. We will never allow such a tragic story to happen again.\n\nDuring NATO's 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia, U.S. missiles killed three Chinese journalists in a strike that the White House later called a mistake and blamed on faulty maps. The event sparked widespread anti-US protests across China and cemented Beijing's distrust of US-led groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nXi's visit to Serbia exactly a quarter of a century after the attack is part of a three-leg tour that includes stops in France and Hungary. China's leader is trying to convince European nations that his country's huge economy is too big to turn away, as Brussels unleashes a salvo of trade probes and aligns with Washington over concerns about capacity China and national security risks.\n\nAdding to the political theater, Xi will be in Europe on the same day as Russian President Vladimir Putin is inaugurated for his fifth term, as concern grows in Western Europe over his war in Ukraine.\n\nXi's criticism of NATO helps explain why his government supports the Kremlin following its invasion. Chinese officials have repeatedly referenced the bombing of Belgrade in recent years, as Beijing has expressed solidarity with the Russian position that NATO aggression on its borders necessitates war.\n\nU.S. and European leaders have urged Xi to use his relationship with Putin to end what German Chancellor Olaf Scholz recently called a senseless war during a trip to Beijing.\n\nXi told his French counterpart in Paris on Monday that he opposed the war in Ukraine being used to shift blame to a third country, tarnish its image and incite a new Cold War. President Emmanuel Macron reiterated that there can be no security in Europe without security in Ukraine.\n\nTies between China and Serbia, which is not an EU member, have strengthened under Xi, even as Beijing's broader relationship with Europe deteriorates over human rights issues and trade conflicts.\n\nIn the Politika article, Xi writes that the friendship between Beijing and Belgrade was

Over the past decade, the two countries have carried out extensive cooperation in culture, education, tourism, sports, and other fields, building a solid foundation for people-to-people exchanges.\n\nNestling among green trees, a three-story white teaching building stands at the Faculty of Education, University of Belgrade. On an exterior wall of the building, there are national flags of China and Serbia.\n\nDanimir Mandic, dean of the Faculty of Education, University of Belgrade, told People's Daily, \"With the help of our Chinese friends, we now have one of the most advanced digital education and artificial intelligence (AI) technology laboratory in the Balkan region.\"\n\nThe laboratory Mandic referred to is the Center for Robotics Artificial Intelligence in Education (hereafter referred to as \"the Center\") located in the white teaching building. In January 2020, NetDragon Websoft Holdings Ltd., a leading Chinese education and gaming provider, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Serbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development to collaborate on projects related to educational software, hardware, value-added services, and online intelligent learning platforms, with an aim to make Serbia's education more intelligent and digitalized. The Center is one of the important components of such collaboration.\n\nIn an intelligent classroom of the Center, People's Daily reporters experienced one of the most cutting-edge technologies: with the help of virtual reality goggles, tasks such as circuit testing and reagent handling in physical and chemical experiments can be simulated by operating the controller; upon detection of mis-operations, notifications are displayed on a screen, ensuring authenticity and safety.\n\nThere is an innovative educational lab within the Center, equipped with a variety of educational tools, such as intelligent homework assessment and analysis software, language learning software, and sandbox games. It also comes with an AI assistant that answers students' questions.\n\nMandic said that since the establishment of the Center, the Chinese side has fully leveraged its technological advantages to support Serbia in developing local educational resources with the help of AI assistants and robots.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Serbian version of an online learning software co-developed by China and Serbia played a crucial role in enabling remote teaching at major Serbian universities and ensuring the learning of students.\n\nThe Center has also established cloud technology partnership with Chinese companies such as Huawei. Mandic said that in the previous semester, many primary schools in Serbia started using smart screens manufactured by China, which has greatly enhanced students' digital skills.\n\nIn a cooking classroom at the Chinese Cultural Center in Belgrade (hereafter referred to as \"the Chinese Cultural Center\"), an engaging cooking class was staged, during which a Chinese chef demonstrated his expertise in cooking authentic Chinese dishes and made Kung Pao Chicken on the spot.\n\nIn May 2023, a Luban Workshop was established at the Chinese Cultural Center by Tourism College of Zhejiang and Belgrade College of Applied Technology. It is reported that both China and Serbia are working on localizing Chinese cooking textbooks and integrating relevant courses into the local vocational education system. They also plan to provide professional training in Chinese cuisine development and production, along with catering services for Chinese restaurant staff in Serbia.\n\nIn recent years, the cultural and tourism cooperation between China and Serbia has achieved fruitful results, strengthening the bond between the two peoples. Two years after the visa exemption agreement between the two countries came into effect in 2017, China became the largest source of inbound tourists for Serbia.

Not the one between Serbia and the European Union, but between Serbia and China. These are the words of the Serbian president, Happy Alexanderchose to welcome his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, today (May 8) in Belgrade as part of his European tour which also took him to Paris and Budapest. It was a scene loaded with symbolism for Serbian-Chinese relations (it marks the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of Belgrade, which also hit the Chinese embassy), whose tones once again more highlighted Vui's distance from the line that Union he would like to join tries (with difficulty) to hold on towards Beijing.\n\n\"China has never turned its back on Serbia; they supported us even 25 years ago; you are always welcome in your second home,\" said the to welcome with all honors to the Chinese president by the Serbian leader, referring to the NATO bombings in spring 1999 condemned by Beijing. An attitude which does not completely hide numerous provocations towards the European Union, both in terms of foreign and economic policy. \"As a small country, we face pressure from all sides due to the autonomous policy we pursue.. We ask for your support\", is Vui's request to one of the countries that causes the most concern in Brussels, with an implicit reference to the non-alignment of EU sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. Over the past two years, the Serbian president has had to find a balance not to become the pariah of Europe, totally opposing the EU's hard line towards the Kremlin, but at the same time to not be forced to break ties with Moscow by adopting international sanctions. And it is precisely thanks to Chinese support (and Beijing's ambiguity towards Russia) that Vui is able to carve out space for maneuver that would otherwise be untenable.conversely demonstrating the immobility of the EU to take countermeasures.\n\nAnother issue on which Serbia finds support from China is undoubtedly that of territorial sovereignty and the non-recognition of the independence of Kosovo (unilaterally declared in 2008), despite the fact that Brussels has been engaged in the mediation of a very difficult dialogue for the normalization of relations between Belgrade and Belgrade. and Pristina for more than ten years. \"The two countries firmly support each other's interests on the basis of sound political relations,\" Xi Jinping confirmed.China supports Serbia in defending its independence and development.\" Also on this front, it is more viable for the Serbian leader to continue to obstruct what has been negotiated diplomatically with Brussels, while the Union seems incapable of reacting with the same rigidity it has shown towards from Pristina. For Beijing, the bargaining chip is the recognition of Taiwan as an integral part of China.a question which is not particularly thorny in Belgrade: \"We are faithful friends\", confirmed Vui on another question of distance from the prudence that the European Union rather seeks (always keeping in mind that Serbia is a candidate country for membership).\n\nThen there is economic and commercial policy, precisely one of the two questions of \"vital interest\" for the European Union at the center of the trilateral summit on Monday May 6 in Paris between the Chinese president, his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macronand the number one in the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. \"Serbia and China are moving from strategic relations to the common future of our two countries; it is the highest form of cooperation, and I am proud to have been able to sign it today,\" Vui rejoiced, speaking about the Joint Declaration signed today for the strengthening the comprehensive strategic partnership between Beijing and Belgrade: \"It charts the direction of development of our bilateral relations.\" The two leaders signed a total of 28 agreements and memorandums of understanding ranging from infrastructure to culture, sports to technology, including the purchase of nine electric trains for the Balkan country's railways, while that the Belgrade-Budapest high-speed railway will be completed by 2026 with China. support and whose trajectory cannot fail to worry Brussels: \"Serbia becomes the first European country with which we will build a community for a common future\", added the Chinese president.\n\nTo conclude the roundup of cryptic statements, even outright provocations against the European Union, President Vui also made a point of emphasizing that China \"is our largest investor and our second largest trading partner.\" with Belgrade's exports to Beijing having \"increased 140-fold over the past ten years, and with the free trade agreement [of October 2023, ed.] we will be able to export almost 95 percent of the products we produce without customs duties. The Serbian leader, however, forgot to mention the commercial value of this relationship and the abysmal difference with the issues with the EU: if in 2022, China moved 5.8 billion (in euros) between exports (4.7) and imports (1.1), in the same year, Serbia imported 21.39 billion and exported 17.69 billion to the EU, for a total of 39.08 billion.

On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Paris, where he met with French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to make the case that engagement with China is a net good.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, came the postscript: Xi visited Serbia to mark the anniversary of the 1999 bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade by five stray NATO rockets, amid the occupation of Kosovo. The implication that interference by NATO and, by extension, its main sponsor, the United States, is detrimental to local interests was clear even before Xi made it clear in a statement. letter published by the Serbian newspaper Policy.\n\nTwenty-five years ago today, NATO blatantly bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese journalists, Xi wrote. We should never forget it. The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such a tragic story to happen again.\n\nOf course, China's top communist leadership's preference for the individual over the collective is not reserved just for NATO. Even before Xi landed in Belgrade, the message in Paris was that China was ready to build ties with European nations even as the European Union becomes increasingly problematic. In 2019, the EU called China a systemic rival and criticized Beijing for its human rights abuses, support for Russia's war in Ukraine, spread of disinformation, rampant espionage, economic retaliation against small countries like Lithuania and unfair trade practices.\n\nNo wonder Xi has no time for this block either. On his final stop on Wednesday, Xi landed in Hungary, the EU's most mutinous member, whose openly illiberal Prime Minister Viktor Orbn is a staunch supporter of Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Hungary played a very important role in call EU sanctions against China over the issues of Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan, says Wang Yiwei, professor of international affairs at Renmin University in Beijing. China appreciates Hungarian behavior and will invest in this close cooperation.\n\nIt is telling that Hungary received $11.5 billion in Chinese investment in 2023 alone. It is home to the largest foreign logistics and manufacturing base of controversial Chinese telecommunications company Huawei and will soon also host the first European factory of electric vehicle giant BYD, based in Shenzhen. Chinese investments in Serbia have reached almost 20 billion dollars over the past decade, government figures show, with Beijing and Belgrade signing a free trade deal last year. China is also building a high-speed railway linking Belgrade and Bucharest, as part of Xi's Belt and Road Initiative. Xis courting the region's two most Europe-skeptical nations is a proven model for defending bilateral relations at multi-party forums.\n\nIt is not just countries on the fringes of the EU that are likely to be incentivized by the world's second-largest economy. In Paris, von der Leyen pressed Xi on trade imbalances, calling Chinese state subsidies that lead to low-cost exports a matter of great concern that threatens European jobs. (Xi refused to admit that China had an overcapacity problem.) The 27 EU members recorded a merchandise trade deficit of $314.72 billion with China in 2023, according to Eurostat data , which, although down from the previous year, remains the second highest on record. . Europe will not hesitate to make the difficult decisions necessary to protect its economy and security, von der Leyen said.\n\nPerhaps it was wishful thinking. In September, Von der Leyen announced a investigation in subsidies to help Chinese production of electric vehicles, prompting Beijing to float customs duties on French brandy as possible retaliation. This is naturally a bigger problem for Macron, who was only too happy to charm Xi, delving into his own playbook of building personal relationships with Xi. even antagonistic World leaders. After pomp and pageantry at the Elysee Palace in Paris, the French president thanked Xi for his openness on the provisional measures on French cognac and his wish not to see them applied, before giving him some prized bottles: a Hennessy XO and a R\u00e9my. Martin Louis XIII.\n\nMacron then took Xi and their two wives to the mountainous Pyrenees of southwest France, where they were entertained in the pouring rain by a traditional shepherds' dance, before settling down to a lunch of local ham, lamb, cheese and blueberry tart. Macron gave Xi a wool blanket from the Pyrenees, a Tour de France cycling jersey and, tellingly, even more cognac: an Armagnac.\n\nMacron is not the only European leader to move away from the European line in the face of national interests. When German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Beijing with a group of business leaders last month, he pressed Xi on Ukraine and unfair trade practices while avoiding combative language that could undermine imperiling some of the 5,000 German companies active in the Chinese market, a fact that makes Germany, whose economy shrank last year, a big loser from Chinese sanctions against the EU. The European Union plays the role of bad cop and member states like France and Germany are the good cops who understand that China still represents an opportunity, Wang says.\n\nYet when the EU's two largest economies struggle to stay the course, it doesn't exactly project solidarity toward the bloc's smaller members. And individual thinking in Europe is particularly important to Xi, as the continent has bonded with Washington over shared outrage over Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nXi is trying to encourage a Europe more independent from the United States, which fits his vision of a multipolar world and offers more space for the world. [Peoples Republic] in which to operate, says Chong Ja Ian, an expert on Chinese diplomacy and professor at the National University of Singapore.\n\nAdditionally, the possible return of a Trump presidency and the resurgence of transatlantic trade frictions are prompting Xi to step up his engagement now. At the very least, Xi's red carpet treatment in Europe will be grist for China's domestic propaganda mill, portraying the Chinese leader as someone his Western counterparts look up to and beg to solve all their problems. What did Macron or von der Leyen get out of it? Very little at this stage, says Nis Grnberg, senior analyst for politics and society at the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies. The status quo is probably the best we can hope for.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Serbia will pursue a national, responsible foreign policy, extending a hand while preserving dignity. We are in the business of making friends, but we will decisively respond to those who encroach on our interests,\" Djuric said in \"Hit Tvit,\" a program on Pink TV.\n\nHe added that Serbia demonstrated this in recent weeks, particularly in the last ten days when President Aleksandar Vucic defended Serbian national interests in the fight against the Srebrenica resolution.\n\nHe emphasized that the new government is primarily a government of the future.\n\n\"The cabinet of Milos Vucevic projects policies for at least four decades, with projects related to Expo, artificial intelligence, and other fields. With a highly capable staff and guided by President Vucic's vision, it enjoys great legitimacy and has the opportunity to transform Serbia for the better,\" he said.\n\nCommenting on criticism that the Serbian government is \"overly large,\" Djuric noted that it's interesting that this comes from those whose governments had many more ministers, agencies, and other entities.\n\nHe urged them to follow the basic principle of giving any government at least 100 days before making comments or criticizing based on its work.\n\n\"These are basic principles of democracy, but they continue with a quarrelsome tone, without arguments, and with no intention of contributing positively. Citizens have recognized this,\" he said.\n\nHe also mentioned that the government has goals and a vision to achieve them.\n\nIn this regard, he stated that the average salary in Serbia will be \u20ac1,400 by 2027 and that Serbia will implement 320 new projects by 2027.\n\n\"Serbia will be a better place to live. I was away from active politics for three and a half years, but over the past few weeks, based on what I've seen, I cannot believe how much has changed. We shouldn't just criticize; it's necessary to be objective and acknowledge the results,\" the Serbian foreign minister concluded.\n\nThe Serbian government will not neglect traditional friendships\n\nDjuric noted that the new government is one of continuity in a political sense, but also one that brings additional energy.\n\nHe emphasized that the new government will not neglect traditional friendships.\n\n\"We will nurture relationships with China, Russia, and former Non-Aligned Movement nations that helped us secure Expo. We would have never succeeded in obtaining Expo without the support of about ten of these countries. We are committed to continuing the development of relations with the United States, and we will strive to find a balance,\" Djuric said.\n\nHighlighting his long political experience and awareness of what's more popular to say regarding an East-West alignment, he noted that he could always say what resonates with public opinion.\n\n\"But I have the President's support, and I will always choose to speak and convey what serves Serbia's interests, not my own or even those of the party I represent, but Serbia's,\" he emphasized.\n\nHe added that citizens can be confident that a government following President Vucic's vision will not succumb to any pressure.\n\n\"When I say 'policy of freedom,' it's not just a phrase. This government is of medium size, some might call it cumbersome, but it's also inclusive. In extremely challenging times, it has brought together most of the political forces necessary to preserve independence, freedom, and territorial integrity while also advocating for Serbia's progress. Those who've taken a clear East or West stance envy us. We will continue to work so that they keep envying us,\" he conveyed.\n\nThe significance of Xi Jinping's visit to Serbia\n\nCommenting on the upcoming visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Serbia, Djuric said that it's not a mere courtesy when it's said that his visit is a great honor for Serbia, placing Serbia on the map. He added that the people of Serbia won't be disappointed when they see how China will vote in the United Nations on issues important to Serbia.\n\n\"This visit is a great honor for us, and we are delighted about it. The free trade agreement with China is not only a legacy for this generation but for our grandchildren's generation. It's of immense importance that Xi Jinping is coming to Serbia,\" Djuric emphasized.\n\nHe noted that Xi's decision to visit only three European countries -- France, Hungary, and Serbia -- demonstrates that Serbia has an independent policy.\n\n\"Xi Jinping would never visit a country that doesn't make its own decisions. We've taken a principled stance on respecting the territorial integrity of all nations,\" he stated.\n\nAsked about criticisms that by respecting China's territorial integrity, President Vucic gave China free rein to do whatever it wanted with Taiwan, Djuric replied that Serbia prioritizes its own interests.\n\n\"We aim to strengthen cooperation with China in economics and other fields. China has become our second-largest economic partner. The U.S. has China as its number one trading partner, like many other countries from which critics come,\" he said.\n\nHe pointed out that the New York Times reported that Xi Jinping is trying to build closer relations in Europe and has chosen leaders with enough character and political strength to discuss geopolitical issues with.\n\n\"This visit places us on the map, and every investor will note that you can fly directly from Belgrade to New York, Chicago, and, God willing, by the end of the year, Miami, as well as Beijing, Shanghai, and Moscow. We will continue expanding our presence and cooperation with China regardless of whether some Green Party MP criticizes us for it. You won't be disappointed in how China will vote in the UN on issues crucial to us,\" Djuric stated.\n\nHe also noted that the New York Times wrote that since the Chinese embassy in Belgrade was bombed in 1999 during the NATO campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, resulting in Chinese casualties, Xi Jinping plans to send a message about international law violations from here.\n\nTension over Vucic-Macron relationship\n\nCommenting on media reports that the Montenegrin government has decided to amend the draft resolution on Srebrenica, Djuric said that this is unofficial information for now, but that if it happens, it seems like an attempt at \"conscience-cleansing\" to serve domestic politics so as not to appear against brotherly Serbia and to mitigate the decision to vote for the resolution.\n\nHe mentioned that one of the amendments is allegedly about respecting the Dayton Agreement, noting that the Dayton Agreement has been trampled upon since there was no consent from all three ethnic groups, one entity opposes it, and not all victims were accounted for, while honoring the tragedy in Srebrenica. UN rules were violated as there were no consultations about the resolution, neither in our region nor elsewhere.\n\nThe second amendment, according to him, is allegedly about individualizing responsibility and guilt.\n\n\"Serbia will assess relationships regarding the resolution to see who behaves as a friend, who we can consider a friend, and who is a partner. We will strive for new friends, but we will distinguish between them,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked if it's realistic for French President Emmanuel Macron to veto Kosovo's membership in the Council of Europe, as some media have reported, Djuric stated that there's tension surrounding the personal relationship between Presidents Vucic and Macron.\n\n\"Some circles are aware that Vucic spent nearly four hours talking with Macron and that Serbia and France are developing their friendship. Serbia needs a strong ally in the EU. Concerning the Council of Europe and the Srebrenica resolution, superhuman effort has been made. Specifically, the president had 110 different interactions with state leaders in the UN, directly contacting them, calling them, presenting his points, and lobbying skillfully. He's not the only one working on this, though; other government members and the Speaker of the Parliament are involved as well,\" he explained.\n\nAccording to him, the results are apparent since the resolution initially had 192 clear votes in favor, but now that's no longer the case, forcing them to postpone the session once.\n\n\"There will also be quite a few Islamic countries supporting Serbia because they know someone is trying to incite discord between Serbs and Bosniaks and don't want to contribute to tensions, even as we all honor the victims of Srebrenica, Serbian victims, Bosniak victims, and Croatian victims,\" the head of Serbian diplomacy said.\n\nHe emphasized that they are putting forth maximum effort and will continue to do so.\n\n\"President Vucic informed me that despite all his obligations, he may travel to New York for the UN General Assembly session to defend Serbian interests with his head held high, both before and after the vote, regardless of the outcome,\" Djuric stated.", "source": {"uri": "kosovo-online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kosovo Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy",

This is Xi's first visit to Europe in five years. His three-stop itinerary of France, Serbia and Hungary might seem odd in Brussels - but makes complete sense in Beijing. It's designed to\n\nSafe spaces. The three host countries \"all represent different aspects of Xi's hopes to get Europe to take a different attitude towards China\" compared with that of the US, says Rana Mitter, ST Lee Chair in US-Asia Relations at Harvard Kennedy School. They are also probably the most pro-China nations in Europe, as Xi looks to repair damage done by Beijing's support for Russia during its two-year assault on Ukraine.\n\nThey might not take much turning. Belgrade was decorated with Chinese flags for Xi's visit; its president, Aleksandar Vucic, told Chinese state media that \"Taiwan is China - full stop\".\n\nA bombing. Today also marks 25 years since Nato bombs hit the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the Kosovo war, killing three Chinese journalists (the US said at the time that it was an accident due to faulty maps and apologised). Xi said yesterday that China will \"never forget\" the bombing, which created a bond between China and Serbia \"forged with the blood of our compatriots\".\n\nWhole new world. Xi last visited Europe in 2019: a world before Covid-19; before Russia's invasion of Ukraine; before Chinese electric vehicles piled up at European ports.\n\nNow the language in Europe has shifted to \"de-risking\" as Brussels launches investigations into Chinese subsidies for electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels. \"Competition yes, dumping no,\" Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, said last month. \"That must be our motto.\"\n\nItaly became the first G7 country to join the Belt and Road Initiative in 2019 - it left last year.\n\nLicence to chill. Britain and Germany have recently charged six people suspected of spying for China, while Grant Shapps, the UK's defence secretary, told parliament yesterday that state-backed hackers had obtained details of thousands of British military personnel. He named no names, but officials briefed that China was behind the hack (China rejected the claims).\n\nDivide and conquer. \"This trip by Xi Jinping is perhaps one of the most aggressive attempts on the part of the Chinese to actively foment disunity, both within the European Union and within Nato,\" says Evan Medeiros, a former senior director for Asian affairs on America's national security council. \"Xi doesn't want to deal with Brussels. He wants to undermine Brussels.\"\n\nDespite the trip to the mountains (where Macron spent his childhood holidays), Macron didn't seem to secure much from Xi beyond a promise not to slap tariffs on French brandies and support for an \"Olympics truce\". Xi's visit \"again proves that... France and Germany don't really want to rock the boat with Beijing,\" says Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group.\n\nWhat's more.

In an signed article published on Tuesday in the Serbian newspaper Politika, Xi said Nato had \u201cflagrantly\u201d bombed the embassy, killing three journalists \u2013 Shao Yunhuan, Xu Xinghu and his wife Zhu Ying.\n\n\u201cThis we should never forget. The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself. The China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides,\u201d Xi wrote.\n\nBeijing has been increasingly at odds with Nato in recent years, repeatedly accusing it of practising a \u201ccold-war\u201d mentality and creating confrontation in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nThe possible expansion of the Aukus security treaty between the US, Britain and Australia has also drawn the ire of China, which warned that the act would create a Nato-like bloc in the region against it.\n\nThe country has also blamed the transatlantic group\u2019s eastward expansion for fuelling the Ukraine war, invoking the Belgrade embassy bombing as a precedent.\n\nXi is also expected to celebrate the opening of the Chinese Cultural Centre, which is one of the biggest in Europe and built on the site of the former embassy, and the trip will highlight the close relationship between Beijing and Belgrade.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry has said Xi will discuss upgrading the relationship between the two sides when he meets his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107.\n\nBeijing has deemed Serbia an \u201cironclad friend\u201d, a title it has only offered to a handful of its most trusted nations such as Pakistan and Cambodia.\n\nChina was also the second biggest supplier of arms to Serbia between 2020 and 2023, behind Russia, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nIt is now the only European country to operate the FK-3 surface-to-air defence system and CH-92A combat drones, and it has also been supplied with medium range missiles and transport aircraft.\n\nVladisavljev said that promoting close ties with Russia has become less popular in Serbia following the invasion of Ukraine, leaving a gap China could fill.\n\n\u201cSerbia is a safe pick [for the trip],\u201d he said. \u201cIt is supposed to be a visit to a friendly country, where the Chinese president will be warmly welcomed.\u201d\n\nHe said that the two sides are expected to \u201ccelebrate the milestones achieved\u201d but are also expected to announce a new joint project.\n\nHe also expects that Vu\u010di\u0107 will use Xi\u2019s visit \u2013 which he described as one of the one of the most high-profile visits in years to try to secure a much-need political \u201cwin\u201d on the domestic stage.\n\nHe said this is \u201cdue to the development of several scenarios that have been seen as a loss \u2013 most notably the one coming out of the relationship with Kosovo\u201d.\n\nTensions have been running high with clashes between ethnic Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo in recent months. In October Nato deployed more troops following reports \u2013 which Belgrade dismissed as \u201clies\u201d \u2013 that Serbia was building up its forces on the border.\n\nMeanwhile, Serbia is struggling to counter broad support across Europe for Kosovo joining international institutions such as the Council of Europe, fearing this amounts to recognition of its independence.\n\nLast year, hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets in Belgrade in protest at what they said were rigged parliamentary and local elections after observers reported widespread irregularities.\n\nThe two nations can also look to each other for support in territorial issues, with neither country recognising Kosovo or Taiwan as independent.\n\nEconomic ties are also strong, with China becoming Serbia\u2019s second-largest trading partner, behind only Germany, according to Serbia\u2019s official figures.\n\nThe two signed a free-trade agreement last year after just months of negotiations and China is now the country\u2019s main source of foreign investment.\n\nBelgrade was one of the first European countries to join the Belt and Road Initiative and has become an important hub and gateway to Europe for the global infrastructure development strategy.\n\nSome of the most high-profile investments that have resulted include a previously loss-making steel mill in Smederevo, which started turning a profit six months after being bought by Hebei-based HBIS Group, and the flagship rail link between Belgrade and the Hungarian capital Budapest.\n\nWang from Renmin University, said the railway would be a priority for Xi\u2019s European tour.\n\n\u201cThe Hungary-Serbia railway is a big boost to Europe\u2019s infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the future, it is also necessary to strengthen cooperation between China and Europe in investment, manufacturing and localisation.\u201d\n\nHungary will be Xi\u2019s final stop on his European tour, visiting between Wednesday and Friday. It is his first visit as head of state.\n\nAs the EU and Nato have both adopted a harder line on Beijing, Hungary\u2019s support as a member of both groups has become increasingly important for China.\n\nChina\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi last week urged Hungary to promote a \u201crational and friendly view\u201d of China after it takes on the bloc\u2019s rotating presidency in July.\n\nThe EU\u2019s perception of China had changed, said Shi Zhiqin, professor of international relations at Tsinghua University.\n\n\u201cIf everything emphasises security, that is to say it becomes overly securitised and politicised, then many opportunities for cooperation will be lost, and that is not in line with the trend of globalisation today,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the EU as a whole is pushing to \u201cde-risk\u201d its relations with China and reduce economic supply chain dependencies, Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orban has doubled down on wooing more investments, especially in electric vehicle and battery manufacturing sectors.\n\nFollowing recent a visit to Beijing, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto announced more funding for railway projects under the Belt and Road Initiative and a US$22 million investment by state-owned Chinese firm Fiberhome Telecom Tech \u2013 to build a base in the country for optical cable production.\n\nShi said he expected the tour to \u201cdeepen\u201d existing relations with Serbia and Hungary and to result in \u201ceven better\u201d cooperation in future.\n\nEarlier this week, Xi was in France as he marks the 60th and 75th anniversary of China establishing diplomatic ties with Paris and Budapest respectively.\n\nBut beyond this symbolism Vladisavljev said the whole visit \u201cwill be a litmus test for the current state of perception of China\u201d in Europe.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Twenty other people were injured in the incident, which has burdened relations between the two powers ever since.\n\nThe Western military alliance had launched the air war in March that year to force then Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a brutal onslaught against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo.\n\nThe U.S. at the time apologized and said the embassy bombing was a mistake that happened due to faulty intelligence. The intended target, Washington said, was the headquarters of a Serbian state arms exporter located on the same street, a few blocks away.\n\n\"Imagine that somebody would, even by accident, strike an American Embassy somewhere around the world. The reaction would be immediate,\" said Sven Biscop, a professor of European foreign and security policy at the Ghent University and Egmont Institute.\n\n\"So for a country like China, it is also clear that this is a big thing,\" he added. \"And, of course, it has not been forgotten.\"\n\nAngry protesters in China stormed U.S. diplomatic installations as the bombing fueled anti-American sentiments and speculation that the attack was intentional rather than accidental. Mistrust over the incident has endured to this day.\n\n\"We will probably never really conclusively know either way,\" Biscop said. \"But one thing is sure. In war, incidents like that do happen, and I usually tend to go for the most simple explanation rather than try to invent complicated theories.\"\n\nWhile straining Beijing's relations with the U.S., the embassy bombing brought China and Serbia closer together. China has emerged as Serbia's largest provider of foreign direct investment and its second-largest trading partner after the European Union.\n\nBeijing opposed the NATO bombing campaign and has since backed Belgrade's bid to counter the Western-backed push for independence in Kosovo, a former Serbian province. In return, Serbia has been a loyal ally to Beijing and has opened its doors without restraint to billions of dollars of Chinese investment, even as it formally seeks EU membership.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible ahead of Xi's visit on Tuesday and Wednesday. In Belgrade, a huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nXi will arrive from France and proceed from Serbia to Hungary as part of his first European tour in five years.\n\nHe is expected to visit the site of the former embassy on the anniversary date and pay his respects to the bombing victims. A Chinese cultural center now stands at the spot where the embassy was once located.\n\nThe sprawling complex reportedly includes a Confucius Institute, workshops, exhibitions, offices, residential space and a hotel. It is seen as a symbol of China's growing influence in Serbia and across Europe.\n\nNear the institute, a group of visitors from China last weekend bowed in front of a simple black-marble monument and laid flowers in honor of the victims of the 1999 bombing. An inscription on the monument in both Chinese and English reads: \"Honor Martyrs, Cherish Peace.\"\n\n__\n\nSylvain Plazy contributed to this report from Brussels.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

With China ranking as Serbia's second-largest trading partner after the EU, bilateral ties are set to deepen further with the imminent implementation of a free trade agreement slated for July this year.\n\nAnticipation surrounds today's discussions between Serbian President Vu\u010di\u0107 and Xi Jinping, with a spotlight on potential new agreements poised to bolster economic cooperation.

Against a backdrop of regional dynamics, Xi's itinerary reflects China's strategic maneuvering in the face of broader geopolitical shifts.\n\nFor Xi Jinping, this European tour marks a significant diplomatic engagement, signaling China's commitment to fostering partnerships amidst global uncertainties.

That event sparked widespread anti-US protests across China and cemented Beijing's mistrust of US-led groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nXi's visit to Serbia exactly a quarter of a century after the bombing is part of a three-leg tour that includes stops in France and Hungary. The Chinese leader is trying to convince European nations that his nation's huge economy is too large to turn away from, as Brussels unleashes a salvo of trade probes and aligns with Washington on concerns over China's over capacity and national security risks.\n\nAdding to the political theater, Xi will be in Europe on the same day Russian President Vladimir Putin is inaugurated into his fifth term, as concern grows in Western Europe over his war in Ukraine.\n\nXi's Nato criticism helps explain his government's rationale for supporting the Kremlin in the wake of its invasion. Chinese officials have referred to the Belgrade bombing multiple times in recent years, as Beijing signaled solidarity with Russia's position that Nato aggression on its borders necessitated the war.\n\nThe US and European leaders have urged Xi to use his relationship with Putin to bring an end to what German Chancellor Olaf Scholz recently branded an \"insane\" war during a trip to Beijing.\n\nXi told his French counterpart in Paris on Monday that he opposes the war in Ukraine \"being used to place responsibility on a third country, tarnish its image and incite a new Cold War.\" President Emmanuel Macron reiterated there cannot be security in Europe without security in Ukraine.\n\nTies between China and Serbia, which is not an EU member, have strengthened under Xi, even as Beijing's broader relationship with Europe frays over human-rights issues and trade spats.\n\nIn the Politika article, Xi wrote that the friendship between Beijing and Belgrade was \"forged with the blood of our compatriots,\" but would only \"grow tall and sturdy.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Twenty other people were injured in the incident, which has burdened relations between the two powers ever since.\n\nAlso Read | Israel-Hamas Ceasefire Deal: Hamas Accepts Qatar-mediated Proposal on Hostage Release, Israeli Withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nThe Western military alliance had launched the air war in March that year to force then Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a brutal onslaught against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo.\n\nThe US at the time apologised and said the embassy bombing was a mistake that happened due to faulty intelligence. The intended target, Washington said, was the headquarters of a Serbian state arms exporter located on the same street, a few blocks away.\n\nAlso Read | Israel-Hamas War: UN Chief Antonio Guterres Warns Against Ground Invasion of Rafah Amid Escalating Tensions in Gaza.\n\n\"Imagine that somebody would, even by accident, strike an American Embassy somewhere around the world. The reaction would be immediate,\" said Sven Biscop, a professor of European foreign and security policy at the Ghent University and Egmont Institute.\n\n\"So for a country like China, it is also clear that this is a big thing,\" he added. \"And, of course, it has not been forgotten.\"\n\nAngry protesters in China stormed US diplomatic installations as the bombing fuelled anti-American sentiments and speculation that the attack was intentional rather than accidental. Mistrust over the incident has endured to this day.\n\n\"We will probably never really conclusively know either way,\" Biscop said. \"But one thing is sure. In war, incidents like that do happen, and I usually tend to go for the most simple explanation rather than try to invent complicated theories.\"\n\nWhile straining Beijing's relations with the US, the embassy bombing brought China and Serbia closer together. China has emerged as Serbia's largest provider of foreign direct investment and its second-largest trading partner after the European Union.\n\nBeijing opposed the NATO bombing campaign and has since backed Belgrade's bid to counter the Western-backed push for independence in Kosovo, a former Serbian province. In return, Serbia has been a loyal ally to Beijing and has opened its doors without restraint to billions of dollars of Chinese investment, even as it formally seeks EU membership.\n\nSigns of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible ahead of Xi's visit on Tuesday and Wednesday. In Belgrade, a huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.\n\nXi will arrive from France and proceed from Serbia to Hungary as part of his first European tour in five years.\n\nHe is expected to visit the site of the former embassy on the anniversary date and pay his respects to the bombing victims. A Chinese cultural centre now stands at the spot where the embassy was once located.\n\nThe sprawling complex reportedly includes a Confucius Institute, workshops, exhibitions, offices, residential space and a hotel. It is seen as a symbol of China's growing influence in Serbia and across Europe.\n\nNear the institute, a group of visitors from China last weekend bowed in front of a simple black-marble monument and laid flowers in honour of the victims of the 1999 bombing. An inscription on the monument in both Chinese and English reads: \"Honor Martyrs, Cherish Peace.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [],

And almost 7 million passengers traveled more than 3 million kilometers in both directions,\" she said.\n\nBesides transport infrastructure, Chinese companies have been engaged in other fields in Serbia, including the steel, automobile and energy industries.\n\nOne of the examples is the Smederevo steel mill, which was purchased by HBIS Group, based in Hebei province, in 2016.\n\nThe mill had suffered losses for years, but managed to turn around shortly after the purchase.\n\nIn a meeting with Xi in Beijing in 2018, Vucic said the revival of the steel mill is a successful example showing that the BRI has boosted employment and economic growth in Serbia.\n\nSo far, the plant is one of the largest exporters in Serbia, and is \"well known in Southeast Europe for its high quality products\", Stefanovic said.\n\nIn recent years, some people in Western countries have expressed their skepticism of Chinese investments and trade with China. Over the past year, some have advocated \"de-risking\" from China, citing what they call \"national security concerns\".\n\nStefanovic, however, said Serbia is \"very satisfied\" with investments from China.\n\n\"The Government of Serbia does not see any risk or 'national security concerns' coming from its cooperation with China,\" she said. \"On the contrary, cooperation with China...has given a strong boost to the development of Serbia.\"\n\nThe ambassador said that Chinese investments have created almost 30,000 job opportunities in Serbia.\n\nLooking into the future, Stefanovic said her country is ready to explore cooperation with China in cutting-edge areas such as artificial intelligence, information technology and green development.\n\nFor the ambassador, the \"strong ties of mutual understanding, respect and support\" between China and Serbia underlie sound cooperation in various fields.\n\nBoth countries have chosen a path of peaceful development, Stefanovic said. Also, they \"share the same values\" when it comes to international relations. \"This further strengthens our overall relations and makes our friendship sustainable and resilient to all changes on a global level,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belt and Road Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "President of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Daily", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China Daily"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_mill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steel mill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novi_Sad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novi Sad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Novi Sad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebei", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hebei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hebei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smederevo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smederevo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Smederevo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202405/08/663ad603a31082fc2b6d83fe.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Paris, where he met with French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to argue the point that engagement with China is a net good.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, came the postscript: Xi traveled to Serbia to mark the anniversary of the bombing of Belgrade's Chinese Embassy in 1999 by five stray NATO rockets amid its occupation of Kosovo. The implication that meddling by NATO -- and by extension, its chief sponsor, the U.S. -- is detrimental to local interests was clear even before Xi spelt it out in a letter published by the Serbian newspaper Politika.\n\n\"Twenty-five years ago today, NATO flagrantly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese journalists,\" Xi wrote. \"This we should never forget. The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\"\n\nOf course, the preference of China's top communist for the individual over the collective isn't just reserved for NATO. Even before Xi touched down in Belgrade, the message in Paris was that China was willing to build ties with European nations even as the European Union becomes increasingly problematic. In 2019, the E.U. labeled China a \"systemic rival\" and has criticized Beijing over human-rights abuses, its support for Russia's war in Ukraine, spreading disinformation, rampant espionage, economic retaliation against small nations like Lithuania, and unfair trade practices.\n\nLittle wonder Xi hasn't time for that bloc either. On Wednesday, on his final stop, Xi touched down in Hungary, the most mutinous of E.U. members, whose avowedly \"illiberal\" Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n is a vocal backer of both Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"Hungary has played a very important role by vetoing E.U. sanctions on China on Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Taiwan issues,\" says Wang Yiwei, a professor of international affairs at Beijing's Renmin University. \"China appreciates Hungarian behavior and will invest in this close cooperation.\"\n\nTellingly, Hungary received $11.5 billion in Chinese investment in 2023 alone. It is home to the largest foreign logistics and manufacturing base of China's controversial telecoms firm Huawei and will soon also host the first European factory of Shenzhen-based EV giant BYD. Chinese investment in Serbia, meanwhile, has reached almost $20 billion over the past decade, according to government figures, with Beijing and Belgrade signing a free trade agreement last year. China is also building an -- albeit stalled -- high-speed railway connecting Belgrade and Bucharest as part of Xi's signature Belt and Road Initiative. Xi's wooing of arguably the region's two most Europe-skeptic nations is a tried and tested playbook to champion bilateral ties over multi-party fora.\n\nIt's not just nations on the fringes of the E.U. that are susceptible to inducement from the world's second biggest economy. In Paris, von der Leyen pressed Xi on trade \"imbalances,\" calling Chinese state subsidies that lead to low-cost exports \"a matter of great concern\" that threaten European jobs. (Xi refused to admit that China had an overcapacity issue.) The E.U.'s 27 members ran a $314.72 billion goods trade deficit with China in 2023, according to Eurostat data, which, although down from the previous year, is still the second highest on record. \"Europe will not waver from making tough decisions needed to protect its economy and security,\" von der Leyen said.\n\nThat was perhaps wishful thinking. In September, Von der Leyen announced an investigation into subsidies assisting Chinese EV production, prompting Beijing to float tariffs against French brandy as possible retaliation. That's naturally a bigger issue for Macron, who was only too happy to turn on the charm with Xi, delving into his own playbook of building personal rapport with even antagonistic world leaders. After pomp and pageantry at the Elys\u00e9e Palace in Paris, the French President thanked Xi for \"openness regarding the provisional measures on French Cognac and his wish not to see them applied,\" before presenting him with a couple of prized bottles: a Hennessy X.O. and a Remy Martin Louis XIII.\n\nMacron then whisked Xi and both their wives to southwestern France's mountainous Pyrenees, where they were entertained in driving rain by a traditional shepherd's dance, before settling down to a lunch of local ham, lamb, cheese, and blueberry pie. Macron presented Xi with a blanket made from Pyrenees wool, a Tour de France cycling jersey, and, tellingly, yet more brandy: an Armagnac.\n\nMacron is not the only European leader to waver from the E.U. line when confronted by national interests. When German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Beijing accompanied by a bevy of business leaders last month, he pressed Xi on Ukraine and unfair trade practices while avoiding combative language that might imperil some of the 5,000 German companies active in the Chinese market, a fact that makes Germany -- whose economy shrunk last year -- a prime loser of any Chinese sanctions against the E.U. \"The European Union plays the bad cop and member states like France and Germany are the good cops who understand that China is still an opportunity,\" says Wang.\n\nStill, when the E.U.'s two biggest economies struggle to hold the line, it doesn't exactly project solidarity to the bloc's smaller members. And individual thinking in Europe is especially important for Xi as the continent has bonded with Washington over shared outrage regarding Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Xi is trying to encourage a Europe that's more independent from the United States, which fits into his vision of a multipolar world and provides more space for the [People's Republic] to operate in,\" says Chong Ja Ian, an expert on China's diplomacy and professor at the National University of Singapore.\n\nMoreover, the possible return of a Trump presidency and a rekindling of trans-Atlantic trade frictions makes it prudent for Xi to ramp up engagement now. At the very least, Xi's red-carpet treatment in Europe will be grist for China's domestic propaganda mill, presenting China's leader as someone Western counterparts fawn over and beg to solve all their problems. \"What did Macron or von der Leyen get out of it? Very little at this point,\" says Nis Gr\u00fcnberg, lead analyst for politics and society at the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies. \"The status quo is probably the best we can hope for.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type":

On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Paris, where he met with French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to argue the point that engagement with China is a net good.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, came the postscript: Xi traveled to Serbia to mark the anniversary of the bombing of Belgrade's Chinese Embassy in 1999 by five stray NATO rockets amid its occupation of Kosovo. The implication that meddling by NATO -- and by extension, its chief sponsor, the U.S. -- is detrimental to local interests was clear even before Xi spelt it out in a letter published by the Serbian newspaper Politika.\n\n\"Twenty-five years ago today, NATO flagrantly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese journalists,\" Xi wrote. \"This we should never forget. The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\"\n\nOf course, the preference of China's top communist for the individual over the collective isn't just reserved for NATO. Even before Xi touched down in Belgrade, the message in Paris was that China was willing to build ties with European nations even as the European Union becomes increasingly problematic. In 2019, the E.U. labeled China a \"systemic rival\" and has criticized Beijing over human-rights abuses, its support for Russia's war in Ukraine, spreading disinformation, rampant espionage, economic retaliation against small nations like Lithuania, and unfair trade practices.\n\nLittle wonder Xi hasn't time for that bloc either. On Wednesday, on his final stop, Xi touched down in Hungary, the most mutinous of E.U. members, whose avowedly \"illiberal\" Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n is a vocal backer of both Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"Hungary has played a very important role by vetoing E.U. sanctions on China on Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Taiwan issues,\" says Wang Yiwei, a professor of international affairs at Beijing's Renmin University. \"China appreciates Hungarian behavior and will invest in this close cooperation.\"\n\nTellingly, Hungary received $11.5 billion in Chinese investment in 2023 alone. It is home to the largest foreign logistics and manufacturing base of China's controversial telecoms firm Huawei and will soon also host the first European factory of Shenzhen-based EV giant BYD. Chinese investment in Serbia, meanwhile, has reached almost $20 billion over the past decade, according to government figures, with Beijing and Belgrade signing a free trade agreement last year. China is also building an -- albeit stalled -- high-speed railway connecting Belgrade and Bucharest as part of Xi's signature Belt and Road Initiative. Xi's wooing of arguably the region's two most Europe-skeptic nations is a tried and tested playbook to champion bilateral ties over multi-party fora.\n\nIt's not just nations on the fringes of the E.U. that are susceptible to inducement from the world's second biggest economy. In Paris, von der Leyen pressed Xi on trade \"imbalances,\" calling Chinese state subsidies that lead to low-cost exports \"a matter of great concern\" that threaten European jobs. (Xi refused to admit that China had an overcapacity issue.) The E.U.'s 27 members ran a $314.72 billion goods trade deficit with China in 2023, according to Eurostat data, which, although down from the previous year, is still the second highest on record. \"Europe will not waver from making tough decisions needed to protect its economy and security,\" von der Leyen said.\n\nThat was perhaps wishful thinking. In September, Von der Leyen announced an investigation into subsidies assisting Chinese EV production, prompting Beijing to float tariffs against French brandy as possible retaliation. That's naturally a bigger issue for Macron, who was only too happy to turn on the charm with Xi, delving into his own playbook of building personal rapport with even antagonistic world leaders. After pomp and pageantry at the Elys\u00e9e Palace in Paris, the French President thanked Xi for \"openness regarding the provisional measures on French Cognac and his wish not to see them applied,\" before presenting him with a couple of prized bottles: a Hennessy X.O. and a Remy Martin Louis XIII.\n\nMacron then whisked Xi and both their wives to southwestern France's mountainous Pyrenees, where they were entertained in driving rain by a traditional shepherd's dance, before settling down to a lunch of local ham, lamb, cheese, and blueberry pie. Macron presented Xi with a blanket made from Pyrenees wool, a Tour de France cycling jersey, and, tellingly, yet more brandy: an Armagnac.\n\nMacron is not the only European leader to waver from the E.U. line when confronted by national interests. When German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Beijing accompanied by a bevy of business leaders last month, he pressed Xi on Ukraine and unfair trade practices while avoiding combative language that might imperil some of the 5,000 German companies active in the Chinese market, a fact that makes Germany -- whose economy shrunk last year -- a prime loser of any Chinese sanctions against the E.U. \"The European Union plays the bad cop and member states like France and Germany are the good cops who understand that China is still an opportunity,\" says Wang.\n\nStill, when the E.U.'s two biggest economies struggle to hold the line, it doesn't exactly project solidarity to the bloc's smaller members. And individual thinking in Europe is especially important for Xi as the continent has bonded with Washington over shared outrage regarding Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Xi is trying to encourage a Europe that's more independent from the United States, which fits into his vision of a multipolar world and provides more space for the [People's Republic] to operate in,\" says Chong Ja Ian, an expert on China's diplomacy and professor at the National University of Singapore.\n\nMoreover, the possible return of a Trump presidency and a rekindling of trans-Atlantic trade frictions makes it prudent for Xi to ramp up engagement now. At the very least, Xi's red-carpet treatment in Europe will be grist for China's domestic propaganda mill, presenting China's leader as someone Western counterparts fawn over and beg to solve all their problems. \"What did Macron or von der Leyen get out of it? Very little at this point,\" says Nis Gr\u00fcnberg, lead analyst for politics and society at the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies. \"The status quo is probably the best we can hope for.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_von_der_Leyen", "type": "person", "score": 5,

We should never forget it, Xi wrote in an article published Tuesday in the Serbian newspaper Politika.\n\nIn an online press briefing Wednesday to mark the end of his term in Belgrade, Gabriel Escobar, Washington's outgoing special envoy for the Western Balkans, criticized the timing of Xi's visit.\n\nThe visit was timed to increase tensions between Serbia and the rest of the Western community, and it serves no purpose, he said.\n\nWe, the United States, said that the bombing of the Chinese embassy in 1999 was an accident, Escobar explained. We apologized. I believe we even paid reparations to the families. But...I believe the timing of the visit was unfortunate but deliberate.\n\nThis strike was part of NATO's military campaign in former Yugoslavia, triggering a diplomatic crisis between Beijing and Washington as well as the largest anti-American demonstrations in China in decades.\n\nThe United States and its NATO allies insisted that the completely unintentional strike targeted a Yugoslav military installation and that the embassy had been misidentified, which was a tragic mistake.\n\nHowever, many people in China, including government officials, have rejected this characterization and remain unconvinced.\n\nChina has maintained close ties with Serbia since it sided with the former Yugoslavia against NATO's air campaign in the 1990s.\n\nOn Wednesday, Xi reaffirmed his unwavering support for Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, with the two leaders backing each other in their territorial claims to Taiwan and Kosovo, respectively.\n\nChina, as a member of the United Nations Security Council, helped ensure that Kosovo, which the Serbian government considers a breakaway province, received official recognition within that body.\n\nWe have a clear and simple position regarding Chinese territorial integrity. Yes, Taiwan is China, Vucic said Wednesday, speaking to a crowd estimated at 20,000, alongside the Chinese leader.\n\nThe two signed an agreement strengthening their strategic partnership for a community with a shared future in a new era, while a free trade agreement is expected to come into force on July 1.\n\nThe longtime Hungarian leader has been a stumbling block to European unity over Ukraine and a strong supporter of Chinese positions on human rights and economic issues.\n\nIn a separate article in the pro-Orban Magyar Nemzet newspaper on Wednesday, Xi wrote that China and Hungary share similar views and close positions on international and regional issues.\n\nWe are committed to the right path of independent and autonomous friendly foreign relations of sovereign countries, he continued.\n\nEscobar, who will soon leave his post as deputy assistant secretary of the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, said Xi had chosen countries willing to challenge the unity of the Euro-Atlantic community.\n\nThe Biden administration has a difficult relationship with populist Orban, who has openly expressed his desire to see former President Donald Trump win the November US election.\n\n\"We warn all our partners and all our interlocutors to be very aware of China's agenda in Europe and China's agenda with respect to the Euro-Atlantic community,\" Escobar said.",

Instead many local Chinese residents were expected to greet Xi at the airport when he arrives.\n\nIn an article published on the Serbian daily newspaper Politika on Tuesday, Xi referred to the bombing, writing: \u201cThe Chinese people value peace, but they will never allow a historical tragedy to repeat itself.\u201d\n\nBut in contrast to a similar article published eight years ago, he described it as a \u201cflagrant\u201d act by Nato rather than a \u201cbarbaric\u201d one.\n\nOn the eve of Xi\u2019s arrival, several of the city\u2019s main streets were decorated with Chinese flags, billboards and banners offering a \u201cwarm welcome\u201d to the visitors, including a 21 storey-high Chinese flag on the Western City Gate, a local skyscraper that sits off the main road to the airport.\n\nOn Monday Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 met with China\u2019s ambassador Li Ming on Monday to talk about \u201cfinal perparations\u201d for Xi\u2019s visit.\n\nHe later posted on Instagram that he was \u201cproud of our steel friendship with China\u201d and was \u201cconvinced that our hospitality will show how much Serbia values the partnership with this great country\u201d.\n\nThe visit is taking place amid tight security, with 3,400 police officers deployed on the streets of the capital, according to the Tanjug news agency.\n\nIt also reported on Tuesday that the Chinese delegation will receive a ceremonial welcome in front of the Palace of Serbia, one of the main government buildings, ahead of the signing of more than 30 agreements between the two countries.\n\nIn the days leading up to Xi\u2019s visit, a number of individual tourists and groups from China visited the site of the former embassy to pay their respects.\n\nOn Tuesday morning these included a group of about 20 people from Beijing.\n\nOne man in his 60s bought flowers from a shop inthe cultural centre to leave at the scene.\n\nAsked how he felt, he choked with sobs and said \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain\u201d\n\nAn owner of the flower shop, surnamed Zhuang, said the site draws daily visitors, including Chinese business leaders and tour groups.\n\n\u201cSome people just looked around, some took a picture, some offered flowers, everyone expresses themselves differently,\u201d she added.\n\nOn Saturday the visitors included Fu Hong, a young man in early 20s from Sichuan province, who said he was on a month-long tour of the Balkans and Turkey with his girlfriend.\n\nHe said they had both wanted to visit the site of the bombing, which happened before either of them was born, but said \u201ctoo frustrating\u201d that the Chinese government had only condemned it in 1999 without taking tougher action.\n\nBut when asked about his views on the US and Nato, he said patriotism and economics are \u201ccompletely different\u201d things, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no young person [in China] now who doesn\u2019t aspire to America. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nAnother visitor in his 20s, a man named Kuang from Shenzhen, said he had not known much about the bombing until he read about the site in a guidebook and was disappointed that few traces of the incident remained.\n\n\u201cIt would have been nice if it had ruins in place, which might remind people of some more things,\u201d he said, adding that the cultural centre that now stood on the site was \u201ctoo new\u201d.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Three Chinese journalists were killed.\n\nThe incident sparked a nationalist fever in China, which has never really gone away. The United States apologized, citing a problem with out-of-date maps. But Chinese public opinion remains convinced that the attack was deliberate -- not least because two years later, in 2001, another incident between an American spy plane and a Chinese jet resulted in the death of the Chinese pilot.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the new Sino-American Cold War, Xi Jinping is in Belgrade to hammer home the point that the United States is the main threat to world peace.", "source": {"uri": "worldcrunch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Worldcrunch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pierre_haski@worldcrunch.com", "name": "Pierre Haski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramount leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO bombing of Yugoslavia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kosovo War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bombing_of_the_Chinese_embassy_in_Belgrade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Acupuncture_and_Chinese_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://worldcrunch.com/media-library/chinese-president-xi-jinping-and-his-wife-are-welcomed-by-serbian-president-vucic-and-his-wife-at-belgrade-nikola-tesla-airport.jpg?id=52193621&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C323%2C0%2C324", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1999-05-07", "textStart": 526, "textEnd": 536}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

In 2016 during his first state visit to the country, Chinese President Xi Jinping laid a foundation stone for the building.\n\nIt is the China Cultural Center built on the ruins of the Chinese embassy in former Yugoslavia by China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the provincial government of Shandong.\n\nAs Xi pays a second visit to Serbia, Global Times reporter went to the center to find out how the place has gained a new life while retaining the sentiment of friendship.\n\nStatues of two ancient Chinese philosophers Laozi, the founder of Taoism, and Confucius stand on either side of the entrance, depicting a classic scenario of Confucius asking Laozi about rites and rituals.\n\nGreat minds are born through communication with others and great civilizations value mutual learning.\n\nThe center, covering an area of 6,000 square meters, displays Chinese-style furniture transported all the way from China via China-Europe Railway Express. It is more than a beautiful building, but a lively stage for local Serbians to learn about China, a bridge connecting the two peoples and a cradle for bilateral friendship.\n\nVladimir Roglic, an IT professional in Belgrade, learns tai chi course at the center. Roglic first developed an interest in China in primary school as a karate practitioner after getting a tai chi brochure from his neighbor.\n\n'A perfect balance'\n\nRoglic followed the movement step by step, and fell in love with it for its \"meditation in movement.\"\n\nRoglic, who speaks fluent Chinese, looks forward to visiting Wudang Mountains in Central China's Hubei Province one day to improve his martial arts techniques at the \"sacred place\" of Taoism.\n\nOf all courses, tai chi is the most popular one while the center also offers classes on Chinese language, calligraphy, guzheng (a traditional Chinese musical instrument), and the cooking and tea ceremony courses would soon to be added to the curriculum.\n\nRoglic's calligraphy classmate Danijela Radanovic is a police officer from Serbia's Ministry of Interior. She has studied Chinese language for about one year and started the calligraphy in April to help her language learning process.\n\nRadanovic has long been interested in Chinese culture, the calligraphy, music and architecture. But she started studying Chinese for a particular reason for she wanted to help more Chinese tourists and business people who encounter difficulties in Serbia.\n\nAs she is getting ready to visit China in September on an exchange program, Radanovic shared with the Global Times her excitement that she will see the country with her own eyes and try authentic Chinese food.\n\n\"I really want to visit Sichuan [Province] to see the pandas. But there are also other places I want to go... Maybe I will live in China one day,\" Radanovic said.\n\nA strong sense of friendship and warmth can be felt through conversations with students attending classes at the center.\n\nThe cultural center has only entered its trial operation very recently, and Milica Milovic is the first local employee. Milovic said that she is proud to be part of the China-Serbia ironclad friendship by working at the center. When asked about the first thing that came up to her mind related to China, Milovic sang the famous \"Bella Ciao,\" an Italian folk song which became a Chinese street melody in 1977, when Yugoslavian film The Bridge was introduced to China.\n\nMilovic mentioned the tragic bombing of the Chinese embassy in 1999 as an early strong bond connecting China and Serbia, noting that the friendship has been enriched and fortified over the years.\n\nPresident Xi, in his signed article published Tuesday in local media Politika, wrote \"The China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides.\"\n\nThe giant painting decorates the entrance hall of the cultural center, peony blossoms with the title \"a peaceful and prosperous time,\" speaks of a common wish that China and Serbia could make their mutual progress a reality and join hands to build a human community of shared future in the new era.\n\n\"Even though I like Chinese culture, music and food, the thing that makes me love China the most are the Chinese people,\" she said.\n\nMilovic's remarks are a testament that amid exchanges on food, music and art, culture, or other sectors like trade and technology, what matters the most are the people.\n\nAs Confucius said 2,500 years ago that \"it is such a delight to have friends coming from afar,\" in Belgrade, Chinese people are treated as real friends.", "source": {"uri": "itnewsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IT News Online"},

The business communities have to seize now such opportunities,\" she noted.\n\nWitnessing China's rapid transformation into an innovation-driven economy, Stefanovic expressed optimism about its resilience.\n\n\"The Chinese government is focusing on supporting advanced technology development as the key pillar of its economy,\" she said, adding that there's no alternative market to provide fertile ground for innovation and growth at China's scale. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_City_300", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food City 300"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belt and Road Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupin_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pupin Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Danube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Forum_for_International_Cooperation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free trade agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 15}], "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Vucic needs to be cautious because this can have certain consequences for Serbia and, what worries me more, for the citizens of Serbia,\" Baraliu says.\n\nHe adds that Serbia is trying to pursue a measured and neutral policy towards Russia and China, similar to what Josip Broz Tito led during the Non-Aligned Movement, but that the West is now too sensitive to such moves, especially after Ukraine.\n\n\"One should be cautious when pursuing such three-way policies, especially when they are opposed to each other.

In 2016 during his first state visit to the country, Chinese President Xi Jinping laid a foundation stone for the building.\n\nIt is the China Cultural Center built on the ruins of the Chinese embassy in former Yugoslavia by China'sMinistry of Culture and Tourism and the provincial government of Shandong.\n\nAs Xi pays a second visit to Serbia, Global Times reporter went to the center to find out how the place has gained a new life while retaining the sentiment of friendship.\n\nStatues of two ancient Chinese philosophers Laozi, the founder of Taoism, and Confucius stand on either side of the entrance, depicting a classic scenario of Confucius asking Laozi about rites and rituals.\n\nGreat minds are born through communication with others and great civilizations value mutual learning.\n\nThe center, covering an area of 6,000 square meters, displays Chinese-style furniture transported all the way from China via China-Europe Railway Express. It is more than a beautiful building, but a lively stage for local Serbians to learn about China, a bridge connecting the two peoples and a cradle for bilateral friendship.\n\nVladimir Roglic, an IT professional in Belgrade, learns tai chi course at the center. Roglic first developed an interest in China in primary school as a karate practitioner after getting a tai chi brochure from his neighbor.\n\n'A perfect balance'\n\nRoglic followed the movement step by step, and fell in love with it for its \"meditation in movement.\"\n\n\"It is not like yoga that you take a position and meditate; it is not fierce sports where you 'fight'; but it is a perfect middle way, just like the symbol of tai chi. It's all about achieving a perfect balance between black and white, yin and yang,\" Roglic told the Global Times.\n\nRoglic, who speaks fluent Chinese, looks forward to visiting Wudang Mountains in Central China'sHubei Province one day to improve his martial arts techniques at the \"sacred place\" of Taoism.\n\nOf all courses, tai chi is the most popular one while the center also offers classes on Chinese language, calligraphy, guzheng (a traditional Chinese musical instrument), and the cooking and tea ceremony courses would soon to be added to the curriculum.\n\nRoglic's calligraphy classmate Danijela Radanovic is a police officer from Serbia'sMinistry of Interior. She has studied Chinese language for about one year and started the calligraphy in April to help her language learning process.\n\nRadanovic has long been interested in Chinese culture, the calligraphy, music and architecture. But she started studying Chinese for a particular reason for she wanted to help more Chinese tourists and business people who encounter difficulties in Serbia.\n\nAs she is getting ready to visit China in September on an exchange program, Radanovic shared with the Global Times her excitement that she will see the country with her own eyes and try authentic Chinese food.\n\n\"I really want to visit Sichuan [Province] to see the pandas. But there are also other places I want to go... Maybe I will live in China one day,\" Radanovic said.\n\nA strong sense of friendship and warmth can be felt through conversations with students attending classes at the center.\n\nThe cultural center has only entered its trial operation very recently, and Milica Milovic is the first local employee. Milovic said that she is proud to be part of the China-Serbia ironclad friendship by working at the center. When asked about the first thing that came up to her mind related to China, Milovic sang the famous \"Bella Ciao,\" an Italian folk song which became a Chinese street melody in 1977, when Yugoslavian film The Bridge was introduced to China.\n\nMilovic mentioned the tragic bombing of the Chinese embassy in 1999 as an early strong bond connecting China and Serbia, noting that the friendship has been enriched and fortified over the years.\n\nPresident Xi, in his signed article published Tuesday in local media Politika, wrote \"The China-Serbia friendship, forged with the blood of our compatriots, will stay in the shared memory of the Chinese and Serbian peoples, and will inspire us to march forward with big strides.\"\n\nThe giant painting decorates the entrance hall of the cultural center, peony blossoms with the title \"a peaceful and prosperous time,\" speaks of a common wish that China and Serbia could make their mutual progress a reality and join hands to build a human community of shared future in the new era.\n\nReal friends\n\nMilovic recalled her stay in Changsha, a relaxing city in Central China'sHunan Province, in 2023 to improve her Chinese, during which she \"started learning more about Chinese culture.\"\n\n\"Even though I like Chinese culture, music and food, the thing that makes me love China the most are the Chinese people,\" she said.\n\nMilovic's remarks are a testament that amid exchanges on food, music and art, culture, or other sectors like trade and technology, what matters the most are the people.\n\nAs Confucius said 2,500 years ago that \"it is such a delight to have friends coming from afar,\" in Belgrade, Chinese people are treated as real friends.", "source": {"uri": "streetinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StreetInsider.com"},

Mutual trust is the synonym of 'ironclad friendship,'\" he said.\n\nSerbia has been an integral part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since its inception in 2013, playing a pivotal role in facilitating cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC) under the BRI framework. Numerous major projects have been successfully implemented through this collaboration, resulting in the modernization of infrastructure across the region.\n\nJovanovic cited the high-speed railway between Belgrade and Budapest as a notable example. By reducing the travel time between the capitals of Serbia and Hungary from eight hours to less than three, this transformative initiative has significantly enhanced regional connectivity. Moreover, it has spurred economic growth and development, benefiting both countries and the broader region.\n\n\"Serbia's cooperation under BRI has helped Serbia to become one of the countries with the fastest GDP growth in Europe, even at the time of recession. Serbia's standing as an international partner has improved significantly,\" he stated.\n\nReflecting on the high-quality development of the BRI, Jovanovic emphasized its role in promoting global prosperity. By cultivating inclusive and mutually beneficial cooperation, the BRI has become a catalyst for economic growth, trade, and connectivity among participating countries. The principles of equality, sovereignty, and non-interference have been fundamental to the BRI's success, contributing to global stability and peace.\n\n\"Time and again, we realize that peace, security and development are indivisible. BRI and China-CEEC forums have provided opportunities to keep the global dialogue on track with development and other aspects of global stability, which are closely intertwined. The initiator of BRI, President Xi Jinping, made a strategic breakthrough in the normalization of Iran-Saudi Arabia relations,\" said Jovanovic.\n\nPresident Xi's state visit: A milestone in bilateral relations\n\nJovanovic emphasized the critical impact of President Xi Jinping's state visit to Serbia in 2016, which elevated bilateral relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership. The solid foundation established during this visit paved the way for future collaborations that yielded mutual benefits and shared prosperity.\n\n\"For example, our trade has grown 185 times; China has become the No. 1 foreign investor in Serbia and the No. 2 biggest trade partner of Serbia; three Chinese companies have become No. 1, 2 and 3 biggest exporters from Serbia (Zijin Mining, Zijin Copper and Hibis Group Serbia Iron and Steel); tourist visas have been reciprocally abolished, custom-free trade has been introduced; direct air flights established, and so on,\" Jovanovic mentioned.\n\nWhen discussing President Xi's upcoming state visit to Serbia at the invitation of President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, Jovanovic expressed confidence that it would provide the best opportunity to assess the extraordinary achievements in Serbia-China cooperation thus far and to initiate a new chapter of high-quality collaboration.\n\n\"It will be marked by environment-friendly economic cooperation, green energy, food and industry production as well as by new long-term strategic projects even more significant than those implemented, or underway of implementation, so far. Serbia and China should continue to be examples of a positive approach to the new challenges requiring openness and true partnership without any prejudices or constraints,\" he said.\n\nA promising future: Strengthening partnerships for shared prosperity\n\nIn discussing China's strides in digitalization and innovation, Jovanovic praised China's leadership in using technology to drive societal development. The country's emphasis on education, research, and science has fueled its advancements in digitalization and artificial intelligence, establishing China as a global leader in innovation.\n\nHe also highlighted the need for countries to embrace China's success in innovation and digitalization, emphasizing the importance of open dialogue and cooperation in the face of technological advancements.\n\n\"It is striking to me that some of the most developed Western countries, renowned for almost religious belief in open markets and the liberal economic order, have adopted the way to spread fear of China and Chinese high technology products in order to protect themselves. Some have not only forbidden imports of Chinese 5G technologies, or smart mobile phones and other digital products, to their own markets, but are systematically pressuring other countries, including Serbia, to do the same,\" he said.\n\nHaving visited China multiple times, Jovanovic has witnessed the country's remarkable transformations. He observed the swift urban development in cities and the technological advancements in rural regions. These experiences have left a lasting impression on him, showcasing China's extensive modernization efforts.\n\nJovanovic expressed his belief that as Serbia and China continue to strengthen their partnership, their shared values of mutual trust, cooperation, and innovation will undoubtedly lead to a more prosperous and interconnected future.", "source": {"uri": "en.people.cn", "dataType":

Throughout our trip, we were embraced by the warmth and friendliness of Serbian people, who surprised us with their deep appreciation for Chinese culture.\n\nWhen strolling through Kalemegdan Citadel, where the spring colors peeked out from lush green leaves lining the road, we encountered a street artist immersed in his music with the wooden stringed instrument called a tambura.\n\nAs we hurried past, his tune suddenly shifted, blending unfamiliar Serbian lyrics with a familiar melody that left us in awe when we were in a foreign land -- it was March of the Volunteers, China's national anthem.\n\nThe elderly artist who played March of the Volunteers was Josip Komljenovic. He warmly called us \"Chinese brothers\" in Serbian and invited us to stay for a moment to share his passion for music.\n\n\"I play 28 instruments,\" he said enthusiastically and took out various traditional Serbian musical instruments from his bag and showed them to us. \"I hope to go to China one day to give my own recital.\"\n\nUpon our leaving, he pulled out a copy of The Sun Shines Over the Sava River and presented it as a gift to us. Then, he skillfully played the tambura and sang a well-known Serbian folk song called Tamo Daleko (In That Distant Place) for us as a final farewell.\n\nThis song was performed by Serbian singer Slobodan Tegula during China Central Television's Spring Festival Gala in 2023 as part of the performance Song of Flowers Along the Belt and Road. On that night of jubilation, Tegula was seen by the audience sitting atop the Kalemegdan Citadel, with the statue of Pobednik (The Victor) standing behind him. The statue was erected in 1928 to commemorate Serbia's victories in the Balkan Wars and World War I. With one hand holding a bird symbolizing peace and the other gripping a sword symbolizing power and conquest, Pobednik guarded that rare moment of tranquility in the surging currents of history.\n\nAs we basked in the warmth of this musical exchange, our interactions with the Institute of International Politics and Economics in Belgrade solidified our belief in the depth of China-Serbia friendship. The young researchers and assistants at the institute painted a vivid picture of their perception of China, using keywords such as \"friend\", \"civilization\", \"history\", \"tradition\", \"cooperation \"and \"industry\".\n\nWhen we showed them a video about Tsinghua University, we were surprised that one research fellow could fluently read the Chinese subtitles in it.\n\n\"The popularity of both the Chinese language and Chinese people in Serbia is really beyond my imagination. The infrastructure projects here with Chinese investment are highly appreciated by the Serbian people and that's why they greet East Asian faces with 'ni hao' (hello) when encountering them on the streets,\" said Zhou Xinyi, a member of the field trip team.\n\nUnder the Belt and Road Initiative, China has invested in many important bridges and railways in Serbia that helped connect the country with neighboring countries and improve people's well-being.\n\n\"Despite differences between European and Chinese companies in terms of operation and management, Chinese companies have adapted well to the local regulations in Serbia and achieved a high level of localization,\" said Nenad Stekic, a researcher with the institute who has the Chinese name \"Xi Ningyi\".", "source": {"uri":

With the China-Serbia Free Trade Agreement set to take effect on July 1 this year, the high-standard mutual opening up between China and Serbia will surely enter a new stage.\n\n\"We consider it one of the most important agreements concluded between the two countries in the field of economy,\" said Stefanovic, believing that the agreement will enhance trade and cooperation in sectors such as the automotive industry, technology and agriculture.\n\nStefanovic has forged an inseparable bond with China ever since coming to the country for the first time as an international student in 1993.\n\n\"People to people contacts are one of the most important segments of our relations, since they are a prerequisite for the expansion and development of overall relations between Serbia and China,\" Stefanovic pointed out.\n\nWith policies such as visa-free travel and direct flights between the two countries, Stefanovic envisioned a future marked by increased tourism, educational exchanges, and cultural understanding.", "source": {"uri": "en.people.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "People's Daily, China"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Daily", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People's Daily"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_visit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State visit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Forum_for_International_Cooperation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free trade agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-speed rail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1394, "textEnd": 1400}], "sentiment": 0.6549019607843136, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

One of them commemorates the three Chinese journalists killed in the incident, on which are inscribed the words honor the martyrs, cherish peace and their names. The other was erected by the city of Belgrade to thank China for its support.\n\nIn front of the monument to the victims, a large number of flowers left by previous visitors had been largely evacuated, leaving only three baskets.\n\nAlthough Tuesday was the anniversary of the bombing, the Chinese embassy did not hold a memorial service on that day, as it had in previous years. Instead, many local Chinese residents were expected to greet Xi at the airport upon his arrival.\n\nIn an article published Tuesday in the Serbian daily Politika, Xi addressed the bombing, writing: The Chinese people value peace, but they will never allow a historic tragedy to happen again.\n\nBut unlike a similar article published eight years ago, he described it as a blatant act by NATO rather than a barbaric act.\n\nOn the eve of Xi's arrival, several main streets in the city were decorated with Chinese flags, billboards and banners offering a warm welcome to visitors, including a 21-story Chinese flag on the West Gate of the city, a local skyscraper that sits off the main road to the airport.\n\nHe later posted on Instagram that he was proud of our steel friendship with China and was confident that our hospitality would show how much Serbia values the partnership with this great country.\n\nThe visit is taking place under high security, with 3,400 police officers deployed on the streets of the capital, according to the Tanjug news agency.\n\nIt was also reported on Tuesday that the Chinese delegation would receive a solemn welcome in front of the Serbian Palace, one of the main government buildings, ahead of the signing of more than 30 agreements between the two countries.\n\nIn the days leading up to Xi's visit, a number of individual tourists and groups from China visited the site of the former embassy to pay their respects.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, they included a group of about 20 people from Beijing.\n\nA man in his sixties bought flowers in a store in the cultural center to leave them there.\n\nWhen asked how he felt, he choked on sobs and said it was hard to explain.\n\nAn owner of the flower shop, surnamed Zhuang, said the site attracted visitors daily, including Chinese business leaders and tourist groups.\n\nSome people just look around, others take a photo, others offer flowers, everyone expresses themselves differently, she added.\n\nAmong the visitors on Saturday was Fu Hong, a young man in his 20s from Sichuan province, who said he was on a month-long tour of the Balkans and Turkey with his girlfriend.\n\nHe said they both wanted to visit the site of the bombing, which happened before they were born, but said it was too frustrating that the Chinese government had only condemned it 1999 without taking more severe measures.\n\nBut when asked about his views on the United States and NATO, he said patriotism and economics are completely different things, adding: There are no young people. [in China] now, who doesn't aspire to America. It's that simple.\n\nAnother visitor in his 20s, a man named Kuang from Shenzhen, said he didn't know much about the attack until he read about the site in a guidebook and that he was disappointed that few traces of the incident remained.\n\nIt would have been nice if there were ruins, which could remind people of other things, he said, adding that the cultural center currently on the site was too new.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label":

However, due to the war in Ukraine, and the fact that relations between Serbia and Russia are under constant monitoring and potential pressure, the Serbian ruling coalition may see this as an opportunity to play a different card. This visit is a continuation of the old foreign policy: on one hand, you use China and Russia to tell the West, 'Take us more seriously, give us a better offer, or we'll go elsewhere,' but it is also a confirmation of this other shift where the Russian card begins to be replaced by the Chinese card,\" our interlocutor believes.\n\nRegarding China's role in the Kosovo dispute, he adds that it is a much more complicated question than it seems at first glance.\n\n\"China, although not recognizing Kosovo primarily due to its territorial disputes and issues like Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, or Hong Kong, unlike Russia, does not stand out with its veto in the Security Council because the traditional Chinese policy has been 'we don't veto in the SC except in disputes and conflicts that directly affect Chinese strategic interests.' So far, it has been more convenient for China to 'fly under the radar,' to leave the baton to Russia,\" Vuksanovic says.\n\nHe emphasizes that we will see if that approach changes.\n\n\"Belgrade had China's support when seeking the International Court of Justice's opinion in The Hague on the legality of Kosovo's independence, and the Chinese supported Belgrade's initiative, but in line with this policy of 'flying under the radar.' For example, they didn't delegate their judge to the final process, even though they had the right. Now, as China becomes increasingly ambitious, it is ready to bend its policy, as it mediated between Iran and Saudi Arabia, but whether it will want to become active in the Kosovo dispute in a similar way is a question,\" he notes.\n\nAccording to him, for now, China seems to perceive the Kosovo issue as a distant dispute that is primarily a European problem.\n\n\"But there is a Belgrade interest and a desire among leaders in Belgrade for China to be a more outspoken protector of Belgrade because Belgrade doesn't like a trend they see, which is Moscow using the Kosovo precedent to justify territorial annexation in Ukraine and other locations in the post-Soviet space. This puts Belgrade in a very awkward position, as can be seen from the statements of Serbian officials but also from Serbia's voting in the UN,\" Vuksanovic believes.\n\nHe adds that one of the key messages of the Chinese president's European tour is that, in a way, the EU remains one of China's most important markets. He reminds us that due to various issues such as the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, market competition, \"there is discomfort regarding China in Europe,\" defining China in documents as a systemic rival and an actor with a different conception of the international system than the EU.\n\n\"This was a Chinese attempt to continue to show some leadership, to maintain some form of communication with Europe, and in that regard, three very specific countries were chosen. On the one hand, two Eastern European countries, Serbia and Hungary, where the elites in power are very open to China, and on the other hand, France, which currently with President Macron has this informal title of EU's political leader,\" he explains.\n\nVuksanovic emphasizes that there will most likely be a degree of Beijing's interest in Southeastern Europe because the war in Ukraine interrupted a very important branch of the Belt and Road Initiative, the one that was supposed to connect China to Europe through Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian territory.", "source": {"uri":

It serves as a reminder of both the past and possible future.\n\nIn France, where Xi first stepped on European soil after five years, Emmanuel Macron's call for 'strategic autonomy' from the US must have been music to Xi's ears. Speaking in the context of French support for European Commission's anti-dumping investigations into imports of Chinese EVs, solar panels and medical equipment, Macron aired the need for greater reciprocity for trade with China. Xi's trip to France, Serbia and pro-Beijing Hungary comes at a time of European vulnerability, both economic and existential, with Putin's Russia in full growl that European leaders hope Xi to temper.\n\nFor Beijing, it is also about placing a speed bump, if not a barrier, on the road that connects Europe to the US. This partly explains Xi's assurance of not imposing levies till anti-dumping investigations into French brandy imports are completed. But China also needs Europe. The latter plays a big role for not only China making a green transition key to its economic growth, but also, in the light of a US tech transfer crunch, it serves as a conduit for Beijing's bid to pivot from the world's factory to the world's innovation lab. In the face of another possible transition in the US - of White House occupancy - Donald Trump's views on Nato are well known.

I felt your sincerity, with sincerity we can do a lot,\" Xi said.\n\nAfter greeting the citizens on the Palace terrace, Vu\u010di\u0107 and Xi held a close meeting.\n\n\"There is no end to my personal happiness because of your visit, and by the number of people gathered, you could see how much the citizens of Serbia love and appreciate you,\" said Vu\u010di\u0107.\n\n\"As a small country, we have a lot of problems, and then we call our big friends, Mr. President,\" he began.\n\n\"When they ask us about China, we don't have complicated answers, in accordance with the principles of China's policy, that's how it was, that's how it will be.\"\n\n\"Thank you for respecting our territorial integrity, for helping us in the international arena. Three Chinese companies are the biggest exporters from Serbia, Steel factory, Zijin Copper Mine, Zijin Gold Mine,\" added Vu\u010di\u0107.\n\n\"I would have a lot to say. The Free Trade Agreement has opened the door wide, we want to see more Chinese companies, Chinese tourists. We are buying nine Chinese trains for the Expo.

Full of fantastic ideas and childlike fun, the creative stop-motion animated films drew applause from attendees.\n\nJasmina Stojanovic, principal and director of the PI School of Animation Film, said the school, founded in the 1980s, is dedicated to providing equal opportunities for children and teenagers to create animation art. Over the years, the school has developed from a social organization to a public institution of the Serbian government, playing an important role in promoting exchanges and development in the field of animated films.\n\n\"This is my first time visiting China, and the trip left me with a very good impression,\" Stojanovic told People's Daily Online. She added that exchanges in the field of culture and art would enhance friendship between both countries and hoped to use this event to tell Serbian stories to Chinese audiences and deepen the understanding between people of both countries.\n\nSneZana Trajkovic, a teacher at the school, said, \"I hope to exchange experiences and ideas with Chinese colleagues through this trip to China. Many of my friends are very interested in coming to China for exchanges, and I hope to invite more Chinese friends to visit Vranje in the future.\"\n\nA student at the School of Animation and Digital Arts at the Communication University of China called the event \"a positive collision.\" Fascinated by Balkan culture, she expressed her hope for such exchanges to extend to her university campus. By doing so, artists from both countries can strengthen cooperation to produce more works that authentically represent the national characteristics of both countries.\n\nIn recent years, cultural exchanges between China and Serbia have increased, cultivating a deeper mutual understanding between the two nations. Guo Kun, an audience member who attended the exhibition, expressed her growing interest in exploring Serbian culture.\n\n\"We might travel to Serbia at the end of this year. I hope such cultural exchanges will enable more Chinese people to know Serbia,\" Guo said. \"We're just like good friends, and our relationships are getting closer through exchanges like this.\"", "source": {"uri": "en.people.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "People's Daily, China"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puppet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stop motion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Short film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vranje", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vranje"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vranje"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Daily", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "People's Daily"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_University_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communication University of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chinese people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balkans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kung_Fu", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kung Fu", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Training", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543499", "eventUri": "eng-9543499", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.584313725490196, "wgt": 97, "relevance": 1}

Something that MAIN STREAM MEDIA DOESN'T LIKE TO REPORT ABOUT AND DIDN'T REPORT ABOUT.\n\nFuture Chinese ambassador Chen Bo visited me in Novo mesto city when I was in the\n\nsecond or third grade of high school at the age 16 when I selected her and some other Chinese female as a potential girlfriend I would want to date. That was back in 1986.\n\nChen Bo then appeared at times in the background of MK Ultra - After 1992/1993 Belgrade incident https://ausertimes.blogspot.com/2024/05/it-appears-to-me-china-is-in-search-of.html which alarmed entire Serbian parliament, the two Chinese sexy babes with whom I had a great time were dismissed - the two were most likely sent back to China and what made me extremely disappointed as I no longer would see them. But Chinese government officials went on to suggest me to worry not as they have replacement for the two which was Chen Bo who begun to travel to Belgrade often times whenever I was brought to Chinese embassy in Belgrade. She appeared to me more and more was there to witness about my failed attempts to jump in the pants of other girls and what made me feel just to waste more time. Game without results which begun to anger me. She had me at the university in China but nothing ever happened and I eventually got tired of seeing her due to number of other females. Chinese supplied Serbian politicians on frequent bases with Chinese beauty and not for marriages, but just for a good time - entertainment. And while got as many as they wanted, I was told I have to marry first one that is offered what I further disagreed with.\n\nBased on her account, she offered me marriage in China upon graduation but I no longer was interested - I got to meet her father and mom who got quite angry with me.\n\nOn a night of bombing, she and the rest of the Chinese staff were hiding in the designated area of the building where told to hide during bombing campaign at least two months ahead of the bombing - their boss was a male Chinese who was extremely loud even aggressive with everybody - including own workers who had to learn to listen/obey due to what one gestured me their lives/survival - he was right.\n\nShe was promoted from assistant ambassador into ambassador based on the personal sacrifice on the night of bombing is what I was told/repeated - due to bravery she passed what Chinese side referred to as the test.\n\nAs for Ljubi\u0161a Risti\u0107 - a tall slender man with mustaches exactly as you see. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 employed one in 1995 to deliver me at Chinese embassy after I no longer was willing to put up with violence(two ultra aggressive chetniks were fired - one appeared to me was even a regular drunk - a police officer who would at times even get to sleep with some Chinese lady if lucky enough). Once Risti\u0107 was given to me, I tried to employ Risti\u0107 but he demanded from me to simply marry one which I refused on what he proceeded to yell at me that I am wasting his time that he is serious family man etc. Man who have no time to loose with guys like myself while also flirting on the side with ladies - Risti\u0107 was a married man. I think Risti\u0107 got married probably in 1990 or something like this and has one daughter and perhaps one more or even two kids ...Risti\u0107 must have been involved for already very very long time probably since his military service...Risti\u0107 claimed me have pulled wounded people from the embassy - saved lives and went on to claim that whole thing was videorecorded and i shouldn't bother to say anything for that matter that would defer from official account.\n\nChen Bo had a room on the third floor, but in reality a Chinese ambassador at the time also had house rented for Chinese staff right next door to embassy. Just so you know...they owned more than Chinese embassy ;)\n\nI liked that Chinese male ambassador and he liked me, but he was afraid to get to close to me and was concentrated instead on work.\n\nFrom https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3262053/xi-jinping-skips-site-1999-nato-bombing-serbia-visit-seen-calculated-move-avoid-stoking-tension-west\n\nVisit 'shows Xi does not want to overly irritate the US, or put his Serbian hosts in a difficult position' with the EU, says analystBut timing the visit to coincide with the anniversary of deaths of three Chinese journalists is in itself viewed as a message to US-led WestShi Jiangtao+ FOLLOWPublished: 6:30pm, 9 May 2024Chinese President Xi Jinping inspects the Serbian Army honour guard during a welcome ceremony in Belgrade on Wednesday.

anniversary of Nato's bombing of the site has been described as a \"calculated move\" to avoid stoking tensions with the US-led West.The omission from Xi's itinerary of the bombing site, which he toured during his first state visit to Serbia in 2016, came as a surprise to many watching the Chinese leader's trip to Serbia this week.\n\nThree Chinese journalists were killed when US-led Nato used missiles to attack the embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, prompting a major crisis between Beijing and Washington, which the latter insisted was a \"tragic mistake\".\n\nDeng Yuwen, former deputy editor of the Communist Party's flagship newspaper Study Times, said Xi's no-show at the bombing site was due, in part, to his tight schedule during the Serbian visit.\n\n\"But, of course, it also shows Xi does not want to overly irritate the US, or put his Serbian hosts in a difficult position,\" he said. \"If Xi went ahead with a speech commemorating the anniversary on top of a much-anticipated visit to the site, the European Union would probably put pressure on Serbia.\"\n\nWhile Serbia is seen as one of the most China-friendly countries in Europe, especially after Nato's bombing of the former Yugoslavia between March and June 1999, it is one of the six Western Balkan countries applying for EU membership.\n\nShen Dingli, an expert on international relations in Shanghai, said Beijing obviously did not want to embarrass Belgrade, which \"would join the EU and Nato sooner or later\".\n\n\"It is clear that China does not want to further alienate itself at a time when Beijing has already edged closer toward Russia during Moscow's invasion of Ukraine,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ausertimes.blogspot.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

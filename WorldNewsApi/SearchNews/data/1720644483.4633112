{"id": 231216314, "title": "Pune Porsche car crash: Parts of luxury resort owned by juvenile\u2019s family razed", "text": "The Satara district administration in Maharashtra on Saturday demolished several allegedly illegal structures inside a luxury resort owned by the family of the juvenile accused in the Pune Porsche car crash case. Last week, the Satara district collector had ordered that the resort in Mahabaleshwar be sealed as it did not have proper permits. As per reports, the resort was developed over the land of an old club but there were legal lacunae in the manner in which this was done. On Saturday, most of the resort buildings that the Collectorate office said were unauthorised were razed using a bulldozer. On May 19, the juvenile was allegedly driving a Porsche car at very high speed while intoxicated when it crashed into a bike, killing techies Aneesh Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta. The case hit national headlines over alleged attempts to get the juvenile let off leniently. The juvenile is currently in an observation home in Yerawada while his parents and his grandfather, who were arrested in cases related to his accident, are currently in jail.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pune-porsche-car-crash-luxury-resort-juveniles-family-razed-9380108/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/pune-porsche-crash-demolition.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:00:29", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.429}

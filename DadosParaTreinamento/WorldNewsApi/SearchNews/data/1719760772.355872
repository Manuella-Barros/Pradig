The compilation initially debuted and peaked at No. 66 on the Billboard 200 in August 2001, but re-entered the chart in the issue dated May 7, 2016, the week following Prince\u2019s death (on April 21, 2016).

Two competing Righteous Brothers recordings of \u201cUnchained Melody\u201d \u2013 the original and a re-recording \u2013 made the top 20 on the Hot 100 in the wake of Ghost.

Meat Loaf, Bat Out of Hell, 23 weeks Released: Oct. 21, 1977 First reached No. 1: Aug. 24, 1991 Billboard 200 peak: No. 13 (Feb. 5, 2022) Notes: The album\u2019s enduring success as a catalog album laid the groundwork for the success of Meat Loaf\u2019s 1993 sequel Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell, which hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Bat Out of Hell spawned his first top 20 hit on the Hot 100, \u201cTwo Out of Three Ain\u2019t Bad.\u201d This was Meat\u2019s first solo album; he had previously teamed with female singer Shaun Murphy in Stoney & Meatloaf, which released an eponymous album in 1971.

The album made history in April 1987 as the first hip-hop album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200. It bumped Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band out of the top spot, and put the industry on notice that rock\u2019s era of unchallenged supremacy was coming to an end. The album spawned the trio\u2019s only top 10 hit on the Hot 100, \u201c(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!).\u201d Kenny G, Miracles: The Holiday Album, 27 weeks Released: Nov. 1, 1994 First reached No. 1: Nov. 11, 1995 Billboard 200 peak: No. 1 for three weeks (beginning Dec. 10, 1994) Notes: This is the instrumental album with the longest run at No. 1.

(\u201cTears in Heaven\u201d isn\u2019t on the collection, nor is the subsequent \u201cChange the World,\u201d which had an even longer run on the Hot 100.) Adele, 19, 41 weeks Image Credit: Paul Bergen/Redferns Released: Jan. 28, 2008 First reached No. 1: March 5, 2011 Billboard 200 peak: No. 4 (March 3, 2012) Notes: 19 dominated the Catalog Albums chart while Adele\u2019s sophomore album, 21, set up residency in the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200, as fans sought to catch up on what they\u2019d missed. 19 brought Adele her first two Grammys \u2014 best new artist and best female pop vocal performance for \u201cChasing Pavements,\u201d which was her first top 30 hit on the Hot 100. This album initially peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 in February 2009 (following Adele\u2019s first big night at the Grammys), but reached its No. 4 peak in February 2012 (following her second, even bigger night at the Grammys).

It exploded thanks to the popularity of \u201cCruel Summer,\u201d which is Swift\u2019s longest-charting Hot 100 hit to date, and to the phenomenal success of Swift\u2019s The Eras Tour. In addition to its Grammy nod for best pop vocal album, the album\u2019s second single, \u201cYou Need to Calm Down,\u201d was nominated for best pop solo performance and the album\u2019s title song was nominated for song of the year.

This is also the only album to log 10 or more weeks at No. 1 on both Catalog Albums and the Billboard 200. This album spawned four top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 the Olivia Newton-John/John Travolta collabs \u201cYou\u2019re the One That I Want\u201d and \u201cSummer Nights,\u201d Newton-John\u2019s solo smash \u201cHopelessly Devoted to You\u201d and Frankie Valli\u2019s \u201cGrease.\u201d This is the only album on this list that received a Grammy nomination for album of the year. (Feel free to inject here, \u201cYou mean to tell me [blank] wasn\u2019t nominated for album of the year?\u201d Nope, it wasn\u2019t.)

It\u2019s also the Christmas album with the longest run at No. 1. It was Grammy-nominated for best traditional pop vocal album, but, surprisingly, didn\u2019t win. (It lost to Paul McCartney\u2019s collection of standards, Kisses on the Bottom.) Queen, Greatest Hits, 105 weeks Image Credit: Richard E. Aaron/Redferns Released in the U.K.: Oct. 26, 1981 First reached No. 1: June 2, 2018 Billboard 200 peak: No. 8 (Nov. 28, 2020) Notes: This is the rock album with the longest run at No. 1. The compilation first hit No. 1 on Catalog Albums five months before the U.S. release of the film Bohemian Rhapsody, which turbocharged Queen\u2019s popularity. This album initially peaked at No. 14 on the Billboard 200 in December 1981, but finally reached its No. 8 peak in November 2020. Bob Marley & the Wailers, Legend, 126 weeks Released: May 8, 1984 First reached No. 1: May 22, 1993 Billboard 200 peak: No. 5 (Sept. 20, 2014) Notes: This compilation, consisting of recordings from 1972-81, was released three years after Marley\u2019s death on May 11, 1981. Marley had only one Hot 100 hit as an artist, \u201cRoots, Rock, Reggae,\u201d which reached No. 51 in 1976 \u2014 and that song isn\u2019t included on this compilation. Legend does include two songs Marley wrote that became big pop hits for other artists: \u201cStir It Up,\u201d a No. 12 hit for Johnny Nash in 1973 and \u201cI Shot the Sheriff,\u201d a No. 1 hit for Eric Clapton the following year. But though they weren\u2019t chart hits for him, many of the songs from Legend have become widely known, including \u201cOne Love\u201d (performed with an interpolation of the melody from another all-time classic, The Impressions\u2019 \u201cPeople Get Ready\u201d), \u201cThree Little Birds,\u201d \u201cJamming\u201d and \u201cGet Up, Stand Up.\u201d This compilation initially peaked at No. 54 on the Billboard 200 in October 1984, but finally muscled its way to its No. 5 peak in September 2014. Now that\u2019s more like it for one of the best-selling sets of all time, and one reggae collection that just about everybody knows.", "summary": "It\u2019s an eclectic list, to say the least, encompassing pop, traditional pop, rock, hard rock, R&#38;B, rap, country and reggae.", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/lists/top-catalog-albums-most-weeks-number-one/", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Albums-With-the-Most-Weeks-at-No.-1-on-Top-Catalog-Albums.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:00:00", "author": "Paul Grein", "authors": ["Paul Grein"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.285}

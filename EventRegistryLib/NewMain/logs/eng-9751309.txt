Instead, the ceremony will travel through the heart of Paris with the Seine River at the center of the festivities.\n\nFans are expected to line the Seine and watch athletes from each participating country travel through the city. Because of the unique setup, more fans than ever will be able to watch the ceremony.\n\nHere's a look at the Olympics opening ceremony in Paris by the numbers, from athletes and countries to boats and security personnel.\n\nMORE: Why swimmers are wary of Paris' Seine River\n\nGone (for now) are the days of Olympic athletes walking around the floor of an arena in front of cheering fans. In Paris, they won't have to walk at all, as they will instead float through the city on boats with hundreds of thousands of fans lining the Seine River.\n\nRoughly 94 boats are expected to travel through Paris carrying Olympic athletes. The full parade figures to have even more boats, with fireworks and other festivities in store around the parade of athletes.\n\nThe full ceremony will span 3.7 miles, or six kilometers, down the Seine River. As many as 300,000 fans are expected to line the river and watch the ceremony, a massive increase from the number of fans that would be able to watch in a traditional indoor venue.\n\nAs many as 75,000 police officers, security personnel, and military members will ensure that the ceremony can be carried out safely. While the festivities have a chance to be among the most unique in Olympic history, taking the ceremony out of an indoor venue makes it much more difficult to secure the vicinity.\n\nAs of April, Paris was looking for 22,000 private security forces in addition to the 35,000 police officers and 18,000 military members expected to be on hand to ensure everyone's safety.\n\nThe opening ceremony will kick off the 33rd Summer Olympics and third Summer Olympics hosted by Paris.\n\nMORE: Event schedule for Paris Olympics\n\nThere will be 206 countries represented at the Olympics in Paris. Each of the International Olympic Committee's 206 member nations is sending an athlete to the Summer Games.\n\nAbout 10,500 athletes from around the world are heading to the Olympics, with the majority participating in the opening ceremony.\n\nWhile 10,500 sounds like a large number, just 0.0001 percent of the world population has earned the right to compete at the Olympics this year. That's one in every 757,143 people. There will be what seems like an endless stream of athletes parading through Paris, but it's still a remarkably exclusive honor for =every individual competing in the games.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern Pentathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/GettyImages-2157595934.jpg?itok=mKMMi0fg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

For starters, the festivities kicking off the 33rd edition of the Games won't be held in a stadium -- they'll take place on a series of parade floats making their way through the French capital on the river Seine. The event is, according to Olympics organizers, meant to revolutionize the Games while \"remaining accessible to a large audience.\" Here's what you need to know about the opening ceremony for the 2024 Paris Games, which begins at 1:30 pm ET Friday.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the Summer Olympics, the opening ceremony will not be held inside a stadium. The choice made by the organization, in agreement with the city of Paris and the French government, is bold and unique, and opens up new avenues for sports competitions. The parade of athletes -- some 10,500 people belonging to the more than 200 participating Olympic committees -- will take place on the Seine, with boats for each delegation equipped with cameras to allow those watching on TV or streaming online to see the athletes up close. (Need to know how to watch the Summer Games? Look no further.)\n\nThe delegations will enter in the center of Paris. The parade will end its nearly 4-mile route in front of the Trocad\u00e9ro, where the other elements of the ceremony and the final performances will take place. The Olympic brazier will not be installed on the Eiffel Tower, as organizers originally planned; instead, the Jardin des Tuileries will host the famous Olympic flame of the Paris 2024 Games. The athletes competing in the Games will be present onstage along with the performers, which are rumored to include Celine Dion and Lady Gaga.", "source": {"uri": "wired.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wired"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@wired.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_France", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuileries_Garden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuileries Garden"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocad\u00e9ro", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trocad\u00e9ro"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre_zero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kilometre zero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Dion", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celine Dion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_flame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic flame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/66a1153131c2a082062f4389/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Olympics-Ceremony-Culture-GettyImages-2159461328.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

France won the title in 1984 in Los Angeles.\n\nBefore that, Israel's opening Olympic football match against Mali is set to be a first security test for the Games. France will deploy thousands of police officers to secure it amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nRugby Sevens is also on the menu on Wednesday, with French global star Antoine Dupont elevating the host country's hopes of a gold medal after their heartbreaking failure at the XVs World Cup last year. France play the US at 4:30 pm and then Uruguay at 8:00 pm.\n\nHandball and archery will make their own debut at the Paris Games on Thursday, and shooting on Friday, before floating parades of athletes and artists on the river Seine take part in the Games' first ever opening ceremony outside a stadium.\n\nOrganisers said the ceremony, protected by 45,000 police and thousands more military, would be a daring, joyful show.\n\nDozens of boats will carry athletes and performers on a 6 km route along the Seine. More than 300,000 spectators will be watching from the riverbanks, with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on TV or on social media.\n\nDetails including some of the artists taking part, who will last carry the torch and light the Olympic cauldron to mark the start of the Games, have been kept secret, and the ceremony's artistic team said they had been rehearsing in private to keep it all under wraps.\n\nBut what is known is that there will be a floating parade, departing from Austerlitz bridge, sailing by Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral and arriving near the Eiffel Tower, with the show also using nearby monuments and mixing music, light and dance.\n\nSightings in Paris of Canadian singer Celine Dion, who last year cancelled the European stretch of a world tour over a rare medical condition, have kicked off rumours that she could be taking part in the opening ceremony.\n\nFrench Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera said Dion's presence in Paris was not a coincidence. In an interview with TF1 TV she declined to say if Dion - best known for the \"Titanic\" movie theme song \"My Heart Will Go On\" - would sing, adding that there were \"many possible roles\" one could play in an opening ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, the start of the Games was marred by a scandal over video footage that led to Britain's joint-most decorated female Olympian Charlotte Dujardin pulling out of the Paris Games. The video shows Dujardin whipping a horse's legs multiple times.\n\nFrench police have arrested a Russian man suspected of planning to destabilise the Olympics, the Paris prosecutor's office said on Wednesday, which could take the form of disinformation or other types of attack.\n\nFive Australian women's water polo players have tested positive for COVID-19, the country's Olympic team chief Anna Meares said on Wednesday. Meares added that the cases were confined to the water polo team.\n\nFrance is set to host the Winter Games six years after the Summer Olympics, after it was conditionally picked as host for the 2030 event on Wednesday. Salt Lake City was awarded the 2034 Winter Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "arnnewscentre.ae", "dataType": "news", "title": "ARN News Centre"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But today we are exactly where we would have dreamed of being a few years ago.\"\n\nIn his reply to CGTN Sports Scene's Greg Laffradi, Estanguet said that he's confident that the openning ceremony of the Games will be \"a great moment of celebration.\"\n\n\"All the predictions are very positive for the weather on next Friday,\" Estanguet said. \"So, you can be confident it will be a great moment of celebration.\"\n\nThe opening ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics will take place on Friday on the River Seine, where the outdoor Olympic swimming events will happen.\n\n\"All the indicators for the Seine are positive at this stage,\" Estanguet added. Both he and Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, swam in the river last week to prove the quality of the water.\n\nIn the first Summer Olympic opening ceremony outside the main stadium, 6,000-7,000 athletes will sail down the Seine on 85 barges and boats. As many as 300,000 spectators are set to watch the parade from stands and on the river banks when another 200,000 will do so from the overlooking apartments.\n\n\"We've always tried to maintain as high a level of ambition as possible so that these Games make France shine,\" Estanguet said and reminded people that there are still about 4,000 tickets available for the opening ceremony.\n\nAround 45,000 members of the French security forces are set to be on duty when the opening ceremony begins. Estanguet made it clear that \"security was the number one priority for Paris 2024.\"\n\n\"There's a balance to be found between top security, which is absolutely the priority,\" he said. \"It's part of the objective to guarantee the security and to propose a fantastic celebration of the Games...

Picture: Kevin Voigt/GettyImages\n\nFootball and Rugby Sevens kick off the sport at the Paris Olympics Wednesday, two days before the opening ceremony, featuring a top French star and a huge police presence for Israel's first appearance.\n\nIsrael's footballers take on Mali in the men's competition, under the watchful eye of 1,000 police officers, with authorities erecting an \"anti-terrorist perimeter\" and bracing for possible disruption around the stadium.\n\nA French police source told AFP it was possible that \"people shout insults from the stands\" or that there is \"whistling and flags shown during the hymns, for example.\"\n\nIsrael's participation in Paris has been a key talking point in the run-up, with calls from the Palestinian Olympic Committee and some left-wing French MPs for the country to be excluded over the Gaza war.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron stressed the Israeli athletes were \"welcome in our country\", adding it was \"France's responsibility to provide them with security.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a packed Stade de France will cheer on Antoine Dupont -- arguably the world's best rugby player and a pin-up of the Paris Games -- as the Rugby Sevens tournament starts.\n\nThe electric Dupont is the biggest draw for the 555,000 fans expected over the six days of rugby action, but France will have their work cut out to stop double Olympic champions Fiji.\n\nFrance and Fiji are in the same pool and will play the United States and Uruguay, before the pair face each other in a mouthwatering clash on Thursday.\n\nOthers to watch in the wide-open competition are traditional rugby powers New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, and Ireland, who take on South Africa's Blitzboks on Wednesday evening.\n\nPreparations for Friday's historic opening ceremony were in full swing with an unprecedented security operation for the athlete's parade along the River Seine.\n\nAround 6,000-7,000 athletes are set to sail down a six-kilometre (four-mile) stretch of the river towards the Eiffel Tower, on 85 barges and boats.\n\nUp to 500,000 people are set to watch in person from specially built stands, on the river banks and from the overlooking balconies and apartments.\n\nThe area around the river has been locked down before the ceremony, with snipers positioned along the route and frogmen deployed to prevent a waterborne attack.\n\nThe entertainment line-up for the ceremony, the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium, is yet to be fully announced.\n\nBut videos posted online showing US pop star Lady Gaga in Paris sparked rumours she will be among the performers.\n\nAmerican rapper Snoop Dogg will carry the Olympic flame this Friday as it makes its final rounds before the ceremony.\n\nSome Paris business owners grumbled the security measures were hurting their bottom line.\n\n\"We were told there would be loads of people during the Olympics and even before. But in fact, no. There's no one,\" Jonas Seignovert, manager of the Eugene restaurant, told AFP.\n\nIn the first scandal of the Games, a video emerged showing the mistreatment of a horse that led to one of Britain's most decorated Olympians, dressage specialist Charlotte Dujardin, being ejected from the Paris Games.\n\nThe video showed three-time Olympic champion Dujardin walking alongside a horse and repeatedly whipping the animal while training a young rider.\n\nDujardin, 39, who has won six Olympic medals and was aiming to become Britain's most successful female Olympian by winning further medals in Paris, has admitted to an \"error of judgement\" and said she was \"deeply ashamed\" of her actions.\n\nWith one Games about to start, France is already looking to host another Olympics, as the International Olympic Committee awarded the 2030 Winter Games to the French Alps.\n\nThe IOC handed the games to France but under the condition that Paris stumps up the required financial commitments.\n\nFrance is the only candidate to host the 2030 Games but the funding has been in question because there is no government in place following inconclusive snap elections.\n\nMacron told IOC members he would ask France's next prime minister to give a financial \"guarantee\" for hosting the Games.", "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It will take place outside in the middle of Paris on the Seine River.\n\nAthletes will be introduced on boats as a part of the ceremony's parade, and cameras will be on board to get up-close video for at-home viewers.\n\nBecause it's outdoors along the Seine River, there is free admission for certain seats. More exclusive seating can be purchased.\n\nHere's all there is to know about the Olympics opening ceremony and its route through Paris.\n\nMORE: What is the Paris poop protest?\n\nThe Summer Games began in Athens, Greece in 1896, but the 2024 Olympics will be the first to have the opening ceremony outside of a stadium.\n\nThe parade begins at the Austerlitz bridge next to the Jardin des Plantes at 1:30 p.m. ET and 7:30 p.m. CET, or local time, in Paris. The boats will move along the Seine River, going around the Ile Saint Louis and the Ile de la Cite -- the two islands in the Seine River.\n\nAfter passing the islands, the boats will continue on their paths from east to west. They'll pass some of the Olympic venues before concluding the six-kilometer route at the Lena Bridge.\n\nThe ceremony will then finish at the Trocadero, which is near the Eiffel Tower.\n\nFans can line up along the Seine River to watch the parade take place. There will be free seating for those looking to sit in the upper quays in between the Austerlitz and Lena bridges. Those looking to sit in the lower quays will need to purchase tickets.\n\nParis Olympic coordinators will have 80 \"giant\" screens and speakers positioned along the river to enhance the experience.\n\nThe opening ceremony is expected to be the largest in Olympic Games history, with an additional 1.5 billion viewers projected to watch on TV and online.\n\nThe Olympics opening ceremony will take place on July 26 at 1:30 p.m. ET and 7:30 p.m. local time in Paris.\n\nSome events will have already started, but this officially marks the beginning of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nThere will be about 94 boats in the Olympics opening ceremony, including \"boats for each national delegation.\" Performers and athletes will be on board.\n\nWhile the opening ceremony is focused on introducing the Summer Games and its athletes, there will be some performances to enhance the event.\n\nThere will be about 3,000 artists and 400 dancers performing at the opening ceremony.

While most countries around the world embrace the hosting duties, it's been no secret that Parisians would rather see anything but fall on their fairytale-like streets.\n\nA survey published by The Spectator earlier this year revealed that nearly 44 per cent of locals thought the Olympics were a 'bad thing', while 52 per cent of local residents considered leaving Paris for the duration of the games.\n\nOne of the most notable detractions from the otherwise picturesque streets of Paris was the huge police presence and blocked roads at every turn.\n\nAnd while I didn't notice a great deal of cafe or boutique closures, one thing is for sure - Paris is looking her absolute best. And that goes for the green glisten of the Seine as well.\n\nThe river itself will host perhaps the most epic moment of the next two weeks -- as almost 100 boats and around 10,000 athletes drift down 6km of river and past iconic landmarks for the opening ceremony.\n\nFrom Notre Dame to Pont Neuf and finally the Eiffel Tower -- the Seine will set the scene as potentially the most mind-blowing opening ceremony of all time. Or, if one element has its way, perhaps the worst.\n\nThe opening ceremony has been under wraps in the lead up to the big event, including the identity of performers and even what will be happening along the banks of the river.\n\nWith more than a billion set to tune in to watch the Olympic Games in Paris, the opening ceremony on the Seine could be thrown into jeopardy if rain hits or the river sees a tide rise or abnormally strong conditions.\n\nLast month proved how easily the ceremony itself could be thrown into disarray. A planned rehearsal for the outdoor opening ceremony was pushed back because recent heavy rains caused an already fast flowing Seine to be going five times faster than it normally does.\n\nThe rehearsal would have featured around 90 barges which will be used to transport teams on their parade down the river in the July 26 ceremony.\n\nIt's an opening ceremony plan that would make Paris the first Olympics ever to host an opening ceremony outside its main stadium and a sporting event never before seen in history.\n\nBut it's an attempt that comes with enormous risk.\n\nTo make the river as secure as can be for the opening, local and federal law enforcement are planning around 45,000 officers, up from the 30,000 expected daily during the rest of the Olympics.\n\nIt's been reported that the French military will bring in another 15,000 for the entirety of the Games, and Paris 2024 will bring in up to 22,000 private security personnel.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron has said there is a Plan B should the security risk become too great, however he and other officials have insisted the Opening Ceremony on the Seine will be safe.\n\nBut while it feels like there is still a marathon effort still at play ahead of Friday's audacious plan, Tony Estanguet, the Paris Olympics chief, said city is \"ready\" for the event.\n\n\"We are ready as we head into the final phase,\" Estanguet told a press conference in Paris.\n\n\"For as long as the closing ceremony hasn't finished, we need to remain vigilant. But today we are exactly where we would have dreamed of being a few years ago.\"\n\nWhile 300,000 ticketed spectators will watch from stands and the riverbanks, there will be an additional 200,000 viewing from apartments overlooking the area.\n\nSo while the potentially breathtaking ceremony will be a world first, there's no doubt that what unfolds on the murky green river Seine will well and truly be at the hands of mother nature.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vanessa_brown@news.com.au", "name": "Vanessa Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spectator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Spectator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barricade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barricade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detection dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Notre Dame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_Neuf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pont Neuf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Estanguet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Estanguet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Paddling", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Paddling", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f67ccec3fc28d61c227b0cd9bd6b59bc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 2707, "textEnd": 2714}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Football and rugby sevens events begin in Paris amidst chaos and police intervention", "body": "The Olympics will officially begin with the opening ceremony, scheduled for July 26.\n\nThe sporting programme at the Paris Olympics endured a chaotic start on Wednesday as men's football kicked off while a huge police operation was put in place for Israel's first appearance at the Games.\n\nTwo days before the opening ceremony, Morocco beat Argentina 2-1 in Saint-Etienne, but only after a late equaliser for the South American side was disallowed and the final minutes were played out in an empty stadium following crowd trouble.\n\nArgentina thought they had escaped with a 2-2 draw when Cristian Medina scored in the 16th minute of added time.\n\nBut as their players celebrated, projectiles including bottles and plastic cups rained down from the stands and several spectators entered the pitch, with the referee promptly blowing the whistle.\n\nThe teams left the playing area, but the referee had not blown for full-time and the outcome of the match was unclear until the sides finally reappeared two hours later to play out three more minutes in a stadium that was by now emptied of spectators.\n\nMedina's goal was eventually disallowed for offside following a review and Morocco celebrated a 2-1 win.\n\n\"It is a disgrace that this should happen and poison the tournament,\" said Argentina coach Javier Mascherano.\n\nIsrael's footballers later on Wednesday took on Mali under the watchful eye of 1,000 police officers, with authorities erecting an \"anti-terrorist perimeter\" and braced for possible disruption around the stadium.\n\nIsrael's participation in Paris has been a key talking point in the run-up, with calls from the Palestine Olympic Committee and some left-wing French MPs for the country to be excluded over the Gaza war.\n\nALSO READ: Israeli athletes 'welcomed' in Paris while Palestinian contingent calls for exclusion\n\nSome Palestinian and Israeli flags were flown with angry words exchanged amongst some fans at the Parc des Princes in Paris.\n\nHowever, French interior minister Gerald Darmanin said \"there has been no security problems to our knowledge.\"\n\nA packed Stade de France cheered on Antoine Dupont - arguably the world's best rugby player and a pin-up of the Paris Games - as he helped his team into the quarter-finals.\n\nA 12-12 draw with the United States was followed by a nervy 19-12 win over Uruguay.\n\nIn the same pool, double champions Fiji also made the knockout round with back-to-back wins over Uruguay and the United States.\n\nIOC warns Salt Lake\n\nAs the clock ticks down towards Friday's opening ceremony along the Seine, Olympic chiefs awarded the 2030 Winter Games to the French Alps and the 2034 event to Salt Lake City.\n\nBut in a dramatic twist they warned the US city could be stripped of the Games if American authorities kept up their feud with the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\nJohn Coates, the chairman of the IOC's legal commission, said the host city contract confirming Salt Lake's right to stage the Olympics had been altered to allow the IOC to strip it of the Games if US authorities did not respect the \"supreme authority\" of WADA.\n\nThe US anti-doping agency has been a vocal critic of WADA for much of the past decade and tensions escalated this year after reports in April revealed that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a banned substance ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, but were subsequently cleared to compete at the Games.\n\nUSADA chief Travis Tygart accused Olympic bosses of \"stooping to threats.\"\n\n\"Today's demonstration further showed that as it stands today, WADA is just a sport lapdog, and clean athletes have little chance,\" said Tygart.\n\nSecurity lockdown\n\nPreparations for Friday's historic opening ceremony were in full swing with an unprecedented security operation for the athletes' parade along the River Seine.\n\nAround 6,000-7,000 athletes are set to sail down a six-kilometre (four-mile) stretch of the river towards the Eiffel Tower, on 85 barges and boats.\n\nUp to 500,000 people are set to watch in person from specially built stands, on the river banks and from the overlooking balconies and apartments.\n\nThe area around the river has been locked down before the ceremony, with snipers positioned along the route and frogmen deployed to prevent a waterborne attack.\n\nThe entertainment line-up for the ceremony, the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium, is yet to be fully announced.\n\nBut videos posted online showing US pop star Lady Gaga in Paris sparked rumours she will be among the performers.\n\nAmerican rapper Snoop Dogg will carry the Olympic flame this Friday as it makes its final rounds before the ceremony.\n\nScandals\n\nIn the first scandal of the Games, a video emerged showing the mistreatment of a horse by one of Britain's most decorated Olympians, dressage specialist Charlotte Dujardin, who has been suspended.\n\nThe film showed the three-time Olympic champion walking alongside a horse and repeatedly whipping the animal while apparently training a young rider.\n\nDujardin, 39, has won six Olympic medals and was aiming to become Britain's most successful female Olympian by winning further medals in Paris.\n\nIn a further controversy, an assistant coach and an analyst with the Canadian women's football team were sent home after rivals were spied upon.\n\nThe analyst, 43-year-old Joey Lombardi, was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session.\n\nLombardi pleaded guilty when he appeared in court in Saint-Etienne on Wednesday, the court told AFP.\n\nThe assistant coach was Jasmine Mander, to whom Lombardi reported.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@scroll.in", "name": "Agence

Organizers said it would reach a climax at around 9:35 pm when the sun sets.\n\nThe show will be attended by over 100 heads of state and government and over 300,000 spectators will watch from the river's banks, organizers said, adding that there will be some 80 giant screens along the way.\n\nThe Paris 2024 committee said there would be about 10,500 athletes and some 222,000 people will get free invites, while 104,000 will have to buy a ticket.\n\nBoats carrying the athletes will be equipped with cameras to allow those watching on TV or their phone to get a close-up view, the committee said.\n\nOrganizing the ceremony in the heart of an iconic city like Paris may make for great pictures, but it's also a major security challenge.\n\nSome 45,000 police will be dispatched to ensure the ceremony's security, including special intervention forces. Snipers will be deployed on the top of buildings along the route. An anti-drone system will be in place.\n\nSpectators and local residents alike will need to carry permits on a QR code to get anywhere near the riverbanks from July 18.\n\nCars won't be allowed into the area, with few exceptions. Nearby metro stations will be closed, as will many of the bridges. No planes will be allowed to fly over Paris - unless they are part of the ceremony.\n\nWith wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and security concerns at home, France already has its security alert at its highest level.\n\nOfficials have said there were no specific terror threats to the July 26 ceremony.\n\nBut should specific concerns arise, there are backup plans, that would either see the ceremony limited to the Trocadero square near the Eiffel tower, or the Stade de France stadium.\n\nThe main potential risk would be from a lone attacker, officials have said over the past months, while also flagging potential petty crime and possible protests, from environmental activists, the far right and far left, the pro-Palestinian movement or others.\n\nA man was arrested in May in Saint-Etienne, suspected of planning an attack in the name of Islamic State at the city's soccer stadium during the Olympics.\n\nA right-wing sympathizer was arrested in eastern France in July on suspicion of plotting attacks to take place during the Olympics.\n\nTokyo 2020: The opening ceremony was overshadowed by the COVID pandemic. Postponed by a year due to the coronavirus, the Games were held largely without spectators.\n\nRio 2016: A financially constrained Brazil had little choice but to put on a more low-key show, with minimal technology and a heavy dependence on the vast talent of Brazil and its Carnival party traditions.\n\nLondon 2012: The 86-year-old Queen Elizabeth put aside royal reserve in a video where she stepped onto a helicopter with James Bond actor Daniel Craig to be carried aloft from Buckingham Palace as part of a dizzying ceremony designed to highlight the grandeur and eccentricities of the nation.\n\nBeijing 2008: About one billion people, or 15 percent of the world's population, watched the opening ceremony, which involved 10,000 performers, 2008 drummers and a dramatic sky-walking finale. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jasmine_payo@rappler.com", "name": "Jasmine Payo", "type": "author", "isAgency":

This will start the ceremony, not mark the end of it, another break from tradition.\n\nWhat time does the opening ceremony start?\n\nThe ceremony starts at 1:30 p.m. EDT/7:30 p.m. CEST and is expected to last more than three hours.\n\nWhere is the opening ceremony be\n\ning held?\n\nThe parade starts at the Austerlitz Bridge beside the Jardin des Plantes and follows the course of the Seine from east to west. It makes its way around two islands in the center of the city before passing under several bridges and gateways. Athletes aboard the boats will get glimpses of several Olympic venues including La Concorde Urban Park (3X3 basketball, breaking, BMX freestyle cycling, skateboarding), Invalides (archery, athletics -- marathon finish, road cycling -- time trial start) and the Grand Palais (fencing, taekwondo). The parade ends at the Iena Bridge, which links the Eiffel Tower on the left bank of the Seine to the Trocad\u00e9ro district on the right bank. The ceremony's finale is at the Trocad\u00e9ro. There, among other ceremonial procedures, French President Emmanuel Macron will deliver opening remarks.\n\nHow can I watch t\n\nhe opening ceremony?\n\nThe ceremony will air on NBC and stream on Peacock and NBC Olympic platforms -- NBCOlympics.com, NBC.com, NBC app, NBC Olympics app.\n\nA preview will air on NBC at noon EDT, with live coverage beginning at 1:30 p.m. and an enhanced prime-time encore at 7:30 p.m.\n\nAbout 220,000 invited and security-screened spectators are expected to fill the upper tiers of the Seine's banks, and an additional 104,000 paying spectators will watch from the lower riverside and around the Trocad\u00e9ro plaza.\n\nThose in Paris who could not get tickets will be able to watch the ceremony on 80 giant screens set up throughout the city.\n\nWho is performing at the opening ceremony?\n\nIn addition to the athletes who will participate in the parade, 3,000 dancers, artists and other athletes will be featured in the opening and closing ceremonies. Most of the entertainment acts remain under wraps. NBC News reported that Celine Dion and Lady Gaga have arrived in Paris amid speculation that one or both of the pop singers will perform at the opening ceremony.\n\nWhat happens if it rains at the opening ceremony?\n\nWell, onlookers and athletes will get wet since there is no roof over the Seine.\n\nAccording to the latest weather forecast, there is a small chance of rain. Meteo-France, the French weather service, is predicting overcast skies from midday onward, with light rain expected in the morning. The weather should improve in the afternoon, but the weather service warned Thursday that showers could hit the Paris region in the evening.\n\nIf it rains, the ceremony is expected to go on as planned.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

This will start the ceremony, not mark the end of it, another break from tradition.\n\nThe ceremony starts at 1:30 p.m. EDT/7:30 p.m. CEST and is expected to last more than three hours.\n\nThe parade starts at the Austerlitz Bridge beside the Jardin des Plantes and follows the course of the Seine from east to west. It makes its way around two islands in the center of the city before passing under several bridges and gateways. Athletes aboard the boats will get glimpses of several Olympic venues including La Concorde Urban Park (3X3 basketball, breaking, BMX freestyle cycling, skateboarding), Invalides (archery, athletics - marathon finish, road cycling - time trial start) and the Grand Palais (fencing, taekwondo). The parade ends at the Iena Bridge, which links the Eiffel Tower on the left bank of the Seine to the Trocad\u00e9ro district on the right bank. The ceremony\u00b4s finale is at the Trocad\u00e9ro. There, among other ceremonial procedures, French President Emmanuel Macron will deliver opening remarks.\n\nThe ceremony will air on NBC and stream on Peacock and NBC Olympic platforms - NBCOlympics.com, NBC.com, NBC app, NBC Olympics app.\n\nA preview will air on NBC at noon EDT, with live coverage beginning at 1:30 p.m. and an enhanced prime-time encore at 7:30 p.m.\n\nA bomb squad boat navigates the Seine River as officials prepare for Friday's opening ceremony, ahead of the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, July 22, 2024, in Paris, France. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)\n\nAbout 220,000 invited and security-screened spectators are expected to fill the upper tiers of the Seine's banks, and an additional 104,000 paying spectators will watch from the lower riverside and around the Trocad\u00e9ro plaza.\n\nThose in Paris who could not get tickets will be able to watch the ceremony on 80 giant screens set up throughout the city.\n\nIn addition to the athletes who will participate in the parade, 3,000 dancers, artists and other athletes will be featured in the opening and closing ceremonies. Most of the entertainment acts remain under wraps. NBC News reported that Celine Dion and Lady Gaga have arrived in Paris amid speculation that one or both of the pop singers will perform at the opening ceremony.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nThe sun sets against the Hotel des Invalides as a spectator walks on the Alexander III bridge over the Seine River, Friday, July 19, 2024, in Paris, ahead of the 2024 Summer Olympics.

France won the title in 1984 in Los Angeles.\n\nBefore that, Israel's opening Olympic soccer match against Mali is set to be a first security test for the Games. France will deploy thousands of police officers to secure it amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nRugby Sevens is also on the menu on Wednesday, with French global star Antoine Dupont elevating the host country's hopes of a gold medal after their heartbreaking failure at the XVs World Cup last year. France play the U.S. at 4.30pm and then Uruguay at 8pm.\n\nHandball and archery will make their own debut at the Paris Games on Thursday, and shooting on Friday, before floating parades of athletes and artists on the river Seine take part in the Games' first ever opening ceremony outside a stadium.\n\nOrganisers said the ceremony, protected by 45,000 police and thousands more military, would be a daring, joyful show.\n\nVIDEO SCANDAL\n\nDozens of boats will carry athletes and performers on a 6km route along the Seine. More than 300,000 spectators will be watching from the riverbanks, with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on TV or on social media.\n\nDetails including some of the artists taking part, who will last carry the torch and light the Olympic cauldron to mark the start of the Games, have been kept secret, and the ceremony's artistic team said they had been rehearsing in private to keep it all under wraps.\n\nBut what is known is that there will be a floating parade, departing from Austerlitz bridge, sailing by Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral and arriving near the Eiffel Tower, with the show also using nearby monuments and mixing music, light and dance.\n\nSightings in Paris of Canadian singer Celine Dion, who last year cancelled the European stretch of a world tour over a rare medical condition, have kicked off rumours that she could be taking part in the opening ceremony.\n\nFrench Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera said Dion's presence in Paris was not a coincidence. In an interview with TF1 TV she declined to say if Dion - best known for the \"Titanic\" movie theme song \"My Heart Will Go On\" - would sing, adding that there were \"many possible roles\" one could play in an opening ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, the start of the Games was marred by a scandal over video footage that led to Britain's joint-most decorated female Olympian Charlotte Dujardin pulling out of the Paris Games.\n\nThe video shows Dujardin whipping a horse's legs multiple times.\n\nFrench police have arrested a Russian man suspected of planning to destabilise the Olympics, the Paris prosecutor's office said on Wednesday, which could take the form of disinformation or other types of attack.\n\nFive Australian women's water polo players have tested positive for COVID-19, the country's Olympic team chief Anna Meares said on Wednesday. Meares added that the cases were confined to the water polo team.\n\nFrance is set to host the Winter Games six years after the Summer Olympics, after it was conditionally picked as host for the 2030 event on Wednesday. Salt Lake City was awarded the 2034 Winter Olympics.\n\n(Writing by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Christian Radnedge)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"},

(Christophe Petit Tesson/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics is underway, with Paris 2024 holding its first sporting events on Wednesday as soccer and rugby sevens took their respective fields of play. Handball will join the action on Thursday, but the 2024 Olympics won't officially begin until the opening ceremony takes place on Friday. It is the quadrennial commencement of any Olympic Games, and dating back to 1996, it has always occurred on a Friday evening local time.\n\nJust as athletes prepare for four years for their chance to shine at the Games, those who put on the Opening Ceremony do the same, and here's what you need to know about the 2024 Olympics Opening Ceremony.\n\nThe opening ceremony will air live on NBC beginning on Friday at 1:30 p.m. ET, with a 90-minute preshow starting at noon ET. It will also stream on Peacock, and NBC will replay a condensed version of the ceremony at 7:30 p.m. ET on Friday.\n\nSportscaster Mike Tirico will host, with Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning and singer Kelly Clarkson commentating for NBC.\n\nParis, France, will be the scene, and many landmarks of the French capital will be featured throughout the ceremony, including the Eiffel Tower, the Seine River, and Jardins du Trocad\u00e9ro.\n\nSpectators will line the Seine River while the cast in the ceremony, and the athletes will travel from the Pont d'Austerlitz Bridge to the Pont d'I\u00e9na Bridge by boat.\n\nThe Jardins du Trocad\u00e9ro is the final destination, where the main performances and the lighting of the Olympic cauldron will take place.\n\nThe ancient Games is the inspiration behind the modern Olympic torch relay, which was first seen in 1936 at the Berlin Games.\n\nThe 2024 Olympics torch relay began on April 16 in Olympia, Greece, the site of the ancient Games, and will conclude at the opening ceremony.\n\nMany of France's most popular current and former athletes have taken part in the relay over the last three months, including four-time NBA champion Tony Parker and four-time Olympic medalist swimmer Florent Manaudou.Additionally, athletes not from France were invited to partake, such as American snowboarder Shaun White and two-time Olympian soccer player Megan Rapinoe.\n\nThe Olympic torch relay has also attracted those outside the sports world, with actress Halle Berry and chef Anne-Sophie Pic carrying the torch as two examples. Rapper Snoop Dogg is part of the final leg of the relay as it makes its way to the opening ceremony.\n\nThe person who will take the baton last and light the Olympic cauldron has not yet been announced and will be revealed when it's time to do so. Past dignitaries to have lit the Olympic cauldron include tennis player Naomi Osaka (2020 Tokyo), boxer Muhammad Ali (1996 Atlanta), and soccer player Michel Platini (1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France).\n\nThere are 206 nations represented at Paris 2024, and there will be over 10,000 athletes set to compete.\n\nOne of the biggest traditions during the opening ceremony is the Parade of Nations, where every athlete congregates with their fellow national team members to walk through the ceremony venue. The athletes are preceded by their flag, and certain athletes are chosen to be their nation's flagbearer.\n\nAs per tradition, Greece will enter first, with the host country, France, entering last. The penultimate nation to enter is the one hosting the next Summer Olympics -- in this case, the United States in 2028 -- and the third-to-last nation hosting the following Olympics, which will be Australia in 2032. Outside of those four, all other nations will enter in alphabetical order.\n\nLeBron James, a three-time Olympic medalist, was chosen as the American male flag bearer and will become the first male basketball player to carry the U.S. flag at the Olympics.\n\nCoco Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open women's tennis champion, will be the American female flag bearer. This will be Cauff's first Olympics. She was set to compete at the 2020 Olympics but had to withdraw after testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe Olympics Opening Ceremony is as much about honoring the athletes as it is an artistic show. France will get the opportunity to showcase itself both in terms of athletics and artistry, with a performance slated to feature over 2,000 dancers.\n\nIncluding both the opening and closing ceremonies for the Olympics and Paralympics, nearly 3,000 artists are expected to take part.\n\nThe musicians and entertainers slated to perform have been kept under wraps, with artistic director Thomas Jolly saying, \"All I can tell you is that it will be very meaningful for the artists that will perform.\"\n\nRoughly 300,000 people are expected to attend the 2024 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony in some form or fashion. That includes those at Jardins du Trocad\u00e9ro, as well as fans who line the Seine River while the athletes travel to the venue.\n\nWith the last Summer Olympics, which were held in 2021, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, just over 10,000 people attended that year's opening ceremony.\n\nFrench officials estimate that over one billion people worldwide will view some of the opening ceremony.\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics span 19 days, but Friday will be the only day in which no sporting events take place. The athletes get the day to themselves as either a welcome to the Olympic Games or a rest day if they already started competing earlier in the week.\n\nOnce the opening ceremony concludes, 14 medal events will be held on Saturday, with the peak coming on the penultimate day. There will be 39 medal events on Aug. 10, and then a final 13 medals will be handed out the next day before the 2024 Olympics Closing Ceremony concludes Paris 2024 at Stade de France.", "source":

They've got to the Olympics and they can just relax, enjoy it and they just get involved with all the stuff around it.\n\n'Whereas I guess I've been very privileged and always been a situation where I can challenge for medals so it's very performance-based.\n\n'And that then means you go, \"no\" [to the opening ceremony].

Sorry to burst the bubble.\n\n'You're standing for like hours and hours and hours to get in the right place so they can parade you in at exactly the right moment and that's not good for performance, basically.'\n\nAsked what she plans to do on Friday night instead, Evans added: 'I think we're going to do something on the evening, we'll probably go for dinner in the [opening ceremony] kit as like a nod to it, if you like.'\n\nScottish cyclist Evans has won Olympic and Commonwealth Games medals in track endurance events. She became a world champion for the first time in 2022.\n\nThe Paris medal hopeful won a silver in the team pursuit at the Tokyo Games in 2020 and has over 30 podium finishes across her career.\n\nThe opening ceremony for the Paris 2024 Olympics will start at 7.30pm local time (6.30pm UK time) on Friday 26 July.\n\n'We are ready and we will be ready throughout the Games,' president Macron said

Pitch invaders are detained by stewards after the match. REUTERS\n\nParis will officially kick off its Olympics extravaganza with an unprecedented opening ceremony on the river Seine on Friday.\n\nHere is what you need to know about the ceremony:\n\nWHEN AND WHERE IS THE OPENING CEREMONY TAKING PLACE?\n\nFor the first time, the Games' opening ceremony will not take place in a stadium.\n\nInstead, around 85 boats will carry nearly 7,000 athletes on a 6km floating parade on the Seine, at the heart of Paris.\n\nDeparting from the Austerlitz bridge, they will sail past the Notre-Dame cathedral and arrive near the Eiffel Tower, after passing under bridges and gateways, including the Pont des Arts and Pont Neuf, and near many of the French capital's landmarks.\n\nThe ceremony is due to start at 7.30 pm (1730 GMT) and last about three hours and 45 minutes.\n\nThey say it will be daring and joyful and take advantage of the historic monuments, riverbanks, sky and water \"and there won't be a single riverbank or bridge that won't be filled with music, dance, or performance.\"\n\nSome 80 giant screens along the way will broadcast the show, which will include a floating parade of athletes and artists and is also expected to feature dancers performing from the roof of buildings along the Seine.\n\nThe show will be \"a large fresco\" celebrating Paris, France and the Games and will interweave the parade of athletes, artistic performances and elements of protocol, said Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of the opening ceremony.\n\nDetails including who will light the Olympic cauldron to mark the start of the Games, or which artists are taking part, have been kept secret.\n\nBut Lady Gaga and Celine Dion are among singers who have been spotted in Paris, triggering rumours they could take part in the ceremony.\n\nFrench media said Franco-Malian pop star Aya Nakamura, the most listened to French female singer in the world, will sing a song by the late Charles Aznavour.\n\nNakamura was the target of racist abuse online when it was first rumoured that she would take part in the ceremony. She sings in French, with frequent use of slang, her style influenced by West Indies zouk music, mixing in American R'n'B and Afrobeats.\n\nOne big unknown is the weather. It is currently forecast to be cloudy, when organisers were hoping there would be a \"golden hour\" of sunset lighting up buildings midway through the ceremony.\n\nWHO WILL BE THERE?\n\nThe show will be attended by over 80 heads of state and government and more than 300,000 spectators will watch from the river's banks, organisers said.\n\nThe Paris 2024 committee said some 222,000 people would get free invites, while 104,000 will have to buy a ticket.\n\nBoats carrying the athletes will be equipped with cameras to allow those watching on TV or their phone to get a close-up view, the committee said.\n\nWHAT ABOUT SECURITY?\n\nOrganising the ceremony in the heart of an iconic city like Paris may make for great pictures, but it's also a major security challenge.\n\nSome 2,000 private security staff and 45,000 police will be dispatched to ensure the ceremony's security, including special intervention forces. Snipers will be deployed on the top of buildings along the route. An anti-drone system will be in place.\n\nSpectators and local residents need to carry permits on a QR code to get anywhere near the riverbanks. Cars won't be allowed into the area, with few exceptions.\n\nNearby metro stations will be closed, as will many of the bridges. No planes will be allowed to fly over Paris - unless they are part of the ceremony.\n\nWith wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and security concerns at home, France already has its security alert at its highest level.\n\nOfficials have said there are no specific terror threats to the ceremony.\n\nThe main potential risk would be from a lone attacker, officials have said over the past months, while also flagging potential petty crime and possible protests, from environmental activists, the far right and far left, the pro-Palestinian movement or others.\n\nA man was arrested in May in Saint-Etienne, suspected of planning an attack in the name of Islamic State at the city's soccer stadium during the Olympics.\n\nA right-wing sympathiser was arrested in eastern France in July on suspicion of plotting attacks to take place during the Olympics.\n\nPAST SUMMER OLYMPICS' OPENING CEREMONIES\n\nTokyo 2020: The opening ceremony was overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Postponed by a year due to the coronavirus, the Games were held largely without spectators.\n\nRio 2016: Financially constrained Brazil had little choice but to put on a more low-key show, with minimal technology and a heavy dependence on the country's Carnival party traditions.\n\nLondon 2012: The 86-year-old Queen Elizabeth put aside royal reserve in a video where she stepped onto a helicopter with James Bond actor Daniel Craig to be carried aloft from Buckingham Palace as part of a dizzying ceremony designed to highlight the grandeur and eccentricities of the nation.\n\nBeijing 2008: About one billion people, or 15% of the world's population, watched the opening ceremony, which involved 10,000 performers, 2008 drummers and a dramatic sky-walking finale.", "source": {"uri":

Rugby, football kick off Paris 2024", "body": "Britain's Charlotte Dujardin has three Olympic gold medals in dressage\n\nFootball and Rugby Sevens kick off the sport at the Paris Olympics Wednesday, two days before the opening ceremony, featuring a top French star and a huge police presence for Israel's first appearance.\n\nIsrael's footballers take on Mali in the men's competition, under the watchful eye of 1,000 police officers, with authorities erecting an \"anti-terrorist perimeter\" and bracing for possible disruption around the stadium.\n\nA French police source told AFP it was possible that \"people shout insults from the stands\" or that there is \"whistling and flags shown during the hymns, for example.\"\n\nIsrael's participation in Paris has been a key talking point in the run-up, with calls from the Palestinian Olympic Committee and some left-wing French MPs for the country to be excluded over the Gaza war.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron stressed the Israeli athletes were \"welcome in our country\", adding it was \"France's responsibility to provide them with security.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a packed Stade de France will cheer on Antoine Dupont -- arguably the world's best rugby player and a pin-up of the Paris Games -- as the Rugby Sevens tournament starts.\n\nThe electric Dupont is the biggest draw for the 555,000 fans expected over the six days of rugby action, but France will have their work cut out to stop double Olympic champions Fiji.\n\nFrance and Fiji are in the same pool and will play the United States and Uruguay, before the pair face each other in a mouthwatering clash on Thursday.\n\nOthers to watch in the wide-open competition are traditional rugby powers New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, and Ireland.\n\n- 'There's no one' -\n\nPreparations for Friday's historic opening ceremony were in full swing with an unprecedented security operation for the athlete's parade along the River Seine.\n\nAround 6,000-7,000 athletes are set to sail down a six-kilometre (four-mile) stretch of the river towards the Eiffel Tower, on 85 barges and boats.\n\nUp to 500,000 people are set to watch in person from specially built stands, on the river banks and from the overlooking balconies and apartments.\n\nThe area around the river has been locked down before the ceremony, with snipers positioned along the route and frogmen deployed to prevent a waterborne attack.\n\nThe entertainment line-up for the ceremony, the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium, is yet to be fully announced.\n\nBut videos posted online showing US pop star Lady Gaga in Paris sparked rumours she will be among the performers.\n\nAmerican rapper Snoop Dogg will carry the Olympic flame this Friday as it makes its final rounds before the ceremony.\n\nSome Paris business owners grumbled the security measures were hurting their bottom line.\n\n\"We were told there would be loads of people during the Olympics and even before. But in fact, no. There's no one,\" Jonas Seignovert, manager of the Eugene restaurant, told AFP.\n\nIn the first scandal of the Games, a video emerged showing the mistreatment of a horse that led to one of Britain's most decorated Olympians, dressage specialist Charlotte Dujardin, being ejected from the Paris Games.\n\nThe video showed three-time Olympic champion Dujardin walking alongside a horse and repeatedly whipping the animal while training a young rider.\n\nDujardin, 39, who has won six Olympic medals and was aiming to become Britain's most successful female Olympian by winning further medals in Paris, has admitted to an \"error of judgement\" and said she was \"deeply ashamed\" of her actions.\n\n- Financial guarantees' -\n\nWith one Games about to start, France is already looking to host another Olympics, as the International Olympic Committee awarded the 2030 Winter Games to the French Alps.\n\nThe IOC handed the games to France but under the condition that Paris stumps up the required financial commitments.\n\nFrance is the only candidate to host the 2030 Games but the funding has been in question because there is no government in place following inconclusive snap elections.\n\nMacron told IOC members he would ask France's next prime minister to give a financial \"guarantee\" for hosting the Games.\n\nburs-ric/gj", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com",

This will start the ceremony, not mark the end of it, another break from tradition.\n\nWhat time does the opening ceremony start?\n\nThe ceremony starts at 1:30 p.m. EDT/7:30 p.m. CEST and is expected to last more than three hours.\n\nWhere is the opening ceremony being held?\n\nThe parade starts at the Austerlitz Bridge beside the Jardin des Plantes and follows the course of the Seine from east to west. It makes its way around two islands in the center of the city before passing under several bridges and gateways. Athletes aboard the boats will get glimpses of several Olympic venues including La Concorde Urban Park (3X3 basketball, breaking, BMX freestyle cycling, skateboarding), Invalides (archery, athletics -- marathon finish, road cycling -- time trial start) and the Grand Palais (fencing, taekwondo). The parade ends at the Iena Bridge, which links the Eiffel Tower on the left bank of the Seine to the Trocad\u00e9ro district on the right bank. The ceremony's finale is at the Trocad\u00e9ro. There, among other ceremonial procedures, French President Emmanuel Macron will deliver opening remarks.\n\nHow can I watch the opening ceremony?\n\nThe ceremony will air on NBC and stream on Peacock and NBC Olympic platforms -- NBCOlympics.com, NBC.com, NBC app, NBC Olympics app.\n\nA preview will air on NBC at noon EDT, with live coverage beginning at 1:30 p.m. and an enhanced prime-time encore at 7:30 p.m.\n\nAbout 220,000 invited and security-screened spectators are expected to fill the upper tiers of the Seine's banks, and an additional 104,000 paying spectators will watch from the lower riverside and around the Trocad\u00e9ro plaza.\n\nThose in Paris who could not get tickets will be able to watch the ceremony on 80 giant screens set up throughout the city.\n\nWho is performing at the opening ceremony?\n\nIn addition to the athletes who will participate in the parade, 3,000 dancers, artists and other athletes will be featured in the opening and closing ceremonies. Most of the entertainment acts remain under wraps. NBC News reported that Celine Dion and Lady Gaga have arrived in Paris amid speculation that one or both of the pop singers will perform at the opening ceremony.", "source": {"uri": "kfdm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KFDM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kfdm.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jardin_des_plantes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jardin des plantes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Austerlitz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Austerlitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocad\u00e9ro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trocad\u00e9ro"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3x3_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "3x3 basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Palais", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Palais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cycle sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_BMX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle BMX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Invalides", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Les Invalides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concorde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taekwondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skateboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_bicycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Road bicycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Dion", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celine Dion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://kfdm.com/resources/media/d4895131-e46d-4f10-ad04-6130a47baf0e-large16x9_AP24137251839130.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

General view as the Olympic Rings and the Eiffel Tower are seen during training. (Reuters)\n\nParis has long been a city of dreamers: Just look at the Eiffel Tower, for decades the world's loftiest structure. Audacity also underpins the French capital's plans for its first Olympic Games in a century, which open Friday with an opening ceremony for the ages.\n\nThe most sprawling and elaborate Olympic opening ever -- a gala spectacular Friday evening on the River Seine that even French President Emmanuel Macron says initially felt like \"a crazy and not very serious idea\" -- kicks off 16 days of competition that promise to be ground-breaking, with nearly every corner of the city hosting some aspect of competition, The Associated Press said.\n\nAfter two toned-down, pandemic-hampered Olympics, expect a bold celebration. The heady marriage of sports and France's world-renowned capital of fashion, gastronomy and culture could also help secure the Olympics' longer-term future.\n\nOlympic organizers were struggling to find suitable host cities for their flagship Summer Games when they settled on Paris in 2017, enticed by its promise of innovations and the potential for the city of romance to rekindle love for the Olympics, especially with younger audiences that have so many other entertainment options.\n\nBut Paris' challenges are huge, too.\n\nPast and present sorrows hang over the Games. The city that has been repeatedly struck by deadly extremist attacks has to safeguard 10,500 athletes and millions of visitors. The international context of wars in Ukraine and Gaza add layers of complication for the gargantuan security effort. French elite special forces are part of the security detail for Israel's delegation.\n\nStill, if all goes well, Paris hopes to be remembered as a before-and-after Olympic watershed.\n\nThe first Games with nearly equal numbers of men and women, an advance that's been a long time coming since 22 women first got accepted as Olympians 124 years ago, also in Paris, will take another step toward aligning the Olympics with the post-#MeToo world.\n\nParis also hopes to reassure climate-conscious Generations Z and beyond by staging Games that are less polluting, more sustainable and more socially virtuous than their predecessors. Many of the sports venues are temporary, because Paris didn't want to repeat the mistake of previous Olympic host cities that built new arenas and then had no use for them.\n\nWith iconic Paris monuments as backdrops -- beach volleyball in the Eiffel Tower's shadow -- and breakdancing added to a growing list of Olympic sports that target young audiences, expect plenty of viral moments on Instagram, TikTok and elsewhere.\n\nCrowds will be back for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic forced Tokyo to push back its Games to 2021 and keep spectators away, and the Beijing Winter Games in 2022, when China was locked down.\n\nPrize-winning French theater director Thomas Jolly is turning central Paris into an open-air stage for the opening ceremony that will run through sunset and showcase France, its people and their history. The 330-meter-tall (1,083-foot-tall) Eiffel Tower will surely feature prominently.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people, including 320,000 paying and invited ticket-holders, are expected to line the Seine's banks as athletes are paraded along the river on boats.\n\nDuring the extravaganza, a no-fly zone extending for 150 kilometers (93 miles) around the capital will close Paris' skies, policed by fighter jets, airspace-monitoring AWACS surveillance flights, surveillance drones, helicopters that can carry sharpshooters and drone-disabling equipment.\n\nHelping Parisians move past the attacks of 2015 Showcasing and celebrating Paris could be joyously cathartic for the city that was plunged into mourning by extremist attacks in 2015.\n\nGuesses about the identity of the person or people who might get the honor of lighting the Olympic cauldron include soccer icon Zinedine Zidane and other French sporting heroes, but also survivors of ISIS group gunmen and suicide bombers who killed 130 people on Nov. 13, 2015.\n\nParis is also taking gambles in hopes of leaving an indelible impression on the Olympics' global audience of billions.\n\nThe decision not to stage the opening ceremony in the traditional setting of France's biggest stadium -- the Stade de France that was among the 2015 attackers' targets and is now the venue for Olympic track and field and rugby sevens -- and to host skateboarding, archery and other sports in temporary arenas in the heart of Paris have made safeguarding the Games more complex.\n\nRights campaigners and Games critics worry about the broad scope and scale of Olympic security, including the use of AI-equipped surveillance technology.\n\nParis' reach stretches to the Pacific The furthest venue is on the other side of the world in the French Pacific territory of Tahiti, where Olympic surfers will compete on famously giant waves that first form in storm belts off Antarctica.\n\nUp to 45,000 police and gendarmes, plus 10,000 soldiers, are safeguarding Paris and its suburbs that together are hosting most of the 32 sports that will crown Olympic champions in 329 medal events. The gold, silver and bronze medals they'll hand out are inlaid with a hexagonal, polished chunk of iron taken from the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe Seine's banks and riverside roads and more than a dozen of its bridges were fenced off nine days ahead of the opening ceremony, creating a no-go zone for people who haven't applied in advance for passes and making it tough for Parisians and visitors to get around and see the sights in the city of 2 million. Owners of restaurants and other businesses inside the security fence are howling about fewer customers.\n\nLeaving an Olympic legacy for Paris Limiting new construction has saved money and, Paris organizers say, contributed to their goal of halving the Games' overall carbon footprint compared with London in 2012 and Rio in 2016. Among the new venues, an Olympic aquatics center in Seine Saint-Denis is expected to help that underprivileged suburb of northern Paris teach more children to swim.\n\nFrench organizers argue that the Games will leave positive impacts on Paris long after the Olympians and Paralympic athletes who follow from Aug. 28 to Sept. 8 have departed.\n\nA costly and complex cleanup of the long-polluted Seine, sped up by the deadline of the Games, is expected to reopen the river to public swimming next year, after Olympic marathon swimmers and triathletes have competed in it. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip this month to demonstrate that its waters are safe.\n\nWith estimated overall costs of around 9 billion euros ($9.7 billion), more than half from sponsors, ticket sales and other non-public funding, Paris' expenses so far are less than for Tokyo, Rio and London.\n\nOnce opening ceremony fireworks have become memories, the City of Light will then become the playground of Olympians.\n\nAmerican gymnastics superstar Simon Biles is back. French-born basketball phenom Victor Wembanyama will carry home hopes on his 7-foot-4 (2.24-meter) frame. Ukrainian and Palestinian athletes have points they want to prove about conflict, resilience and sacrifice that go beyond the realms of sport.\n\nThe lucky few will win medals. Many will wish they had gone higher, faster and stronger.\n\nBut, together, they'll always have Paris.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat

the Paris Olympics endured a chaotic start on Wednesday as men's football kicked off while a huge police operation was put in place for Israel's first appearance at the Games.\n\nTwo days before the opening ceremony, Morocco beat Argentina 2-1 in Saint-Etienne, but only after a late equaliser for the South American side was disallowed and the final minutes were played out in an empty stadium following crowd trouble.\n\nArgentina thought they had escaped with a 2-2 draw when Cristian Medina scored in the 16th minute of added time.\n\nBut as their players celebrated, projectiles including bottles and plastic cups rained down from the stands and several spectators entered the pitch, with the referee promptly blowing the whistle.\n\nThe teams left the playing area, but the referee had not blown for full-time and the outcome of the match was unclear until the sides finally reappeared two hours later to play out three more minutes in a stadium that was by now emptied of spectators.\n\nMedina's goal was eventually disallowed for offside following a review and Morocco celebrated a 2-1 win.\n\n\"It is a disgrace that this should happen and poison the tournament,\" said Argentina coach Javier Mascherano.\n\nIsrael's footballers later Wednesday took on Mali under the watchful eye of 1,000 police officers, with authorities erecting an \"anti-terrorist perimeter\" and braced for possible disruption around the stadium.\n\nIsrael's participation in Paris has been a key talking point in the run-up, with calls from the Palestine Olympic Committee and some left-wing French MPs for the country to be excluded over the Gaza war.\n\nSome Palestinian and Israeli flags were flown with angry words exchanged amongst some fans at the Parc des Princes in Paris.\n\nHowever, French interior minister Gerald Darmanin said \"there has been no security problems to our knowledge\".\n\nA packed Stade de France cheered on Antoine Dupont -- arguably the world's best rugby player and a pin-up of the Paris Games -- as he helped his team into the quarter-finals.\n\nA 12-12 draw with the United States was followed by a nervy 19-12 win over Uruguay.\n\nIn the same pool, double champions Fiji also made the knockout round with back-to-back wins over Uruguay and the United States.\n\nIOC warns Salt Lake\n\nAs the clock ticks down towards Friday's opening ceremony along the Seine, Olympic chiefs awarded the 2030 Winter Games to the French Alps and the 2034 event to Salt Lake City.\n\nBut in a dramatic twist they warned the US city could be stripped of the Games if American authorities kept up their feud with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\n\nJohn Coates, the chairman of the IOC's legal commission, said the host city contract confirming Salt Lake's right to stage the Olympics had been altered to allow the IOC to strip it of the Games if US authorities did not respect the \"supreme authority\" of WADA.\n\nThe US anti-doping agency (USADA) has been a vocal critic of WADA for much of the past decade and tensions escalated this year after reports in April revealed that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a banned substance ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, but were subsequently cleared to compete at the Games.\n\nUSADA chief Travis Tygart accused Olympic bosses of \"stooping to threats\".\n\n\"Today's demonstration further showed that as it stands today, WADA is just a sport lapdog, and clean athletes have little chance,\" said Tygart.\n\nSecurity lockdown\n\nThe Olympics lost a top star when tennis world number one Jannik Sinner withdrew with tonsillitis, with the Italian admitting he was \"sad and disappointed\".\n\nPreparations for Friday's historic opening ceremony were in full swing with an unprecedented security operation for the athletes' parade along the River Seine.\n\nAround 6,000-7,000 athletes are set to sail down a six-kilometre (four-mile) stretch of the river towards the Eiffel Tower, on 85 barges and boats.\n\nUp to 500,000 people are set to watch in person from specially built stands, on the river banks and from the overlooking balconies and apartments.\n\nThe area around the river has been locked down before the ceremony, with snipers positioned along the route and frogmen deployed to prevent a waterborne attack.\n\nThe entertainment line-up for the ceremony, the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium, is yet to be fully announced.\n\nBut videos posted online showing US pop star Lady Gaga in Paris sparked rumours she will be among the performers.\n\nAmerican rapper Snoop Dogg will carry the Olympic flame this Friday as it makes its final rounds before the ceremony.\n\nScandals\n\nIn the first scandal of the Games, a video emerged showing the mistreatment of a horse by one of Britain's most decorated Olympians, dressage specialist Charlotte Dujardin, who has been suspended.\n\nThe film showed the three-time Olympic champion walking alongside a horse and repeatedly whipping the animal while apparently training a young rider.\n\nDujardin, 39, has won six Olympic medals and was aiming to become Britain's most successful female Olympian by winning further medals in Paris.\n\nIn a further controversy, an assistant coach and an analyst with the Canadian women's football team were sent home after rivals were spied upon.\n\nThe analyst, 43-year-old Joey Lombardi, was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session.\n\nLombardi pleaded guilty when he appeared in court in Saint-Etienne on Wednesday, the court told AFP.\n\nThe assistant coach was Jasmine Mander, to whom Lombardi reported.", "source": {"uri": "namibian.com.na", "dataType": "news",

France won the title in 1984 in Los Angeles.\n\nBefore that, Israel's opening Olympic soccer match against Mali is set to be a first security test for the Games. France will deploy thousands of police officers to secure it amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nRugby Sevens is also on the menu on Wednesday, with French global star Antoine Dupont elevating the host country's hopes of a gold medal after their heartbreaking failure at the XVs World Cup last year. France play the U.S. at 4.30pm and then Uruguay at 8pm.\n\nHandball and archery will make their own debut at the Paris Games on Thursday, and shooting on Friday, before floating parades of athletes and artists on the river Seine take part in the Games' first ever opening ceremony outside a stadium.\n\nOrganisers said the ceremony, protected by 45,000 police and thousands more military, would be a daring, joyful show.\n\nVIDEO SCANDAL\n\nDozens of boats will carry athletes and performers on a 6km route along the Seine. More than 300,000 spectators will be watching from the riverbanks, with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on TV or on social media.\n\nDetails including some of the artists taking part, who will last carry the torch and light the Olympic cauldron to mark the start of the Games, have been kept secret, and the ceremony's artistic team said they had been rehearsing in private to keep it all under wraps.\n\nBut what is known is that there will be a floating parade, departing from Austerlitz bridge, sailing by Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral and arriving near the Eiffel Tower, with the show also using nearby monuments and mixing music, light and dance.\n\nSightings in Paris of Canadian singer Celine Dion, who last year cancelled the European stretch of a world tour over a rare medical condition, have kicked off rumours that she could be taking part in the opening ceremony.\n\nFrench Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera said Dion's presence in Paris was not a coincidence. In an interview with TF1 TV she declined to say if Dion - best known for the \"Titanic\" movie theme song \"My Heart Will Go On\" - would sing, adding that there were \"many possible roles\" one could play in an opening ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, the start of the Games was marred by a scandal over video footage that led to Britain's joint-most decorated female Olympian Charlotte Dujardin pulling out of the Paris Games.\n\nThe video shows Dujardin whipping a horse's legs multiple times.\n\nFrench police have arrested a Russian man suspected of planning to destabilise the Olympics, the Paris prosecutor's office said on Wednesday, which could take the form of disinformation or other types of attack.\n\nFive Australian women's water polo players have tested positive for COVID-19, the country's Olympic team chief Anna Meares said on Wednesday. Meares added that the cases were confined to the water polo team.\n\nFrance is set to host the Winter Games six years after the Summer Olympics, after it was conditionally picked as host for the 2030 event on Wednesday. Salt Lake City was awarded the 2034 Winter Olympics.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe greatest show on earth is back as we get ready to kick off the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\n\nThese Games have come around quicker than most, with the last edition in Tokyo being postponed by a year due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut three years later, it's time for another fortnight of pulsating action with some of the biggest names in sport set to make headlines over the coming days and weeks.\n\nBefore all that, however, there is the small matter of the Opening Ceremony. We have been treated to some spellbinding ceremonies in recent years, from the magic of London and stunning imagery of Beijing to the colour, noise and party atmosphere of Rio.\n\nThis year's ceremony in the French capital plans to be just as special, with a very unique concept and some huge mystery guests teased in the build-up. But where and when is it all happening and who can we expect to be there?\n\nHere's everything you need to know:\n\nWhen is the Paris 2024 Olympics opening ceremony?\n\nThe ceremony will take place on Friday, July 26 and start at 7.30pm in Paris (6.30pm UK time)\n\nIt is expected to last around three and a half hours in total.\n\nWhere is the opening ceremony being held?\n\nThe Paris Olympics will make history, with the opening ceremony set to be the first one ever to be held outside of a stadium.\n\nInstead, the French capital will be transformed into a stadium in itself, with the traditional parade of athletes taking place in boats along the Seine and passing iconic Parisian landmarks.\n\nIt will be held over a six-kilometre stretch of the river, with a parade of boats carrying each of the 91 national delegations and over 10,500 athletes.\n\nThe route begins near Austerlitz Bridge by the Jardin des Plantes and will circle around \u00cele Saint Louis and \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 before going past many of the Games venues and concluding in front of the Trocad\u00e9ro. It is there that the athletes will be treated to a stunning show and, of course, the lighting of the Olympic torch.\n\nAround 300,000 people are expected to attend the ceremony along the river.\n\nHow can I watch the opening ceremony?\n\nEurosport is the main European rights holder for broadcasting the Olympics this year - however the BBC will be broadcasting all the big moments across the fortnight of sport, including the opening ceremony.\n\nYou can watch the opening ceremony on BBC One on Friday night, with coverage starting at 5.45pm.\n\nWho is performing at the opening ceremony?\n\nExact arrangements for performances at the opening ceremony have been kept under wraps by officials but a host of stars have been linked with appearing in the build-up.\n\nLady Gaga has been strongly tipped to perform at the ceremony, having been spotted in the French capital earlier this week. Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of the opening and closing ceremonies also reportedly, began following Gaga on Instagram a few weeks ago, fuelling speculation further.\n\nAlso rumoured to be performing is Celine Dion. The My Heart Will Go On singer was diagnosed with the rare and incurable stiff-person syndrome in 2022 with the neurological condition causing involuntary muscle spasms and affecting her ability to sing.\n\nBut she has vowed to get back on stage once more and, after being seen arriving in Paris on Tuesday, is set to do so at the opening ceremony.\n\nA source told The Sun: \"Celine has made no secret of her desire to make it back to the stage, and Paris would be the perfect opportunity for her to do that. Unlike other offers which are full shows, making an appearance at the opening ceremony would see Celine performing just one song.\n\n\"The formal offer to perform was made earlier this year, and Celine is working around the clock to make it happen. She's made huge leaps and is getting stronger every day, but she's not out of the woods yet. Everyone has their \u00adfingers crossed it is able to happen. It will be quite the moment.\"\n\nOther huge artists to be rumoured to perform include Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter and Rihanna, while rapper Snoop Dogg is set to play a role in the ceremony as a torch bearer.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_jones@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "John Jones", "type": "author",

For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nPARIS -- Welcome to the Paris Summer Olympics.\n\nAfter COVID-19 pandemic restrictions kept spectators away for the last two Olympic Games (in Beijing and Tokyo), the French capital has prepared to welcome back crowds with a splash: the public will be treated to a unique opening ceremony on the iconic River Seine.\n\nThe outdoor ceremony -- set to be the largest one yet, measured by audience and geographical sprawl -- kicks off 16 days of sporting events held across the city and beyond.\n\nOutside of Paris, the historic Palace of Versailles will host equestrian events, while surfing will take place some 10,000 miles away in Teahupo'o, Tahiti.\n\nContinuing its streak of domination at the Summer Games, the United States is expected to collect the most medals in Paris, followed by China, Great Britain, France and then Australia. Russia, meanwhile -- typically a top contender -- is sending a very small number of athletes to Paris following consequences related to their country's doping and its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHere's what else to know ahead of the Games before the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\n1. An opening ceremony like no other\n\nClose to 100 boats carrying more than 10,000 athletes and performers will glide down a 3.7-mile stretch of the River Seine during the opening ceremony on July 26. It's the first time in the history of the modern Olympics that's being held outside of a stadium, officials say.\n\nThe open-air event is expected to draw some 300,000 spectators -- most of whom will pay no admission fee to watch the parade from the river's upper embankments.\n\nThe parade will travel east to west, starting at Austerlitz Bridge, and then pass by major landmarks and event venues like the Grand Palais. The parade is set to end at the Pont d'I\u00e9na bridge before a finale show at the Trocad\u00e9ro opposite the Eiffel Tower.\n\nTony Estanguet, president of the Paris Games organizing committee, described the vision for the ceremony when the plan was announced in 2021.\n\n\"The entire city has been turned into a vast Olympic stadium. The Seine represents the track, and the quays the spectators' stands,\" Estanguet said.\n\nThe parade's route also offers a sightseeing tour of some of the temporary sports venues, including an outdoor arena abutting the Eiffel Tower where beach volleyball games will take place.\n\n2. A swimmable Seine?\n\nThere's also the matter of the Seine as a competition venue. In the run-up to the games, a question has plagued officials: Will the Seine be swimmable in time for the Olympics? The sewage-polluted waters have been a hurdle to the city's ambitious goal to hold the swim leg of the triathlon in the famous river where swimming has been historically banned.\n\nRecent testing of the water has turned up unsafe levels of E. coli bacteria caused by fecal matter, but tests earlier this month showed acceptable bacteria levels. In an effort to silence skeptics, last week Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo followed through on her promise to take a dip in the Seine and declared the waters perfectly safe.\n\n3. Breaking will make its Olympics debut\n\nFollowing the previous Summer Games' addition of skateboarding and surfing, another sport with counterculture roots will take the Olympics stage for the first time in Paris. Breaking -- best known to the uninitiated as \"break-dancing\" -- is a dance style said to have originated in the 1970s from the streets of New York City's South Bronx and inspired by the break beats and hip-hop tracks played by DJs and MCs. But the athleticism involved in the art form -- head-spins, backflips and other acrobatics -- is undeniable.\n\nBreaking became more mainstream in the 1990s as it entered pop culture and expanded in popularity through international competition. And in 2016, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) added breaking to the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires.\n\nAlthough it's an American export, other countries including Japan, Canada and The Netherlands boast talent that's been known to surpass the U.S. competitively.\n\nIn Paris, 16 b-boys (male breakers) and 16 b-girls will go head to head in separate battles at Place de la Concorde, an outdoor public square. The women's competition is set for Aug. 9 and men's is on Aug. 10. On Team USA, look out for medal contenders Victor Montalvo and Grace \"Sunny\" Choi.\n\n4. Simone Biles leads American gymnasts' shot at redemption\n\nThe same U.S. women's gymnastics team that took home a silver medal at the Tokyo Games all-around final in 2021 is hoping to rewrite their Olympic ending in Paris.\n\nThree years ago, Biles, who at 27 is the most decorated gymnast of all time, came down with a case of the \"twisties,\" a debilitating psychological affliction that forced her to pull out of several events to focus on her mental health. In her place, Suni Lee had emerged as the unlikely champion, and went on to earn a gold medal in the individual all-around competition in Tokyo.\n\nJoining Biles and Lee are Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey, and 16-year-old newcomer Hezly Rivera.\n\nNow, with Biles in top form and the team united in its goal of \"redemption,\" the women's squad is the favorite to win gold. And especially so, given that Russia, the defending gold medalist, won't be there. The IOC plans to allow only some Russian athletes to compete as \"individual neutral athletes\" under strict conditions it set in response to Russia's war in Ukraine. The country's absence also improves the men's chances of medaling in a sport normally dominated by Russia, China and Japan.\n\n5. Ledecky and Dressel headline U.S. swim team\n\nEntering her fourth Olympics, Katie Ledecky continues to dominate the 800- and 1,500-meter freestyle events, in both of which she still holds the world records. Seven of her Olympic medals are gold, putting her just two wins away from earning the most Olympic gold medals of any female athlete in history. Younger swimmers have Ledecky beat in the 400-meter freestyle: Australia's Ariarne Titmus (who took gold in Tokyo and also reigns in the 200-meter event) and Canada's Summer McIntosh have each knocked down Ledecky's world record, which Titmus currently holds. The Titmus-McIntosh-Ledecky 400-meter race should make for a thrilling watch.\n\nIn men's swimming, the U.S. is looking for a superstar and hoping that Caeleb Dressel is it. The 27-year-old won five gold medals in Tokyo -- joining an elite few of swimmers that have won that many in a single Games, including Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz. After taking an eight-month break from the sport, Dressel showed at the Olympic trials last month that he's still fast in sprints.\n\nHeading into Paris, however, the two fastest swimmers in the world are not from the usual rival powerhouses (Australia and the U.S.) but from Canada -- McIntosh on the women's -- and France -- L\u00e9on Marchand.\n\n6. A Chinese doping scandal casts a shadow over swimming\n\nA doping scandal sparked international outrage after it was revealed in April that 32 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug ahead of the Tokyo Games in 2021 but were cleared to compete. The drug in question -- called trimetazidine or TMZ -- is the same one found in a sample from Kamila Valieva, the Russian figure skater who was subsequently slapped with a four-year ban from international competition.\n\nChinese officials say an unintentional contamination led to the positive tests. The World Anti-Doping Agency accepted that explanation after its investigation and said that international doping rules don't require them to ban the athletes.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into the case involving the swimmers. Meanwhile, China is expected to send 11 of the 32 swimmers who had the performance drug in their system in 2021 to compete in Paris.\n\nThe agency's handling of the positive tests has sowed doubt deeper among critics who question whether the regulatory body responsible for curbing cheating holds some countries to a lower standard than others.\n\n7. The rivalry between American and Jamaican sprinters\n\nThe 100-meter sprint, the most popular track event, has shaped up to be a familiar two-nation race. Representing Jamaica in the women's race is Shericka Jackson, whose biggest challenge is American Sha'Carri Richardson. But don't overlook Jamaican sprint queen Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who will race in her fifth and final Olympics 16 years after becoming the first Caribbean woman to win the 100-meter gold. They are chasing Florence Griffith Joyner's record set in 1988.\n\nIn the 200-meter, there's a real chance we could see the fall of Flo-Jo's world record set that same year when she ran 21.34 seconds. Jackson will go head-to-head with teammate Elaine Thompson-Herah and Gabby Thomas of Team USA.\n\nIn the men's 100-meter race, Noah Lyles on Team USA will face Jamaica's Oblique Seville and Kishane Thompson, each aiming to break the world record time set by eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt. Still, the field is brimming with talent that clouds podium predictions. Other top contenders include reigning Olympic champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and a former world champion American Fred Kerley.\n\nLyles also racing in the 200-meter -- his better event -- a race that won't be as wide open as the 100. He's the favorite, ahead of Tebogo, a notable exception to the rivalry who won the men's race last week at an international meet in Monaco.\n\n8. In soccer, U.S. women hope to get back to winning gold. The U.S. men play their first Olympics in ages\n\nSoccer starts before the Games officially kick off with the opening ceremony. The U.S. women's national team is aiming to upgrade their bronze medal from Tokyo. The four-time gold medalists haven't taken first on the podium since the 2012 Games in London. Since the retirement of major stars -- Megan Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd, Julie Ertz, Sam Mewis -- has made way for a younger team, which will be led by new head coach Emma Hayes, former manager of the women's Chelsea Football Club. World Cup champion Spain is the favorite to take gold.\n\nThe last time the U.S. sent a men's soccer team to the Olympics was in 2008, and they haven't medaled since 1904. Since the rule to restrict the competition to players under 23 went into effect in 1992, the men's team has advanced to the knockout stage only once.\n\nThe men kick off their tournament on Wednesday in a game against host country France, a favorite to win it all. The women's squad plays Zambia on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "michiganpublic.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Michigan Public"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

as Paris Olympics kicks off", "body": "Empty feeling: Morocco's players and staff celebrate at the end of the match with Argentina\n\nThe sporting programme at the Paris Olympics endured a chaotic start on Wednesday as men's football kicked off and a huge police operation was put in place for Israel's first appearance at the Games.\n\nTwo days before the opening ceremony, Morocco beat Argentina 2-1 in Saint-Etienne, but only after a late equaliser for the South American side was disallowed and the final minutes were played out in an empty stadium following crowd trouble.\n\nArgentina thought they had escaped with a 2-2 draw when Cristian Medina scored in the 16th minute of added time.\n\nBut as their players celebrated, projectiles including bottles and plastic cups rained down from the stands and several spectators entered the pitch, with the referee promptly blowing the whistle.\n\nThe teams left the playing area, but the referee had not blown for full-time and the outcome of the match was unclear until the sides finally reappeared two hours later to play out three more minutes in a stadium that was by now emptied of spectators.\n\nMedina's goal was eventually disallowed for offside following a review and Morocco celebrated a 2-1 win.\n\nIsrael's footballers later Wednesday take on Mali under the watchful eye of 1,000 police officers, with authorities erecting an \"anti-terrorist perimeter\" and bracing for possible disruption around the stadium.\n\nIsrael's participation in Paris has been a key talking point in the run-up, with calls from the Palestine Olympic Committee and some left-wing French MPs for the country to be excluded over the Gaza war.\n\nA packed Stade de France cheered on Antoine Dupont -- arguably the world's best rugby player and a pin-up of the Paris Games -- but he was unable to lead the hosts to victory in a 12-12 draw with the United States.\n\n\"It's always a lot of emotion when you play with all your supporters so it's important to deal with that and to be better even with the pressure,\" admitted the 27-year-old.\n\nAustralia laid down a marker to France and double champions Fiji with a 21-14 win over Samoa at a packed Stade de France.\n\n- IOC warns Salt Lake -\n\nAs the clock ticks down towards Friday's opening ceremony along the Seine, Olympic chiefs awarded the 2030 Winter Games to the French Alps and the 2034 event to Salt Lake City.\n\nBut in a dramatic twist they warned the US city could be stripped of the Games if American authorities kept up their feud with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\n\nJohn Coates, the chairman of the IOC's legal commission, said the host city contract confirming Salt Lake's right to stage the Olympics had been altered to allow the IOC to strip it of the Games if US authorities did not respect the \"supreme authority\" of WADA.\n\nThe US anti-doping agency (USADA) has been a vocal critic of WADA for much of the past decade and tensions escalated this year after reports in April revealed that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a banned substance ahead of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, but were subsequently cleared to compete at the Games.\n\nUSADA chief Travis Tygart accused Olympic bosses of \"stooping to threats\".\n\n\"Today's demonstration further showed that as it stands today, WADA is just a sport lapdog, and clean athletes have little chance,\" said Tygart.\n\n- Security lockdown -\n\nThe Olympics lost a top star when tennis world number one Jannik Sinner withdrew with tonsillitis with the Italian admitting he was \"sad and disappointed\".\n\nPreparations for Friday's historic opening ceremony were in full swing with an unprecedented security operation for the athletes' parade along the River Seine.\n\nAround 6,000-7,000 athletes are set to sail down a six-kilometre (four-mile) stretch of the river towards the Eiffel Tower, on 85 barges and boats.\n\nUp to 500,000 people are set to watch in person from specially built stands, on the river banks and from the overlooking balconies and apartments.\n\nThe area around the river has been locked down before the ceremony, with snipers positioned along the route and frogmen deployed to prevent a waterborne attack.\n\nThe entertainment line-up for the ceremony, the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium, is yet to be fully announced.\n\nBut videos posted online showing US pop star Lady Gaga in Paris sparked rumours she will be among the performers.\n\nAmerican rapper Snoop Dogg will carry the Olympic flame this Friday as it makes its final rounds before the ceremony.\n\n- Scandals -\n\nIn the first scandal of the Games, a video emerged showing the mistreatment of a horse by one of Britain's most decorated Olympians, dressage specialist Charlotte Dujardin, who has been suspended.\n\nThe film showed the three-time Olympic champion walking alongside a horse and repeatedly whipping the animal while apparently training a young rider.\n\nDujardin, 39, has won six Olympic medals and was aiming to become Britain's most successful female Olympian by winning further medals in Paris.\n\nIn a further scandal, an assistant coach and an analyst with the Canadian women's football team were sent home for their part in spying on rivals.\n\nThe analyst, 43-year-old Joey Lombardi, was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session.\n\nLombardi pleaded guilty when he appeared in court in Saint-Etienne on Wednesday, the court told AFP.\n\nThe assistant coach was Jasmine Mander, to whom Lombardi reported.\n\nric-jw/gj/dj/jc\n\nMore from this section\n\nExodus United Global Signs Multi-Year Agreement to Bring Indian Films and TV

Audacity also underpins the French capital's plans for its first Olympic Games in a century, which open Friday with an opening ceremony for the ages.\n\nThe most sprawling and elaborate Olympic opening ever -- a gala spectacular Friday evening on the River Seine that even French President Emmanuel Macron says initially felt like \"a crazy and not very serious idea\" -- kicks off 16 days of competition that promise to be ground-breaking, with nearly every corner of the city hosting some aspect of competition.\n\nAfter two toned-down, pandemic-hampered Olympics, expect a bold celebration. The heady marriage of sports and France's world-renowned capital of fashion, gastronomy and culture could also help secure the Olympics' longer-term future.\n\nOlympic organizers were struggling to find suitable host cities for their flagship Summer Games when they settled on Paris in 2017, enticed by its promise of innovations and the potential for the city of romance to rekindle love for the Olympics, especially with younger audiences that have so many other entertainment options.\n\nBut Paris' challenges are huge, too.\n\nPast and present sorrows hang over the Games\n\nThe city that has been repeatedly struck by deadly extremist attacks has to safeguard 10,500 athletes and millions of visitors. The international context of wars in Ukraine and Gaza add layers of complication for the gargantuan security effort. French elite special forces are part of the security detail for Israel's delegation.\n\nStill, if all goes well, Paris hopes to be remembered as a before-and-after Olympic watershed.\n\nThe first Games with nearly equal numbers of men and women, an advance that's been a long time coming since 22 women first got accepted as Olympians 124 years ago, also in Paris, will take another step toward aligning the Olympics with the post-#MeToo world.\n\nParis also hopes to reassure climate-conscious Generations Z and beyond by staging Games that are less polluting, more sustainable and more socially virtuous than their predecessors. Many of the sports venues are temporary, because Paris didn't want to repeat the mistake of previous Olympic host cities that built new arenas and then had no use for them.\n\nWith iconic Paris monuments as backdrops -- beach volleyball in the Eiffel Tower's shadow -- and breakdancing added to a growing list of Olympic sports that target young audiences, expect plenty of viral moments on Instagram, TikTok and elsewhere.\n\nCrowds will be back for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic forced Tokyo to push back its Games to 2021 and keep spectators away, and the Beijing Winter Games in 2022, when China was locked down.\n\nPrize-winning French theater director Thomas Jolly is turning central Paris into an open-air stage for the opening ceremony that will run through sunset and showcase France, its people and their history. The 330-meter-tall (1,083-foot-tall) Eiffel Tower will surely feature prominently.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people, including 320,000 paying and invited ticket-holders, are expected to line the Seine's banks as athletes are paraded along the river on boats.\n\nDuring the extravaganza, a no-fly zone extending for 150 kilometers (93 miles) around the capital will close Paris' skies, policed by fighter jets, airspace-monitoring AWACS surveillance flights, surveillance drones, helicopters that can carry sharpshooters and drone-disabling equipment.\n\nHelping Parisians move past the attacks of 2015\n\nShowcasing and celebrating Paris could be joyously cathartic for the city that was plunged into mourning by extremist attacks in 2015.\n\nGuesses about the identity of the person or people who might get the honor of lighting the Olympic cauldron include soccer icon Zinedine Zidane and other French sporting heroes, but also survivors of Islamic State-group gunmen and suicide bombers who killed 130 people on Nov. 13, 2015.\n\nParis is also taking gambles in hopes of leaving an indelible impression on the Olympics' global audience of billions.\n\nThe decision not to stage the opening ceremony in the traditional setting of France's biggest stadium -- the Stade de France that was among the 2015 attackers' targets and is now the venue for Olympic track and field and rugby sevens -- and to host skateboarding, archery and other sports in temporary arenas in the heart of Paris have made safeguarding the Games more complex.\n\nRights campaigners and Games critics worry about the broad scope and scale of Olympic security, including the use of AI-equipped surveillance technology.\n\nParis' reach stretches to the Pacific\n\nThe furthest venue is on the other side of the world in the French Pacific territory of Tahiti, where Olympic surfers will compete on famously giant waves that first form in storm belts off Antarctica.\n\nUp to 45,000 police and gendarmes, plus 10,000 soldiers, are safeguarding Paris and its suburbs that together are hosting most of the 32 sports that will crown Olympic champions in 329 medal events. The gold, silver and bronze medals they'll hand out are inlaid with a hexagonal, polished chunk of iron taken from the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe Seine's banks and riverside roads and more than a dozen of its bridges were fenced off nine days ahead of the opening ceremony, creating a no-go zone for people who haven't applied in advance for passes and making it tough for Parisians and visitors to get around and see the sights in the city of 2 million. Owners of restaurants and other businesses inside the security fence are howling about fewer customers.\n\nLeaving an Olympic legacy for Paris\n\nLimiting new construction has saved money and, Paris organizers say, contributed to their goal of halving the Games' overall carbon footprint compared with London in 2012 and Rio in 2016. Among the new venues, an Olympic aquatics center in Seine Saint-Denis is expected to help that underprivileged suburb of northern Paris teach more children to swim.\n\nFrench organizers argue that the Games will leave positive impacts on Paris long after the Olympians and Paralympic athletes who follow from Aug. 28 to Sept. 8 have departed.\n\nA costly and complex cleanup of the long-polluted Seine, sped up by the deadline of the Games, is expected to reopen the river to public swimming next year, after Olympic marathon swimmers and triathletes have competed in it. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip this month to demonstrate that its waters are safe.\n\nWith estimated overall costs of around 9 billion euros ($9.7 billion), more than half from sponsors, ticket sales and other non-public funding, Paris' expenses so far are less than for Tokyo, Rio and London.\n\nOnce opening ceremony fireworks have become memories, the City of Light will then become the playground of Olympians.\n\nAmerican gymnastics superstar Simon Biles is back. French-born basketball phenom Victor Wembanyama will carry home hopes on his 7-foot-4 (2.24-meter) frame. Ukrainian and Palestinian athletes have points they want to prove about conflict, resilience and sacrifice that go beyond the realms of sport.\n\nThe lucky few will win medals. Many will wish they had gone higher, faster and stronger.\n\nBut, together, they'll always have Paris.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri":

For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nAfter COVID-19 pandemic restrictions kept spectators away for the last two Olympic Games (in Beijing and Tokyo), the French capital has prepared to welcome back crowds with a splash: the public will be treated to a unique opening ceremony on the iconic River Seine.\n\nThe outdoor ceremony -- set to be the largest one yet, measured by audience and geographical sprawl -- kicks off 16 days of sporting events held across the city and beyond.\n\nOutside of Paris, the historic Palace of Versailles will host equestrian events, while surfing will take place some 10,000 miles away in Teahupo'o, Tahiti.\n\nContinuing its streak of domination at the Summer Games, the United States is expected to collect the most medals in Paris, followed by China, Great Britain, France and then Australia. Russia, meanwhile -- typically a top contender -- is sending a very small number of athletes to Paris following consequences related to their country's doping and its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHere's what else to know ahead of the Games before the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nClose to 100 boats carrying more than 10,000 athletes and performers will glide down a 3.7-mile stretch of the River Seine during the opening ceremony on July 26. It's the first time in the history of the modern Olympics that's being held outside of a stadium, officials say.\n\nThe open-air event is expected to draw some 300,000 spectators -- most of whom will pay no admission fee to watch the parade from the river's upper embankments.\n\nThe parade will travel east to west, starting at Austerlitz Bridge, and then pass by major landmarks and event venues like the Grand Palais. The parade is set to end at the Pont d'I\u00e9na bridge before a finale show at the Trocad\u00e9ro opposite the Eiffel Tower.\n\nTony Estanguet, president of the Paris Games organizing committee, described the vision for the ceremony when the plan was announced in 2021.\n\n\"The entire city has been turned into a vast Olympic stadium. The Seine represents the track, and the quays the spectators' stands,\" Estanguet said.\n\nThe parade's route also offers a sightseeing tour of some of the temporary sports venues, including an outdoor arena abutting the Eiffel Tower where beach volleyball games will take place.\n\nThere's also the matter of the Seine as a competition venue. In the run-up to the games, a question has plagued officials: Will the Seine be swimmable in time for the Olympics? The sewage-polluted waters have been a hurdle to the city's ambitious goal to hold the swim leg of the triathlon in the famous river where swimming has been historically banned.\n\nRecent testing of the water has turned up unsafe levels of E. coli bacteria caused by fecal matter, but tests earlier this month showed acceptable bacteria levels. In an effort to silence skeptics, last week Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo followed through on her promise to take a dip in the Seine and declared the waters perfectly safe.\n\nFollowing the previous Summer Games' addition of skateboarding and surfing, another sport with counterculture roots will take the Olympics stage for the first time in Paris. Breaking -- best known to the uninitiated as \"break-dancing\" -- is a dance style said to have originated in the 1970s from the streets of New York City's South Bronx and inspired by the break beats and hip-hop tracks played by DJs and MCs. But the athleticism involved in the art form -- head-spins, backflips and other acrobatics -- is undeniable.\n\nBreaking became more mainstream in the 1990s as it entered pop culture and expanded in popularity through international competition. And in 2016, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) added breaking to the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires.\n\nAlthough it's an American export, other countries including Japan, Canada and The Netherlands boast talent that's been known to surpass the U.S. competitively.\n\nIn Paris, 16 b-boys (male breakers) and 16 b-girls will go head to head in separate battles at Place de la Concorde, an outdoor public square. The women's competition is set for Aug. 9 and men's is on Aug. 10. On Team USA, look out for medal contenders Victor Montalvo and Grace \"Sunny\" Choi.\n\nThe same U.S. women's gymnastics team that took home a silver medal at the Tokyo Games all-around final in 2021 is hoping to rewrite their Olympic ending in Paris.\n\nThree years ago, Biles, who at 27 is the most decorated gymnast of all time, came down with a case of the \"twisties,\" a debilitating psychological affliction that forced her to pull out of several events to focus on her mental health. In her place, Suni Lee had emerged as the unlikely champion, and went on to earn a gold medal in the individual all-around competition in Tokyo.\n\nJoining Biles and Lee are Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey, and 16-year-old newcomer Hezly Rivera.\n\nNow, with Biles in top form and the team united in its goal of \"redemption,\" the women's squad is the favorite to win gold. And especially so, given that Russia, the defending gold medalist, won't be there. The IOC plans to allow only some Russian athletes to compete as \"individual neutral athletes\" under strict conditions it set in response to Russia's war in Ukraine. The country's absence also improves the men's chances of medaling in a sport normally dominated by Russia, China and Japan.\n\nEntering her fourth Olympics, Katie Ledecky continues to dominate the 800- and 1,500-meter freestyle events, in both of which she still holds the world records. Seven of her Olympic medals are gold, putting her just two wins away from earning the most Olympic gold medals of any female athlete in history. Younger swimmers have Ledecky beat in the 400-meter freestyle: Australia's Ariarne Titmus (who took gold in Tokyo and also reigns in the 200-meter event) and Canada's Summer McIntosh have each knocked down Ledecky's world record, which Titmus currently holds. The Titmus-McIntosh-Ledecky 400-meter race should make for a thrilling watch.\n\nIn men's swimming, the U.S. is looking for a superstar and hoping that Caeleb Dressel is it. The 27-year-old won five gold medals in Tokyo -- joining an elite few of swimmers that have won that many in a single Games, including Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz. After taking an eight-month break from the sport, Dressel showed at the Olympic trials last month that he's still fast in sprints.\n\nHeading into Paris, however, the two fastest swimmers in the world are not from the usual rival powerhouses (Australia and the U.S.) but from Canada -- McIntosh on the women's -- and France -- L\u00e9on Marchand.\n\nA doping scandal sparked international outrage after it was revealed in April that 32 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug ahead of the Tokyo Games in 2021 but were cleared to compete. The drug in question -- called trimetazidine or TMZ -- is the same one found in a sample from Kamila Valieva, the Russian figure skater who was subsequently slapped with a four-year ban from international competition.\n\nChinese officials say an unintentional contamination led to the positive tests. The World Anti-Doping Agency accepted that explanation after its investigation and said that international doping rules don't require them to ban the athletes.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into the case involving the swimmers. Meanwhile, China is expected to send 11 of the 32 swimmers who had the performance drug in their system in 2021 to compete in Paris.\n\nThe agency's handling of the positive tests has sowed doubt deeper among critics who question whether the regulatory body responsible for curbing cheating holds some countries to a lower standard than others.\n\nThe 100-meter sprint, the most popular track event, has shaped up to be a familiar two-nation race. Representing Jamaica in the women's race is Shericka Jackson, whose biggest challenge is American Sha'Carri Richardson. But don't overlook Jamaican sprint queen Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who will race in her fifth and final Olympics 16 years after becoming the first Caribbean woman to win the 100-meter gold. They are chasing Florence Griffith Joyner's record set in 1988.\n\nIn the 200-meter, there's a real chance we could see the fall of Flo-Jo's world record set that same year when she ran 21.34 seconds. Jackson will go head-to-head with teammate Elaine Thompson-Herah and Gabby Thomas of Team USA.\n\nIn the men's 100-meter race, Noah Lyles on Team USA will face Jamaica's Oblique Seville and Kishane Thompson, each aiming to break the world record time set by eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt. Still, the field is brimming with talent that clouds podium predictions. Other top contenders include reigning Olympic champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and a former world champion American Fred Kerley.\n\nLyles also racing in the 200-meter -- his better event -- a race that won't be as wide open as the 100. He's the favorite, ahead of Tebogo, a notable exception to the rivalry who won the men's race last week at an international meet in Monaco.\n\nSoccer starts before the Games officially kick off with the opening ceremony. The U.S. women's national team is aiming to upgrade their bronze medal from Tokyo. The four-time gold medalists haven't taken first on the podium since the 2012 Games in London. Since the retirement of major stars -- Megan Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd, Julie Ertz, Sam Mewis -- has made way for a younger team, which will be led by new head coach Emma Hayes, former manager of the women's Chelsea Football Club. World Cup champion Spain is the favorite to take gold.\n\nThe last time the U.S. sent a men's soccer team to the Olympics was in 2008, and they haven't medaled since 1904. Since the rule to restrict the competition to players under 23 went into effect in 1992, the men's team has advanced to the knockout stage only once.\n\nThe men kick off their tournament on Wednesday in a game against host country France, a favorite to win it all. The women's squad plays Zambia on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAE 90.7 - Charlotte's NPR News Source"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Instead, it will be held along the famous Seine River as the stakeholders aim to integrate the event into the city's life. Each national delegation will travel in a boat during the ceremony as the parade will cover a staggering 6 km route, meandering into the capital city of Paris from East to West and finally finishing in Trocad\u00e9ro.\n\nThe journey via the boat will witness some of Paris' most notable landmarks. To facilitate it to watch for the larger audience, 80 giant screens will be available along with speakers. The likes of Lady Gaga and Celine Dion are expected to perform in the ceremony. Rap legend Snoop Dog and Mexican actress Salma Hayek are expected to be the torch bearers.\n\nThe opening ceremony is likely to go beyond 3 hours.\n\nWhen does the opening ceremony start in India?\n\nThe opening ceremony will get underway on July 26th, Friday, 11:00 pm.\n\nWhere to watch the Paris 2024 Olympics opening ceremony?\n\nFans can watch the live telecast of the opening ceremony Sports18 1 SD and Sports18 1 HD as far as television channels go.

programme at the Paris Olympics endured a chaotic start on Wednesday as men's football kicked off and a huge police operation was put in place for Israel's first appearance at the Games.\n\nTwo days before the opening ceremony, Morocco beat Argentina 2-1 in Saint-Etienne, but only after a late equaliser for the South American side was disallowed and the final minutes were played out in an empty stadium following crowd trouble.\n\nArgentina thought they had escaped with a 2-2 draw when Cristian Medina scored in the 16th minute of added time.\n\nBut as their players celebrated, projectiles including bottles and plastic cups rained down from the stands and several spectators entered the pitch, with the referee promptly blowing the whistle.\n\nThe teams left the playing area, but the referee had not blown for full-time and the outcome of the match was unclear until the sides finally reappeared two hours later to play out three more minutes in a stadium that was by now emptied of spectators.\n\nMedina's goal was eventually disallowed for offside following a review and Morocco celebrated a 2-1 win.\n\nIsrael's footballers later Wednesday take on Mali under the watchful eye of 1,000 police officers, with authorities erecting an \"anti-terrorist perimeter\" and bracing for possible disruption around the stadium.\n\nIsrael's participation in Paris has been a key talking point in the run-up, with calls from the Palestine Olympic Committee and some left-wing French MPs for the country to be excluded over the Gaza war.\n\nA packed Stade de France cheered on Antoine Dupont -- arguably the world's best rugby player and a pin-up of the Paris Games -- but he was unable to lead the hosts to victory in a 12-12 draw with the United States.\n\n\"It's always a lot of emotion when you play with all your supporters so it's important to deal with that and to be better even with the pressure,\" admitted the 27-year-old.\n\nAustralia laid down a marker to France and double champions Fiji with a 21-14 win over Samoa at a packed Stade de France.\n\nAs the clock ticks down towards Friday's opening ceremony along the Seine, Olympic chiefs awarded the 2030 Winter Games to the French Alps and the 2034 event to Salt Lake City.\n\nBut in a dramatic twist they warned the US city could be stripped of the Games if American authorities kept up their feud with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\n\nJohn Coates, the chairman of the IOC's legal commission, said the host city contract confirming Salt Lake's right to stage the Olympics had been altered to allow the IOC to strip it of the Games if US authorities did not respect the \"supreme authority\" of WADA.\n\nThe US anti-doping agency (USADA) has been a vocal critic of WADA for much of the past decade and tensions escalated this year after reports in April revealed that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a banned substance ahead of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, but were subsequently cleared to compete at the Games.\n\nUSADA chief Travis Tygart accused Olympic bosses of \"stooping to threats\".\n\n\"Today's demonstration further showed that as it stands today, WADA is just a sport lapdog, and clean athletes have little chance,\" said Tygart.\n\nThe Olympics lost a top star when tennis world number one Jannik Sinner withdrew with tonsillitis with the Italian admitting he was \"sad and disappointed\".\n\nPreparations for Friday's historic opening ceremony were in full swing with an unprecedented security operation for the athletes' parade along the River Seine.\n\nAround 6,000-7,000 athletes are set to sail down a six-kilometre (four-mile) stretch of the river towards the Eiffel Tower, on 85 barges and boats.\n\nUp to 500,000 people are set to watch in person from specially built stands, on the river banks and from the overlooking balconies and apartments.\n\nThe area around the river has been locked down before the ceremony, with snipers positioned along the route and frogmen deployed to prevent a waterborne attack.\n\nThe entertainment line-up for the ceremony, the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium, is yet to be fully announced.\n\nBut videos posted online showing US pop star Lady Gaga in Paris sparked rumours she will be among the performers.\n\nAmerican rapper Snoop Dogg will carry the Olympic flame this Friday as it makes its final rounds before the ceremony.\n\nIn the first scandal of the Games, a video emerged showing the mistreatment of a horse by one of Britain's most decorated Olympians, dressage specialist Charlotte Dujardin, who has been suspended.\n\nThe film showed the three-time Olympic champion walking alongside a horse and repeatedly whipping the animal while apparently training a young rider.\n\nDujardin, 39, has won six Olympic medals and was aiming to become Britain's most successful female Olympian by winning further medals in Paris.\n\nIn a further scandal, an assistant coach and an analyst with the Canadian women's football team were sent home for their part in spying on rivals.\n\nThe analyst, 43-year-old Joey Lombardi, was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session.\n\nLombardi pleaded guilty when he appeared in court in Saint-Etienne on Wednesday, the court told AFP.\n\nThe assistant coach was Jasmine Mander, to whom Lombardi reported.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris",

Rugby, football kick off Paris 2024", "body": "Paris: Football and Rugby Sevens kick off the sporting action at the Paris Olympics on Wednesday featuring a top French star and a huge police presence.\n\nAs the clock ticks down towards Friday's opening ceremony, Olympic chiefs awarded the 2030 Winter Games to the French Alps and the 2034 event to Salt Lake City.\n\nBut in a dramatic twist they warned the US city could be stripped of the Games if American authorities kept up their feud with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\n\nAs the sport gets under way two days before the opening ceremony, a packed Stade de France will cheer on Antoine Dupont -- arguably the world's best rugby player and a pin-up of the Paris Games -- as the Rugby Sevens tournament starts.\n\nThe electric Dupont is the biggest draw for the 555,000 fans expected over the six days of rugby action, but France will have their work cut out to stop double Olympic champions Fiji.\n\nFrance and Fiji are in the same pool and will play the United States and Uruguay, before the pair face each other in a mouthwatering clash on Thursday.\n\nOthers to watch in the wide-open competition are traditional rugby powers New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, and Ireland.\n\nIOC warns Salt Lake\n\nThe success of Salt Lake City's bid to host the 2034 Olympics was a foregone conclusion given the Utah city, which hosted the Games in 2002, was the only candidate.\n\nBut the International Olympic Committee said the Games could be revoked if US lawmakers and the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) were not brought into line.\n\nJohn Coates, the chairman of the IOC's legal commission, said the host city contract confirming Salt Lake's right to stage the Olympics had been altered to allow the IOC to strip it of the Games if US authorities did not respect the \"supreme authority\" of WADA.\n\nUSADA has been a vocal critic of WADA for much of the past decade and tensions escalated this year after reports in April revealed that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a banned substance ahead of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, but were subsequently cleared to compete at the Games.\n\nThe IOC handed the 2030 games to France but under the condition that Paris stumps up the required financial commitments.\n\nSecurity lockdown\n\nPreparations for Friday's historic opening ceremony were in full swing with an unprecedented security operation for the athletes' parade along the River Seine.\n\nAround 6,000-7,000 athletes are set to sail down a six-kilometre (four-mile) stretch of the river towards the Eiffel Tower, on 85 barges and boats.\n\nUp to 500,000 people are set to watch in person from specially built stands, on the river banks and from the overlooking balconies and apartments.\n\nThe area around the river has been locked down before the ceremony, with snipers positioned along the route and frogmen deployed to prevent a waterborne attack.\n\nThe entertainment line-up for the ceremony, the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium, is yet to be fully announced.\n\nBut videos posted online showing US pop star Lady Gaga in Paris sparked rumours she will be among the performers.\n\nAmerican rapper Snoop Dogg will carry the Olympic flame this Friday as it makes its final rounds before the ceremony.\n\nIn the first scandal of the Games, a video emerged showing the mistreatment of a horse by one of Britain's most decorated Olympians, dressage specialist Charlotte Dujardin, who has been suspended.\n\nThe film showed the three-time Olympic champion walking alongside a horse and repeatedly whipping the animal while apparently training a young rider.\n\nDujardin, 39, has won six Olympic medals and was aiming to become Britain's most successful female Olympian by winning further medals in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "thepeninsulaqatar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peninsula"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Audacity also underpins the French capital's plans for its first Olympic Games in a century, which open Friday with an opening ceremony for the ages.\n\nThe most sprawling and elaborate Olympic opening ever -- a gala spectacular Friday evening on the River Seine that even French President Emmanuel Macron says initially felt like \"a crazy and not very serious idea\" -- kicks off 16 days of competition that promise to be ground-breaking, with nearly every corner of the city hosting some aspect of competition.\n\nAfter two toned-down, pandemic-hampered Olympics, expect a bold celebration. The heady marriage of sports and France's world-renowned capital of fashion, gastronomy and culture could also help secure the Olympics' longer-term future.\n\nOlympic organizers were struggling to find suitable host cities for their flagship Summer Games when they settled on Paris in 2017, enticed by its promise of innovations and the potential for the city of romance to rekindle love for the Olympics, especially with younger audiences that have so many other entertainment options.\n\nBut Paris' challenges are huge, too.\n\nThe city that has been repeatedly struck by deadly extremist attacks has to safeguard 10,500 athletes and millions of visitors. The international context of wars in Ukraine and Gaza add layers of complication for the gargantuan security effort. French elite special forces are part of the security detail for Israel's delegation.\n\nStill, if all goes well, Paris hopes to be remembered as a before-and-after Olympic watershed.\n\nThe first Games with nearly equal numbers of men and women, an advance that's been a long time coming since 22 women first got accepted as Olympians 124 years ago, also in Paris, will take another step toward aligning the Olympics with the post-#MeToo world.\n\nParis also hopes to reassure climate-conscious Generations Z and beyond by staging Games that are less polluting, more sustainable and more socially virtuous than their predecessors. Many of the sports venues are temporary, because Paris didn't want to repeat the mistake of previous Olympic host cities that built new arenas and then had no use for them.\n\nWith iconic Paris monuments as backdrops -- beach volleyball in the Eiffel Tower's shadow -- and breakdancing added to a growing list of Olympic sports that target young audiences, expect plenty of viral moments on Instagram, TikTok and elsewhere.\n\nCrowds will be back for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic forced Tokyo to push back its Games to 2021 and keep spectators away, and the Beijing Winter Games in 2022, when China was locked down.\n\nPrize-winning French theater director Thomas Jolly is turning central Paris into an open-air stage for the opening ceremony that will run through sunset and showcase France, its people and their history. The 330-meter-tall (1,083-foot-tall) Eiffel Tower will surely feature prominently.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people, including 320,000 paying and invited ticket-holders, are expected to line the Seine's banks as athletes are paraded along the river on boats.\n\nDuring the extravaganza, a no-fly zone extending for 150 kilometers (93 miles) around the capital will close Paris' skies, policed by fighter jets, airspace-monitoring AWACS surveillance flights, surveillance drones, helicopters that can carry sharpshooters and drone-disabling equipment.\n\nShowcasing and celebrating Paris could be joyously cathartic for the city that was plunged into mourning by extremist attacks in 2015.\n\nGuesses about the identity of the person or people who might get the honor of lighting the Olympic cauldron include soccer icon Zinedine Zidane and other French sporting heroes, but also survivors of Islamic State-group gunmen and suicide bombers who killed 130 people on Nov. 13, 2015.\n\nParis is also taking gambles in hopes of leaving an indelible impression on the Olympics' global audience of billions.\n\nThe decision not to stage the opening ceremony in the traditional setting of France's biggest stadium -- the Stade de France that was among the 2015 attackers' targets and is now the venue for Olympic track and field and rugby sevens -- and to host skateboarding, archery and other sports in temporary arenas in the heart of Paris have made safeguarding the Games more complex.\n\nRights campaigners and Games critics worry about the broad scope and scale of Olympic security, including the use of AI-equipped surveillance technology.\n\nThe furthest venue is on the other side of the world in the French Pacific territory of Tahiti, where Olympic surfers will compete on famously giant waves that first form in storm belts off Antarctica.\n\nUp to 45,000 police and gendarmes, plus 10,000 soldiers, are safeguarding Paris and its suburbs that together are hosting most of the 32 sports that will crown Olympic champions in 329 medal events. The gold, silver and bronze medals they'll hand out are inlaid with a hexagonal, polished chunk of iron taken from the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe Seine's banks and riverside roads and more than a dozen of its bridges were fenced off nine days ahead of the opening ceremony, creating a no-go zone for people who haven't applied in advance for passes and making it tough for Parisians and visitors to get around and see the sights in the city of 2 million. Owners of restaurants and other businesses inside the security fence are howling about fewer customers.\n\nLimiting new construction has saved money and, Paris organizers say, contributed to their goal of halving the Games' overall carbon footprint compared with London in 2012 and Rio in 2016. Among the new venues, an Olympic aquatics center in Seine Saint-Denis is expected to help that underprivileged suburb of northern Paris teach more children to swim.\n\nFrench organizers argue that the Games will leave positive impacts on Paris long after the Olympians and Paralympic athletes who follow from Aug. 28 to Sept. 8 have departed.\n\nA costly and complex cleanup of the long-polluted Seine, sped up by the deadline of the Games, is expected to reopen the river to public swimming next year, after Olympic marathon swimmers and triathletes have competed in it. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip this month to demonstrate that its waters are safe.\n\nWith estimated overall costs of around 9 billion euros ($9.7 billion), more than half from sponsors, ticket sales and other non-public funding, Paris' expenses so far are less than for Tokyo, Rio and London.\n\nOnce opening ceremony fireworks have become memories, the City of Light will then become the playground of Olympians.\n\nAmerican gymnastics superstar Simon Biles is back. French-born basketball phenom Victor Wembanyama will carry home hopes on his 7-foot-4 (2.24-meter) frame. Ukrainian and Palestinian athletes have points they want to prove about conflict, resilience and sacrifice that go beyond the realms of sport.\n\nThe lucky few will win medals. Many will wish they had gone higher, faster and stronger.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She sings in French, with frequent use of slang, her style influenced by West Indies zouk music, mixing in American R'n'B and Afrobeats.\n\nOne big unknown is the weather. It is currently forecast to be cloudy, when organizers were hoping there would be a \"golden hour\" of sunset lighting up buildings midway through the ceremony.\n\nWHO WILL BE THERE?\n\nThe show will be attended by over 80 heads of state and government and more than 300,000 spectators will watch from the river's banks, organizers said.\n\nThe Paris 2024 committee said some 222,000 people would get free invites, while 104,000 will have to buy a ticket.\n\nBoats carrying the athletes will be equipped with cameras to allow those watching on TV or their phone to get a close-up view, the committee said.\n\nWHAT ABOUT SECURITY?\n\nOrganizing the ceremony in the heart of an iconic city like Paris may make for great pictures, but it's also a major security challenge.\n\nSome 2,000 private security staff and 45,000 police will be dispatched to ensure the ceremony's security, including special intervention forces. Snipers will be deployed on the top of buildings along the route. An anti-drone system will be in place.\n\nSpectators and local residents need to carry permits on a QR code to get anywhere near the riverbanks. Cars won't be allowed into the area, with few exceptions.\n\nNearby metro stations will be closed, as will many of the bridges. No planes will be allowed to fly over Paris - unless they are part of the ceremony.\n\nWith wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and security concerns at home, France already has its security alert at its highest level.\n\nOfficials have said there are no specific terror threats to the ceremony.\n\nThe main potential risk would be from a lone attacker, officials have said over the past months, while also flagging potential petty crime and possible protests, from environmental activists, the far right and far left, the pro-Palestinian movement or others.\n\nA man was arrested in May in Saint-Etienne, suspected of planning an attack in the name of Islamic State at the city's soccer stadium during the Olympics.\n\nA right-wing sympathizer was arrested in eastern France in July on suspicion of plotting attacks to take place during the Olympics.\n\nPAST SUMMER OLYMPICS' OPENING CEREMONIES\n\nTokyo 2020: The opening ceremony was overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Postponed by a year due to the coronavirus, the Games were held largely without spectators.\n\nRio 2016: Financially constrained Brazil had little choice but to put on a more low-key show, with minimal technology and a heavy dependence on the country's Carnival party traditions.\n\nLondon 2012: The 86-year-old Queen Elizabeth put aside royal reserve in a video where she stepped onto a helicopter with James Bond actor Daniel Craig to be carried aloft from Buckingham Palace as part of a dizzying ceremony designed to highlight the grandeur and eccentricities of the nation.\n\nBeijing 2008: About one billion people, or 15% of the world's population, watched the opening ceremony, which involved 10,000 performers, 2008 drummers and a dramatic sky-walking finale.

This will start the ceremony, not mark the end of it, another break from tradition.\n\nWhat time does the opening ceremony start?\n\nThe ceremony starts at 1:30 p.m. EDT/7:30 p.m. CEST and is expected to last more than three hours.\n\nWhere is the opening ceremony be\n\ning held?\n\nThe parade starts at the Austerlitz Bridge beside the Jardin des Plantes and follows the course of the Seine from east to west. It makes its way around two islands in the center of the city before passing under several bridges and gateways. Athletes aboard the boats will get glimpses of several Olympic venues including La Concorde Urban Park (3X3 basketball, breaking, BMX freestyle cycling, skateboarding), Invalides (archery, athletics -- marathon finish, road cycling -- time trial start) and the Grand Palais (fencing, taekwondo). The parade ends at the Iena Bridge, which links the Eiffel Tower on the left bank of the Seine to the Trocad\u00e9ro district on the right bank. The ceremony's finale is at the Trocad\u00e9ro. There, among other ceremonial procedures, French President Emmanuel Macron will deliver opening remarks.\n\nHow can I watch t\n\nhe opening ceremony?\n\nThe ceremony will air on NBC and stream on Peacock and NBC Olympic platforms -- NBCOlympics.com, NBC.com, NBC app, NBC Olympics app.\n\nA preview will air on NBC at noon EDT, with live coverage beginning at 1:30 p.m. and an enhanced prime-time encore at 7:30 p.m.\n\nAbout 220,000 invited and security-screened spectators are expected to fill the upper tiers of the Seine's banks, and an additional 104,000 paying spectators will watch from the lower riverside and around the Trocad\u00e9ro plaza.\n\nThose in Paris who could not get tickets will be able to watch the ceremony on 80 giant screens set up throughout the city.\n\nWho is performing at the opening ceremony?\n\nIn addition to the athletes who will participate in the parade, 3,000 dancers, artists and other athletes will be featured in the opening and closing ceremonies. Most of the entertainment acts remain under wraps. NBC News reported that Celine Dion and Lady Gaga have arrived in Paris amid speculation that one or both of the pop singers will perform at the opening ceremony.\n\nAP Summer Olympics:

The reason why these two languages are spoken has now been revealed ahead of the Paris 2024 Games. The Paris Olympics gets underway on the 26th of July, culminating on the 11th of August.\n\nWith the Paris Olympics just days away, over 10,000 athletes will be getting ready to put to work years of training and preparation in a bid to win gold for their respective sport and respective country. As with every Olympic event, anticipation is rife, especially with the last summer Games having been in Tokyo 2021, the first ever odd-numbered Olympic event, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nParis 2024 will mark a return to Olympic normality, with the United States of America hoping they can defend their record of having won every summer Games since 1996, a record that sees them hold the record for most medals won in Olympic history, with 2,968 medals.\n\nAs much as the Olympic Games is about sports, and discovering a new-found love for sports and athletes you've never seen, as well as supporting the sports and athletes you love, there is one aspect of the Games that millions of people tune in for every four years, and that is the opening ceremony.\n\nOlympics Opening Ceremony\n\nParis has decided to make history with their version of the opening ceremony, with it set to take place on the river Seine, marking it as the first time an Olympics opening ceremony has taken place outside, and not inside a stadium. Despite it being exactly a century since France has hosted the summer Games, people will have noticed that in the events that have taken place since, that French is always spoken, and there is a fascinating reason why.\n\nWhy French is spoken at every opening ceremony\n\nEver since 1896, the Olympic Games has been synonymous with the French language, and that is because it is the official language of the Games, alongside English. Having been dormant since the Ancient Greek era of athletic showcasing, 1896 marked the revival of the Olympic Games, with Frenchman, Pierre de Coubertin, seen to be the father of the modern Games.\n\nDue to his involvement, France has always been synonymous with the Games, with the French language being seen as the language of diplomacy, and lots of people dedicate that to Coubertin, with many believing his work on the Games being a key reason as to why France was made the first official language of the Olympic Games.\n\nIt is due to this that with every Olympic opening ceremony, announcements are made in both French and English, due to their roles as official languages. Announcements would also be made in the native tongue of the host city, but due to this year's Olympics emanating from France, there will be no need, as French is already involved. This same rule of thumb applies to the closing ceremonies, meaning that the Paris 2024 Olympic Games will only have French and English involved.\n\nRelated Why Team GB Athlete Charlotte Dujardin Withdrew From Olympics\n\nA video has surfaced showing Charlotte Dujardin whipping a horse during a coaching session, leading to her withdrawing from the Olympics.\n\nA fascinating reason, and a homage to the history of the Games, Paris 2024 will mark the third time that France has hosted, with many athletes having just arrived at the Olympic Village ahead of this weekend's opening ceremony.\n\nThe two-week-long event will start on the 26th of July, and culminate on the 11th of August, as the USA will hope to win an eighth successive summer Games ahead of them hosting it in 2028, in Los Angeles.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Coubertin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pierre de Coubertin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Greek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Dujardin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Dujardin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mixcollage-24-jul-2024-09-43-am-8534.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 263, "textEnd": 275, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 296, "textEnd": 310, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

It makes its way around two islands in the center of the city before passing under several bridges and gateways.\n\nAthletes aboard the boats will get glimpses of several Paris Olympics venues including La Concorde Urban Park (3X3 basketball, breaking, BMX freestyle cycling, skateboarding), Invalides (archery, athletics -- marathon finish, road cycling -- time trial start) and the Grand Palais (fencing, taekwondo). The parade ends at the Iena Bridge, which links the Eiffel Tower on the left bank of the Seine to the Trocad\u00e9ro district on the right bank.\n\nThe ceremony's finale is at the Trocad\u00e9ro.

This will start the ceremony, not mark the end of it, another break from tradition.\n\nThe ceremony starts at 11 p.m. IST (1:30 p.m. EDT/7:30 p.m. CES) and is expected to last more than three hours.\n\nA police officer stands guard near Notre Dame Cathedral as the security perimeter for the opening ceremony is deployed ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympics and Paralympics Games in Paris | Photo Credit: Reuters\n\nThe parade starts at the Austerlitz Bridge beside the Jardin des Plantes and follows the course of the Seine from east to west. It makes its way around two islands in the center of the city before passing under several bridges and gateways. Athletes aboard the boats will get glimpses of several Olympic venues including La Concorde Urban Park (3X3 basketball, breaking, BMX freestyle cycling, skateboarding), Invalides (archery, athletics -- marathon finish, road cycling -- time trial start) and the Grand Palais (fencing, taekwondo). The parade ends at the Iena Bridge, which links the Eiffel Tower on the left bank of the Seine to the Trocad\u00e9ro district on the right bank. The ceremony's finale is at the Trocad\u00e9ro. There, among other ceremonial procedures, French President Emmanuel Macron will deliver opening remarks.\n\nPolice officers are pictured on the river Seine during the tour. | Photo Credit: Reuters\n\nThe ceremony will air on NBC and stream on Peacock and NBC Olympic platforms -- NBCOlympics.com, NBC.com, NBC app, NBC Olympics app.\n\nA preview will air on NBC at noon EDT, with live coverage beginning at 1:30 p.m. and an enhanced prime-time encore at 7:30 p.m.\n\nAbout 220,000 invited and security-screened spectators are expected to fill the upper tiers of the Seine's banks, and an additional 104,000 paying spectators will watch from the lower riverside and around the Trocad\u00e9ro plaza.\n\nThose in Paris who could not get tickets will be able to watch the ceremony on 80 giant screens set up throughout the city.\n\nIn addition to the athletes who will participate in the parade, 3,000 dancers, artists and other athletes will be featured in the opening and closing ceremonies. Most of the entertainment acts remain under wraps. NBC News reported that Celine Dion and Lady Gaga have arrived in Paris amid speculation that one or both of the pop singers will perform at the opening ceremony.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocad\u00e9ro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trocad\u00e9ro"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Notre-Dame de Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3x3_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "3x3 basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jardin_des_plantes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jardin des plantes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Palais", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Palais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cycle sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Austerlitz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Austerlitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_BMX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle BMX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Invalides", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Les Invalides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concorde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taekwondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skateboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_bicycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Road bicycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Dion", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celine Dion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/sport/olympics/j0fs0s/article68444779.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-07-22T100210Z_445471406_UP1EK7M0RVJNL_RTRMADP_3_OLYMPICS-2024-VOLUNTEERS.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 55, "textEnd": 62}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Audacity also underpins the French capital's plans for its first Olympic Games in a century, which open Friday with an opening ceremony for the ages.\n\nThe most sprawling and elaborate Olympic opening ever -- a gala spectacular Friday evening on the River Seine that even French President Emmanuel Macron says initially felt like \"a crazy and not very serious idea\" -- kicks off 16 days of competition that promise to be ground-breaking, with nearly every corner of the city hosting some aspect of competition.\n\nAfter two toned-down, pandemic-hampered Olympics, expect a bold celebration. The heady marriage of sports and France's world-renowned capital of fashion, gastronomy and culture could also help secure the Olympics' longer-term future.\n\nOlympic organizers were struggling to find suitable host cities for their flagship Summer Games when they settled on Paris in 2017, enticed by its promise of innovations and the potential for the city of romance to rekindle love for the Olympics, especially with younger audiences that have so many other entertainment options.\n\nThe city that has been repeatedly struck by deadly extremist attacks has to safeguard 10,500 athletes and millions of visitors. The international context of wars in Ukraine and Gaza add layers of complication for the gargantuan security effort. French elite special forces are part of the security detail for Israel's delegation.\n\nStill, if all goes well, Paris hopes to be remembered as a before-and-after Olympic watershed.\n\nThe first Games with nearly equal numbers of men and women, an advance that's been a long time coming since 22 women first got accepted as Olympians 124 years ago, also in Paris, will take another step toward aligning the Olympics with the post-#MeToo world.\n\nParis also hopes to reassure climate-conscious Generations Z and beyond by staging Games that are less polluting, more sustainable and more socially virtuous than their predecessors. Many of the sports venues are temporary, because Paris didn't want to repeat the mistake of previous Olympic host cities that built new arenas and then had no use for them.\n\nWith iconic Paris monuments as backdrops -- beach volleyball in the Eiffel Tower's shadow -- and breakdancing added to a growing list of Olympic sports that target young audiences, expect plenty of viral moments on Instagram, TikTok and elsewhere.\n\nCrowds will be back for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic forced Tokyo to push back its Games to 2021 and keep spectators away, and the Beijing Winter Games in 2022, when China was locked down.\n\nPrize-winning French theater director Thomas Jolly is turning central Paris into an open-air stage for the opening ceremony that will run through sunset and showcase France, its people and their history. The 330-meter-tall (1,083-foot-tall) Eiffel Tower will surely feature prominently.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people, including 320,000 paying and invited ticket-holders, are expected to line the Seine's banks as athletes are paraded along the river on boats.\n\nDuring the extravaganza, a no-fly zone extending for 150 kilometers (93 miles) around the capital will close Paris' skies, policed by fighter jets, airspace-monitoring AWACS surveillance flights, surveillance drones, helicopters that can carry sharpshooters and drone-disabling equipment.\n\nHelping Parisians move past the attacks of 2015\n\nShowcasing and celebrating Paris could be joyously cathartic for the city that was plunged into mourning by extremist attacks in 2015.\n\nGuesses about the identity of the person or people who might get the honor of lighting the Olympic cauldron include soccer icon Zinedine Zidane and other French sporting heroes, but also survivors of Islamic State-group gunmen and suicide bombers who killed 130 people on Nov. 13, 2015.\n\nParis is also taking gambles in hopes of leaving an indelible impression on the Olympics' global audience of billions.\n\nThe decision not to stage the opening ceremony in the traditional setting of France's biggest stadium -- the Stade de France that was among the 2015 attackers' targets and is now the venue for Olympic track and field and rugby sevens -- and to host skateboarding, archery and other sports in temporary arenas in the heart of Paris have made safeguarding the Games more complex.\n\nRights campaigners and Games critics worry about the broad scope and scale of Olympic security, including the use of AI-equipped surveillance technology.\n\nParis' reach stretches to the Pacific\n\nThe furthest venue is on the other side of the world in the French Pacific territory of Tahiti, where Olympic surfers will compete on famously giant waves that first form in storm belts off Antarctica.\n\nUp to 45,000 police and gendarmes, plus 10,000 soldiers, are safeguarding Paris and its suburbs that together are hosting most of the 32 sports that will crown Olympic champions in 329 medal events. The gold, silver and bronze medals they'll hand out are inlaid with a hexagonal, polished chunk of iron taken from the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe Seine's banks and riverside roads and more than a dozen of its bridges were fenced off nine days ahead of the opening ceremony, creating a no-go zone for people who haven't applied in advance for passes and making it tough for Parisians and visitors to get around and see the sights in the city of 2 million. Owners of restaurants and other businesses inside the security fence are howling about fewer customers.\n\nLeaving an Olympic legacy for Paris\n\nLimiting new construction has saved money and, Paris organizers say, contributed to their goal of halving the Games' overall carbon footprint compared with London in 2012 and Rio in 2016. Among the new venues, an Olympic aquatics center in Seine Saint-Denis is expected to help that underprivileged suburb of northern Paris teach more children to swim.\n\nFrench organizers argue that the Games will leave positive impacts on Paris long after the Olympians and Paralympic athletes who follow from Aug. 28 to Sept. 8 have departed.\n\nA costly and complex cleanup of the long-polluted Seine, sped up by the deadline of the Games, is expected to reopen the river to public swimming next year, after Olympic marathon swimmers and triathletes have competed in it. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip this month to demonstrate that its waters are safe.\n\nWith estimated overall costs of around 9 billion euros ($9.7 billion), more than half from sponsors, ticket sales and other non-public funding, Paris' expenses so far are less than for Tokyo, Rio and London.\n\nOnce opening ceremony fireworks have become memories, the City of Light will then become the playground of Olympians.\n\nAmerican gymnastics superstar Simon Biles is back. French-born basketball phenom Victor Wembanyama will carry home hopes on his 7-foot-4 (2.24-meter) frame. Ukrainian and Palestinian athletes have points they want to prove about conflict, resilience and sacrifice that go beyond the realms of sport.\n\nThe lucky few will win medals. Many will wish they had gone higher, faster and stronger.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Reuters\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics will kick off a little over 24 hours from now with the opening ceremony set to take place in River Seine at 11 pm IST (7.30 pm local time).\n\nA few of the events are already underway including football, archery but the Games are not officially considered open until the Opening Ceremony has taken place.\n\nParis Olympics Complete Coverage: Click here for news, schedule, explainers and more\n\nBefore the 33rd Summer Olympics Games get underway, we take a look at what's new in Paris this year:\n\nOpening ceremony outside stadium\n\nParis 2024 is set to standout in Olympic history for having the most unique opening ceremony ever. This year's opening ceremoyn is set to take place at The Seine, the river that flows through the French capital, instead of a stadium as has been a norm over the years.\n\nOver 10,000 athletes will be travelling on around 100 boats during the opening ceremony that will pass through some of Paris' most iconic places including Notre Dame, Pont des Arts and Pont Neuf. The floating parade will begin from the Austerlitz bridge and will end at the Trocad\u00e9ro, where the remainder of the Opening Ceremony will take place.\n\nGender parity\n\nIt was in Paris in 1900 where women athletes competed at the Olympics for the first time. More than a century later, the French capital bears witness to another milestone -- that of a parity between male and female athletes at the world's biggest sporting event.\n\nA total of 10,500 athletes from 206 countries are participating in the 2024 Paris Games, and feature as many man as women. For context, the 1936 Olympics had just 8.4 per cent female participation while the number in the Tokyo 2020 Games was 47.8 per cent.\n\nNew sports\n\nBreaking, more popularly known as breakdancing across the world, will be making its highly-anticipated debut in the Paris Games. What began as a dance form in New York City in the 1970s has slowly evolved into a competitive sport that has its own world championships.\n\nIt was part of the 2018 Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires and is set to experience its biggest moment ever in Paris in July and August. Breaking, however, has not been included for the Los Angeles Olympics four years from now.\n\nAlso canoeing is set to have a new event in Paris 2024 -- kayak cross, where athletes will compete against each other over white-water and through obstacles.\n\nSports such as surfing, climbing and skateboarding are set for a second appearance after they made their debuts in Tokyo 2020.\n\nRepechage rounds in athletics\n\nAthletics, along with swimming, has been at the heart of the modern Olympic Games since the inaugural edition in 1896. After 128 years, the most popular sport at the Summer Olympics is set to have 'repechage' rounds, which is set to change the qualification system for the semi-finals.\n\nRepechage, which is already in place in sports such as wrestling and boxing, will be introduced in all track events from 200m to 1500m, including hurdles events. In the 'repechage' provision, athletes will stand the chance of making the semi-finals even if they don't automatically qualify in round one heats by participating in the repechage heats. It essentially gives a second chance to those who finish outside the top 3 in the heats.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Organising_Committee_of_the_Olympic_and_Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Austerlitz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Austerlitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocad\u00e9ro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trocad\u00e9ro"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Notre Dame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_Neuf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pont Neuf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_des_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pont des Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2018_Summer_Youth_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repechage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Repechage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skateboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoeing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canoeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayak", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kayak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/07/Eiffel-Tower-Paris-Olympics-Reuters-1200-2024-07-4f0e7722bf6e16ba713f1fe1ca1e59cb.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

See the schedule for the 2024 Paris Games.", "body": "The 2024 Paris Olympics are set to kick off soon, with a schedule full of sporting events. Here's everything you need to know about when this summer's Olympics will start and end.\n\nThe Olympics will officially open in Paris on the night of Friday, July 26 and continue through Sunday, Aug. 11, although some team events started on July 24. The July 26 opening ceremony will be held on the Seine river, which flows though Paris. The closing ceremony, which includes a parade of flags and athletes, will take place on Aug. 11.\n\nThe opening ceremony for the 2024 Summer Olympics will be unique. According to organizers, the July 26 event will be the first Olympic opening ceremony held outside of a stadium. The Tokyo opening ceremony last time around was held in a largely empty stadium because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn Paris, athletes will parade in boats down the Seine river. The flotilla will begin at 7:30 p.m. local time on Friday, July 26,, which is 1:30 p.m. Eastern in the U.S. and 10:30 a.m. on the West Coast.\n\nAn estimated 94 boats will travel along the almost four-mile route as part of the ceremony, with delegations and performers joining athletes on the Seine, according to organizers. Around 10,500 athletes representing 206 National Olympic Committees are taking part in the Games.\n\nAround 120 heads of state, royals and other leaders will also attend the opening ceremony.\n\nThe closing ceremony for the 2024 Summer Olympics will be on Sunday, Aug. 11, beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern, in the Stade de France. It will feature a parade of flags, a parade of athletes and victory ceremonies, among other events. The closing ceremony in Tokyo lasted for about three hours.\n\nArtistic gymnastics events are scheduled for July 27 to Aug. 1, and then again from Aug. 3-5. Rhythmic gymnastics events, a female-only event, are scheduled for Aug. 8-10. Artistic and rhythmic gymnastics test different skills and use different equipment.\n\nAll trampoline gymnastics events are scheduled for Aug. 2, the day starts with the women's qualifications, followed by the women's final. Then comes the men's qualifications and the men's final later on Aug. 2.\n\nWomen's artistic gymnastics, featuring athletes including U.S. star Simone Biles, involves four core events: beam, vault, uneven bars and floor exercise. Men's artistic gymnastics features eight events across six pieces of equipment: rings, vault, pommel horse, horizontal bar, parallel bars and floor exercise. There are two additional events to test the overall skill of the male gymnasts.\n\nThere are two categories of competition in Olympic rhythmic gymnastics, individual all-around women and group all-around women. It showcases skill, flexibility and musicality using balls, hoops, clubs and ribbons.\n\nSome who go to check the Olympics schedule for soccer may be confused: The sport is listed under football, as it is known in most of the world.\n\nThe events started before the official opening ceremony on July 26 because of the number of matches in the tournament. Matches are scheduled for most days during the Games, with the full listings and results available online.\n\nCompetition actually began two days before the opening ceremony, on July 24, with preliminary rounds in archery, soccer, handball and rugby. The swimming events will run during the first week of the Games from July 27 through Aug. 4, with track and field events taking place from July 1 to Aug. 11.\n\nThe marathon is traditionally the last athletic event.\n\nWhile a full schedule is available online, the Paris Games organizers note that it is subject to change.\n\nThere will be both live and tape-delayed coverage of the Olympics airing on TV. At least nine hours of coverage will be broadcast each day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET on NBC and Telemundo. Some events will air on the USA Network, Golf Channel, CNBC and E!.\n\nPeacock will livestream events from the 2024 Olympics, including the opening and closing ceremonies and every Olympic basketball

It will be open to all: residents from Paris and its region, as well as visitors from all over France and around the world.\n\n\"By opening with the parade of athletes, Paris 2024 is breaking with tradition.\n\n\"Athletes will be featured on stage during the introduction to and throughout the ceremony as part of Paris 2024's constant aim to hold Games created for and by athletes.\"\n\nIn a blow to organizers, the ceremony is allegedly struggling to sell out, as well as the showpiece Olympic event.\n\nIt is the third time that Paris will host the Summer Games, with the most recent edition coming exactly a century before - but it seems that excitement levels may be on the wane.\n\nThat is because \"hundreds of thousands of tickets\" remain unsold with just days left before it starts.\n\nThe Times state that between 500,000 and 600,000 tickets remain unsold.\n\nAnd, as of yesterday, they included both the men's and women's 100m finals.\n\nBoth of these two events are traditionally the hottest tickets at the Olympics and are sold out well in advance.\n\nTickets priced at \u00a3249 and \u00a3825 are still available for the Sunday 4 August session.\n\nAnd some for as low as \u00a3164 for the Saturday 3 August evening session, which includes the women's 100m final, are also still for sale.\n\nThe water quality of the Seine has also become a hot topic of discussion.\n\nIn 1923, swimming in the river was outlawed by the French government for a century due to its poor water quality and health hazards.\n\nOver \u00a31.2billion has been spent since 2016 in an attempt to clean it according to Sports Pro Media.\n\nDespite extensive efforts, including building a mega-basin designed to store waste and prevent the sewage system from spilling into the river, the results have fallen short of expectations, casting doubt and raising concerns about the safety of athletes and their health.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_gordon@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Jamie Gordon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocad\u00e9ro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trocad\u00e9ro"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre_zero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kilometre zero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_France", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/team-great-britain-walk-parade-916074526.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 2629, "textEnd": 2637}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 2694, "textEnd": 2702}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

How would Team USA, the largest delegation in the Summer Olympics, navigate an unprecedented opening ceremony on the Seine?\n\nNext came the safety concerns, Deal's responsibility as chief of security and athlete services of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee. It has taken years for her to feel comfortable with Paris 2024's plans as her team and federal officials worked closely with French security.\n\nWith the Paris Olympics set to open July 26, everyone from organizers and security officials, to hospitality providers and ceremony coordinators, feels the pressure of pulling off the event. The nearly four-hour ceremony along 6 kilometers of the famed river through Paris presents the biggest high-wire act of these Games, one that has taken years of planning to pull off.\n\n\"It's a balance of security,\" said Deal, \"and also the experience for the stakeholders that are going to be there. And they're finding that sweet spot right now.\"\n\nBefore the French can produce the promised spectacle through Paris, they must secure it. That's Herculean considering potential threats to the Games in France, which is no stranger to terrorist attacks. The ceremony will come less than two weeks after an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump and with ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nTo secure the opening, local and federal law enforcement are planning around 45,000 officers, up from the 30,000 expected daily during the rest of the Olympics. The French military will bring in another 15,000 for the Games, and Paris 2024 will bring in up to 22,000 private security personnel.\n\nIn addition to security for the crowds at the opening ceremony, French officials need to vet residents and control access to buildings along the route.\n\n\"This would be no different as to when the pope comes somewhere and they do a parade route down the street or something,\" said Jim Morgan, who spent 24 years in the Secret Service and is now chief security officer at Concentric Advisors. \"That's exactly how they'll secure it. It's very challenging, but it is doable because they will treat it just like any other parade-type route that you would take, only it's on the water in boats.\"\n\nFor Deal, that will mean nesting Team USA's security plans with those of French authorities. She has worked closely with them and the State Department, which will have more than 70 agents on the ground with the U.S. delegation -- which includes 592 Olympic athletes -- throughout the Games.\n\nDeal, who spent 18 years as a special agent in the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security, pointed to the French authorities' experience with the Tour de France, among other major sporting events. She said they have been in touch with the New York Police Department to discuss securing events such as New Year's Eve in Times Square, which draws around 1 million people. \"I'm feeling confident,\" she said in April. \"But it took a year and a half to get there.\"\n\nPart of that comes from Paris organizers adjusting the crowd size in January. Initially planned for 600,000 spectators, the ceremony will now accommodate around 300,000.\n\nRoughly 100,000 spectators will have paid tickets for the lower docks along the Seine, while another 220,000 will have free access by invitation to the upper docks. Security will be tight for both, and French authorities have said they will use artificial intelligence to monitor crowd surges.\n\n\"I was thrilled,\" Deal said of the adjustment in spectators. \"Because to me, that's understanding that you need to be nimble and you need to be flexible. And it's a balancing game. If you know you can't meet that security threshold, you've got to decrease the spectators.\"\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\n\nThe security considerations will play a major role for the spectators who can attend in person, including the VIPs with the best seats for the spectacle.\n\nTo secure the Games, metro and car services will not run on the day of the opening. Sponsors, agencies and On Location -- the hospitality provider for the Games -- have built plans within those constraints.\n\nTheir message has been clear -- you'll have to be flexible, and you'll have to walk.\n\n\"I think generally, the sponsors get it. They just want us to provide a solution for their VIPs that is as painless as possible, accepting that it's a different experience and therefore there's going to be a compromise,\" said Michael Tonge, senior vice president of global sales at On Location. \"Nobody's going to drive up to the Trocadero and have a drop-off. It's just not going to happen.\"\n\nHospitality plans have largely been determined by which bank of the river spectators are staying on as it will not be possible to cross bridges, some of which are being used for hospitality, entertainment or broadcasts on the day of the ceremony.\n\nGMR Marketing, which has around 20 Olympic clients, said it is communicating the logistical and time constraints to clients and providing alternative hospitality lounges if they don't want to make the lengthy and involved commitment to go in person.\n\n\"It is top of mind on the safety of guests, getting them there, settled and getting them back and what that looks like on transport and so forth, because it could be a lot,\" said Corinne Holman-Martin, vice president of client and consulting services at GMR.\n\n\"Opening ceremony tends to be a bit of a long day or a long evening in general,\" Holman-Martin said. \"This has a different dynamic to it as well, so we've got to keep those things in mind and also keep the guest expectation to understand that because they're going to be one of 300,000-plus people.\"\n\nOn Location has offered several packages, from an open-air brasserie on a bridge to food and drinks in boats on the river. It also has hospitality lounges in venues within a 15-minute walk of the ceremony.\n\n\"It's once in a lifetime,\" Tonge said. \"It's never going to happen again in any way.\"\n\nThat is certainly the hope of the ceremony's creative team. Paris organizers selected Thomas Jolly, a French actor and theater director, to direct the opening ceremony. After that, little is known, with opening ceremony details treated like state secrets.\n\nWithin Paris 2024, the artists performing in the ceremony are referred to in code names of deceased singers. Marie-Catherine Ettori, director of ceremonies for Paris 2024, said organizers share documents with French authorities that outline generally what will happen in certain areas to allow them to secure the ceremony without sharing creative details.\n\n\"We felt that if you leave something very incredible at the beginning of the Games, for the Paralympics and for the Olympics, then there is something like high energy,\" Ettori said. \"To cross Paris in such configuration, we hope that will give [the athletes] some energy to create something wonderful in the sporting part of the Games.\"\n\nThe ceremony will use around 180 boats to progress through the 6-kilometer route, with organizers contracting with the tourist boats that work along the Seine. Around 10,000 athletes will make their way to the Trocadero, where part of the usual protocol and speeches will occur.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach are expected to be among the dozens of dignitaries at the Trocadero.\n\n\"Everybody from security, transportation down to the hospitality agency, On Location, everybody is thinking down to the one meter and the one minute, who needs to be where,\" said Christophe Dubi, the IOC's Olympic Games executive director.\n\n\"Is it challenging? The ultimate challenge. Is it the most rewarding? Most definitely.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportsbusinessjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "sportsbusinessjournal.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_axon@sportsbusinessjournal.com", "name":

This will be Gauff's first time competing in the Olympics; she was forced to drop out of the Tokyo Games in 2021 after testing positive for COVID-19. She is also the first tennis player selected to be the U.S. flag bearer at an Olympic opening ceremony.

It also follows France's snap legislative elections, called in June by French President Emmanuel Macron, which ended with a hung parliament and parties on the left and far right increasing their size and influence.\n\nAccording to a Seton Hall University sports poll, conducted at the end of June, Americans are more excited than in previous years to watch the 2024 Olympics.\n\nOver 1,600 adults across the country were asked if they were \"more excited to watch the opening ceremony than previous ones,\" 56% of self-described Olympic fans, 51% of sports fans, 59% of avid fans and 48% of casual fans said \"Yes.\"\n\nWhen compared to the 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympics, 59% of the general population and 75% of sports fans said they planned to watch at least part of the Paris Games, up from 49% of the general population and 65% of sports fans who said they would watch the Tokyo Games.\n\n\"Clearly, interest in the Paris 2024 Olympic games is the strongest in recent years,\" Seton Hall Professor Charles Grantham, director of the Center for Sport Management, said in a statement. \"Beyond being in Paris, one of the most visited and famous cities in the world, these games feature a better time difference to see more competitions live, and less off the field distractions such as the pandemic (Tokyo 2021) or human rights concerns (Beijing 2022).\"", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType":

The 10,500-athlete, 90-boat flotilla will travel a 3\u00bd-mile route down the Seine through the middle of Paris.\n\nA diplomatic Riondet said he didn't mind having to prep for the unprecedented event.\n\n\"Of course, it's an additional challenge,\" he said. \"We train frequently on the Seine and I know that it's going to be very, very nice. If you have the chance to be on a boat, on the Seine, it's quite tremendous, seeing all the buildings. The people will be able to see athletes in a way they've never experienced.\"\n\nThe Olympics come to Paris almost nine years after coordinated terrorist attacks cost the lives of 130 people in the deadliest attack ever in peacetime France.\n\nThere have been about 50 terrorist attacks stopped by intelligence services since 2017, officials said.\n\nOf the 45,000 law enforcement agents who will be on duty Friday, there will be 650 members of elite tactical units, snipers and hostage specialists. There'll also be 22,000 private security contractors working during the opening ceremony Friday, officials said.\n\nTo enter any part of the control zone, whether its blocks away from an Olympic event venue or the Seine River, getting through checkpoints can take 20 to 30 minutes depending on traffic and time of day. Police check everyone's credentials and match them with an ID.\n\nOver 12-foot-high wooden planks are blocking off popular tourist sites like the Champs de Mars in front of the Eiffel Tower and the grounds by Les Invalides ahead of the games.\n\nOn Tuesday, there's also a more visible military presence as the \"Vigipirate\" -- the country's counterterrorism unit -- have begun patrolling the streets along with police and the Gendarmerie.\n\nA security perimeter will prevent vehicles and most pedestrians from vast swaths of the city by the Seine, which cuts across Paris. Subway stations and bridges across the river will be closed.\n\nFrench authorities carried out background checks on a million people linked to the Games, including job applicants, volunteers, competitors, coaches and staff, journalists and security contractors, leading to 4,350 identified as potential security threats, officials said.\n\nD'Amico, the retired FBI agent, said he doesn't envy Paris security officials, running the Olympics during this fraught time in world history with nearby wars in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.\n\n\"Everyone is going to look at the Olympics to make a name for themselves and that's why it is one of the biggest targets out there,\" said D'Amico, who now runs a security consulting company in Florida.\n\nSo far, the only known plot against the Olympics was foiled back in May by France's domestic intelligence agency, the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Int\u00e9rieure (DGSI).\n\nA Chechen man was arrested in Saint-Etienne and suspected of planning an attack on the city's soccer stadium during a competition. The Islamic State Khorasan Province group, the Central Asian offshoot of the Islamic State terrorist group, was behind the plot, officials have said.\n\nProtecting air space above the Games will be a top priority and Prime Minister Gabriel Attal visited a military air base Tuesday to inspect anti-drone systems.\n\nAbout six drones are now being intercepted near Olympic sites every day, according to Attal.\n\nA no-fly zone will be enforced up to 93 miles outside the center of Paris on Friday night.\n\n\"Nothing can be allowed to get past us,\" Attal told reporters in V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, southwest of Paris. France's military has prepared to deploy systems that can detect, jam, and intercept drones.\n\nSecurity will be high underwater as well, with 100 mine-clearing divers on duty.\n\n\"We are preparing for something that isn't fully anticipated,\" Riondet said. \"So, we've anticipated thousands of scenarios and that we are ready to take over on a scenario that wasn't expected.\"", "source": {"uri":

Paris after 100 years | News", "body": "Paris 2024, world's biggest sporting event, to begin on July 26 with opening ceremony on River Seine\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics will see the Games return to Paris after a century, with the French capital previously hosting the world's biggest sporting event in 1900 and 1924.\n\nThe 33rd edition of the Summer Olympics will kick off on Friday, with an opening ceremony on the River Seine, and run until Aug. 11.\n\nThe closing ceremony will take place at the Stade de France.\n\nSince 1896, the modern Games have been held every four years aside from 1916, 1940 and 1944, when they were canceled because of World Wars I and II.\n\nAthletes who win will take with them a part of the Eiffel Tower, as the medals feature fragments of iron sourced from the iconic structure.\n\nThe medalists will display an authentic segment of the Eiffel Tower on their chests, as each medal will feature a central piece of iron weighing 18 grams.\n\nThe metal comes from parts of the monument's structure removed during renovation work during the 20th century.\n\n- Candidacy process\n\nOn Sept. 13, 2015, France formally submitted its bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympic Games.\n\nIt was endorsed by Denis Masseglia, then-president of the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF), and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo.\n\nAt the time, Paris, which had set aside a budget of \u20ac6.2 billion ($6.7 billion), for the Games, was considered a more formidable contender in 2015 compared to its competitors.\n\nParis had last hosted the Olympics in 1924 and had bid for the Games in 1992, 2008 and 2012.\n\nAfter Hamburg, Budapest and Rome withdrew their bids, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) urged Los Angeles and Paris to reach a compromise.\n\nThe Committee proposed that Los Angeles host the 2028 Olympic Games and offered $1.8 billion in support for their preparation.\n\nWith Los Angeles accepting this proposal, Paris then agreed to host the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\n- Paris 2024 Olympic mascot\n\nThe Organizing Committee unveiled the designs for the mascots of the Olympic and Paralympic Games on Nov. 14, 2022.\n\nIts name and design were chosen as symbols of freedom and to represent allegorical figures of the French Republic.\n\nThe mascot's eyes were designed to be both mischievous and expressive and were also compared to the cockade of France, the French national ornament.\n\nIts features, attire and gestures reflect the mascot's passion for sports.\n\n- Olympic torch\n\nThe Olympic torch relay, a central tradition of the event, was introduced at the 1936 Berlin Summer Games.\n\nThe Paris 2024 Games torch was designed by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur.\n\nCarried by 10,000 people over thousands of miles, the torch, crafted from metal by steel giant Arcelor Mittal, resembles an oval iron pipe with a rounded center.\n\nUpon its arrival, the torch will have been carried to more than 400 locations, including France's overseas territories, until the opening of the event on July 26.\n\n- Russian, Belarussian athletes to compete as neutrals\n\nAccording to the International Olympic Committee, athletes from Russia and Belarus will compete under neutral status and will not participate in the opening ceremony.\n\nThe flags, emblems and anthems of Russia and Belarus will not be used, and athletes from these countries must adhere to the same anti-doping regulations as all other participants.\n\nNo officials from the governments of either country will be invited or accredited as part of the games.\n\nThe closing ceremony will take place at the Stade de France national stadium on Sunday, Aug. 11.", "source": {"uri": "yenisafak.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yeni \u015eafak"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Paris Olympics endured a chaotic start on Wednesday as men's football kicked off and a huge police operation was put in place for Israel's first appearance at the Games.\n\nTwo days before the opening ceremony, Morocco beat Argentina 2-1 in Saint-Etienne, but only after a late equaliser for the South American side was disallowed and the final minutes were played out in an empty stadium following crowd trouble.\n\nArgentina thought they had escaped with a 2-2 draw when Cristian Medina scored in the 16th minute of added time.\n\nBut as their players celebrated, projectiles including bottles and plastic cups rained down from the stands and several spectators entered the pitch, with the referee promptly blowing the whistle.\n\nThe teams left the playing area, but the referee had not blown for full-time and the outcome of the match was unclear until the sides finally reappeared two hours later to play out three more minutes in a stadium that was by now emptied of spectators.\n\nMedina's goal was eventually disallowed for offside following a review and Morocco celebrated a 2-1 win.\n\nIsrael's footballers later Wednesday take on Mali under the watchful eye of 1,000 police officers, with authorities erecting an \"anti-terrorist perimeter\" and bracing for possible disruption around the stadium.\n\nIsrael's participation in Paris has been a key talking point in the run-up, with calls from the Palestine Olympic Committee and some left-wing French MPs for the country to be excluded over the Gaza war.\n\nA packed Stade de France cheered on Antoine Dupont -- arguably the world's best rugby player and a pin-up of the Paris Games -- but he was unable to lead the hosts to victory in a 12-12 draw with the United States.\n\n\"It's always a lot of emotion when you play with all your supporters so it's important to deal with that and to be better even with the pressure,\" admitted the 27-year-old.\n\nAustralia laid down a marker to France and double champions Fiji with a 21-14 win over Samoa at a packed Stade de France.\n\n- IOC warns Salt Lake -\n\nAs the clock ticks down towards Friday's opening ceremony along the Seine, Olympic chiefs awarded the 2030 Winter Games to the French Alps and the 2034 event to Salt Lake City.\n\nBut in a dramatic twist they warned the US city could be stripped of the Games if American authorities kept up their feud with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\n\nJohn Coates, the chairman of the IOC's legal commission, said the host city contract confirming Salt Lake's right to stage the Olympics had been altered to allow the IOC to strip it of the Games if US authorities did not respect the \"supreme authority\" of WADA.\n\nThe US anti-doping agency (USADA) has been a vocal critic of WADA for much of the past decade and tensions escalated this year after reports in April revealed that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a banned substance ahead of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, but were subsequently cleared to compete at the Games.\n\nUSADA chief Travis Tygart accused Olympic bosses of \"stooping to threats\".\n\n\"Today's demonstration further showed that as it stands today, WADA is just a sport lapdog, and clean athletes have little chance,\" said Tygart.\n\n- Security lockdown -\n\nThe Olympics lost a top star when tennis world number one Jannik Sinner withdrew with tonsillitis with the Italian admitting he was \"sad and disappointed\".\n\nPreparations for Friday's historic opening ceremony were in full swing with an unprecedented security operation for the athletes' parade along the River Seine.\n\nAround 6,000-7,000 athletes are set to sail down a six-kilometre (four-mile) stretch of the river towards the Eiffel Tower, on 85 barges and boats.\n\nUp to 500,000 people are set to watch in person from specially built stands, on the river banks and from the overlooking balconies and apartments.\n\nThe area around the river has been locked down before the ceremony, with snipers positioned along the route and frogmen deployed to prevent a waterborne attack.\n\nThe entertainment line-up for the ceremony, the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium, is yet to be fully announced.\n\nBut videos posted online showing US pop star Lady Gaga in Paris sparked rumours she will be among the performers.\n\nAmerican rapper Snoop Dogg will carry the Olympic flame this Friday as it makes its final rounds before the ceremony.\n\n- Scandals -\n\nIn the first scandal of the Games, a video emerged showing the mistreatment of a horse by one of Britain's most decorated Olympians, dressage specialist Charlotte Dujardin, who has been suspended.\n\nThe film showed the three-time Olympic champion walking alongside a horse and repeatedly whipping the animal while apparently training a young rider.\n\nDujardin, 39, has won six Olympic medals and was aiming to become Britain's most successful female Olympian by winning further medals in Paris.\n\nIn a further scandal, an assistant coach and an analyst with the Canadian women's football team were sent home for their part in spying on rivals.\n\nThe analyst, 43-year-old Joey Lombardi, was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session.\n\nLombardi pleaded guilty when he appeared in court in Saint-Etienne on Wednesday, the court told AFP.\n\nThe assistant coach was Jasmine Mander, to whom Lombardi reported.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

So, with rumours swirling of appearances by Celine Dion and Lady Gaga, plans for boats full of athletes and a huge city-wide after-party, here is everything you need to know about the opening ceremony.\n\nRecommended:\n\nEverything you need to know about the Paris 2024 Olympics\n\nParis 2024 Olympics opening ceremony: start time, date and everything you need to know\n\nHow to get around during the Paris 2024 Olympic Games\n\nParis 2024 Olympics QR Code: how to apply and the zone system explained\n\nThe ceremony will begin at 7.30pm CEST (which is 6.30pm BST, 12.30pm CDT and 10.30pm PDT). The Summer Games will officially be launched at 8.24pm CEST, or 20.24 on a 24-hour clock - pretty clever, eh?\n\nFor the first time ever, the ceremony won't be held in a stadium. Instead, planners have spent months organising a performance on the Seine, with boats for each national delegation. The parade will begin at the Austerlitz Bridge and culminate its 6km-long route in front of the Trocad\u00e9ro.\n\nThe whole shebang has been kept largely under wraps, but that hasn't stopped rumours swirling about who is expected to perform at the opening ceremony. Two of the most exciting anticipated named include none other than Celine Dion and Lady Gaga.\n\nAya Nakamura, the most listened-to French singer worldwide, is also expected to perform at the opening ceremony. Stay tuned for updates on the line-up.\n\nIt will last three and a half hours, from 7.30pm to 11pm CEST. But the night doesn't have to end there - bars across Paris have been granted a special permit to stay open all night to celebrate the launch of the competition. You can read more about that here.\n\nIf you're watching in France, France T\u00e9l\u00e9vision, the national broadcaster, is the channel to hop to. In the UK (and if you've got a TV licence), the BBC is showing Olympics coverage and in the US, NBC is set to air at least nine hours of coverage a day.\n\nThe Olympics also has its own streaming channel for those watching online. Read our full guide on how to watch the Olympics here.\n\nThe tickets were being sold in six categories, A, B, C, D, E+ and E, with prices ranging from \u20ac90-\u20ac2,700.\n\nWant to get your hands on some last-minute tickets? Well, earlier this week we reported that 4,000 tickets are still available for the opening ceremony. Many of those are likely to have sold by now, and while there are still tickets available, they start from an eye-watering \u20ac1,800.

Japan beat 10-man Paraguay 5-0 in Group D.\n\nA packed Stade de France cheered on Antoine Dupont - arguably the world's best rugby player and a pin-up of the Paris Games - but he was unable to lead the hosts to victory in a 12-12 draw with the United States. \"It's always a lot of emotion when you play with all your supporters so it's important to deal with that and to be better even with the pressure,\" admitted the 27-year-old. Australia laid down a marker to France and double champions Fiji with a 21-14 win over Samoa at a packed Stade de France.\n\nAs the clock ticks down towards tomorrow's opening ceremony along the Seine, Olympic chiefs awarded the 2030 Winter Games to the French Alps and the 2034 event to Salt Lake City. But in a dramatic twist they warned the US city could be stripped of the Games if American authorities kept up their feud with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\n\nJohn Coates, the chairman of the IOC's legal commission, said the host city contract confirming Salt Lake's right to stage the Olympics had been altered to allow the IOC to strip it of the Games if US authorities did not respect the \"supreme authority\" of WADA. The US anti-doping agency (USADA) has been a vocal critic of WADA for much of the past decade and tensions escalated this year after reports in April revealed that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a banned substance ahead of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, but were subsequently cleared to compete at the Games.\n\nUSADA chief Travis Tygart accused Olympic bosses of \"stooping to threats\". \"Today's demonstration further showed that as it stands today, WADA is just a sport lapdog, and clean athletes have little chance,\" said Tygart.\n\nThe Olympics lost a top star when tennis world number one Jannik Sinner withdrew with tonsillitis with the Italian admitting he was \"sad and disappointed\".\n\nPreparations for tomorrow's historic opening ceremony were in full swing with an unprecedented security operation for the athletes' parade along the River Seine. Around 6,000-7,000 athletes are set to sail down a six-kilometre (four-mile) stretch of the river towards the Eiffel Tower, on 85 barges and boats.\n\nUp to 500,000 people are set to watch in person from specially built stands, on the river banks and from the overlooking balconies and apartments. The area around the river has been locked down before the ceremony, with snipers positioned along the route and frogmen deployed to prevent a waterborne attack.\n\nThe entertainment line-up for the ceremony, the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium, is yet to be fully announced. But videos posted online showing US pop star Lady Gaga in Paris sparked rumours she will be among the performers. American rapper Snoop Dogg will carry the Olympic flame tomorrow as it makes its final rounds before the ceremony.\n\nIn the first scandal of the Games, a video emerged showing the mistreatment of a horse by one of Britain's most decorated Olympians, dressage specialist Charlotte Dujardin, who has been suspended. The film showed the three-time Olympic champion walking alongside a horse and repeatedly whipping the animal while apparently training a young rider.\n\nDujardin, 39, has won six Olympic medals and was aiming to become Britain's most successful female Olympian by winning further medals in Paris. In a further scandal, an assistant coach and an analyst with the Canadian women's football team were sent home for their part in spying on rivals. The analyst, 43-year-old Joey Lombardi, was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session.\n\nLombardi pleaded guilty when he appeared in court in Saint-Etienne on Wednesday, the court said. The assistant coach was Jasmine Mander, to whom Lombardi reported.", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Anti-Doping Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Pubill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marc Pubill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Princes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parc des Princes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pau,_Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Waine", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Waine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldor_Shomurodov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eldor Shomurodov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebasti\u00e1n_Coates", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sebasti\u00e1n Coates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samoa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Paris Olympics kicks off", "body": "Empty feeling: Morocco's players and staff celebrate at the end of the match with Argentina\n\nThe sporting programme at the Paris Olympics endured a chaotic start on Wednesday as men's football kicked off and a huge police operation was put in place for Israel's first appearance at the Games.\n\nTwo days before the opening ceremony, Morocco beat Argentina 2-1 in Saint-Etienne, but only after a late equaliser for the South American side was disallowed and the final minutes were played out in an empty stadium following crowd trouble.\n\nArgentina thought they had escaped with a 2-2 draw when Cristian Medina scored in the 16th minute of added time.\n\nBut as their players celebrated, projectiles including bottles and plastic cups rained down from the stands and several spectators entered the pitch, with the referee promptly blowing the whistle.\n\nThe teams left the playing area, but the referee had not blown for full-time and the outcome of the match was unclear until the sides finally reappeared two hours later to play out three more minutes in a stadium that was by now emptied of spectators.\n\nMedina's goal was eventually disallowed for offside following a review and Morocco celebrated a 2-1 win.\n\nIsrael's footballers later Wednesday take on Mali under the watchful eye of 1,000 police officers, with authorities erecting an \"anti-terrorist perimeter\" and bracing for possible disruption around the stadium.\n\nIsrael's participation in Paris has been a key talking point in the run-up, with calls from the Palestine Olympic Committee and some left-wing French MPs for the country to be excluded over the Gaza war.\n\nA packed Stade de France cheered on Antoine Dupont -- arguably the world's best rugby player and a pin-up of the Paris Games -- but he was unable to lead the hosts to victory in a 12-12 draw with the United States.\n\n\"It's always a lot of emotion when you play with all your supporters so it's important to deal with that and to be better even with the pressure,\" admitted the 27-year-old.\n\nAustralia laid down a marker to France and double champions Fiji with a 21-14 win over Samoa at a packed Stade de France.\n\n- IOC warns Salt Lake -\n\nAs the clock ticks down towards Friday's opening ceremony along the Seine, Olympic chiefs awarded the 2030 Winter Games to the French Alps and the 2034 event to Salt Lake City.\n\nBut in a dramatic twist they warned the US city could be stripped of the Games if American authorities kept up their feud with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\n\nJohn Coates, the chairman of the IOC's legal commission, said the host city contract confirming Salt Lake's right to stage the Olympics had been altered to allow the IOC to strip it of the Games if US authorities did not respect the \"supreme authority\" of WADA.\n\nThe US anti-doping agency (USADA) has been a vocal critic of WADA for much of the past decade and tensions escalated this year after reports in April revealed that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a banned substance ahead of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, but were subsequently cleared to compete at the Games.\n\nUSADA chief Travis Tygart accused Olympic bosses of \"stooping to threats\".\n\n\"Today's demonstration further showed that as it stands today, WADA is just a sport lapdog, and clean athletes have little chance,\" said Tygart.\n\nMore from this section New lawsuit accuses MTA of cutting bus services Oval Invincibles Vs Birmingham Phoenix - Playing Xis, Head To Head, Venue Details Wife of New York Yankees executive dies after being found unresponsive at home - Security lockdown -\n\nThe Olympics lost a top star when tennis world number one Jannik Sinner withdrew with tonsillitis with the Italian admitting he was \"sad and disappointed\".\n\nPreparations for Friday's historic opening ceremony were in full swing with an unprecedented security operation for the athletes' parade along the River Seine.\n\nAround 6,000-7,000 athletes are set to sail down a six-kilometre (four-mile) stretch of the river towards the Eiffel Tower, on 85 barges and boats.\n\nUp to 500,000 people are set to watch in person from specially built stands, on the river banks and from the overlooking balconies and apartments.\n\nThe area around the river has been locked down before the ceremony, with snipers positioned along the route and frogmen deployed to prevent a waterborne attack.\n\nThe entertainment line-up for the ceremony, the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium, is yet to be fully announced.\n\nBut videos posted online showing US pop star Lady Gaga in Paris sparked rumours she will be among the performers.\n\nAmerican rapper Snoop

This will start the ceremony, not mark the end of it, another break from tradition.\n\nWhat time does the opening ceremony start?\n\nThe ceremony starts at 1:30 p.m. EDT/7:30 p.m. CEST and is expected to last more than three hours.\n\nWhere is the opening ceremony be ing held?\n\nThe parade starts at the Austerlitz Bridge beside the Jardin des Plantes and follows the course of the Seine from east to west. It makes its way around two islands in the center of the city before passing under several bridges and gateways. Athletes aboard the boats will get glimpses of several Olympic venues including La Concorde Urban Park (3X3 basketball, breaking, BMX freestyle cycling, skateboarding), Invalides (archery, athletics -- marathon finish, road cycling -- time trial start) and the Grand Palais (fencing, taekwondo). The parade ends at the Iena Bridge, which links the Eiffel Tower on the left bank of the Seine to the Trocad\u00e9ro district on the right bank. The ceremony's finale is at the Trocad\u00e9ro. There, among other ceremonial procedures, French President Emmanuel Macron will deliver opening remarks.\n\nHow can I watch t he opening ceremony?\n\nThe ceremony will air on NBC and stream on Peacock and NBC Olympic platforms -- NBCOlympics.com, NBC.com, NBC app, NBC Olympics app.\n\nA preview will air on NBC at noon EDT, with live coverage beginning at 1:30 p.m. and an enhanced prime-time encore at 7:30 p.m.\n\nAbout 220,000 invited and security-screened spectators are expected to fill the upper tiers of the Seine's banks, and an additional 104,000 paying spectators will watch from the lower riverside and around the Trocad\u00e9ro plaza.\n\nThose in Paris who could not get tickets will be able to watch the ceremony on 80 giant screens set up throughout the city.\n\nWho is performing at the opening ceremony?\n\nIn addition to the athletes who will participate in the parade, 3,000 dancers, artists and other athletes will be featured in the opening and closing ceremonies. Most of the entertainment acts remain under wraps. NBC News reported that Celine Dion and Lady Gaga have arrived in Paris amid speculation that one or both of the pop singers will perform at the opening ceremony.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocad\u00e9ro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trocad\u00e9ro"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3x3_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "3x3 basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jardin_des_plantes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jardin des plantes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Palais", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Palais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cycle sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Austerlitz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Austerlitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_BMX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle BMX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Invalides", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Les Invalides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concorde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taekwondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skateboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_bicycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Road bicycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Dion", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celine Dion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern Pentathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/25/08/Paris_Olympics_85100.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

most decorated Olympians, dressage specialist Charlotte Dujardin, being ejected from the Paris Games.\n\nThe video showed three-time Olympic champion Dujardin walking alongside a horse and repeatedly whipping the animal while training a young rider.\n\nDujardin, 39, who has won six Olympic medals and was aiming to become Britain's most successful female Olympian by winning further medals in Paris,

Russia, meanwhile -- typically a top contender -- is sending a very small number of athletes to Paris following consequences related to their country's doping and its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHere's what else to know ahead of the Games before the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nClose to 100 boats carrying more than 10,000 athletes and performers will glide down a 3.7-mile stretch of the River Seine during the opening ceremony on July 26. It's the first time in the history of the modern Olympics that's being held outside of a stadium, officials say.\n\nThe open-air event is expected to draw some 300,000 spectators -- most of whom will pay no admission fee to watch the parade from the river's upper embankments.\n\nThe parade will travel east to west, starting at Austerlitz Bridge, and then pass by major landmarks and event venues like the Grand Palais. The parade is set to end at the Pont d'I\u00e9na bridge before a finale show at the Trocad\u00e9ro opposite the Eiffel Tower.\n\nTony Estanguet, president of the Paris Games organizing committee, described the vision for the ceremony when the plan was announced in 2021.\n\n\"The entire city has been turned into a vast Olympic stadium. The Seine represents the track, and the quays the spectators' stands,\" Estanguet said.\n\nThe parade's route also offers a sightseeing tour of some of the temporary sports venues, including an outdoor arena abutting the Eiffel Tower where beach volleyball games will take place.\n\nThere's also the matter of the Seine as a competition venue. In the run-up to the games, a question has plagued officials: Will the Seine be swimmable in time for the Olympics? The sewage-polluted waters have been a hurdle to the city's ambitious goal to hold the swim leg of the triathlon in the famous river where swimming has been historically banned.\n\nRecent testing of the water has turned up unsafe levels of E. coli bacteria caused by fecal matter, but tests earlier this month showed acceptable bacteria levels. In an effort to silence skeptics, last week Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo followed through on her promise to take a dip in the Seine and declared the waters perfectly safe.\n\nFollowing the previous Summer Games' addition of skateboarding and surfing, another sport with counterculture roots will take the Olympics stage for the first time in Paris. Breaking -- best known to the uninitiated as \"break-dancing\" -- is a dance style said to have originated in the 1970s from the streets of New York City's South Bronx and inspired by the break beats and hip-hop tracks played by DJs and MCs. But the athleticism involved in the art form -- head-spins, backflips and other acrobatics -- is undeniable.\n\nBreaking became more mainstream in the 1990s as it entered pop culture and expanded in popularity through international competition. And in 2016, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) added breaking to the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires.\n\nAlthough it's an American export, other countries including Japan, Canada and The Netherlands boast talent that's been known to surpass the U.S. competitively.\n\nIn Paris, 16 b-boys (male breakers) and 16 b-girls will go head to head in separate battles at Place de la Concorde, an outdoor public square. The women's competition is set for Aug. 9 and men's is on Aug. 10. On Team USA, look out for medal contenders Victor Montalvo and Grace \"Sunny\" Choi.\n\nThe same U.S. women's gymnastics team that took home a silver medal at the Tokyo Games all-around final in 2021 is hoping to rewrite their Olympic ending in Paris.\n\nThree years ago, Biles, who at 27 is the most decorated gymnast of all time, came down with a case of the \"twisties,\" a debilitating psychological affliction that forced her to pull out of several events to focus on her mental health. In her place, Suni Lee had emerged as the unlikely champion, and went on to earn a gold medal in the individual all-around competition in Tokyo.\n\nJoining Biles and Lee are Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey, and 16-year-old newcomer Hezly Rivera.\n\nNow, with Biles in top form and the team united in its goal of \"redemption,\" the women's squad is the favorite to win gold. And especially so, given that Russia, the defending gold medalist, won't be there. The IOC plans to allow only some Russian athletes to compete as \"individual neutral athletes\" under strict conditions it set in response to Russia's war in Ukraine. The country's absence also improves the men's chances of medaling in a sport normally dominated by Russia, China and Japan.\n\nEntering her fourth Olympics, Katie Ledecky continues to dominate the 800- and 1,500-meter freestyle events, in both of which she still holds the world records. Seven of her Olympic medals are gold, putting her just two wins away from earning the most Olympic gold medals of any female athlete in history. Younger swimmers have Ledecky beat in the 400-meter freestyle: Australia's Ariarne Titmus (who took gold in Tokyo and also reigns in the 200-meter event) and Canada's Summer McIntosh have each knocked down Ledecky's world record, which Titmus currently holds. The Titmus-McIntosh-Ledecky 400-meter race should make for a thrilling watch.\n\nIn men's swimming, the U.S. is looking for a superstar and hoping that Caeleb Dressel is it. The 27-year-old won five gold medals in Tokyo -- joining an elite few of swimmers that have won that many in a single Games, including Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz. After taking an eight-month break from the sport, Dressel showed at the Olympic trials last month that he's still fast in sprints.\n\nHeading into Paris, however, the two fastest swimmers in the world are not from the usual rival powerhouses (Australia and the U.S.) but from Canada -- McIntosh on the women's -- and France -- L\u00e9on Marchand.\n\nA doping scandal sparked international outrage after it was revealed in April that 32 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug ahead of the Tokyo Games in 2021 but were cleared to compete. The drug in question -- called trimetazidine or TMZ -- is the same one found in a sample from Kamila Valieva, the Russian figure skater who was subsequently slapped with a four-year ban from international competition.\n\nChinese officials say an unintentional contamination led to the positive tests. The World Anti-Doping Agency accepted that explanation after its investigation and said that international doping rules don't require them to ban the athletes.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into the case involving the swimmers. Meanwhile, China is expected to send 11 of the 32 swimmers who had the performance drug in their system in 2021 to compete in Paris.\n\nThe agency's handling of the positive tests has sowed doubt deeper among critics who question whether the regulatory body responsible for curbing cheating holds some countries to a lower standard than others.\n\nThe 100-meter sprint, the most popular track event, has shaped up to be a familiar two-nation race. Representing Jamaica in the women's race is Shericka Jackson, whose biggest challenge is American Sha'Carri Richardson. But don't overlook Jamaican sprint queen Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who will race in her fifth and final Olympics 16 years after becoming the first Caribbean woman to win the 100-meter gold. They are chasing Florence Griffith Joyner's record set in 1988.\n\nIn the 200-meter, there's a real chance we could see the fall of Flo-Jo's world record set that same year when she ran 21.34 seconds. Jackson will go head-to-head with teammate Elaine Thompson-Herah and Gabby Thomas of Team USA.\n\nIn the men's 100-meter race, Noah Lyles on Team USA will face Jamaica's Oblique Seville and Kishane Thompson, each aiming to break the world record time set by eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt. Still, the field is brimming with talent that clouds podium predictions. Other top contenders include reigning Olympic champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and a former world champion American Fred Kerley.\n\nLyles also racing in the 200-meter -- his better event -- a race that won't be as wide open as the 100. He's the favorite, ahead of Tebogo, a notable exception to the rivalry who won the men's race last week at an international meet in Monaco.\n\nSoccer starts before the Games officially kick off with the opening ceremony. The U.S. women's national team is aiming to upgrade their bronze medal from Tokyo. The four-time gold medalists haven't taken first on the podium since the 2012 Games in London. Since the retirement of major stars -- Megan Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd, Julie Ertz, Sam Mewis -- has made way for a younger team, which will be led by new head coach Emma Hayes, former manager of the women's Chelsea Football Club. World Cup champion Spain is the favorite to take gold.\n\nThe last time the U.S. sent a men's soccer team to the Olympics was in 2008, and they haven't medaled since 1904. Since the rule to restrict the competition to players under 23 went into effect in 1992, the men's team has advanced to the knockout stage only once.\n\nThe men kick off their tournament on Wednesday in a game against host country France, a favorite to win it all. The women's squad plays Zambia on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "bpr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "bpr.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Of course, you cannot annihilate the risk.\n\n\"There will always be one. But the idea is not to accept defeat against terrorism by abandoning this magnificent setting.\"\n\nAround 1,000 officers will be on duty to protect Israel's football match against Mali, meanwhile, where protests are expected, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said.\n\nGarda\u00ed assisting in security operation\n\nAnd it is not just French security personnel who will be on patrol in Paris over the coming weeks.\n\nA total of 56 garda officers will also be deployed to France for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nGarda inspector Neil Casley said garda\u00ed will also assist in policing in some tourist areas following a request received from French authorities and subsquent Government approval.\n\nLatest stories from Paris 2024\n\nHe told RT\u00c9's Morning Ireland: \"Garda officers in Paris will be partaking in joint patrols with French police and will be available to assist Irish nationals or other English-speaking nationals attending Olympic events.\n\n\"Specifically, there will be three types of missions that may be assigned to garda officers.\n\n\"These are assuring public security, assisting to welcome visitors and facilitate engagement with local host authorities, and ensuring transport security in train stations and metro stations near Olympic venues.\"\n\nMr Casley said garda members will be based around all central locations in Paris.\n\n\"We'll have teams in the ninth district, 11th district, 15th district and also up in the Stade de France stadium,\" he added.\n\nAdditional reporting AFP", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news",

Over 17 days, a total of 10,500 athletes will vie for medals in these events.\n\nAthletes who win will take with them a part of the Eiffel Tower, as the medals feature fragments of iron sourced from the iconic structure.\n\nThe medalists will display an authentic segment of the Eiffel Tower on their chests, as each medal will feature a central piece of iron weighing 18 grams.\n\nThe metal comes from parts of the monument's structure removed during renovation work during the 20th century.\n\nCandidacy process\n\nOn Sept. 13, 2015, France formally submitted its bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympic Games.\n\nThe letter outlining the application highlighted that \"the Olympic spirit and the Parisian identity are defined by unity in diversity, tolerance of differences, and a collective commitment to peace.\"\n\nIt was endorsed by Denis Masseglia, then-president of the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF), and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo.\n\nAt the time, Paris, which had set aside a budget of \u20ac6.2 billion ($6.7 billion), for the Games, was considered a more formidable contender in 2015 compared to its competitors.\n\nParis had last hosted the Olympics in 1924 and had bid for the Games in 1992, 2008 and 2012.\n\nAlongside the French capital, other cities that declared their candidacy for the 2024 Summer Games included Los Angeles, Hamburg, Budapest and Rome. They announced their bids at various times throughout 2014 and 2015.\n\nAfter Hamburg, Budapest and Rome withdrew their bids, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) urged Los Angeles and Paris to reach a compromise.\n\nThe Committee proposed that Los Angeles host the 2028 Olympic Games and offered $1.8 billion in support for their preparation.\n\nWith Los Angeles accepting this proposal, Paris then agreed to host the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nParis 2024 Olympic mascot\n\nThe Organizing Committee unveiled the designs for the mascots of the Olympic and Paralympic Games on Nov. 14, 2022.\n\nNamed Olympic Phryge, the Paris 2024 mascot is based on the traditional small Phrygian hats that the mascots are shaped after.\n\nIts name and design were chosen as symbols of freedom and to represent allegorical figures of the French Republic.\n\nThe mascot's eyes were designed to be both mischievous and expressive and were also compared to the cockade of France, the French national ornament.\n\nIts features, attire and gestures reflect the mascot's passion for sports.\n\nOlympic torch\n\nThe Olympic torch relay, a central tradition of the event, was introduced at the 1936 Berlin Summer Games.\n\nThe Paris 2024 Games torch was designed by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur.\n\nUnlike traditional designs, this year's Games feature a torch with a unique structure, composed of 10 distinct parts.\n\nCarried by 10,000 people over thousands of miles, the torch, crafted from metal by steel giant Arcelor Mittal, resembles an oval iron pipe with a rounded center.\n\nUpon its arrival, the torch will have been carried to more than 400 locations, including France's overseas territories, until the opening of the event on July 26.\n\nRussian, Belarussian athletes to compete as neutrals\n\nAccording to the International Olympic Committee, athletes from Russia and Belarus will compete under neutral status and will not participate in the opening ceremony.\n\nThe flags, emblems and anthems of Russia and Belarus will not be used, and athletes from these countries must adhere to the same anti-doping regulations as all other participants.\n\nNo officials from the governments of either country will be invited or accredited as part of the games.\n\nThe closing ceremony will take place at the Stade de France national stadium on Sunday, Aug. 11.", "source": {"uri":

See the 2024 Paris Games schedule.", "body": "The 2024 Paris Olympics are set to kick off soon, with a schedule full of sporting events. Here's everything you need to know about when this summer's Olympics will start and end.\n\nThe Olympics will officially open in Paris on the night of Friday, July 26 and continue through Sunday, Aug. 11, although some team events started on July 24. The July 26 opening ceremony will be held on the Seine river, which flows though Paris. The closing ceremony, which includes a parade of flags and athletes, will take place on Aug. 11.\n\nThe opening ceremony for the 2024 Summer Olympics will be unique. According to organizers, the July 26 event will be the first Olympic opening ceremony held outside of a stadium. The Tokyo opening ceremony was held in a largely empty stadium because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn Paris, athletes will parade in boats down the Seine river. The flotilla will begin at 7:30 p.m. local time, which is 1:30 p.m. Eastern in the U.S. and 10:30 a.m. on the West Coast.\n\nAn estimated 94 boats will travel along the almost four-mile route as part of the ceremony, with delegations and performers joining athletes on the Seine, according to organizers. Around 10,500 athletes representing 206 National Olympic Committees are taking part in the Games.\n\nAround 120 heads of state, royals and other leaders will also attend the opening ceremony.\n\nThe closing ceremony for the 2024 Summer Olympics will be on Sunday, Aug. 11, beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern in the Stade de France. It will feature a parade of flags, a parade of athletes and victory ceremonies, among other events. The ceremony in Tokyo lasted for about three hours.\n\nArtistic gymnastics events are scheduled for July 27 to Aug. 1, and then again from Aug. 3-5. Rhythmic gymnastics events, a female-only event, are scheduled for Aug. 8-10. Artistic and rhythmic gymnastics test different skills and use different equipment.\n\nAll trampoline gymnastics events are scheduled for Aug. 2, the day starts with the women's qualifications, followed by the women's final. Then comes the men's qualifications and the men's final later on Aug. 2.\n\nWomen's artistic gymnastics, featuring athletes including U.S. start Simone Biles, involves four core events: beam, vault, uneven bars and floor exercise. Men's artistic gymnastics features eight events across six pieces of equipment: rings, vault, pommel horse, horizontal bar, parallel bars and floor exercise. There are two additional events to test the overall skill of the male gymnasts.\n\nThere are two categories of competition in Olympic rhythmic gymnastics, individual all-around women and group all-around women. It showcases skill, flexibility and musicality using balls, hoops, clubs and ribbons.\n\nSome who go to check the Olympics schedule for soccer may be confused: The sport is listed under football, as it is known in most of the world.\n\nThe events started before the official opening ceremony on July 26 because of the number of matches in the tournament. Matches are scheduled for most days during the Games, with the full listings and results available online.\n\nCompetition actually began two days before the opening ceremony, on July 24, with preliminary rounds in archery, soccer, handball and rugby. The swimming events will run during the first week of the Games from July 27 through Aug. 4, with track and field events taking place from July 1 to Aug. 11.\n\nThe marathon is traditionally the last athletic event.\n\nWhile a full schedule is available online, the Paris Games organizers note that it is subject to change.\n\nThere will be both live and tape-delayed coverage of the Olympics airing on TV. At least nine hours of coverage will be broadcast each day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET on NBC and Telemundo. Some events will air on the USA Network, Golf Channel, CNBC and E!.\n\nPeacock will livestream events from the 2024 Olympics, including the opening and closing ceremonies and every Olympic basketball game.\n\nAliza Chasan\n\nAliza Chasan is a Digital Content Producer for \"60 Minutes\" and CBSNews.com.

Here are some theories", "body": "Paris is abuzz with thousands of athletes and spectators arriving for the 2024 Olympic Games -- but it isn't just the arrival of sporting superstars to the city that is generating excitement.\n\nSpeculation is rife on which artists will take to the stage during the opening ceremony on July 27.\n\nMost notably, divas Lady Gaga and Celine Dion have both been spotted in Paris, with fans theorising on social media they might be there to perform in the Olympic opener.\n\nArtistic director for the opening ceremony Thomas Jolly has ben tight-lipped about the line-up, only telling Associated Press that \"it will be very meaningful for the artists that will perform\".\n\nWe might not know until the ceremony kicks off, with acts usually kept secret.\n\nHere are some of the performers punters suspect (or hope) may take to the stage.\n\nAccording to US Magazine Variety, The French-Candian singer has been spotted staying near the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\n\nWhile she gets points for being a famous French (Canadian) speaker, given her recent health struggles, it's unlikely she could perform.\n\nIn 2022, the singer revealed her diagnosis of Stiff Person Syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease that causes muscles to stiffen and spasm.\n\nIt wouldn't be her first time on the Olympic stage -- the singer performed at the opening ceremony in Atlanta in 1996.\n\nThe singer has said she may never perform again due to her illness despite really wanting to.\n\nBut who knows, perhaps this could be her stunning return.\n\nIf not, our hearts will learn to go on.\n\nIf anyone could add to the theatrics of an Olympic opening ceremony taking place on the Seine, it would be Lady Gaga.\n\nShe isn't French, but the pop star was spotted in town this week.\n\nFans on the internet have been speculating since the Olympic Committee shared a video teasing a mystery performer seen wearing a chrome bodysuit, wrapped in an Olympic flag.\n\nThey believe it's reminiscent of her Chromatica album era.\n\nFor particularly eagle-eyed (or delusional) internet sleuths, the mere sight of a piano near where the ceremony will take place has been enough to send them into a frenzy.\n\nIf you need convincing she is up to the job, read up on her show-stopping performance at the 2017 Superbowl half-time show.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time a US singer has popped up in a Olympic ceremony they aren't local to.\n\nBut Gaga is booked and busy enough.\n\nThe trailer to her new film Joker: Folie a Deux has just dropped and she's busy recording her seventh album.\n\nShe could very well be in Paris to promote her new film.\n\nIt's also possible that she's just rich and famous and enjoying a European summer like every other celebrity at the moment.\n\nNow onto an actual French choice.\n\nEarlier this year, President Emmanuel Macron threw his support behind French-Malian R&B star Aya Nakamura as a choice for the opening ceremony.\n\nShe is currently the most-listened to French-speaking singer in the world.\n\nBut Nakamura hasn't confirmed the rumour.\n\nThe BBC is reporting she would sing a song in the Chanson style by iconic French singer Edith Piaf.\n\nThe speculation has sparked a row on identity and language among the French.\n\nAn award-winning artist, Nakamura immigrated to France as a child.\n\nThe suggestion she would open the Olympics led to backlash by far-right politicians suggesting she wasn't French enough to perform and criticising her pronunciation of French words.\n\nThis triggered an investigation by the Paris prosecutor into alleged racist abuse against the artist brought forward by anti-racism advocacy group LICRA.\n\nIn April, Mr Macron said \"she speaks to a good number of our fellow citizens and I think she is absolutely in her rightful place in an opening or closing ceremony\", according to The Guardian.\n\nFrench singer-songwriter Christine and the Queens has also been floated as a possibility due to his links to the Games.\n\nLast year, he played at an event promoting the Olympic Games, performing his song Full of Life.\n\nSorry, but hopes for the French electronic music duo to reunite for the opening ceremony have already been dashed.\n\nSpeculation began to surface after an interview with the director of the opening ceremony Thomas Jolly in a French publication who alluded to Daft Punk playing in the ceremony.\n\nHowever, following the publication of the interview, Jolly posted an update on X that the group declined to play.\n\n\"My comments were confusing and generated a lot of expectations,\" he wrote.\n\n\"After discussing a possible presence at the ceremony, the group's decision is not to participate.\"\n\nSpeaking of French DJs, David Guetta has expressed his disappointment about not being asked to perform.\n\nChalking up more than 10 million album sales and 14 billion streams globally was not enough for the producer to secure a spot at the ceremony.\n\n\"I am still between the fourth and 15th most listened to artist in the world,\" he said.\n\nThis is the first time in Olympic history the opening ceremony will be performed outside of the stadium.\n\nAround 6,000 to 7,000 athletes are set to sail down the river Seine on 85 barges and boats, with around 3,000 dancers, singers and entertainers positioned on the banks, bridges and nearby monuments.\n\nUp to 500,000 people set to watch in person from stands, on the river banks and the overlooking apartments.\n\nHere's a look at the concept art of the opening ceremony parade:\n\nJolly said the main theme would be \"love\" and the performances would celebrate diversity.\n\n\"We are a city of love, and also because in the world there are a lot of fractures,\" he explained.\n\n\"We want to say, we are all living together in the same city, the same country, the same continents and the same planet.\"\n\nJolly's plans have been criticised by some conservatives in France, but he said his work would be a celebration of cultural, linguistic, religious and sexual diversity.\n\nAnd in Adelaide, Hobart, Canberra, Darwin, Gold Coast and regional markets across the country, listeners can hear live daily Olympics coverage across ABC Radio and DAB+.\n\nThe ABC coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games is brought to you in conjunction with the Nine Network.\n\nVery early on Saturday morning.\n\nThe ceremony is scheduled to start 8.24pm in Paris on July 26, which, for Australia, actually falls on the following day -- Saturday, July 27.", "source": {"uri":

Sand-covered beach volleyball courts are going up in front of the Eiffel Tower. Archers will loose arrows on the grassy esplanade by the Invalides, a 17th-century military complex that houses Napoleon's tomb.\n\nFrance's plan to conduct the Games at locales around the city is intended to demonstrate that Western democracies, for all their tumult, can host a monumental event that is accessible to the public. The security challenge is as immense as the scale of the quadrennial contest that is expected to draw around 10,500 athletes from more than 190 nations, along with 100 or so world leaders.\n\nAuthorities are preparing for potential attacks by Islamist militants, as well as state-sponsored sabotage originating in Russia or Iran, French officials said. Wars in Ukraine and Gaza have magnified those threats, according to Western officials and security experts.\n\n\"The idea is really to have events in the heart of the city, to allow access for as many people as possible,\" said Nicolas Nordman, security adviser to the mayor of Paris. \"That means the security challenges are clearly more significant than doing this in a stadium.\"\n\nFrance is mobilizing nearly three times as many security personnel as the number deployed for the London Olympics, the last one held in Europe.\n\nAmerican police departments for the first time are lending a hand to an overseas Olympics host, including officers from New York, Los Angeles and Fairfax County, according to U.S. diplomatic security service officials who coordinated the arrangements with France. The U.S. also is sending bomb-sniffing dogs at the request of France.\n\nThe thorniest security challenge will be protecting the opening ceremony on Friday, expected to be the most-attended Olympics kickoff in modern history. A 4-mile parade of boats on the Seine will carry the Olympic athletes, who in past Games traditionally marched through more easily protected stadiums. Authorities estimate the ceremony will draw 300,000 spectators.\n\n\"The security measures and the resources deployed for the Games' opening ceremony are unprecedented,\" said Bruno Le Ray, a retired general who is in charge of Olympics security for the Paris 2024 organizing committee.\n\nThe banks of the Seine were sealed off to the public a week ahead of the ceremony. During the event, police will be stationed every 6 feet or so along the river, said Lo\u00efc Walder, a spokesman for UNSA, one of France's largest police unions. Authorities are clearing homeless encampments that dot the river banks and moving people into temporary housing.\n\nThe French military will close off surrounding airspace during the opening ceremony and deploy anti-drone squads throughout the Games.\n\nThe government also is unspooling a massive dragnet to shield the Games from potential terrorists and saboteurs. Police have sent administrative orders forbidding people deemed a security risk from coming near Olympics events, interior ministry officials said. They are conducting more than one million background checks of people living around and working in restricted areas related to the Games.\n\nFrench security services face the challenge of keeping tabs on thousands of suspected Islamist extremists and people who have been convicted of terror offenses since the deadly attacks in the country by Islamist militants in 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe Paris Games happen to coincide with one of France's biggest political crises in decades. Snap elections called by President Emmanuel Macron have left France with a fractured parliament. His government resigned July 16, remaining only as a caretaker until a new one is formed.\n\nThe potential for unruly mass demonstrations over the elections adds to the pressure on French police charged with securing the Paris Games. Unions have called for protests to pressure Macron to allow a leftist coalition to form a new government after it won the largest number of seats in parliamentary elections this month.\n\n\"We must be careful that our people don't arrive at the Olympic Games exhausted or injured,\" said Walder, the police union spokesman.\n\nA 40-year-old software developer, his wife and three children were asleep in their Paris apartment last month when a squad of French police broke down his door. They handcuffed the man and ordered him to reveal the passwords to his computer and phone.\n\nThe man had served 10 months in prison for spreading Islamic State propaganda on social media in 2015 and 2016, and he was released from parole in 2022. Police said they were investigating whether he was a threat to the Games.\n\nAuthorities spent two hours searching his apartment and found no incriminating evidence, according to the man and his lawyer. Days later, the man received a notice from the Interior Ministry forbidding him from visiting any sites of the Games. The ministry ordered him to check in with his local police station every morning at 8 a.m. for the next three months, according to a copy of the order reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"I haven't had any contact with radicalized people. I kept away from all of that,\" the man said.\n\n\"All of my old clients are calling me,\" said the man's lawyer, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Morant, including more than 10 people seeking to challenge the administrative orders in court. \"I can understand the Interior Ministry wants to secure the games. But when they take measures that restrict freedom so much -- this, I understand less.\"\n\nInterior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said 155 people were subject of such orders, and 164 \"home visits\" were conducted before the Games.\n\nThe government is using the Paris Olympics to test new security technology, including algorithmic video surveillance. Computer programs analyze live video streaming from cameras throughout the country and alert police to fires, dangerous crowd movements, a person with a weapon and other potential threats. Video cameras nationwide connect to a command center overseen by the Interior Ministry.\n\nOfficials said defending against a cyberattack was a priority because event tickets will all be electronic. Hackers targeted the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, shutting down computer systems at the stadium and frustrating people trying to retrieve their e-tickets.\n\nRussia is the main concern, officials and security experts said. Macron has pushed Western allies to station military personnel inside Ukraine, crossing a red line drawn by the U.S. and some in Europe to avoid directly confronting Moscow.\n\n\"They're going to try and disrupt the Games,\" said Dale Buckner, chief executive of Global Guardian, which is providing security at the Olympics for corporate delegations and affluent families. \"The objective is to embarrass the French government and put a stain on the Games.\"\n\nFrench authorities said Tuesday they arrested and charged a 40-year-old Russian man with planning an operation to sow disorder at the Olympics.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee announced Paris was a candidate city in September 2015. Two months later, Islamic State militants killed more than 130 people in coordinated attacks across the Paris region. The following year, an Islamist radical drove a truck through a packed boardwalk in Nice on Bastille Day, killing 86 people.\n\nThe truck attack showed how an unarmed extremist could produce mass casualties. French authorities canceled dozens of events around the country for the rest of the summer, concluding that security forces didn't have the resources to protect against such threats.\n\nDespite the security challenge, officials saw hosting the Games as a way for France to bounce back.\n\nIn May 2017, two days after Macron was sworn in, he hosted inspectors from the Olympic Committee at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to make the case for Paris.\n\nEarly on, French officials said the Paris Games would help the development of France's blighted suburbs. The Olympic Village and the media center were built in Seine-Saint-Denis, one of the country's poorest districts. The site will eventually be converted into commercial offices and housing, some of it subsidized. The new aquatics center will serve local residents.\n\nThe idea to hold the opening ceremony on the Seine came from Tony Estanguet, the former Olympic canoeist in charge of the Paris 2024 organizing committee. He gave his pitch to Macron during a meeting in 2020.\n\n\"At the very beginning, it seemed to be a crazy and not very serious idea,\" Macron said Monday. \"But we decided it was the right moment to deliver this crazy idea and make it real.\"\n\nThe Interior Ministry first needed to make sure that the plan for the ceremony could be carried out safely, Le Ray said.\n\nAt first, the Paris 2024 organizing committee hoped to welcome as many as 600,000 spectators for the opening ceremony. They cut that number in half, largely for security reasons.\n\nMore than 100,000 people are expected to watch from ticketed seats on the lower banks of the Seine, closer to the spectacle. Ticket prices for the most plum riverbank spots near the Eiffel Tower, Place de la Concorde and the Louvre are selling for as much as \u20ac2,700, just under $3,000. The city has been sending free tickets to Paris residents for the river's upper banks.\n\nLuxury conglomerate LVMH, controlled by French billionaire Bernard Arnault -- among the world's wealthiest individuals -- is hosting an opening ceremony party at its Cheval Blanc hotel, overlooking the Seine.\n\nDuring the Games, the Seine will host open-water swimming, the triathlon and other events. France spent $1.5 billion to limit sewage runoff, opening the river to swimming for the first time in a century. The government built a massive underground tank to store a mix of sewage and rainwater that for decades flowed into the Seine after a heavy rainfall.\n\nFrench politicians have taken a dip in the river as a show of confidence, despite test results showing bacteria levels in the famed waters still exceed safety thresholds on some days.\n\n\"It's great,\" said Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo after her plunge in front of journalists and onlookers. \"Not only can we welcome the games but also swim in the Seine in the years to come.\"\n\nWrite to Matthew Dalton at Matthew.Dalton@wsj.com and Noemie

They promise to be unusual thanks to the exemplary commitment to sustainability and decarbonization on the part of the organizers, but what will be unusual is also the opening ceremony.\n\nThis will be the first time in Olympic history that the opening ceremony will be held outside of a stadium and out in the actual hosting city. This outdoor concept makes Paris 2024 the largest opening ceremony in terms of audience and geographical coverage. The event will start at 19:30 (CET) and is expected to last for three hours!\n\nThe aim of this unusual idea, which has been causing some headaches with Paris residents in recent days due to the closing of streets and change in traffic, is actually to bring the Games and the Olympic Spirit closer to the people by trying to include as many of them as possible as first-hand spectators.\n\nAccording to the organizers, some 600,000 people will be able to enjoy the opening ceremony in person, which is unprecedented. There were 222,000 free tickets available to watch the floating parade (consisting of 100 boats with all the countries' teams) from the upper banks of the Seine, in addition to 104,000 paid tickets on the lower quays. This marks the first Opening Ceremony where most spectators will not pay an admission fee - another historic milestone for Paris 2024.\n\nStill, Paris is a large metropolis and even living in it may not be enough to observe the festivities first-hand, which is why, the city authorities have also made sure to install 80 giant screens throughout the French capital so that residents can leave their homes and get to watch the event live in the company of their neighbours. That is sure to create festive local nodes as well.\n\nWhat's more, every arondissement in Paris will have its own fan zone, a concept that's become popular in recent years during football events, such as the World Cup and Euro Cup. Here's a list of all the fan zones in Paris:\n\nThat means that if you're in Paris, you'll never be too far away from an opportunity to join a public festivity and collective viewing of the grand spectacle.\n\nActually, all in all, nearly 200 free celebration sites will be open to the general public throughout France. But\n\nWe can't compile a listing for every city or country that may organize a fan zone and public viewing but here are some places in Europe where you can catch up with the opening ceremony in the company of other sports enthusiasts.\n\nBerlin is inviting residents and guests of the city to come gather at Cassiopeia Sommergarten for the opening ceremony of the Games. People in Luxembourg City can head to Place de la Constitution and those who happen to be in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia can dive into the Olympic Spirit with fellow viewers at the Toplocentrala cultural centre in Southern Park.\n\nWhat if your city has not organized a public viewing though?

Getting the Paris Games to a violent and chaotic start, Morocco fans rushed the field after Argentina netted a late goal in the 16th minute of added time.

There is historical reason behind games like football getting underway in the lead-up to the opening ceremony. Benjamin Ceugnart, who is the Competitions Calendar Project Manager for Paris 2024, has stated that the aforementioned sport gets an early start to make sure players have enough recovery period during the tournament. Since the Barcelona 1992 Games, football has started before the opening ceremony.\n\nArchery is India's first event at the ongoing edition of the Paris Olympic Games. The venue, Invalides, is located next to the river Seine, where the opening ceremony will be conducted. The opening ceremony in Paris is taking place on the river Seine - in the centre of the city and not at a stadium.\n\nRugby sevens and handball started for the first time before the opening day of the Summer Games. According to Ceugnart, this decision was made to make the competitions' organisation more fluid. Rugby sevens and handball will share match venues with athletics and weightlifting in Paris.\n\nALSO READ: Paris Olympics 2024 Live Updates: Deepika Kumari leads charge for India in women's archery\n\n\"Handball starts on D-1, for the women, because it will take place in a shared competition venue during the pools organised at the South Paris Arena 6, Benjamin said. \"It's exactly the same concept for rugby sevens.

Michel Euler/AP hide caption\n\nAfter COVID-19 pandemic restrictions kept spectators away for the last two Olympic Games (in Beijing and Tokyo), the French capital has prepared to welcome back crowds with a splash: the public will be treated to a unique opening ceremony on the iconic River Seine.\n\nThe outdoor ceremony -- set to be the largest one yet, measured by audience and geographical sprawl -- kicks off 16 days of sporting events held across the city and beyond.\n\nOutside of Paris, the historic Palace of Versailles will host equestrian events, while surfing will take place some 10,000 miles away in Teahupo'o, Tahiti.\n\nContinuing its streak of domination at the Summer Games, the United States is expected to collect the most medals in Paris, followed by China, Great Britain, France and then Australia. Russia, meanwhile -- typically a top contender -- is sending a very small number of athletes to Paris following consequences related to their country's doping and its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHere's what else to know ahead of the Games before the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nClose to 100 boats carrying more than 10,000 athletes and performers will glide down a 3.7-mile stretch of the River Seine during the opening ceremony on July 26. It's the first time in the history of the modern Olympics that's being held outside of a stadium, officials say.\n\nThe open-air event is expected to draw some 300,000 spectators -- most of whom will pay no admission fee to watch the parade from the river's upper embankments.\n\nThe parade will travel east to west, starting at Austerlitz Bridge, and then pass by major landmarks and event venues like the Grand Palais. The parade is set to end at the Pont d'I\u00e9na bridge before a finale show at the Trocad\u00e9ro opposite the Eiffel Tower.\n\nTony Estanguet, president of the Paris Games organizing committee, described the vision for the ceremony when the plan was announced in 2021.\n\n\"The entire city has been turned into a vast Olympic stadium. The Seine represents the track, and the quays the spectators' stands,\" Estanguet said.\n\nThe parade's route also offers a sightseeing tour of some of the temporary sports venues, including an outdoor arena abutting the Eiffel Tower where beach volleyball games will take place.\n\nThere's also the matter of the Seine as a competition venue. In the run-up to the games, a question has plagued officials: Will the Seine be swimmable in time for the Olympics? The sewage-polluted waters have been a hurdle to the city's ambitious goal to hold the swim leg of the triathlon in the famous river where swimming has been historically banned.\n\nRecent testing of the water has turned up unsafe levels of E. coli bacteria caused by fecal matter, but tests earlier this month showed acceptable bacteria levels. In an effort to silence skeptics, last week Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo followed through on her promise to take a dip in the Seine and declared the waters perfectly safe.\n\nFollowing the previous Summer Games' addition of skateboarding and surfing, another sport with counterculture roots will take the Olympics stage for the first time in Paris. Breaking -- best known to the uninitiated as \"break-dancing\" -- is a dance style said to have originated in the 1970s from the streets of New York City's South Bronx and inspired by the break beats and hip-hop tracks played by DJs and MCs. But the athleticism involved in the art form -- head-spins, backflips and other acrobatics -- is undeniable.\n\nBreaking became more mainstream in the 1990s as it entered pop culture and expanded in popularity through international competition. And in 2016, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) added breaking to the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires.\n\nAlthough it's an American export, other countries including Japan, Canada and The Netherlands boast talent that's been known to surpass the U.S. competitively.\n\nIn Paris, 16 b-boys (male breakers) and 16 b-girls will go head to head in separate battles at Place de la Concorde, an outdoor public square. The women's competition is set for Aug. 9 and men's is on Aug. 10. On Team USA, look out for medal contenders Victor Montalvo and Grace \"Sunny\" Choi.\n\nThe same U.S. women's gymnastics team that took home a silver medal at the Tokyo Games all-around final in 2021 is hoping to rewrite their Olympic ending in Paris.\n\nThree years ago, Biles, who at 27 is the most decorated gymnast of all time, came down with a case of the \"twisties,\" a debilitating psychological affliction that forced her to pull out of several events to focus on her mental health. In her place, Suni Lee had emerged as the unlikely champion, and went on to earn a gold medal in the individual all-around competition in Tokyo.\n\nJoining Biles and Lee are Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey, and 16-year-old newcomer Hezly Rivera.\n\nNow, with Biles in top form and the team united in its goal of \"redemption,\" the women's squad is the favorite to win gold. And especially so, given that Russia, the defending gold medalist, won't be there. The IOC plans to allow only some Russian athletes to compete as \"individual neutral athletes\" under strict conditions it set in response to Russia's war in Ukraine. The country's absence also improves the men's chances of medaling in a sport normally dominated by Russia, China and Japan.\n\nEntering her fourth Olympics, Katie Ledecky continues to dominate the 800- and 1,500-meter freestyle events, in both of which she still holds the world records. Seven of her Olympic medals are gold, putting her just two wins away from earning the most Olympic gold medals of any female athlete in history. Younger swimmers have Ledecky beat in the 400-meter freestyle: Australia's Ariarne Titmus (who took gold in Tokyo and also reigns in the 200-meter event) and Canada's Summer McIntosh have each knocked down Ledecky's world record, which Titmus currently holds. The Titmus-McIntosh-Ledecky 400-meter race should make for a thrilling watch.\n\nIn men's swimming, the U.S. is looking for a superstar and hoping that Caeleb Dressel is it. The 27-year-old won five gold medals in Tokyo -- joining an elite few of swimmers that have won that many in a single Games, including Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz. After taking an eight-month break from the sport, Dressel showed at the Olympic trials last month that he's still fast in sprints.\n\nHeading into Paris, however, the two fastest swimmers in the world are not from the usual rival powerhouses (Australia and the U.S.) but from Canada -- McIntosh on the women's -- and France -- L\u00e9on Marchand.\n\nA doping scandal sparked international outrage after it was revealed in April that 32 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug ahead of the Tokyo Games in 2021 but were cleared to compete. The drug in question -- called trimetazidine or TMZ -- is the same one found in a sample from Kamila Valieva, the Russian figure skater who was subsequently slapped with a four-year ban from international competition.\n\nChinese officials say an unintentional contamination led to the positive tests. The World Anti-Doping Agency accepted that explanation after its investigation and said that international doping rules don't require them to ban the athletes.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into the case involving the swimmers. Meanwhile, China is expected to send 11 of the 32 swimmers who had the performance drug in their system in 2021 to compete in Paris.\n\nThe agency's handling of the positive tests has sowed doubt deeper among critics who question whether the regulatory body responsible for curbing cheating holds some countries to a lower standard than others.\n\nThe 100-meter sprint, the most popular track event, has shaped up to be a familiar two-nation race. Representing Jamaica in the women's race is Shericka Jackson, whose biggest challenge is American Sha'Carri Richardson. But don't overlook Jamaican sprint queen Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who will race in her fifth and final Olympics 16 years after becoming the first Caribbean woman to win the 100-meter gold. They are chasing Florence Griffith Joyner's record set in 1988.\n\nIn the 200-meter, there's a real chance we could see the fall of Flo-Jo's world record set that same year when she ran 21.34 seconds. Jackson will go head-to-head with teammate Elaine Thompson-Herah and Gabby Thomas of Team USA.\n\nIn the men's 100-meter race, Noah Lyles on Team USA will face Jamaica's Oblique Seville and Kishane Thompson, each aiming to break the world record time set by eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt. Still, the field is brimming with talent that clouds podium predictions. Other top contenders include reigning Olympic champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and a former world champion American Fred Kerley.\n\nLyles also racing in the 200-meter -- his better event -- a race that won't be as wide open as the 100. He's the favorite, ahead of Tebogo, a notable exception to the rivalry who won the men's race last week at an international meet in Monaco.\n\nSoccer starts before the Games officially kick off with the opening ceremony. The U.S. women's national team is aiming to upgrade their bronze medal from Tokyo. The four-time gold medalists haven't taken first on the podium since the 2012 Games in London. Since the retirement of major stars -- Megan Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd, Julie Ertz, Sam Mewis -- has made way for a younger team, which will be led by new head coach Emma Hayes, former manager of the women's Chelsea Football Club. World Cup champion Spain is the favorite to take gold.\n\nThe last time the U.S. sent a men's soccer team to the Olympics was in 2008, and they haven't medaled since 1904. Since the rule to restrict the competition to players under 23 went into effect in 1992, the men's team has advanced to the knockout stage only once.\n\nThe men kick off their tournament on Wednesday in a game against host country France, a favorite to win it all. The women's squad plays Zambia on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_bowman@npr.org", "name": "Emma Bowman", "type": "author",

The IOC announced that boxer Ngamba and taekwondo athlete Al-Ghotany would be carrying the IOC flag on behalf of the committee's Olympic team during the opening ceremony.\n\nRecord spectator admission\n\nThe ceremony will be open to a significant number of spectators.\n\nApproximately 220,000 invited and security-screened spectators will occupy the upper tiers of the Seine's banks, while an additional 104,000 paying spectators will view the event from the lower riverside and around the Trocad\u00e9ro plaza.\n\nFor those unable to secure tickets, 80 giant screens throughout Paris will broadcast the ceremony.\n\nThe Paris 2024 site states, \"The Opening Ceremony for the Olympic Games Paris 2024 will be the largest in Games history.

Key events include Jannik Sinner's withdrawal due to illness, new appointments in NHL, and notable achievements in swimming, gymnastics, rugby sevens, and the much-anticipated opening ceremony. It also touches on Salt Lake City's selection for the 2034 Winter Games, and WADA's compliance review involving the U.S. anti-doping agency.\n\nFollowing is a summary of current sports news briefs.\n\nOlympics-Tennis-Sinner pulls out of Paris Games due to illness\n\nJannik Sinner has withdrawn from the Paris Games due to tonsillitis, the world number one said on Wednesday, denting Italy's hopes of winning a first Olympic tennis medal since 1924. Sinner won his first Grand Slam at the Australian Open earlier this year and reached the semi-finals of the French Open.\n\nNHL-Oilers hire ex-Blackhawks executive Bowman as new general manager\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers have hired former Chicago Blackhawks executive Stan Bowman to be their new general manager and executive vice president of hockey operations, the National Hockey League team said on Wednesday. The decision comes three weeks after the NHL said Bowman and two other Blackhawks executives were eligible to seek employment in the league again more than two years after they were punished in the fallout from the Chicago team's sexual assault scandal.\n\nOlympics-Swimming-Scott ready to add to his medal haul in the Paris pool\n\nDuncan Scott has won quite a lot since now-disgraced Chinese swimmer Sun Yang branded him a loser at the 2019 world championships. The jibe, uttered after he and Australian Mack Horton refused to shake hands with Sun and join him on the 200 metres freestyle podium in Gwangju, remains an ironic badge of honour for Britain's most decorated Olympic swimmer.\n\nOlympics-Artistic gymnastics-Malone overcomes injury to lead young US gymnasts at Paris Games\n\nAfter a devastating knee injury during gymnastic competition last year, Brody Malone's quest for a second Games in Paris seemed all but lost. But after three surgeries, the 24-year-old is now leading a youthful U.S. men's squad hungry for its first Olympic team medal since 2008.\n\nOlympics-Rugby Sevens-Dupont's France held by U.S. on opening day\n\nThe Paris Olympics began in earnest on Wednesday when the first batch of pool games in rugby sevens kicked off in front of a noisy crowd at the iconic Stade de France where hosts France were held to a draw by the United States. Although the Olympics opening ceremony is not until Friday, soccer and rugby sevens preliminary rounds got underway for logistical reasons in Paris and around the country.\n\nOlympics-Tennis-Gauff named Team USA's female flag bearer for Paris Games\n\nU.S. Open champion Coco Gauff will be the female flag bearer for the United States at the Paris Olympics opening ceremony, joining four-time NBA champion LeBron James, the American team said on Wednesday. The 20-year-old Gauff will be the youngest-ever U.S. flag bearer and first American tennis player to be awarded the honour, three years after she was forced to miss the Tokyo Olympics when she tested positive for COVID.\n\nOlympics-Soccer, rugby kick off Games ahead of opening ceremony\n\nThe sporting action at the Paris Olympics kicked off with two soccer matches on Wednesday, two days before thousands of athletes and artists are set to take part in an ambitious opening ceremony at the heart of the French capital. After years of preparation, and as more than 10,000 athletes are getting ready for their shot at one of the 329 gold medals that will be up for grabs in 19 days of competition, the first two events of the Paris Games kicked off at 3pm (1300 GMT).\n\nOlympics-Salt Lake City confirmed as host of the 2034 Winter Olympic Games - IOC\n\nSalt Lake City was awarded the 2034 Winter Olympic Games on Wednesday following a vote of the International Olympic Committee. The U.S. city, which hosted the 2002 Winter Games, earned 83 votes out of 89 at the IOC session, having been named the preferred choice in June.\n\nExclusive-WADA to put U.S. anti-doping agency under compliance review\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will take the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) to the Independent Compliance Review Committee next month, WADA told Reuters, a landmark move that could jeopardise the country hosting the 2028 and 2034 Olympics. WADA is taking the step as a result of a dispute with USADA over its handling of a case involving 23 Chinese swimmers who tested positive for a banned substance in 2021.\n\nOlympics-Artistic gymnastics-Biles eyes gymnastics history and unfinished business at Paris Games\n\nSimone Biles has a chance to make Olympic history at the Paris Games alongside an experienced U.S. team she credits with lifting her up after she considered walking away from the sport she revolutionised. Biles withdrawal from Tokyo three years ago due to a mental block that made it unsafe to continue rocked those Games and raised questions about whether the greatest gymnast of all time would compete in a third Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type":

Handball will join the action on Thursday, but the 2024 Olympics won't officially begin until the opening ceremony takes place on Friday. It is the quadrennial commencement of any Olympic Games, and dating back to 1996, it has always occurred on a Friday evening local time.\n\nSpectators will line the Seine River while the cast in the ceremony, and the athletes will travel from the Pont d'Austerlitz Bridge to the Pont d'I\u00e9na Bridge by boat.\n\nThe 2024 Olympics torch relay began on April 16 in Olympia, Greece, the site of the ancient Games, and will conclude at the opening ceremony.\n\nAdditionally, athletes not from France were invited to partake, such as American snowboarder Shaun White and two-time Olympian soccer player Megan Rapinoe.\n\nThe Olympic torch relay has also attracted those outside the sports world, with actress Halle Berry and chef Anne-Sophie Pic carrying the torch as two examples. Rapper Snoop Dogg is part of the final leg of the relay as it makes its way to the opening ceremony.\n\nOne of the biggest traditions during the opening ceremony is the Parade of Nations, where every athlete congregates with their fellow national team members to walk through the ceremony venue. The athletes are preceded by their flag, and certain athletes are chosen to be their nation's flagbearer.\n\nWith the last Summer Olympics, which were held in 2021, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, just over 10,000 people attended that year's opening ceremony.\n\nOnce the opening ceremony concludes, 14 medal events will be held on Saturday, with the peak coming on the penultimate day. There will be 39 medal events on Aug. 10, and then a final 13 medals will be handed out the next day before the 2024 Olympics Closing Ceremony concludes Paris 2024 at Stade de France.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_flame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic flame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_d'I\u00e9na", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pont d'I\u00e9na"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_d'Austerlitz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pont d'Austerlitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne-Sophie_Pic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anne-Sophie Pic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Rapinoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megan Rapinoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_White", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaun White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snowboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Halle Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympia, Greece"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Olympia, Greece"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/07/25/id5693342-GettyImages-2162281468-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-16", "textStart": 650, "textEnd": 658}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 1785, "textEnd": 1792}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

We are now at 8.8 million tickets sold and we still have 500,000 to 600,000 tickets available.\"\n\nThe men's 100m final will headline the evening session at the Stade de France on Sunday August 4, with tickets still available at a range of prices between \u20ac295 (\u00a3249) and \u20ac980 (\u00a3825). The women's sprint showcase will feature a day earlier, with an entry point \u20ac195 (\u00a3164) for those still seeking a seat.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, tickets are priced cheaper than for the London Olympics in 2012. Around 250,000 tickets were unsold then, largely for football which took place in large venues around the country, which has again contributed to the high figure in Paris.\n\nThe last Summer Olympics in Tokyo had heavy restrictions on spectators due to the Covid pandemic, while in Rio in 2016, about a million tickets went unsold.\n\nMore than 300,000 people are expected to line the banks of the Seine in the French capital on Friday, with 45,000 police in attendance in a significant security effort.

The kickoff for the opening ceremony, which for the first time in Olympic Games history will not be hosted in a stadium but in the heart of Paris, is expected to attract understandable interest and curiosity. It will also heighten already existing concerns about how safe a massive three-hour event can be in the center of a city that has been repeatedly wounded by bloody terrorist attacks.\n\nIn reality, the activities of the Games, the first in the post-pandemic world and therefore the first to be held again in the presence of the public and spectators since 2016, will have begun two days earlier with the soccer tournament of the event and the matches between Argentina - Morocco and Uzbekistan - Spain.\n\nMany, of course, believe that the third Olympics hosted by Paris, after 1900 and 1924, have already started -- albeit quietly. They even consider the starting point to be the morning of the previous Wednesday when the mayor of the French capital dared to dive and swim in the waters of the Seine. The 65-year-old Anne Hidalgo accepted the challenge and offered herself as a guinea pig to prove to the world that the ten-year Seine cleanup program, which has cost French taxpayers around 1.5 billion euros, has finally borne fruit.\n\nIn good news, the mayor is alive and in excellent health after her swim in the river, despite the fact that just two weeks earlier, measurements showed that the concentrations of coliform bacteria in a water sample were ten times above the maximum allowable limit. Equally resilient as Hidalgo was the French Minister of Sports, Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra, who took her dip in the famous river last Saturday, making another effort to convince the triathlon and marathon swimming athletes that the Seine is not only hospitable for their events but also, primarily, safe. It is noted that swimming in the river had been banned for health reasons since as far back as 1923.\n\nThe only one who has not yet dared to take the plunge he had long promised is the President of France. Emmanuel Macron, who from the start of his presidency in 2017, was a staunch supporter of hosting the Games and exhausted every last bit of his influence to ensure that the French bid prevailed over Los Angeles, which ultimately secured the 2028 Games. At present, he has much more significant issues on his mind than selling his image, something he is admittedly very adept at.\n\nAlthough the idea of holding an opening ceremony with Paris as the ideal backdrop initially thrilled him, he only expressed concern about the safety of the athletes and the approximately 300,000 spectators this past April and put forward the alternative of Stade de France. In the end, however, calm prevailed, spectacle triumphed over second thoughts, and thus, with the current data, for the first time in history, we will see the 10,500 athletes -- 50% men, 50% women, as these are the first Olympics of absolute equality -- from around the world (or at least some of them) parading on floating platforms during the official opening of the Games.\n\nThe opening ceremony is traditionally the crown jewel of the Olympic Games. This is especially true when the French have spent 7.5 billion euros to bring the premier sporting event back to Paris exactly a century after they last hosted it. That's why they entrusted the orchestration of the three-hour event to a 42-year-old director, who has proven not only his competence but also his boldness and modern aesthetic through his highly discussed performances.\n\nNormandy-born but naturalized Parisian Thomas Jolly took charge of the opening ceremony almost without realizing it himself. Two years ago, he gave an interview to the newspaper \"L'Equipe,\" in which he shared his grand vision of what an opening ceremony away from stadiums, in the heart of the city, could look like. The organizing committee liked his idea more than he could have imagined, and so, a few weeks later, in September 2022, he was appointed.\n\nThe only (but dominant) problem for the French director is that he will not be able to see his artistic vision completed until the moment it is viewed by the rest of the world. Conducting the ceremony along a roughly 6-kilometer route from the Austerlitz Bridge to the Trocad\u00e9ro, where the Olympic Flame will be lit, obviously prohibits rehearsals, making the task even more challenging.\n\nNevertheless, Jolly promises a spectacle that will merge the classical with the contemporary face of France. He has committed to an inclusive show that reflects the entirety of the country and has decided to utilize all the landmarks of Paris, which will play a starring role in his artistic vision. He has even described himself as immune to the impossible -- a claim well-known to those who watched his 24-hour-long Shakespearean performance two years ago. In any case, his statement heightens expectations.\n\nHowever, to be honest, neither Jolly nor even Paris will be the main star of the opening ceremony. Bernard Arnault, the world's richest person and head of the LVMH empire, has ensured that his brands will steal the show. After all, as the 213-billion-euro magnate has said, LVMH craftsmen are perfectionists and meticulous, just like the champions.\n\nThe Arnault Factor\n\nArnault's sponsorship of the Paris Games, which will conclude on August 11, amounts to a modest estimate of 150 million euros. This sum is enough to justify the intervention he reportedly made to the International Olympic Committee to have his group's trademarks featured during the opening ceremony. After all, the procession of athletes will sail past two iconic Louis Vuitton boutiques and the \"Cheval Blanc\" hotel, also owned by Arnault. But the emphatic presence of the French giant at the Paris Games does not end there.\n\nThe medals for the event, which will contain metal fragments from the Eiffel Tower, are being created by the historic French house Chaumet, part of Arnault's portfolio. Both the medals and the torches will be transported in specially designed cases by Louis Vuitton. The Arnault family also undertook to design the official uniforms for the French Olympic team, which numbers around 1,300 members. However, they assigned the job to an Italian brand within their business group, Berluti.\n\nFor Bernard Arnault's eldest son, Antoine, vice-president of Dior, LVMH could not be absent from an event that will broadcast France's image to the world. However, it's not just a matter of prestige for the Arnault family, who have close friendly ties with President Macron, that made it imperative to infiltrate almost every aspect of the Paris Games. There are also more practical reasons why the group of 75 luxury brands must make a resounding \"presence.\"\n\nOnce, the audience for these expensive products were the affluent, but according to a recent American study, 60% of consumers are not extraordinarily wealthy individuals but citizens who spend less than 2,000 euros a year -- giving from their modest means -- to incorporate a hint of luxury into their daily lives. Therefore, the world's largest sporting event, held every four years, seems like an ideal field for the mass attraction of new customers through indirect advertising.\n\nThe Venues\n\nHowever, the Paris Games will not go down in history solely as the luxurious Games -- although Bernard Arnault's eldest son rejects this characterization and argues that LVMH tried to think and act creatively -- nor simply as the Games that, nominally at least, made gender equality a reality. They also aspire to be recorded as the most environmentally neutral Games.\n\nWhether they succeed or not, with this mindset, the organizers tried to utilize existing stadiums and not build new ones, which later they wouldn't know what to do with -- for example, in Athens, 20 years after the Games, we still wonder while venues like the beach volleyball stadium in Faliro Bay are left to rot. The centerpiece of the Paris Olympics will be Stade de France, where the rugby matches and track and field events (August 2-11) will be held. Built in 1998 for the FIFA World Cup and with a capacity of 80,000 spectators, it has been tested in major sporting and concert events and has performed excellently.\n\nOf course, the French couldn't miss the opportunity to utilize the iconic Roland Garros facilities for the Olympic tennis tournament, as well as for boxing, and the Palace of Versailles for modern pentathlon and equestrian events. Another landmark of Paris, the fully renovated Grand Palais, will initially host fencing and then taekwondo, while the Palais de Bercy (now known as Accor Arena) will host the basketball tournament and artistic gymnastics. The Parc des Princes, the home ground of Paris Saint-Germain, will host the football matches.\n\nIn the western part of the city, at La Defense Arena, the heart of the particularly popular rugby in France, swimming competitions and water polo will take place thanks to the building's multifunctionality. By far the most photogenic venue, created specifically for the Olympics, will be the one in front of the Eiffel Tower. The French had the rather brilliant idea to place a 12,800-seat stadium in the shadow of the most famous Parisian symbol, where the beach volleyball matches will be held.\n\nBrand new is the rowing course, the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium, created 35 kilometers west of Paris and delivered in 2019. Sailing events will take place in the south of the country, at the Marseille Marina, while the luckiest athletes will be the surfers, who will travel to Tahiti to ride the waves of the French territory.\n\nThe Greek Olympic Team\n\nThe Greek Olympic team, which until a few days ago consisted of 101 members, has now been reduced to 100 following the temporary suspension of a track and field athlete who tested positive in an anti-doping control by the Hellenic Anti-Doping Agency. Although Greece does not have a representative in surfing, Greek champions will compete in 15 sports. With flag bearers in the opening ceremony being Antigoni Drismpioti and Giannis Antetokounmpo - since 2020, the IOC allows countries to have both a male and a female flag bearer to promote gender equality - Greece's delegation is the largest since the 2012 London Olympics and hopes for a better outcome than the modest haul from Tokyo, which saw two gold medals from Stefanos Ntouskos and Miltos Tentoglou, one silver from the men's national water polo team, and one bronze from Lefteris Petrounias.\n\nFor the Rio rings champion, this will be his third Olympic Games. The ping pong champion Panagiotis Gionis will double this number of participations in Paris, while Byron Kokkalanis in windsurfing (iQFoil) and Nora Drakou in swimming will reach four Olympiads. Incidentally, Greece's swimming team consists of 16 members, including Kristian Gkolomeev, Apostolos Christou, Anna Ntountounaki, Alkis Kynigakis (marathon swimming), and Stergios Bilas, and is in excellent shape as demonstrated by their triumphant performances at the recent European Championship in Belgrade, which yielded 20 medals.\n\nOur country will also participate in artistic swimming in the duet event with Evangelia Platanioti and Sofia Malkogeorgou, as well as in water polo (men and women). Greek representation will also be present in cycling (Giorgos Bouglas), equestrian (Ioli Mytilinaiou), fencing (Dora Gountoura), judo (Elisavet Teltsidou, Theodoros Tselidis), wrestling with three entries and high hopes for Giorgos Kougioumtsidis, tennis (Tsitsipas brothers, Maria Sakkari, and Despina Papamichail), and of course basketball. The rowing team will also be numerous with seven members, as will the shooting team with five participants. As for the king of the Olympic Games, athletics, all eyes will naturally be on Miltos Tentoglou (long jump) and his close friend Emmanuel Karalis (pole vault), who is in excellent form having broken the national record twice in a few weeks.\n\nThe Critique\n\nOf course, beyond performance on the competition fields, the Olympics for host cities are also a matter of impressions. And so far, Paris seems not to be winning them, especially after a scathing article by the British newspaper \"Telegraph\" which was widely circulated last week. In it, the author expresses the opinion that the French capital had no \"touristic\" reason to want to host the Olympics, as it is already the most famous and popular city in the world with 44 million visitors annually. Instead, he presents the Games as a personal bet, if not an obsession, of President Macron, who, according to the article, is currently witnessing one disappointing statistic after another.\n\nAccording to the \"Telegraph\" journalist, hotel occupancy in Paris is lower than the corresponding period last summer, reaching 81%, while he points out that the losses projected by Air France for the third quarter of the year are due to low interest and citizens' reluctance to travel to where the heart of the Games will beat.\n\nEconomic journalist and analyst Matthew Lynn, who has also dealt with the Greek financial crisis in his book, notes that Bernard Arnault was actually enlisted by Macron to save whatever can be saved and concludes that the idea of holding the Olympic Games every four years in the same part of the world should perhaps be seriously considered, even proposing Greece as the ideal location.", "source": {"uri": "en.protothema.gr", "dataType": "news",

Many of the barriers will be removed after the opening ceremony.\n\nIntelligence services uncovered two plots against the country by suspected Islamic militants in early 2024.\n\nIn May, a man was detained on suspicion of planning an attack on the torch relay in Bordeaux, and another man was arrested in southern France over a plan to attack an Olympic football venue.\n\nThe cost of this year's Games is estimated to be about 9bn euros (\u00a37.6bn), less than any of the previous four Games - in Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro, London and Beijing.\n\nMuch of the funding is coming from private companies, as well as sales of tickets and broadcasting rights.\n\nThe government's official auditors have said it may have to pay between 3bn and 5bn euros (\u00a32.5bn and \u00a34.2bn) for costs such as policing.\n\nThe organising committee of Paris 2024 has promised to make it the greenest Games in Olympic history, with half the carbon footprint of London 2012 and Rio 2016.\n\nThe Games will be held in the same city where, in 2015, world leaders agreed to try to prevent global temperatures rising by more than 1.5C.\n\nAbout 95% of the Olympic and Paralympic sites are either existing structures or temporary ones.\n\nThe organisers say they are using as much recycled material as they can - including recycled cardboard beds for athletes - and trying to minimise carbon emissions.\n\nHowever, it has been reported that thousands of air-conditioning units have been ordered for Olympic Village rooms by some national teams.\n\nMillions of visitors are expected in Paris during the Games, with ticket holders expected to spend an estimated 2.6bn euros (\u00a32.2bn).\n\nHoteliers in Paris pushed up their rates, in many cases doubling them or more, in anticipation of a big rise in demand. But there have been reports that many hotels have had unexpectedly low sales.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The degree of difficulty with any opening ceremony is through the roof, but I don't know where to put this one. It's unlike anything I've ever been a part of. It's exciting, but there are a lot of unknowns.\n\n\"The creative directors that have put this show together are really banking on a beautiful night in Paris, and they want to use sort of golden hour to present the city and their country. A lot of cameras would be compromised if there is significant weather, things like live drones and aerials. There are quite a few variables, and it's never going to be rehearsed in its entirety. So other than that, it's going to be perfect.\"\n\nNBC and Peacock's coverage of the Paris opening ceremony on Friday has the potential to be unlike anything we've ever seen from an Olympics. The first-ever waterborne opening ceremony will feature 85 or so boats carrying athletes from more than 200 countries traveling past spectators seated on the banks of the famed Paris body of water. Live coverage begins at noon ET on NBC with the ceremony believed to be starting at 1:30 p.m. ET. It is expected to last over three hours. Telemundo will provide Spanish-language coverage beginning at 1 p.m. ET.\n\nEach boat will take about 45 minutes from the time it leaves the starting point at Pont d'Austerlitz to the time it arrives at the Trocad\u00e9ro. There are expected to be 300,000 spectators lining the course, bridges filled with dancers and musicians, and the hope from organizers (and no doubt NBC) is that the spectacular ceremony will provide the jet fuel to get people excited about the Games.\n\nThe prime-time re-airing of the opening ceremony will begin at 7:30 p.m. ET on NBC and Peacock.\n\nHyland said NBC will focus heavily on Team USA during the opening ceremony broadcast, and as part of that focus, host and reporter Maria Taylor (along with two camera operators and one researcher) will be reporting live from Team USA's boat as it makes its way down the Seine. Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb of the \"Today\" show, and Snoop Dogg will be located at the Pont de la Concorde (about halfway down the river) as part of the coverage.\n\nMolly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics production, called the Paris opening ceremony the most complicated live event ever attempted on television. The host broadcaster, Olympic Broadcast Services, has more than 100 cameras ready to create the world feed to cover the entertainment and the athlete boats. There are also 200 mobile phone cameras feeding live shots of every single delegation. Solomon said NBC will have 45 of its own cameras to follow the U.S. team from the village to their boat as well as cameras on bridges and throughout the ceremony.\n\nMike Tirico, Kelly Clarkson and Peyton Manning will host the opening ceremony from the Trocad\u00e9ro, which sits across the Seine from the Eiffel Tower. (Paris 2024 has constructed a temporary stadium at the Trocad\u00e9ro in the shape of a horseshoe.) The additions of Clarkson and Manning are significant given it represents NBCU going heavy on celebrity as part of its Paris Games coverage. Solomon said the choices of Clarkson and Manning were intentional given the event will intersperse musical performances with the parade of nations on boats.\n\n\"When we reflected on what we're going to be covering, we thought about why don't we bring in a wider perspective of voices,\" said Solomon, the first woman to exec\u00adutive produce the Olympics for NBC. \"Sports, entertainment, news, you're going to get all of that. There's nobody better than Mike Tirico giving perspective. I watched Kelly Clarkson host NFL Honors a couple of years ago, and I was blown away by her ability to communicate outside her sort of lane. Same thing with Peyton. Anything he touches his gold.\n\n\"So you've got Kelly who can speak to the entertainment piece and the musical performances. You've got Peyton who loves the Olympics and has a curiosity about athletes and stories. Plus you have Savannah and Hoda who can handle anything and have hosted three or four opening ceremonies between them. I think this is much more a 360 view of the ceremony, and I felt like it was time to reimagine and bring in a wider array of voices.\"\n\nThe live opening ceremony broadcast is just one element for NBC Universal. They have to quickly go from the live production to producing and presenting a curated prime-time version of the opening ceremony just hours after it airs live. NBC will have a staff of 40 senior production staffers assigned to take the live broadcast and add graphics, re-voicing, teases, and other storytelling elements for the prime-time re-air. Hyland predicted the prime-time show, which comes on at 7:30 p.m. ET, will be about 75 to 80 percent similar to the live broadcast from the afternoon. He said there might be more focus on Team USA in the prime-time taped show. There are more commercials in the prime-time hour than the live broadcast, and the prime-time show will obviously show less of the full ceremony than the live broadcast.\n\n\"We're going to cover it live in the daytime and then fuse it with deeper storytelling in prime time,\" Solomon said.\n\nOutside of the artistic ambition, the Paris opening ceremony is significant for NBCU's viewership aspirations. It's the first opening ceremony with some distance from the global pandemic, and NBC's hope is to create viewership momentum heading into the competition.\n\nThat has not been the case with the last two Olympics. The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics opening ceremony across multiple platforms had a total audience delivery of 16 million viewers, the lowest opening ceremony viewership in NBC's history. NBC's broadcast of the Tokyo Games opening ceremony in July 2021 drew 17 million viewers, which at the time was the smallest U.S. television audience for the event in three decades. Just six years ago, NBC averaged 28.3 million viewers (including streaming) for the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.\n\nFor NBC, there is a lot riding on the boat parade.",

Image credit: World Archery\n\nThe Paris 2024 Olympics is underway even though the official start is scheduled for 26 July with an elaborate opening ceremony along the Seine River in France. The Olympics 'unofficially' began on 24 July with football, Rugby Sevens competition on 24 July while women's handball and archery individual ranking rounds are scheduled for 25 July.\n\nIndia will only be in action in the archery ranking around where all six archers will compete.\n\nParis Olympics LIVE Updates: Archers get India's campaign underway\n\nWhy Paris Olympics started before the opening ceremony?\n\nIt's a common theme, at least for football, to start in advance at every Olympics as it's a highly physical sport in which the teams cannot play every day. To ensure that they get at least 48 hours of recovery period, the football matches are scheduled to start in advance.\n\nBenjamin Ceugnart, Competitions Calendar Project Manager at Paris 2024, explaining the situation said: \"Since the Barcelona 1992 Games, football has started ahead of the opening ceremony. What's more, the players can't play every day, so they need a recovery period of at least 48 hours.' As a result, the men's teams will play on D-2 and the women's teams on D-1.\"\n\nParis Olympics Complete Coverage: Click here for news, schedule, explainers and more\n\nThe early start for Rigby Sevens and handball is a new concept but because the sports are sharing venues with other games, it was decided to start them in advance.\n\n\"Handball starts on D-1, for the women, because it will take place in a shared competition venue during the pools organised at the South Paris Arena 6,\" Ceugnart said. \"So we had to make sure we had enough time to guarantee the transition between handball and weightlifting, which will follow at this venue.\"\n\n\"It's exactly the same concept for rugby sevens. The competition also starts on D-2 because the Stade de France will then host the athletics.\"\n\nThis will help the organisers to host all the team tournaments swiftly and on time.\n\nIndia at Paris Olympics 2024: All you need to know\n\nIt is to be noted that there will be no elimination rounds before the opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympics and no medals will be awarded before the Games officially begin.\n\n\"Under IOC rules, there is one principle that must be respected: no medals are awarded and no athletes are eliminated before the opening ceremony\", Ceugnart added.\n\nClick here to check the full list of Indian athletes at the Paris Olympics 2024", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ujwal_singh@firstpost.com", "name": "Ujwal Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Archery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Handball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Archery_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Archery Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic weightlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Handball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Handball", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/02/Deepika-Kumari-World-Archery-1200-2024-02-dffcec814ae9ced7a4f9d29880b07ddc.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 72, "textEnd": 79, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 194, "textEnd": 201}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 307, "textEnd": 314, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

The parade will end in front of the Trocad\u00e9ro, where there will be performers and the ceremonial lighting of the Olympic torch.\n\nLive coverage will start at 12 p.m. EDT Friday and the opening ceremony will start at 1:30 p.m. It will be broadcast on NBC and Peacock, NBC's streaming service.

Ceremony artistic director Thomas Jolly has said he wants to \"show France in all of its diversity,\" but has otherwise stayed mum on specifics, telling the Associated Press, \"All I can tell you is that it will be very meaningful for the artists that will perform.\" A total of 3,000 artists -- including several hundred dancers -- are set to take part in the opening and closing ceremonies. Daphne Burki, a judge on \"Drag Race France,\" is the costume designer for the events.\n\nNo appearance by Lady Gaga has been confirmed by organizers despite rampant rumors that have convinced fans she'll perform. Gaga was seen arriving in Paris earlier this week and Jolly started following Gaga on Instagram earlier this month. The official Twitter account for the Olympics has also teased a performer disguised in a black hood and chrome accessories with the line \"You haven't seen anything yet.\"\n\nRumors that C\u00e9line Dion will perform live for the first time in four years at the Olympics have picked up steam in recent days, and acting French Sports Minister Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra added fuel to the fire Wednesday when he said the legendary musician's presence in Paris was \"not by chance.\"\n\nThe first games of the Olympics will be played Wednesday in soccer and rugby. The men's soccer team will play France at 3 p.m. EDT Wednesday and the women's soccer team will play against Zambia at 3 p.m. Thursday. The first Olympic medals will be awarded on Saturday for the 10m air rifle mixed team shooting event.\n\nJimmy Fallon of the \"Tonight Show\" and sports reporter Mike Tirico will host NBC's coverage of the closing ceremony of the Olympics, live coverage of which will begin at 2 p.m. EDT Sunday, Aug, 11 on NBC. Fan favorite commentators Terry Gannon, Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski will narrate the event, and Douglas Emhoff, husband to Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris, will lead the U.S. delegation at the event. The ceremony is expected to include performances by French celebrities, a parade of flags, parade of athletes and the final medal ceremony, which will award athletes in the marathon, basketball, modern pentathlon, volleyball, and water polo. The Los Angeles Olympic Committee will then give viewers a sneak peak of what's to come in 2028.\n\nPotential strikes. Dancers who signed up to perform in the opening ceremony have filed a strike notice due to low pay and \"glaring inequalities in treatment,\" according to the British news outlet Express, and trade unionists have said more than 3,000 dancers, acrobats and actors working on the opening ceremony have been doing so for low or no pay and were recruited under \"shameful conditions.\" The strike notice has been filed for Friday, the day of the opening ceremony.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Russia, meanwhile -- typically a top contender -- is sending a very small number of athletes to Paris following consequences related to their country's doping and its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHere's what else to know ahead of the Games before the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nClose to 100 boats carrying more than 10,000 athletes and performers will glide down a 3.7-mile stretch of the River Seine during the opening ceremony on July 26. It's the first time in the history of the modern Olympics that's being held outside of a stadium, officials say.\n\nThe open-air event is expected to draw some 300,000 spectators -- most of whom will pay no admission fee to watch the parade from the river's upper embankments.\n\nThe parade will travel east to west, starting at Austerlitz Bridge, and then pass by major landmarks and event venues like the Grand Palais. The parade is set to end at the Pont d'I\u00e9na bridge before a finale show at the Trocad\u00e9ro opposite the Eiffel Tower.\n\nTony Estanguet, president of the Paris Games organizing committee, described the vision for the ceremony when the plan was announced in 2021.\n\n\"The entire city has been turned into a vast Olympic stadium. The Seine represents the track, and the quays the spectators' stands,\" Estanguet said.\n\nThe parade's route also offers a sightseeing tour of some of the temporary sports venues, including an outdoor arena abutting the Eiffel Tower where beach volleyball games will take place.\n\nThere's also the matter of the Seine as a competition venue. In the run-up to the games, a question has plagued officials: Will the Seine be swimmable in time for the Olympics? The sewage-polluted waters have been a hurdle to the city's ambitious goal to hold the swim leg of the triathlon in the famous river where swimming has been historically banned.\n\nRecent testing of the water has turned up unsafe levels of E. coli bacteria caused by fecal matter, but tests earlier this month showed acceptable bacteria levels. In an effort to silence skeptics, last week, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo followed through on her promise to take a dip in the Seine and declared the waters perfectly safe.\n\nFollowing the previous Summer Games' addition of skateboarding and surfing, another sport with counterculture roots will take the Olympics stage for the first time in Paris. Breaking -- best known to the uninitiated as \"break-dancing\" -- is a dance style said to have originated in the 1970s from the streets of New York City's South Bronx and inspired by the break beats and hip-hop tracks played by DJs and MCs. But the athleticism involved in the art form -- head-spins, backflips and other acrobatics -- is undeniable.\n\nBreaking became more mainstream in the 1990s as it entered pop culture and expanded in popularity through international competition. And in 2016, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) added breaking to the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires.\n\nAlthough it's an American export, other countries, including Japan, Canada and The Netherlands, boast talent that's been known to surpass the U.S. competitively.\n\nIn Paris, 16 b-boys (male breakers) and 16 b-girls will go head to head in separate battles at Place de la Concorde, an outdoor public square. The women's competition is set for Aug. 9, and the men's is on Aug. 10. On Team USA, look out for medal contenders Victor Montalvo and Grace \"Sunny\" Choi.\n\nThe same U.S. women's gymnastics team that took home a silver medal at the Tokyo Games all-around final in 2021 is hoping to rewrite their Olympic ending in Paris.\n\nThree years ago, Biles, who at 27 is the most decorated gymnast of all time, came down with a case of the \"twisties,\" a debilitating psychological affliction that forced her to pull out of several events to focus on her mental health. In her place, Suni Lee had emerged as the unlikely champion, and went on to earn a gold medal in the individual all-around competition in Tokyo.\n\nJoining Biles and Lee are Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and 16-year-old newcomer Hezly Rivera.\n\nNow, with Biles in top form and the team united in its goal of \"redemption,\" the women's squad is the favorite to win gold. And especially so, given that Russia, the defending gold medalist, won't be there. The IOC plans to allow only some Russian athletes to compete as \"individual neutral athletes\" under strict conditions it set in response to Russia's war in Ukraine. The country's absence also improves the men's chances of medaling in a sport normally dominated by Russia, China and Japan.\n\nEntering her fourth Olympics, Katie Ledecky continues to dominate the 800- and 1,500-meter freestyle events, in both of which she still holds the world records. Seven of her Olympic medals are gold, putting her just two wins away from earning the most Olympic gold medals of any female athlete in history. Younger swimmers have Ledecky beat in the 400-meter freestyle: Australia's Ariarne Titmus (who took gold in Tokyo and also reigns in the 200-meter event) and Canada's Summer McIntosh have each knocked down Ledecky's world record, which Titmus currently holds. The Titmus-McIntosh-Ledecky 400-meter race should make for a thrilling watch.\n\nIn men's swimming, the U.S. is looking for a superstar and hoping that Caeleb Dressel is it. The 27-year-old won five gold medals in Tokyo -- joining an elite few of swimmers that have won that many in a single Games, including Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz. After taking an eight-month break from the sport, Dressel showed at the Olympic trials last month that he's still fast in sprints.\n\nHeading into Paris, however, the two fastest swimmers in the world are not from the usual rival powerhouses (Australia and the U.S.) but from Canada -- McIntosh on the women's -- and France -- L\u00e9on Marchand.\n\nA doping scandal sparked international outrage after it was revealed in April that 32 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug ahead of the Tokyo Games in 2021 but were cleared to compete. The drug in question -- called trimetazidine or TMZ -- is the same one found in a sample from Kamila Valieva, the Russian figure skater who was subsequently slapped with a four-year ban from international competition.\n\nChinese officials say an unintentional contamination led to the positive tests. The World Anti-Doping Agency accepted that explanation after its investigation and said that international doping rules don't require them to ban the athletes.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into the case involving the swimmers. Meanwhile, China is expected to send 11 of the 32 swimmers with the performance drug in their system in 2021 to compete in Paris.\n\nThe agency's handling of the positive tests has sowed doubt deeper among critics who question whether the regulatory body responsible for curbing cheating holds some countries to a lower standard than others.\n\nThe 100-meter sprint, the most popular track event, has shaped up to be a familiar two-nation race. Representing Jamaica in the women's race is Shericka Jackson, whose biggest challenge is American Sha'Carri Richardson. But don't overlook Jamaican sprint queen Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who will race in her fifth and final Olympics 16 years after becoming the first Caribbean woman to win the 100-meter gold. They are chasing Florence Griffith Joyner's record set in 1988.\n\nIn the 200-meter, there's a real chance we could see the fall of Flo-Jo's world record, set that same year when she ran 21.34 seconds. Jackson will go head-to-head with teammate Elaine Thompson-Herah and Gabby Thomas of Team USA.\n\nIn the men's 100-meter race, Noah Lyles on Team USA will face Jamaica's Oblique Seville and Kishane Thompson, each aiming to break the world record time set by eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt. Still, the field is brimming with talent that clouds podium predictions. Other top contenders include reigning Olympic champion Marcell Jacobs of Italy, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and a former world champion American Fred Kerley.\n\nLyles also racing in the 200-meter -- his better event -- a race that won't be as wide open as the 100. He's the favorite, ahead of Tebogo, a notable exception to the rivalry, who won the men's race last week at an international meet in Monaco.\n\nSoccer starts before the Games officially kick off with the opening ceremony. The U.S. women's national team is aiming to upgrade their bronze medal from Tokyo. The four-time gold medalists haven't taken first on the podium since the 2012 Games in London. Since the retirement of major stars -- Megan Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd, Julie Ertz, Sam Mewis -- has made way for a younger team, which will be led by new head coach Emma Hayes, former manager of the women's Chelsea Football Club. World Cup champion Spain is the favorite to take gold.\n\nThe last time the U.S. sent a men's soccer team to the Olympics was in 2008, and they haven't medaled since 1904. Since the rule to restrict the competition to players under 23 went into effect in 1992, the men's team has advanced to the knockout stage only once.", "source": {"uri": "kqed.org", "dataType":

The 10,500-athlete, 90-boat flotilla will travel a 3\u00bd-mile route down the Seine through the middle of Paris.\n\nA diplomatic Riondet said he didn't mind having to prep for the unprecedented event.\n\n\"Of course, it's an additional challenge,\" he said. \"We train frequently on the Seine and I know that it's going to be very, very nice. If you have the chance to be on a boat, on the Seine, it's quite tremendous, seeing all the buildings. The people will be able to see athletes in a way they've never experienced.\"\n\nThe Olympics come to Paris almost nine years after coordinated terrorist attacks cost the lives of 130 people in the deadliest attack ever in peacetime France.\n\nThere have been about 50 terrorist attacks stopped by intelligence services since 2017, officials said.\n\nOf the 45,000 law enforcement agents who will be on duty Friday, there will be 650 members of elite tactical units, snipers and hostage specialists. There'll also be 22,000 private security contractors working during the opening ceremony Friday, officials said.\n\nTo enter any part of the control zone, whether its blocks away from an Olympic event venue or the Seine River, getting through checkpoints can take 20 to 30 minutes depending on traffic and time of day. Police check everyone's credentials and match them with an ID.\n\nOver 12-foot-high wooden planks are blocking off popular tourist sites like the Champs de Mars in front of the Eiffel Tower and the grounds by Les Invalides ahead of the games.\n\nOn Tuesday, there's also a more visible military presence as the \"Vigipirate\" -- the country's counterterrorism unit -- have begun patrolling the streets along with police and the Gendarmerie.\n\nA security perimeter will prevent vehicles and most pedestrians from vast swaths of the city by the Seine, which cuts across Paris. Subway stations and bridges across the river will be closed.\n\nFrench authorities carried out background checks on a million people linked to the Games, including job applicants, volunteers, competitors, coaches and staff, journalists and security contractors, leading to 4,350 identified as potential security threats, officials said.\n\n\"Nobody will be able to get accreditation from the organizing committee unless they have been screened,\" said Julien Dufour, head of the Interior Ministry's security screening service, SNEAS.\n\nD'Amico, the retired FBI agent, said he doesn't envy Paris security officials, running the Olympics during this fraught time in world history with nearby wars in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.\n\n\"Everyone is going to look at the Olympics to make a name for themselves and that's why it is one of the biggest targets out there,\" said D'Amico, who now runs a security consulting company in Florida.\n\nSo far, the only known plot against the Olympics was foiled back in May by France's intelligence agency, the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Imp\u00f4ts (DGSI).\n\nA Chechen man was arrested in Saint-Etienne and suspected of planning an attack on the city's soccer stadium during a competition. The Islamic State Khorasan Province group, the Central Asian offshoot of the Islamic State terrorist group, was behind the plot, officials have said.\n\nProtecting air space above the Games will be a top priority and Prime Minister Gabriel Attal visited a military air base Tuesday to inspect anti-drone systems.\n\nAbout six drones are now being intercepted near Olympic sites every day, according to Attal.\n\nA no-fly zone will be enforced up to 93 miles outside the center of Paris on Friday night.\n\n\"Nothing can be allowed to get past us,\" Attal told reporters in V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, southwest of Paris. France's military has prepared to deploy system that can detect, jam, and intercept drones.\n\nSecurity will be high underwater as well, with 100 mine-clearing divers on duty.\n\n\"We are preparing for something that isn't fully anticipated,\" Riondet said. \"So, we've anticipated thousands of scenarios and that we are ready to take over on a scenario that wasn't expected.\"", "source": {"uri":

take on Mali under the watchful eye of 1,000 police officers, with authorities erecting an \"anti-terrorist perimeter\" and bracing for possible disruption around the stadium.\n\nIsrael's participation in Paris has been a key talking point in the run-up, with calls from the Palestine Olympic Committee and some left-wing French MPs for the country to be excluded over the Gaza war.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron stressed that Israeli athletes were \"welcome in our country\", adding it was \"France's responsibility to provide them with security\".\n\nA packed Stade de France will cheer on Antoine Dupont -- arguably the world's best rugby player and a pin-up of the Paris Games -- as the Rugby Sevens tournament starts, with Australia taking on Samoa.\n\nThe electric Dupont is the biggest draw for the 555,000 fans expected over the six days of rugby action, but France will have their work cut out to stop double Olympic champions Fiji.\n\nFrance and Fiji are in the same pool and will play the United States and Uruguay, before the pair face each other in a mouthwatering clash on Thursday.\n\nOthers to watch in the wide-open competition are traditional rugby powers New

On the plus side, the opening ceremony is traditionally a prime-time production in the host city's time zone, so fans will have ample opportunity to load up on coffee before the festivities begin.\n\nThe opening ceremony will have a unique twist this time around, with the traditional parade of nations relocated from its usual stadium setting to the Seine, where athletes will cruise through the heart of Paris on nearly 90 boats.\n\nThat wrinkle alone should generate more interest in this year's spectacle, along with the usual pomp, circumstances, speeches and performances. Here's when to tune in out west:\n\nOlympics opening ceremony Pacific Time schedule\n\nThe opening ceremony for the 2024 Olympics is scheduled to begin Friday at 10:30 a.m. PT, which is 7:30 p.m. local time in Paris.\n\nThe procession along the Seine will wind its way from the Pont d'Austerlitz to the Trocadero, where the official ceremonies and performances will take place.\n\nThe 2024 opening ceremony will be broadcast live on NBC in the U.S. and on CBC in Canada, with NBC also set to show an encore presentation in prime time.\n\nThe parade of nations will follow a 6-kilometer (3.75-mile) route along the Seine, with nearly 90 boats traveling from east to west along the river.\n\nAthletes will begin the journey at the Pont d'Austerlitz, alongside the Jardin des Plantes in the 5th arrondissement. They will float past numerous landmarks, including the Notre-Dame cathedral, the Louvre and d'Orsay museums, and the Place de la Concorde before the parade comes to an end at the Pont d'Iena with the Eiffel Tower on the left bank and the Trocadero on the right.\n\nThe Trocadero will be the venue for the official ceremonies that open the Games.\n\nCountries enter the parade of nations in alphabetical order, based on the host country's language. That means, for instance, Germany will be one of the first countries to enter, as it is known as Allemagne in French.\n\nThere are some exceptions. Greece always comes out first as a tribute to the ancient Olympic games, while the Refugee Olympic Team has come out second since it was formed.\n\nThe host country always enters last, and the next two Summer Games hosts, Australia (2032) and the United States (2028) will precede France in the procession.\n\nHere's the complete order for the 2024 parade of nations:", "source": {"uri":

Races will take place in its streets and in the river that makes up its heart and soul, and millions from around the world are making their way to France to take part in the quadrennial festivities.\n\nHere are five things to expect from the host city as the games get underway.\n\nA background for the Games unlike any other\n\nOne hundred years after the Olympics were last in Paris, the City of Light is poised to show off its world-famous sights.\n\nPerhaps the most iconic image already making the rounds on social media is the beach volleyball court located in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. The 137-year-old landmark looms over the court, enjoying its free ticket to watch the matches below.\n\nBut other classic Paris locations will be worked into the competitions as well.\n\nThe Place de la Concorde in central Paris will play host to multiple events, including skateboarding and 3x3 basketball, as one of the city's largest squares turns into an Olympic venue. The Trocadero will be the final stop of Friday's Opening Ceremony, in which athletes will disembark boats that float down the Seine (we'll have more to say on that in a moment). Versailles will host equestrian competitions on the grounds that were once walked by the very top of French society.\n\nAnd Pont Alexandre III, the beautiful bridge that crosses the Seine, will be the start and finish line of multiple events that take place throughout the city.\n\nParis is one of the world's most beautiful locations, its architecture known worldwide. Those scenes and sights will make for some of the most distinct Olympic imagery in recent decades.\n\nPARIS, FRANCE - JULY 24: A view of Trocadero Square, the venue for the Paris Olympics opening ceremony, with the Eiffel Tower in the background, on July 24, 2024 in Paris, France. (Photo by Sheng Jiapeng/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)\n\nSheng Jiapeng/China News Service/VCG/Getty Images\n\nThe return of fans in earnest\n\nLet's face it: The last couple Olympics have been weird.\n\nThe 2020 Summer Games were actually held in 2021 in Tokyo, playing out in front of virtually no fans amid lockdowns from the Covid-19 pandemic and travel restrictions still in place throughout the world.\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympic Games in China were held as that country still pursued its zero-Covid strategy, dramatically limiting the number of foreigners who could get into the country to cheer on their nations' athletes. While Chinese spectators were allowed, masks were still commonplace and noise was limited in order to comply with Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nBut as the world has moved on from the pandemic, and the Games moved to one of the most iconic travel locations in the world, fans are expected back in their millions.\n\nThe Games will be loud with nearly 9 million tickets having been sold for Olympic events as of earlier this month. Expect a celebratory atmosphere as Olympians are once again able to be cheered on by spectators from around the world, some of whom have traveled thousands of miles to see them compete.\n\nAll of France gets its chance to show off\n\nThese are the Paris Olympics, but they're not only being held in the country's capital.\n\nNice, Marseille, Bordeaux, Nantes, Lyon, Chateauroux and even Tahiti will all get their chance to partake in the Olympic spirit by hosting competitions. The 2024 Summer Games were organized with a mind to put the entire French nation on display, including its more tropical territories.\n\nThe various competitions will bring in thousands of spectators for major sports, including soccer and basketball, to cities hours away from Paris.\n\nIt's a boon for the local economies and also for the Olympic traveler who will get a chance to see the rest of France during the two weeks of competition.\n\nA Games focused on sustainability\n\nPARIS, FRANCE - MARCH 14: The Paris 2024 logo, representing the Olympic and Paralympic Games four months prior to the start of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic games is displayed on the facade of Paris town hall on March 14, 2024 in Paris, France. The city is gearing up to host the XXXIII Olympic and Paralympic Summer Games, from 26 July to 11 August. (Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images)\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nAs part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \"most responsible and sustainable games in history,\" organizers are building something that's meant to last.\n\n\"This village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\" said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \"Paris 2024 is renting it for a few months.\"\n\nInstead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else's home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village -- which contains 82 buildings -- will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people.\n\nOrganizers add that the Games is expected to run on 100% renewable energy.\n\nThe village itself will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics.\n\nParis' famed (or infamous, depending on the day's temperature) lack of air conditioning will also be a focus of energy efficiency.\n\nWhile the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning.\n\nThis system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment.\n\nThat cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter.\n\nThe Seine\n\nPreparations take place on the river Seine, Paris. The Opening Ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games takes place on Friday 26th July, along the River Seine. Picture date: Wednesday July 24, 2024. PA Photo.

Editorial use only, no commercial use without prior consent from rights holder.\n\nMartin Rickett/PA\n\nAnd then there's the Seine, the city's iconic river that splits Paris in two.\n\nThe river has been the focus of much scrutiny in the lead up to competition. Set to be the scene of the Opening Ceremonies and long-distance swimming competitions, the water quality and the current have both been closely watched.\n\nCity leaders - and a CNN correspondent - have been leaping into the river to prove that they believe it's safe to swim in ahead of competition.\n\nTriathlon events are due to start at the city's Alexandre III Bridge later this month, but official testing by the city has shown E. coli bacteria levels have been above acceptable levels on the majority of days between June 3 and July 2, which would potentially expose athletes to serious health risks.\n\nDespite a 1.4 billion Euro ($1.5 billion) clean-up plan for the Seine, where swimming has been illegal for more than 100 years due to pollution levels, concerns remain over the river's suitability for swimming events.\n\nThe Opening Ceremony of the Paris Olympics is set to take place on the Seine on July 26 if currents are not too strong, and Paris 2024 shares the view that sunshine and higher temperatures have brought about a significant improvement in water quality, CNN previously reported.\n\nBut, keep an eye on the weather: A recent rehearsal on June 24 was cancelled due to strong water flows caused by heavy rainfall. Another one could cause a last-minute scramble to ensure an extremely unique Opening Ceremony goes off as planned.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors":

This will start the ceremony, not mark the end of it, another break from tradition.\n\nThe ceremony starts at 1:30 p.m. EDT/7:30 p.m. CEST and is expected to last more than three hours.\n\nThe parade starts at the Austerlitz Bridge beside the Jardin des Plantes and follows the course of the Seine from east to west. It makes its way around two islands in the center of the city before passing under several bridges and gateways. Athletes aboard the boats will get glimpses of several Olympic venues including La Concorde Urban Park (3X3 basketball, breaking, BMX freestyle cycling, skateboarding), Invalides (archery, athletics -- marathon finish, road cycling -- time trial start) and the Grand Palais (fencing, taekwondo). The parade ends at the Iena Bridge, which links the Eiffel Tower on the left bank of the Seine to the Trocad\u00e9ro district on the right bank. The ceremony's finale is at the Trocad\u00e9ro. There, among other ceremonial procedures, French President Emmanuel Macron will deliver opening remarks.\n\nThe ceremony will air on NBC and stream on Peacock and NBC Olympic platforms -- NBCOlympics.com, NBC.com, NBC app, NBC Olympics app.\n\nA preview will air on NBC at noon EDT, with live coverage beginning at 1:30 p.m. and an enhanced prime-time encore at 7:30 p.m.\n\nAbout 220,000 invited and security-screened spectators are expected to fill the upper tiers of the Seine's banks, and an additional 104,000 paying spectators will watch from the lower riverside and around the Trocad\u00e9ro plaza.\n\nThose in Paris who could not get tickets will be able to watch the ceremony on 80 giant screens set up throughout the city.\n\nIn addition to the athletes who will participate in the parade, 3,000 dancers, artists and other athletes will be featured in the opening and closing ceremonies. Most of the entertainment acts remain under wraps. NBC News reported that Celine Dion and Lady Gaga have arrived in Paris amid speculation that one or both of the pop singers will perform at the opening ceremony.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

The Seine tells the story of this great celebration of humanity, and the ceremony will reflect that,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a tale that's inclusive and broad. It suggests that there is not just one idea of France, but several ideas, and that France has continued to evolve throughout history,\" he said. \"It's actually very French to question yourself. It fuels arguments and protests and strikes, but that's OK, that's also part of the story.\"\n\nIn fact, a labor union representing dancers filed a strike notice just one week before the ceremony, claiming unfair employment conditions.\n\nTalks are ongoing between unions and Paname 24, the service provider for the ceremony, said Maud Le Pladec, director of dance for the Paris 2024 ceremonies and choreographer of the opening ceremony.\n\nShe's part of the core group of creatives who worked on the event, who also include Daphn\u00e9 B\u00fcrki, styling and costumes director, and Victor Le Masne, musical director.\n\nTo keep details of the ceremony under wraps, they toiled away in a script room in a secret Paris apartment and rehearsed the different parts of the ceremony in warehouses, meaning everything will come together on the night.\n\n\"We had a lot of philosophical exchanges about what France represents for us, because we want it to be inclusive and representative of all identities, which is not always the case for Olympic ceremonies,\" said B\u00fcrki, a television presenter who has been a juror on the first three seasons of \"Drag Race France.\"\n\nJolly said 98 percent of the ceremony will unfold live, with 2 percent of sequences pre-recorded to give viewers a glimpse inside historic buildings.\n\n\"It was a new process for everyone involved,\" said the theater director, who is known for staging marathon Shakespeare productions and recently spearheaded the revival of the 1970s French rock opera \"Starmania,\" with costumes by Louis Vuitton creative director of womenswear Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re.\n\n\"For example, we created software that simulates the 3.7 miles of the Seine with all the buildings. I can even make the sun rise or set, or bring on rain or storms or rainbows, to visualize the scenography,\" he said.\n\nSet designer Emmanuelle Favre was charged with turning the ideas into reality, under the supervision of Thierry Reboul, director of ceremonies of the organizing committee.\n\n\"It was a tough task,\" Jolly conceded. \"We had to take into account the reality of Paris, of the Seine, its water, wind, sky, heritage sites, quays, stones, bridges and boats. And the fish! I mention them because we were careful to respect the river's natural environment.\"\n\nDaylight will be key to the ceremony, which is scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m. and expected to last three-and-a-half hours. \"No lighting engineer can beat the sun setting on Paris,\" said Jolly, noting that the move was also calculated to reduce the environmental footprint of the event.\n\nAs reported, it will be the first time that outfits for the opening ceremony are designed with their carbon impact in mind. B\u00fcrki said one tableau would feature upcycled clothes exclusively.\n\nThe event will also spotlight creations by and Dior, which both belong to luxury conglomerate LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, a premium partner of the sporting competition; looks by 15 emerging designers, and original designs overseen by Olivier B\u00e9riot, head of the Paris 2024 costume department.\n\n\"We tried to do things consciously, contrary to other opening ceremonies where everything was made from scratch,\" said B\u00fcrki. \"Most of the clothes in the tableaux will be repurposed. Some of the performers want to keep their outfits, while others will go to the performing arts venues who want to give them a second life.\"\n\nHer workshop on the outskirts of Paris conducted fittings for all 3,000 performers. \"It represents hours of work. Some outfits require yards of fabric. There is one tableau that involved roughly seven miles of ribbon,\" she noted.\n\nLe Pladec, director of the National Choreographical Center of Orleans, said the ceremony would feature a variety of styles.\n\n\"It's an opportunity for me to represent all the dance cultures in France. After all, we are the cradle of dance, in my opinion,\" she said.\n\n\"I represent contemporary dance, but I also work with ballet companies, and we'll be celebrating the arrival of breaking in the Olympics with the presence of so-called urban dances and clubbing,\" she added.\n\nLe Masne, a composer and arranger who has worked with artists including electronic duo Justice, Woodkid and Juliette Armanet, said the score would likewise included symphonic orchestras like the National Orchestra of France and more contemporary genres like techno.\n\nHe hinted that popular performers, including international stars, would also be involved, though he declined to name names.\n\n\"It's France welcoming the world. It's not just a French event, it's an event that must speak to as many people as possible, so we thought along those lines,\" Le Masne said.\n\nFrench-Malian singer Aya Nakamura was the target of racist insults in March following speculation that she would perform an Edith Piaf song at the opening ceremony. Far-right critics claimed her music does not represent France, even though she is the country's most streamed artist.\n\nMore than 300,000 people are expected to watch the opening ceremony on the banks of the Seine, with an additional 1.5 billion people set to tune in worldwide.", "source": {"uri": "wwd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WWD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joelle_diderich@wwd.com",

Metzler\n\nA buoy is seen during a surfing training session in Teahupo'o, on the French Polynesian Island of Tahiti, on Tuesday, ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics. AFP-Yonhap\n\nPARIS -- France went into full Olympic countdown this week as the long-awaited Summer Games will begin in Paris with a spectacular evening parade of 85 boats and barges along the iconic Seine. This unique, creative opening ceremony, with over 10,000 athletes and dignitaries from the teams, featured a resplendent pharaonic spectacle evoking ancient Egypt as much as modern France.\n\nThe XXXIII Olympics are being held just 100 years since the 1924 Paris Olympics.\n\nJohn J. Metzler\n\nThe Games arrived following years of preparations, traffic disruptions bad even by Parisian standards and a security lockdown in large parts of the city. Not surprisingly many Parisians have deliberately sarcastically left the city to avoid the crowding and traffic jams. Tourism is down too and the city is quieter than usual, even for summer.\n\nThough the Games cost nearly $10 billion and have gone not surprisingly over budget, they have not been as costly as recent Olympiads in London. Moreover, construction was integrated into preexisting venues and buildings thus causing a lower \"carbon footprint\" for construction. Naturally, the Games have not been without controversy; Anne Hidalgo, the Socialist mayor of Paris barred the Total Energy Group as a sponsor. Instead, there's the luxury goods company LVMH. And the risk of swimming in the otherwise polluted Seine was challenged when Hidalgo took a quick dip while wearing a wetsuit in a publicity-staged and paradoxical event.\n\nSecurity is tight in the week preceding the waterborne opening ceremony; 45,000 police and Gendarmes sealed off both sides of the Seine with metal fencing for over 2 miles in an already dense and historic urban environment. People living in the affected zone needed special QR codes on their phones to access their own neighborhoods and homes in chic areas such as Ile St. Louis near Notre Dame. Public transport was highly restricted in large parts of Paris a week before the events.\n\nSignificantly, threats from al-Qaida terror networks or Russian militants remain very real.\n\nEven pedestrian and bicycle movement was highly restricted. When walking through well-known streets and haunts near the Seine, there were various checkpoints needing QR codes for local movement. Municipal police, national police and the Gendarmerie, often with automatic rifles, controlled movement. Such area control evoked Paris during the COVID-19 pandemic when local lockdowns reached absurd levels. A further 18,000 military reinforced security against terrorist threats, especially rooftop security along the Seine and providing anti-drone technology. And on the Seine itself, special security speedboats were deployed with SWAT teams prepared for any eventuality.\n\nNewly constructed spectator seating lined large swaths of the Seine and many of the historic bridges along the river for the 2.5 by 1.2 miles zone, where 10,000 athletes will stage a waterborne parade on Friday ending at the Eiffel Tower and the Trocadero. About 300,000 spectators are expected to line the Seine for the spectacular event.\n\nThe Summer Games, slated between July 16 and Aug. 11, followed by the Paris Paralympics, will be hosting 24,000 athletes from around the world as well as hundreds of thousands of spectators. Among more than 30 traditional sporting competitions ranging from boxing, sailing, swimming, soccer and judo, the new sport being introduced this Olympiad by the Paris Committee is breakdancing. The athletes will compete for 329 gold medals.\n\nVenues range from the splendid skatepark in the newly created urban park in the central Place de la Concorde, to swimming in new aquatic stadiums in St. Denis, to taekwando in the historic Grand Palais in central Paris, home to the 1900 Grand Expo and to equestrian events in the Gardens of the Palace of Versailles. While most events are in the Paris region, such as beach volleyball at the Eiffel Tower in a new 13,000-seat pop-up stadium, sailing competitions will take place halfway around the world in French Polynesia!\n\nSome 14,000 athletes will stay at the newly built Olympic Village in St. Denis. Following the Games, the Village will become affordable housing in this poorer part of suburban Paris.\n\nIn parallel, many of the larger teams will host special hospitality venues; Team USA House is located in the historic Palais Brongniart in central Paris. Korea House is in the Maison de Chimie, prestigiously situated near the Parliament. Denmark has a great place on the central Champs Elysees! And for those without pricy tickets to see the sporting events, the Hotel de Ville (City Hall) has a spectacular \"fan zone\" with continuous video and live events.\n\nBruno Jeudy of the weekly La Tribune Dimanche wrote editorially, \"In the end, let's not forget the last step associated with Olympianism; Excellence.\"\n\nJohn J.

Over 17 days, a total of 10,500 athletes will vie for medals in these events.\n\nAthletes who win will take with them a part of the Eiffel Tower, as the medals feature fragments of iron sourced from the iconic structure.\n\nThe medalists will display an authentic segment of the Eiffel Tower on their chests, as each medal will feature a central piece of iron weighing 18 grams.\n\nThe metal comes from parts of the monument's structure removed during renovation work during the 20th century.\n\nOn Sept. 13, 2015, France formally submitted its bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympic Games.\n\nThe letter outlining the application highlighted that \"the Olympic spirit and the Parisian identity are defined by unity in diversity, tolerance of differences, and a collective commitment to peace.\"\n\nIt was endorsed by Denis Masseglia, then-president of the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF), and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo.\n\nAt the time, Paris, which had set aside a budget of \u20ac6.2 billion ($6.7 billion), for the Games, was considered a more formidable contender in 2015 compared to its competitors.\n\nParis had last hosted the Olympics in 1924 and had bid for the Games in 1992, 2008 and 2012.\n\nAlongside the French capital, other cities that declared their candidacy for the 2024 Summer Games included Los Angeles, Hamburg, Budapest and Rome. They announced their bids at various times throughout 2014 and 2015.\n\nAfter Hamburg, Budapest and Rome withdrew their bids, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) urged Los Angeles and Paris to reach a compromise.\n\nThe Committee proposed that Los Angeles host the 2028 Olympic Games and offered $1.8 billion in support for their preparation.\n\nWith Los Angeles accepting this proposal, Paris then agreed to host the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe Organizing Committee unveiled the designs for the mascots of the Olympic and Paralympic Games on Nov. 14, 2022.\n\nNamed Olympic Phryge, the Paris 2024 mascot is based on the traditional small Phrygian hats that the mascots are shaped after.\n\nIts name and design were chosen as symbols of freedom and to represent allegorical figures of the French Republic.\n\nThe mascot's eyes were designed to be both mischievous and expressive and were also compared to the cockade of France, the French national ornament.\n\nIts features, attire and gestures reflect the mascot's passion for sports.\n\nThe Olympic torch relay, a central tradition of the event, was introduced at the 1936 Berlin Summer Games.\n\nThe Paris 2024 Games torch was designed by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur.\n\nUnlike traditional designs, this year's Games feature a torch with a unique structure, composed of 10 distinct parts.\n\nCarried by 10,000 people over thousands of miles, the torch, crafted from metal by steel giant Arcelor Mittal, resembles an oval iron pipe with a rounded center.\n\nUpon its arrival, the torch will have been carried to more than 400 locations, including France's overseas territories, until the opening of the event on July 26.\n\nRussian, Belarussian athletes to compete as neutrals\n\nAccording to the International Olympic Committee, athletes from Russia and Belarus will compete under neutral status and will not participate in the opening ceremony.\n\nThe flags, emblems and anthems of Russia and Belarus will not be used, and athletes from these countries must adhere to the same anti-doping regulations as all other participants.\n\nNo officials from the governments of either country will be invited or accredited as part of the games.\n\nThe closing ceremony will take place at the Stade de France national stadium on Sunday, Aug. 11.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu

Us Weekly confirmed on Wednesday, July 24, that the Grammy winner will perform during the opening ceremony, marking her first major show since announcing her stiff-person syndrome diagnosis in December 2022.\n\nFrench Sports Minister Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra previously teased Dion's inclusion in the event during an interview on the French channel TF1's Bonjour breakfast show, hinting that Dion's presence in Paris was \"not by chance,\" per Deadline.\n\nWhen asked whether Dion would make an opening ceremony appearance, Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra, 46, cryptically stated, \"There are a multitude of possible roles in an opening ceremony.\"\n\nScroll down for everything to know about the 2024 Paris Olympics opening ceremony:\n\nThe 4.5-hour opening ceremony will air on NBC, Peacock and the NBC and NBC Olympics apps on July 26 at 1:30 p.m. ET. An encore of the event will air on the network and streamers later that day at 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThe historic opening ceremony will take place along the River Seine. Rather than entering a stadium, athletes will proceed down the river on boats while passing by iconic landmarks such as the Louvre and Notre-Dame. The procession will begin under Austerlitz Bridge and end near the Eiffel Tower.\n\nKelly Clarkson and Peyton Manning will cohost the opening ceremony with NBC sports commentator Mike Tirico. NBC Sports' Maria Taylor will also join Team USA athletes on their boat down the River Seine.\n\n\"I took a little French in high school, and I told my mother I would take her to Paris one day,\" Manning, 48, shared during a March appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon with Clarkson, 42, and Tirico, 57. \"Thirty years to the time I graduated, I'm taking my mom to Paris for the Olympics.\"\n\n\"I have no words, honestly,\" Gauff, 20, said of being bestowed with the honor on the Wednesday, July 24, episode of Today, noting that the news made her cry.\n\n\"I didn't want to cry in front of my teammates,\" she added. \"When Chris [Eubanks] told me, I was holding it in, but when I called my mom, I started crying because I think it's even more special that so many incredible people -- even now I get emotional thinking about it -- but so many incredible people just think that I am worthy of this. It means a lot, truly.\"\n\nJames, meanwhile, was informed he would carry the flag by Olympics teammate Stephen Curry. \"We understand how much of an honor it is to be in that position, and I think Bron's entire career, on and off the court, speak for itself of him being worthy of that honor,\" Curry, 36, said in a video nominating his fellow athlete for the position.\n\nWhile many of the opening ceremony's celebrity performers are being kept under wraps, President Emmanuel Macron confirmed that French singer Aya Nakamura will be among the show's lineup of acts.\n\nIn addition to teasing a now-confirmed appearance from Dion, Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra also hinted that Lady Gaga will take to the stage at the global event. \"We promised you very big artists,\" she said on the TF1's Bonjour breakfast show.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paige_strout@usmagazine.com", "name": "Paige Strout", "type": "author",

Friday's ceremony poses a particular challenge for authorities.\n\nUnlike previous summer Olympics, it will not take place inside a stadium - instead, a flotilla of barges will carry thousands of athletes down the River Seine.\n\nTo keep participants safe, France will impose a no-fly zone of 150km during the ceremony, while snipers will be deployed on the top of buildings along the route. Access to the Seine within that 6km route has now been blocked off to anyone without a special pass or QR code to enter.\n\n\"For as long as the closing ceremony hasn't finished, we need to remain vigilant,\" Tony Estanguet, president of the Paris 2024 Organising Committee, said earlier this week. \"Security is our number one priority for Paris 2024,\" he added.\n\nAccording to Marc Hecker, a security analyst at the French Institute for International Relations, the main security threats facing Paris ahead of the Olympics come from \"jihadis and other terrorist groups from the far right,\" while nonviolent activists also pose a challenge to the smooth running of the games.\n\nAuthorities are particularly stringent about cybersecurity, amid concerns that hackers will attempt to access information from the main France 2024 system. Despite those security challenges, Mr Hecker believes Paris is ready.\n\nHe said: \"They've been preparing for years now, and it will be an amazing deployment of security forces for several weeks. There will be around 45,000 policemen and gendarme for the opening ceremony, plus more than 10,000 soldiers and 20,000 private security officers. The idea, of course, is to maximise the protection, and to minimise the risk. Of course, you cannot annihilate the risk. There will always be one. But the idea is not to accept defeat against terrorism by abandoning this magnificent setting.\"\n\nAround 1,000 officers will be on duty to protect Israel's football match against Mali, meanwhile, where protests are expected, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said.\n\nGarda\u00ed assisting in security operation\n\nAnd it is not just French security personnel who will be on patrol in Paris over the coming weeks.", "source": {"uri": "ifri.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "ifri.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_checkpoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security checkpoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Estanguet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Estanguet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-fly_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "No-fly zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jihadism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\u00e9rald_Darmanin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "G\u00e9rald Darmanin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gendarmerie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garda_S\u00edoch\u00e1na", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_the_Interior_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of the Interior (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mali"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mali"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Safety_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Safety and Security", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Conferences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/styles/vignette_share/public/thumbnails/image/marc_hecker_ifri_rte_irlande.jpg?itok=yzo_-rAM", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

For more of our coverage from the Games, head to our latest updates.\n\nMore than 10,000 athletes have descended on the French capital for more than two weeks of competition, patriotism and potential drama.\n\nThere will be 329 events across 39 sports, including for the first time ever, breaking (aka break-dancing). Competitions will take place as far away as Marseille and Tahiti. Some teams are bringing their own air conditioning to the Olympic Village, which is being cooled by a system of water pipes as part of organizers' effort to host the \"greenest-ever Games.\"\n\nFallout continues from a doping scandal earlier this year, in which nearly two dozen elite Chinese swimmers were cleared by the world's anti-doping agency despite testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug, sparking accusations of a cover-up and, most recently, a U.S. Department of Justice investigation.\n\nOlympic powerhouse Russia, which traditionally sends hundreds of athletes to the games, is sending only around a dozen this year, after years of doping incidents and heightened international condemnation over its war in Ukraine.\n\nAnd of course, there's the Seine, the famously filthy river that winds through Paris and -- after years of promises, $1 billion of investment and some bacteria-related setbacks -- is finally swimmable just in time for the triathlon and long-distance swimming events.\n\nThe Seine is also the site of the opening ceremony on Friday, where some 100 boats carrying tens of thousands of athletes and performers will glide down a 3.7-mile stretch of the river as spectators gather on the river banks to mark what organizers are calling the first outdoor opening ceremony in modern Olympic history.\n\nThe opening ceremony begins at 1:30 p.m. ET (7:30 p.m. in Paris) and is expected to last a little over four hours. The traveling ceremony will work its way from east to west, ending with a final show at the Trocad\u00e9ro\n\nNBC, which has a lock on Olympics coverage, will kick things off with a preview show starting at noon ET. It will broadcast the entire ceremony live on TV and stream it via Peacock, NBCOlympics.com, NBC.com and the NBC/NBC Sports apps.\n\nTheir opening ceremony coverage will be hosted by Kelly Clarkson, Peyton Manning and Mike Tirico, with contributions from Today hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb.\n\nAnd don't worry if you can't give the spectacle your full attention in the middle of the day. NPR will be live blogging the opening ceremony throughout the afternoon right on NPR.org, and NBC will stream the ceremony again in primetime starting at 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThere are 16 days of competition between Friday's production and the closing ceremony, on August 11. You can see the full schedule here.\n\nAnd despite the six-hour time difference, NBC says U.S.-based viewers will still be able to watch many of the most anticipated events live.\n\nCompetition times will run from roughly 3 a.m. ET to 6 p.m. ET, and the network plans to provide at least nine hours of coverage each day.\n\nThat includes carrying live competitions during the mornings and afternoons (both on TV and streaming online and on apps) and a three-hour \"enhanced Olympic primetime show\" each evening, consisting of highlights and behind-the-scenes moments from the day's events.\n\nViewers can also follow along via NBC Olympics' social media accounts, including on Instagram, X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok.\n\nAnd of course, NPR's own Olympics team will bring you recaps, coverage and color -- including on the ground in Paris -- online and on air over the next few weeks.\n\nYou can find all of NPR's Paris Olympics stories (past, present and upcoming) here on our website.\n\nTo listen to our broadcast coverage, tune to your local NPR station and stream our radio programming on npr.org or the NPR app.\n\nYou can also subscribe to our newsletters, including the daily Up First morning newsletter, for updates and analysis straight to your inbox.", "source": {"uri": "bpr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "bpr.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, 80 giant screens have been set up across the city to make the live telecast available to the Parisians.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FTox7uO7nA\n\nThe highlight of the Opening Ceremony is the 6 km boat parade on the river Seine. The Austerlitz Bridge near the Jardin des Plantes is the starting point of the parade. Trocad\u00e9ro has been decided as the point of conclusion for this year's Paris Olympics. There will be approximately 94 boats which will sail across the River Seine which will carry around 10,500 people.\n\nThe fashion capital of the world is also set to get a whole new fashion makeover. Athletes from each contingent are set to wear the traditional outfit which signifies the culture of their country.\n\nIndia and France share a time difference of 3 hours and 30 minutes behind. So, the Indian fans will have a lot of adjustments to their clock dials to be on time throughout the Olympics to keep track of the events. The opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics is scheduled to take place on the 26th of July at 8:24 pm (local time).\n\nOn the other hand, after a nonstop action for three weeks, the Olympics will close on the 11th of August around 3:00 pm (local time).\n\nIndian fans who are thousands of kilometres away from the actual action will be able to watch the opening ceremony live on the Jio Cinema app.", "source": {"uri": "newsroompost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsroomPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "soumyaroop_mukherjee@newsroompost.com", "name": "Soumyaroop Mukherjee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jardin_des_plantes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jardin des plantes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Austerlitz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Austerlitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocad\u00e9ro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trocad\u00e9ro"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JioCinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JioCinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://newsroompost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/picture-20.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 1527, "textEnd": 1539}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 1656, "textEnd": 1670}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

With events spread across iconic venues in France and free viewing options for Indian audiences, the Games promise a historic and inclusive celebration.The 2024 Paris Olympics, set to take place from July 26 to August 11, is poised to be a landmark event, as Paris prepares to host the Games for the third time. The City of Light first hosted the Olympics in 1900 and again in 1924, making this edition historically significant.\n\nThe opening ceremony on July 26 will break away from tradition, featuring a magnificent boat parade along the Seine River instead of a stadium setting. This spectacle will see athletes aboard a fleet of boats, with the parade reaching its climax at the Jardins du Trocadero. Spectators will line the riverbanks, with bleachers accommodating 300,000 people. The ceremony coincides with the closing date of the 1924 Paris Olympics, creating a historic link.\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics will introduce new sports, including Breaking, featuring solo battles for men and women, and Extreme Slalom in Canoe Slalom, where four athletes race simultaneously. Sailing will see new categories such as IQFoil (windsurfing) and formula kite. Additionally, mixed events will be added in athletics, shooting, and sailing, with the 35km walking mixed relay, Skeet mixed team event, and mixed Dinghy, respectively. This emphasis on new sports and mixed events underscores the organizers' commitment to gender equality and inclusivity.\n\nThe Games will utilize 35 venues, primarily within Paris and its surrounding areas, but also extending to other cities like Marseille, Lyon, Chateauroux, and Bordeaux. The Stade de France will host athletics and rugby sevens, while the Stade Roland Garros will showcase tennis and boxing. Swimming events will be held at both the Paris La Defense Arena and the Paris Aquatic Centre.\n\nNotably, some competitions will take place at iconic landmarks, such as beach volleyball beneath the Eiffel Tower and various sports at La Concorde. Fencing and taekwondo will be hosted at the Grand Palais, with the Marathon starting at the Hotel de Ville. Beyond Paris, football matches will be held across France, sailing in Marseille, and surfing in Tahiti.\n\nIn a remarkable twist, the medals for the Paris Games will include a piece of the city's history. Chaumet, a prestigious French luxury jeweler, will incorporate 18 grams of iron from the Eiffel Tower into the gold, silver, and bronze medals. These unique medals will be awarded to athletes at both the Olympics and Paralympics, adding a touch of Parisian heritage to their achievements.\n\nThe official mascot, \"Freege,\" inspired by the Phrygian hat, symbolizes freedom and the French Republic. For those interested in attending, tickets are available only through the official resale platform on the Paris 2024 website.\n\nIndian viewers can watch the Paris Olympics for free through Jio Cinema and the Sports18 TV network. This coverage will feature an \"India Feed\" to closely follow the nation's athletes, with 20 simultaneous feeds ensuring comprehensive coverage.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com",

Races will take place in its streets and in the river that makes up its heart and soul, and millions from around the world are making their way to France to take part in the quadrennial festivities.\n\nHere are five things to expect from the host city as the games get underway.\n\nA background for the Games unlike any other\n\nOne hundred years after the Olympics were last in Paris, the City of Light is poised to show off its world-famous sights.\n\nPerhaps the most iconic image already making the rounds on social media is the beach volleyball court located in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. The 137-year-old landmark looms over the court, enjoying its free ticket to watch the matches below.\n\nBut other classic Paris locations will be worked into the competitions as well.\n\nThe Place de la Concorde in central Paris will play host to multiple events, including skateboarding and 3\u00d73 basketball, as one of the city's largest squares turns into an Olympic venue. The Trocadero will be the final stop of Friday's Opening Ceremony, in which athletes will disembark boats that float down the Seine (we'll have more to say on that in a moment). Versailles will host equestrian competitions on the grounds that were once walked by the very top of French society.\n\nAnd Pont Alexandre III, the beautiful bridge that crosses the Seine, will be the start and finish line of multiple events that take place throughout the city.\n\nParis is one of the world's most beautiful locations, its architecture known worldwide. Those scenes and sights will make for some of the most distinct Olympic imagery in recent decades.\n\nThe return of fans in earnest\n\nLet's face it: The last couple Olympics have been weird.\n\nThe 2020 Summer Games were actually held in 2021 in Tokyo, playing out in front of virtually no fans amid lockdowns from the Covid-19 pandemic and travel restrictions still in place throughout the world.\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympic Games in China were held as that country still pursued its zero-Covid strategy, dramatically limiting the number of foreigners who could get into the country to cheer on their nations' athletes. While Chinese spectators were allowed, masks were still commonplace and noise was limited in order to comply with Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nBut as the world has moved on from the pandemic, and the Games moved to one of the most iconic travel locations in the world, fans are expected back in their millions.\n\nThe Games will be loud with nearly 9 million tickets having been sold for Olympic events as of earlier this month. Expect a celebratory atmosphere as Olympians are once again able to be cheered on by spectators from around the world, some of whom have traveled thousands of miles to see them compete.\n\nAll of France gets its chance to show off\n\nThese are the Paris Olympics, but they're not only being held in the country's capital.\n\nNice, Marseille, Bordeaux, Nantes, Lyon, Chateauroux and even Tahiti will all get their chance to partake in the Olympic spirit by hosting competitions. The 2024 Summer Games were organized with a mind to put the entire French nation on display, including its more tropical territories.\n\nThe various competitions will bring in thousands of spectators for major sports, including soccer and basketball, to cities hours away from Paris.\n\nIt's a boon for the local economies and also for the Olympic traveler who will get a chance to see the rest of France during the two weeks of competition.\n\nA Games focused on sustainability\n\nAs part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \"most responsible and sustainable games in history,\" organizers are building something that's meant to last.\n\n\"This village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\" said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \"Paris 2024 is renting it for a few months.\"\n\nInstead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else's home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village -- which contains 82 buildings -- will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people.\n\nOrganizers add that the Games is expected to run on 100% renewable energy.\n\nThe village itself will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics.\n\nParis' famed (or infamous, depending on the day's temperature) lack of air conditioning will also be a focus of energy efficiency.\n\nWhile the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning.\n\nThis system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment.\n\nThat cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter.\n\nThe Seine\n\nAnd then there's the Seine, the city's iconic river that splits Paris in two.\n\nThe river has been the focus of much scrutiny in the lead up to competition. Set to be the scene of the Opening Ceremonies and long-distance swimming competitions, the water quality and the current have both been closely watched.\n\nCity leaders - and a CNN correspondent - have been leaping into the river to prove that they believe it's safe to swim in ahead of competition.\n\nTriathlon events are due to start at the city's Alexandre III Bridge later this month, but official testing by the city has shown E. coli bacteria levels have been above acceptable levels on the majority of days between June 3 and July 2, which would potentially expose athletes to serious health risks.\n\nDespite a 1.4 billion Euro ($1.5 billion) clean-up plan for the Seine, where swimming has been illegal for more than 100 years due to pollution levels, concerns remain over the river's suitability for swimming events.\n\nThe Opening Ceremony of the Paris Olympics is set to take place on the Seine on July 26 if currents are not too strong, and Paris 2024 shares the view that sunshine and higher temperatures have brought about a significant improvement in water quality, CNN previously reported.\n\nBut, keep an eye on the weather: A recent rehearsal on June 24 was cancelled due to strong water flows caused by heavy rainfall. Another one could cause a last-minute scramble to ensure an extremely unique Opening Ceremony goes off as planned.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The long-awaited Summer Games will begin in Paris tomorrow with a spectacular evening parade of 85 boats and barges along the iconic River Seine.\n\nThis unique, creative opening ceremony, featuring over 10,000 athletes and dignitaries from the teams, will include a resplendent Pharaonic spectacle that evokes ancient Egypt as much as modern France.\n\nThe Games arrived after years of preparations, with traffic disruptions that were bad even by Parisian standards and a security lockdown in large parts of the city.\n\nNot surprisingly, many Parisians have left the city to avoid the crowding and traffic jams. Tourism is down, too, and the city is quieter than usual.\n\nThough the Games cost nearly $10 billion (about 361 billion baht) they have not been as costly as recent Olympiads. Surprisingly it has also not over budget. Moreover, construction was integrated into preexisting venues and buildings, thus causing a lower \"carbon footprint\".\n\nNaturally, the Games have not been without controversy; Anne Hidalgo, the Socialist mayor of Paris, barred the Total Energy group as a sponsor. Instead, there's the luxury goods company LVMH.\n\nThe risk of swimming in the otherwise polluted River Seine was challenged when Ms Hidalgo took a quick dip while wearing a wetsuit in a publicity-staged and paradoxical event.\n\nSecurity is tight the week preceding the waterborne opening ceremony with 45,000 police and Gendarmes sealing off both sides of the Seine with metal fencing for over 3kms in an already dense and historic urban environment.\n\nPeople living in the affected zone need special QR codes on their phones to access their own neighbourhoods and homes in chic areas. A week before the events, public transport has been restricted in large parts of Paris.\n\nEven pedestrian and bicycle movement were highly restricted. When walking through well-known streets and haunts near the river, I noticed various checkpoints needed QR codes for local movement.\n\nMunicipal police, national police, and the Gendarmerie, often with automatic rifles, controlled movement.\n\nSuch area control evoked Paris during the Covid-19 pandemic when local lockdowns reached absurd levels.\n\nA further 18,000 military reinforced security against terrorist threats, especially rooftop security along the river and providing anti-drone technology. Special security speedboats were deployed on the river, and Swat teams were prepared for any eventuality.\n\nNewly constructed spectator seating lined large swaths of the Seine, where 10,000 athletes will stage a waterborne parade tomorrow ending at the Eiffel Tower and the Trocadero. About 300,000 spectators are expected to line the Seine for the spectacular event.\n\nThe Summer Games slated between July 26 and Aug 11 -- followed by the Paris Para-Olympics --will host 24,000 athletes from around the world as well as hundreds of thousands of spectators.\n\nAmong more than 30 traditional sporting competitions, including boxing, sailing, swimming, soccer, and judo, the Paris committee is introducing a new sport this Olympiad -- breakdancing. The athletes will compete for 329 gold medals.\n\nVenues range from the splendid skatepark in the newly created urban park in the central Place de la Concorde to swimming in new aquatic stadiums in St Denis, to taekwondo in the historic Grand Palais in central Paris, home to the 1900 Grand Expo, to equestrian events in the gardens of the Palace of Versailles.\n\nWhile most events are in the Paris region, such as beach volleyball at the Eiffel Tower in a new 13,000-seat pop-up stadium, sailing competitions will take place halfway around the world in French Polynesia.\n\nSome 14,000 athletes will stay at the newly built Olympic Village in St Denis. Following the Games, the village will become affordable housing in this poorer part of suburban Paris.\n\nIn parallel, many of the larger teams will host special hospitality venues; Team USA House is located in the historic Palais Brongniart in central Paris. Korea House is in the Maison de Chimie, prestigiously situated near the Parliament. Denmark has a great place on the central Champs Elysees.\n\nFor those without pricy tickets to see sporting events, the Hotel de Ville (City Hall) has a spectacular \"fan zone\" with continuous video and live events.\n\nBruno Jeudy of the weekly La Tribune Dimanche wrote editorially, \"In the end, let's not forget the last step associated with Olympianism; Excellence.\"\n\nJohn J Metzler is a United Nations correspondent covering diplomatic and defence issues.

It is supposed to be a spectacular scene, watched from the shores by millions of spectators.\n\nDan Lovinger, president, Olympic & Paralympic Partnerships atNBCUniversal. told Broadcasting+Cable that when Molly Solomon, the executive producer for NBC's Olympic coverage, got a first look at the run of show for the opening ceremony, she said, \"We're not going to want to break away.\"\n\nNBCU went to the ring-holder sponsors of its Olympic coverage, official sponsors with the right to place their logos alongside the Olympic rings and other trademarks, and they agreed to the commercial-free arrangement as part of their overall ad packages.\n\n\"They're going to get a lot of exposure, but we're never going to leave the action,\" Lovinger said. \"It will be a spectacle like nothing else,\" he said, noting that opportunities like this show that \"there are real tangible benefits to being a ring holder.\"\n\n\"At The Coca-Cola Company, we believe in the real magic that can happen when the world comes together, so being a part of this spectacular presentation of the Opening Ceremony on NBC is a tremendous opportunity to celebrate and share those unifying and inspiring moments,\" Coca-Cola North America VP, integrated marketing Robin Triplett said. \"We're proud of our 96-year-long relationship with the Olympic Movement and look forward to bringing our portfolio of brands to fans throughout the Olympic Games Paris 2024.\"\n\nThe Paris Olympics have generated more than $1.2 billion in advertising revenue, a record for NBCU and its parent Comcast.\n\nCoverage of the opening ceremonies will be hosted by NBC Olympics primetime host Mike Tirico, alongside Kelly Clarkson and Peyton Manning. NBC Sports' Maria Taylor will be on the Team USA boat, while Today hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb will cover the ceremony from a bridge along the route.\n\nOpening ceremony reporters include Melissa Stark and Andrea Joyce, who will report from the red carpet.\n\nAward-winning director Thomas Jolly is the artistic director for the opening ceremony.", "source": {"uri": "nexttv.com",

At the 2024 Paris Olympics, there will be three times as many. The French capital is \"rolling out the largest peacetime security operation in the country's history\" to protect around 10,500 athletes, 100 world leaders, and more than 10 million visitors for the Games beginning Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reports. Officials say up to 45,000 police, 10,000 soldiers, and 22,000 private security guards will be on hand. For Friday's opening ceremony on the Seine, to attract 300,000 onlookers, police will be stationed every 6 feet along the riverbank, which has been blocked from the public for a week.\n\nUnlike London, which relegated festivities to the outskirts of the city, Paris is bringing the action to iconic locales at its heart. Place de la Concorde, Paris' largest public square, is hosting BMX bike races, skateboarding, and breakdancing; the Eiffel Tower is hosting beach volleyball; the 17th-century Invalides military complex, home of Napoleon's tomb, is hosting archery events; the Grand Palais historic site and museum is hosting fencing and taekwondo; and the Seine is hosting the opening ceremony. The idea is \"to allow access for as many people as possible,\" Nicolas Nordman, deputy mayor of Paris in charge of security, tells the Journal. \"That means the security challenges are clearly more significant than doing this in a stadium.\"\n\nFor the first time, US police departments will be assisting an overseas Olympics host. Officers from New York, Los Angeles, and Virginia's Fairfax County will join some 1,750 foreign police from dozens of countries, per the BBC and Journal. French officials say there have been no specific threats, though they're preparing for potential attacks by Islamist militants and sabotage stemming from Russia or Iran.\n\nAuthorities said Tuesday that a Russian man was arrested and charged with planning an operation to sow disorder. Some 45,000 police will be deployed for the opening ceremony and 30,000 for each subsequent day, with private security and soldiers to intervene in case of a terror attack, per the Guardian. Additionally, 44,000 barriers have been erected, and numerous roads and Metro stations have been closed.

The scandal has once again raised the issue of the treatment of horses in sports.\n\nThe Netherlands have found themselves under the spotlight after convicted rapist Steven van de Velde was selected for their volleyball team.\n\nVan de Velde was sentenced to four years in prison in 2016 after pleading guilty to raping a 12-year-old girl when he was 19.\n\nThe now 29-year-old will not be staying at the Olympic Village and comments from his teammates defending him and the Dutch team boss' 'surprise' at the reaction to his selection have courted more controversy.\n\nWhile the International Olympic Committee (IOC) permits athletes to wear a hijab, host team France have imposed a ban on their own competitors from wearing the Muslim headscarf. Amnesty International have described the ban as 'racist gender discrimination'.\n\nIsraeli athletes will be given round-the-clock security protection at the Olympics after a French MP said they 'are not welcome in Paris' because of the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nIn a related incident, Adidas pulled an advert featuring Bella Hadid that made reference to the 1972 Munich Olympics where 11 Israeli athletes were killed in a terrorist attack.\n\nCanada sacked two staff members from their women's football team after they used a drone to fly over and film the training sessions of rivals New Zealand ahead of their match.\n\nWith the opening ceremony, triathlon and marathon swimming events taking place on the Seine, the French government have spent \u20ac1.4billion to clean up the river that has been illegal to swim in for a century due to high pollution levels.\n\nHas it worked? Well, until very recently the Seine was still failing water quality tests for E coli but organisers are confident it is now safe - that is unless a so-called 'sh*t flashmob' doesn't happen.\n\nIn a bid to make Paris 2024 the greenest games in history, the Olympic village was built with eco-friendly water pumps rather than air conditioning units.\n\nBut with temperatures set to surpass 30C, several delegations, including Team GB, have forked out on hiring 2,500 of their own AC units in order to stay cool.\n\nEarlier this year it was revealed that 23 Chinese swimmers - 11 of whom will compete in Paris - had tested positive for banned substance TMZ ahead of the last games in Tokyo.\n\nThough they were cleared to compete, the World Ant-Doping Agency's handling of the investigation and decision to keep it private for three years has been widely criticised.\n\nMORE : Team GB star explains why she's snubbing Paris Olympics opening ceremony", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk",

which is set to smash previous attendances.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Australia's participation in this year's ceremony.\n\nMORE: Australian Olympics squad for Paris 2024\n\nAustralia will be country No. 203 of 205 introduced during the Parade of Nations.\n\nIn the past, Australia have been involved early in the ceremony because of their position in the alphabet.\n\nHowever, as the host of the upcoming 2032 Games in Brisbane, they will be the third-last nation to be announced.\n\nThe United States - who are hosting in Los Angeles in 2028 - will follow, with the current hosts France held until the end.\n\nIt's unclear exactly what time Australia's athletes will be introduced.\n\nFans will want to keep an eye out for Zimbabwe, who are the last nation on the list before the green and gold.\n\nThe full Parade of Nations order is below.\n\nThe opening ceremony will begin at 7:30 pm local time on Friday, July 26.\n\nThat equates to a 3:30 am AEST start on Saturday, July 27 for Australian east coast viewers.\n\nIt is forecast to last roughly four hours, with a 'climax' two hours in.\n\nIn line with tradition, Greece will be the first out in the Parade of Nations, followed by the Refugee Olympic Team.\n\nNations will then be introduced in alphabetical order using the French language.\n\nThis means countries like South Africa (Afrique du Sud) and Germany (Allemagne) are earlier than usual.\n\nAussie fans can tune in to the opening ceremony on free-to-air television via Channel 9.\n\nIt will also be available to stream on 9Now and Stan Sport, with the latter providing

Instead, it will be done on the Seine, the river that crosses the centre of Paris.\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics, scheduled to take place from July 26 to August 11, promises to be a groundbreaking event. This edition of the Games marks a significant milestone, as Paris becomes the first city to host the Olympics three times, following previous events in 1900 and 1924. The Games will feature 32 sports and 329 medal events, with a focus on innovation and inclusivity.\n\nOne of the most notable additions to the Olympic program is breaking, an urban dance style that originated in the United States in the 1970s. Breaking will make its Olympic debut with two events, one for men and one for women, where 16 B-Boys and 16 B-Girls will compete in solo battles. This inclusion reflects the Olympic Movement's commitment to embracing new and diverse forms of athletic expression.\n\nThe Paris 2024 Games will also introduce several new mixed events, including the 35km walking mixed relay in athletics, the Skeet mixed team event in shooting, and the mixed Dinghy in sailing. These additions aim to promote greater gender equality and diversity in Olympic competitions.\n\nThe event will feature a unique Opening Ceremony, held on the Seine River rather than in a stadium, marking a departure from traditional Olympic ceremonies. The Games will also make use of iconic Parisian landmarks, such as the Champ de Mars for beach volleyball and the Grand Palais for fencing and taekwondo.\n\nIn addition to the sporting events, the Paris 2024 Organising Committee has placed a strong emphasis on socio-economic impact. The Games are expected to generate significant employment opportunities, with a focus on supporting small businesses and promoting social enterprises.\n\nOverall, the 2024 Paris Olympics promises to be a memorable and transformative event, blending tradition with innovation and showcasing the power of sport to bring people together and drive positive change.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre_zero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kilometre zero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Street dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeet_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skeet shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Palais", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Palais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opening ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champ_de_Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Champ de Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taekwondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beach volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sailing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern Pentathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/misc/icon-512x512.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "dateEnd": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 214, "textEnd": 234}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

The opening ceremony, expected to be inclusive and unique, is a major highlight with an estimated 300,000 spectators along the Eiffel Tower and Seine River to witness delegations. The Champions Park, where athletes celebrate with fans, is a popular venue. There is an unmistakable buzz in Paris. The French capital has become a global melting pot with athletes and fans from across the world converging here.\n\nThe anticipation is palpable, especially for the opening ceremony, which promises to be different and inclusive.\n\n\"An estimated 3,00,000 people are expected to be there around the Eiffel Tower and the Seine to watch the delegations come down the river,\" says Christian Klaue, Corporate Affairs Director of the IOC.\n\nFans are particularly excited about the Champions Park, a new addition that will see athletes celebrating their medals and achievements with fans.\n\n\"I did not get tickets to some of the events because they are either sold out and too expensive. But I plan to spend a lot of time in the Champions Park because it is open to the public and a number of athletes will come here,\" says a Jamaican fan, who has flown in from London having saved up for the last two years.\n\nThe airport arrivals have been handled well by the organisers. Once you reach the Charles de Gaulle (CDG) airport, it doesn't take more than 30 minutes to clear immigration and collect luggage. Surprisingly, language hasn't been an issue so far. While there is decent branding in the airport, the commute from CDG to the city could have been better done up. Having said that, once you are in the city its Olympics everywhere. The athletes too are satisfied with what they have in the village.\n\n\"The best part is we have been told there are baking classes for us if we want. Chefs will teach us how to bake in an attempt to help us relieve stress,\" says an Indian athlete.\n\nWhile only a few have taken up the offer so far, the consensus is that the six restaurants set up to serve for dining are top-notch. The Main Press Centre is fully functional.\n\nThe volunteers speak reasonable English and are efficient in their job. Transportation, a perennial concern, could certainly be improved. However, with 48 hours until the opening ceremony, there is time to smooth out any wrinkles.\n\nUndoubtedly, the highlight was the torch relay.\n\nThe flame has reached Paris and will make its way to the Olympic Stadium on the 26th. Abhinav Bindra, who took part in the relay and ran with the torch around 4:00 pm Paris time, said, \"The Olympic torch is a symbol of peace and unity. To be able to do this is always an honour and a privilege. I hope this will be one of the best Games ever and the Indian contingent will have an excellent Olympics.\"\n\nThe event, which was held in Gennevilliers, saw an outpouring of fan enthusiasm, with families and children lining the streets to cheer on the runners.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement in the organisers' communication. For example, Airline staff both in India and in Dubai and Abu Dhabi are unaware that the media accreditation cards also serve as the visa for Paris.\n\nAlmost every journalist coming in from India has had an issue with airline officials and immigration staff, leading to questioning and inconvenience.\n\nBetter communication from the French embassy and a directive to the airlines and to immigration officials could ease travel hassles.\n\nAnother issue is the accreditation validation booth at CDG, which closes at 8pm.\n\nThis has caused a lot of trouble for journalists coming in. Without a validated accreditation, access to transport is unavailable, leaving expensive taxis as the only option. The greatest global sporting spectacle, the Olympic Games, is finally here. With 24 hours left for the opening ceremony, all eyes are on Paris.\n\nAfter the Covidaffected Olympics Games in Tokyo three years ago, it is a massive relief to see a return to normal. Now to seeing PV Sindhu and Sharath Kamal walk into the stadium carrying the tri-colour and the best Indian campaign of all time with India touching the coveted double digit medal haul.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_pot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melting pot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles de Gaulle Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_flame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic flame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles de Gaulle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Sindhu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P.

But a \"lockdown\" that reminds him of the pandemic, a part of the strict security measures before Friday's opening ceremony, means business is slow and the serveur's tips have dried up. So, he's grumpy.\n\nAnd he isn't the only one. The Games are here and the locals seem testy.\n\nThen again, Simon Kuper issues a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer. \"Parisians complain about everything all the time,\" says the British-French author.\n\nA lament can be a conversation starter. Be it 'se plaindre' (grumbling generally), 'raler' (complaining for fun), or 'faire la gueule' (sulking).\n\nThey crib that the build-up has been mired in political turmoil of Olympic proportions. Scoff over the tripling public transport rates, the sudden metro station closures and the out-of-bounds city centre. They whine about the rats swimming in the Seine. And worry that the balconies of the Haussmann-era buildings along the iconic river may not be able to take the weight of the crowds expected to gather there to watch the opening ceremony.\n\nComplaining, in this Olympic season, has become a medal sport. But like any host fearing that everything could go wrong when the guests turn up, the last-minute jitters and trepidation are finely counter-balanced with growing excitement and fervent hope.\n\nHeld amid the Covid pandemic in 2021, the Japanese capital was forced to close the doors of its majestic stadiums to the public. The closest the locals got to any sporting action was standing outside the fenced arenas or around the street corners, taking photos of the buses ferrying athletes.\n\nIn contrast, the French capital has been transformed into one giant stadium. For the next three weeks, its iconic monuments -- the Eiffel Tower, Grand Palais, Invalides and Place de la Concorde -- will turn into playgrounds.\n\nThe reduced access and temporary structures around these landmark sites may be a source of irritation for the tourists who have braved the Olympic surge to make Paris their summer destination. But the athletes who competed in front of empty stands three years ago, performing to pre-recorded claps and AI-generated chants, will write their scripts in postcard-perfect surroundings.\n\nParis hasn't bothered with constructing modern-day coliseums and draping the entire city with Olympic brandings. But, in its typical understated, effortless fashion, the Olympics is all you see wherever you look.\n\nThe ubiquitous five rings that adorn the Eiffel Tower also hang gracefully on the terminal of the Charles de Gaulle airport. The Games' colours are splashed on the streets and the dedicated Olympic lanes will ensure the athletes don't get stuck in traffic in this city where more people travel on bicycles than anywhere in the world.\n\nThe drivers moan as their cars oscillate between the first and second gears in bumper-to-bumper traffic, but won't steer into the empty 'Jeux' (Games) lanes, fearing a 135-euro (roughly Rs 12,200) fine.\n\nThere's nothing more audacious, however, than Friday's opening ceremony on the River Seine, which will see a flotilla of more than 200 boats in an outdoor celebration that's never been seen before.\n\nThe creative director of the opening ceremony, Thomas Jolly, called the idea \"typically French\", which, in essence, means there's a compulsion \"to not be like everyone else\". \"Secondly, a little bit of insolence,\" the 42-year-old theatre actor said. \"Thirdly, audacity -- which can sometimes come across as arrogance, which, let's be honest, is the case with France.\"\n\nThe instinct to wow the world has come at a price. The days leading up to the ceremony have been most disruptive. Cars are being stopped and searched every second kilometre. Pedestrians and cyclists have had to register for special QR codes to access the secured zones around the Seine. Both banks of the river have been shut down, leading to businesses -- from booksellers to souvenir shops to restaurants -- facing a practical closure.\n\nSimon Kuper, the author of 'Impossible City: Paris in the Twenty-First Century', says the people who live or work by the river have been in \"a kind of lockdown for days around the opening ceremony\". \"So, to go to the supermarket, you need a pass. If you want to have a friend for dinner two days before the opening ceremony, you have to register that friend with the police. And the police have to see that he's not a security risk,\" Kuper says.\n\nAnd so, the Parisians complain. Thousands have even left the city -- or plan to in the next few days. But as Tokyo showed even in the harshest of conditions, once the Games are declared open and elite sport begins, all the noise fades into the background.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mihir_vasavda@indianexpress.com", "name": "Mihir Vasavda", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasserie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brasserie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metro station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Kuper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simon Kuper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Palais", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Palais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Invalides", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Les Invalides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_la_Concorde", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Place de la Concorde"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playground", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playground"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles de Gaulle Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noise pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedestrian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 19}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/New-Project-2024-07-25T083802.349.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Olympic Games 2024: From 'Chariots of Fire' to 'Munich' Here Are Must-Watch Iconic Films Around the World's Biggest Sporting Event.\n\nLady Gaga's recent Parisian sojourn has sent fans into a frenzy of speculation about her potential involvement in the 2024 Olympics opening ceremony. With the event set on the Seine, the flamboyant pop star seems a natural fit for the dramatic spectacle. The Olympic Committee's cryptic teaser featuring a chrome-clad figure has only fuelled the rumours, with fans drawing parallels to Gaga's Chromatica era. Even the presence of a piano near the ceremony site has become a focal point of online detective work.\n\nCeline Dion, whose life has been significantly affected by stiff person syndrome, has not taken the stage in four years but remains determined to return. French media outlets have speculated about a potential Olympics opening ceremony performance after footage surfaced of Dion smiling and walking in Paris. According to French radio station RTL, she arrived in Paris via private jet at Le Bourget airport on Monday (July 22( evening and was scheduled for a fitting at the Dior fashion house on Tuesday (July 23) afternoon.\n\nFrench-Malian singer Aya Nakamura has sparked interest amid speculation that she could bring vibrant R&B to the Seine scene. According to BBC reports, she might perform a Chanson-style song by iconic French singer Edith Piaf. Additionally, Christine and the Queens is also in consideration due to his past involvement with the Games. It's even said that electronic duo Daft Punk might be part of the Paris Olympics' opening ceremony.

India House is set up at Parc de la Villette in Paris. Shaan has revealed that his performance will include a variety of tracks, among them an unreleased song initially planned for the Kartik Aaryan-starrer Chandu Champion. Joining him on the global stage will be the Raghu Dixit Project (Indian contemporary folk band), Penn Masala (musical group), Tommy Khosla & Jawari, promising a rich cultural showcase at this prestigious sporting event.\n\nFor the unversed, the Paris 2024 Olympics will commence with a historic Opening Ceremony on the Seine on Friday, July 26.

Many from the country's contingent of 117 athletes have trickled into the Games Village, and already ticking a few to-do boxes -- selfies with Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz, for instance.\n\nThey are here to do more than just that, though.\n\nHockey goalkeeper PR Sreejesh -- the photo of him sitting atop the goalpost after the men's team won bronze was a standout moment of the Tokyo Games of 2021 -- is eager to sign off on his international career with even finer memories. \"When we entered the Village, everyone was like 'let's do something better than last time',\" Sreejesh, gearing up for his fourth Games, told HT on Wednesday. \"Earlier, we were there to participate in the Olympics. Now, every player here has some sort of motto!\"\n\nThat motto, from the larger Indian perspective on the back of the country's best-ever seven-medal show at Tokyo 2020, would be to match that at least, or better, surpass it. A double-digit medal haul in Paris would be an ideal extension to their \"sau paar\" (100-plus) Hangzhou Asian Games exploits of last year.\n\nIt will, make no mistake, take some doing.\n\nLike it has for the Paris Games to reach this point. The build-up was a tad shaky and a touch political. Snap elections in France, protests against staging the Games, and concerns around the safety of the River Seine, which will not only host some swimming events but also the opening ceremony, have darkened the countdown clock for the first Olympics of a post-Covid world.\n\nThe banners and flags, and the increased presence of security give Paris the Olympics feel, though the buzz is yet to fully resonate across the French capital. On most streets, it's business as usual, and a fair share of Parisians (known, after all, to be grumpier than most) say they would rather leave the city for these two weeks. A dedicated traffic lane for Games-specific vehicles has frustrated the city's cabbies.\n\nEven as the finishing touches are still being applied along the Seine for the opening ceremony, a college-going volunteer says reassuringly that it will work out just fine. \"Here in Paris, things take some time,\" he said, smiling.\n\nAlmost none of Olympics set-up has been built from scratch for these Games. From venues to the Village, refining, repackaging and repurposing have been the buzzwords to go with the larger green theme of Paris 2024. Of the 35 venues put into action, from those in the heart of Paris to faraway cities of Marseille and Chateauroux, a majority were either pre-existing or are temporary.\n\nThe Yves-du-Manoir Stadium, in which Sreejesh and his team mates trained on Wednesday, for instance, wears the rare badge of honour of playing host twice in Olympic history. In 1924, it stood witness to the glitz of the opening ceremony and speed of the Flying Finn (Paavo Nurmi swept to five gold medals in that edition) during the athletics events. A century on, slick dribbles and ferocious flicks will be on show here.\n\nSome of Paris's most iconic structures will also be in play. Beach volleyball will be held by the Eiffel Tower, and equestrian events will take place at the Palace of Versailles.\n\nThe Aquatics Centre hosting artistic swimming, diving and water polo is the only permanent structure built specifically for Paris 2024. In the summer of 2025, however, the 6,000-seat facility will become a massive multi-sports facility open to all in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe green carpet extends to the design of the athletes Village, erected across three communes. The 54-hectare space, which holds 82 buildings, will turn into office spaces and homes for thousands of people post the Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nThen, some existing structures have been revamped. The Halle Maxwell, a large gymnasium stacked with over 350 pieces of equipment for athletes to use inside the Village, is at a site that was an industrial hub which pumped in electricity to the heart of the city in the 20th century. And the Cite du Cinema, a film studio founded by auteur Luc Besson, is now used as a training ground within the Village for weightlifters, wrestlers and fencers.\n\nSo, as reel life makes way for drama in real life, this connection sums up the look and feel of the Paris Olympics. The city of art, culture and love is decorated with a distinctly sporting makeup. And, within it's glorious confines, India will look to paint the town rouge.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The budget for the 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games is \u00adestimated at $10 billion US.\n\nIn the end, the Victoria Games opening ceremony was held at Centennial Stadium on the \u00adUniversity of Victoria campus before a crowd of 35,000, including Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.\n\n\"The floating stadium in the Inner Harbour made a lot of sense and was very much do-able. But it was low-hanging fruit to be picked off in terms of cost \u00adsavings,\" said Terry Williams, senior architect for the floating-stadium plans.\n\nStill, many on the Island with long memories will watch wistfully Friday as Paris' ambitious opening plays out, wondering what could have been.\n\n\"It caught people's imaginations at the time,\" said Williams. \"It would have been fabulous for Victoria, which I have always envisioned as the Prague of the Pacific. I will watch with interest how Paris uses the Seine for its opening ceremony Friday.\"\n\nWith the 30th anniversary of the 1994 Victoria Games set to be celebrated next month, the story of the floating ceremony that didn't happen still reverberates.\n\nWilliams, who was also senior architect of Centennial Stadium's temporary expansion for the Games, has been a proponent over the years of making better use of the Inner Harbour, particularly Ship Point.\n\nChris Gower, who was junior architect for the Victoria Inner Harbour opening-ceremony concept under Williams, and later worked on the Centennial Stadium temporary expansion for the Games, said while the floating ceremony never happened in Victoria, it \"showed we don't think like a provincial backwater.\"\n\n\"An idea that little ol' Victoria came up with three decades ago will be done, in its own way, by Paris,\" Gower said.\n\nThe Paris Olympics opening ceremony (10 a.m. PT Friday on CBC) will feature a six-kilometre flotilla of athletes and performers on the Seine River passing under historic bridges and by many of the city's iconic structures, such as Notre Dame Cathedral and The Louvre Museum.\n\nThe original plans for a free and open ceremony, watched by two to three million people on the banks of the river, have been scaled back to 250,000 ticketed spectators due to security concerns.\n\nFurther affecting preparations is the weather, which will be hot, but with a 60 per cent chance of rain.\n\nVictoria can certainly tell Paris a thing or two about best-laid plans.\n\n[email protected]\n\n>>>

And although these areas remain eerily quiet for now, protected by a network of high-security metal barriers, there was a festival atmosphere just up the street at the Arc de Triomphe, where people from all over the world had gathered.\n\nStream every moment and every medal of the 2024 Paris Olympics on Peacock, starting with the Opening Ceremony July 26 at 12 p.m. ET.\n\n\"You can feel the vibes in the air,\" said Vinicius Rodrigues, 32, from Sao Paulo, Brazil. Under the arch of the iconic monument, he was dressed in the bright yellow of his home country alongside his wife, Aliene, 34, and two daughters, Maya, 3, and Chloe, 1.\n\nThis is the first Olympics they've traveled to. And despite their country failing to qualify for men's soccer, and therefore unable to defend its gold medal, the family spent Wednesday at the game between Spain and Uzbekistan at the city's Parc des Princes stadium. Though Spain won 2-1, it was the Uzbek fans' singing, chanting and impressive unison \"thunder clapping\" that charmed neutrals.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" beamed Rodrigues, who works as an electrical engineer. \"It was one of my dreams to come here.\"\n\nAdding to the pre-show excitement are the list of celebrities who have begun to roll into town this week. Singers Celine Dion and Lady Gaga have both been spotted in the French capital, leading to speculation they might be about to play the secretively planned opening ceremony.\n\nSocial media has been replete with rumors about who else might attend or perform.\n\nMeanwhile, the actor Selma Hayek was among the stars chosen to carry the Olympic Torch through Paris on Wednesday.\n\nHayek, who was dressed in a white tracksuit, called the torch \"a symbol of light, hope, peace, and unity,\" in an Instagram post Wednesday \"If you believe in these values, know that you were with me every step of the way,\" she said, adding that she was \"proud to represent the enduring spirit of the Olympics, bringing light, hope, and unity to all.\"\n\nHip-hop icon Snoop Dogg will carry the Olympic flame Friday through the streets of Saint-Denis, the town's mayor, Mathieu Hanotin, announced Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Olympics organizers and French officials say they hope this spirit can change the narrative of a world beset by tension and division, and engulfed in war in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan.\n\nMany Parisians are skeptical. A survey by leading French pollster IFOP between July 15 and 16 found that 36% of French people were indifferent about the Olympics, 26% were concerned and 5% were angry.\n\nWith Paris criss-crossed with QR-demanding security checkpoints, trade in the city is down 70% in the past week, the Confederation of French Commerce said Monday. That was evident when NBC News walked around the security perimeter flanking the Seine late Wendesday. Cafes usually packedwith tourists had the unusual spectacle of free tables outside, and two taxi drivers, who were not authorized by their employers to give their names, said the city was far quieter than usual.\n\nWith the event proper yet to kick off, this may just be a pre-Games lull. Several streets back from the Seine, the Champs Elysees was still the picture of bustling Paris. Bikes rattled over cobblestones, cigarette smoke wafed from cafe terraces, and stylishly dressed men and women went about their business.\n\nIndeed there are plenty here who are enthusiastic about the event that's taken over their city.\n\nFor Pamela Karam, 33, a graphic designer who lives in the suburbs, it's another step in the green revolution that's consumed Paris under Mayor Anne Hidalgo. Over the past few years, downtown roads have been closed to cars in favor of bike lanes. And the Olympics promises to take this a step further, making the Seine swimmable for the first time in 100 years thanks to a $1.5 billion overhaul of the sewage system.\n\n\"The skate park they've built around the Place de la Concorde is going to look so nice when it opens,\" she said. \"But being able to swim in the Seine -- that will be fantastic.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com",

This was the date (100 years ago tomorrow) when the Closing Ceremony of the last Paris Olympics was held.\n\nToday, July 26, 2024, it's the opening ceremony. Befitting an event that's a century in the making, it will be the first Olympics not to be held inside the stadium -- but along the River Seine.\n\nImagine 300,000 spectators -- including my fellow Cebuano tennis player, Malone Aradillos, who'll be attending the opening with his family -- watching a never-before-seen spectacle.\n\nMy wife Jasmin, daughter Jana, and I arrived in \"The City of Lights\" last Wednesday. We were greeted by large billboards emblazoned with \"Paris 2024\" logos. The five Olympic rings hung atop the Terminal 1 building. At the Charles de Gaulle airport, we stood beside Olympians from Austria.\n\nSECURITY. Because we could not secure opening ceremony tickets (or crazy enough to pay 1,000 Euro each), I did the next best thing: I planned to run along the Seine the day before the opening.\n\nYesterday at 6 a.m., I did my early morning workout by strolling towards Notre Dame. I imagined the thousands of Olympians parading and riding their boats along the Seine.\n\nBut, no, security here is incredibly strict. Upon arrival at CDG airport, you're met with dozens of armed security personnel. We saw many in military fatigues carrying high-powered firearms as we walked near Centre Pompidou and headed towards the Louvre (which we couldn't get to). The security force here is staggering: 45,000 policemen, 20,000 private security personnel and a 10,000-strong detachment of soldiers -- reportedly the largest military gathering in Paris since World War II.\n\nWhen I tried to go near the River Seine, I could not. There are barriers installed and a perimenter blockade restricting entry. Paris developed SILT (translated into Strengthening Internal Security and the Fight Against Terrorism) that divide areas into zones (red, gray, etc), restricting entry before the opening ceremony unless you have a Pass Jeux.\n\nDANCESPORT. If Cebu City became the first Palaro city in 64 editions to host dancesport, there is also one sport that Paris 2024 will unveil: Breakdancing.\n\nYes, for those who grew up in the 1970s and 80s, this was our \"sport.\" Dancing to the tune of my favorite breakdance song, \"Rockit\" by Herbie Hancock, we would strut, drop to the ground, balance, swirl, kick or do a headstand.\n\nThe \"Breaking\" Olympic competition will have two events, 16 \"B-Boys\" and 16 \"B-Girls,\" and will be one of 32 sports to be played in Paris with a total of 329 medal events.\n\n\"Breakdance\" will join the new sports introduced in Tokyo that include sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding, the sport of our own, Margielyn Didal.\n\nGENDER EQUALITY. Another first in Olympic history: there will be the same number of women and men competing in Paris. There are 206 countries that will be represented in the Games and an estimated 10,500 athletes. This number will be equally divided: 5,250 women and 5,250 men.", "source": {"uri": "sunstar.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun.Star Network Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@sunstar.com.ph", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(John_Lennon_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imagine (John Lennon song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebuano_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cebuano language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles de Gaulle Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninoy_Aquino_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ninoy Aquino International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Pompidou", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centre Pompidou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louvre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancesport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dancesport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Notre Dame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margielyn_Didal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margielyn Didal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbie_Hancock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Herbie Hancock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cebu City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cebu City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern Pentathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Multi-Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Multi-Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/sunstar%2F2024-07%2F1932feaa-2a3c-4f0b-992c-fc33b2f5fa82%2F4471891-671788055.jpg?rect=0%2C28%2C750%2C394&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 105, "relevance": 1}

Beginning at the 1908 London Games, the event is a chance for every participating nation to showcase their athletes and culture through the presentation.\n\nThousands of athletes will embark on the Seine this year in boats, taking a nice ride through the center of Paris among throngs of fans in a reimagined opening ceremony. The parade takes place in a very specific order that honors the tradition of the Games, as well as its current and future hosts.\n\nThe scene will be a spectacle, and Paris will light up with the colors of every country that embarked on its Olympic journey this year. Find out what the order of the parade entails below.\n\nCountries have always entered the Parade of Nations alphabetically in the language of the host nation. For example, Team USA entered the Mexico Games in 1968 at the beginning of the parade as the \"Estados Unidos,\" but at Beijing 2008, the US entered 139th based on the Chinese alphabet. This year, the list is determined in French.\n\nThe host nation traditionally enters last. Additionally, at the 2020 Tokyo Games, a new tradition was born where the upcoming Games host entered second- and third-to-last. For the Paris games, that means the U.S. (Los Angeles 2028) will enter before France, and Australia (Brisbane 2032) will enter before the U.S.\n\nThe Refugee Olympic Team has entered second, after Greece, since the 2020 Games, as well. Individuals on this team compete under the Olympic flag. Russian and Belarusian athletes, competing as Individual Neutral athletes, will not take part in the Parade of Nations.\n\nMORE: Meet the full roster for the USA Olympic track and field team 2024\n\nWhy does Greece always enter the Parade of Nations first?\n\nThe only other exception to the alphabetical rule is Greece. Starting at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, coaches and athletes from Greece entered first in order to honor the birthplace of the modern Olympics. The only time since that Greece has not led the procession was in 2004 when Athens hosted the Summer Games.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_effress@sportingnews.com", "name": "Sarah Effress", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karate at the 2020 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic symbols"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-02/Seine%20Paris%20Olympics%202024%20021624.jpg?itok=ljW7VZ6Q", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751309", "eventUri": "eng-9751309", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 0, "relevance": 1}

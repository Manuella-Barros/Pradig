If Potential Tropical Cyclone One develops, it is expected to be named \"Alberto.\" A Tropical Storm Watch was issued for parts of the Texas coast and northeastern Mexico. Regardless of its development, heavy rainfall is expected across southern Mexico and Central America and is likely to cause life-threatening and flash flooding.

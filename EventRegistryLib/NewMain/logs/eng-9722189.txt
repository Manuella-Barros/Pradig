One of the main issues that arose in Gerry and Theresa's relationship was Gerry's refusal to move for Theresa. During the run of The Golden Bachelor, it was revealed that Gerry had been dating after his wife's death, which he had previously denied.\n\nThe Golden Bachelor star Gerry Turner was sold to be the ultimate catch for mature women, but it turned out that he wasn't husband material whatsoever after his failed Golden marriage. Gerry, who was cast as the lead of The Golden Bachelor season 1 in the old-fashioned way with a nation-wide search, was painted out to be one of the most wholesome, vulnerable men that's ever been on the series. Sharing his tragic backstory, Gerry was able to get into the hearts of Bachelor Nation by making himself appear relatable and kind-hearted.\n\nSharing that his wife, Toni Turner, had passed away unexpectedly years prior and he felt lost without her, Gerry was made out to be a man whose life was stripped away from him after tragedy. He shared that he had two daughters along with a few granddaughters who were helping him through his loss, but he didn't know how to deal with the pain of grief in the months and years after losing his wife. Explaining he hadn't dated since his wife's death, Gerry was hopeful The Golden Bachelor could introduce him to someone who would change his life forever.\n\nDuring Gerry's time as The Golden Bachelor, he appeared grateful and humble as he met his cast of women. The cast of The Golden Bachelor season 1 was comprised of dozens of women who were excited to meet Gerry and get their own chance at love. Putting themselves out there in order to find a genuine love like no other, the women were excited to get their shot at gaining Gerry's love and affection, but they didn't realize that the man they were presented with wasn't the man they'd wind up with in the end.\n\nGerry ultimately chose Theresa Nist during his final rose ceremony, proposing to his new love and sharing that he was thrilled to have found someone to spend his golden years with. While Theresa and Gerry had a decent connection on the series, many found it odd that he didn't choose Leslie Fhima, who he appeared to have more in common with. Despite the mixed emotions surrounding his choice, Gerry and Theresa moved forward in their relationship, sharing that they'd be getting married on a live TV special just a month after the finale.\n\nWith the couple solidifying their relationship during The Golden Wedding special, where they exchanged vows in front of a group of their friends, family members, and Bachelor Nation alumni, Gerry and Theresa committed to each other, or so it would seem. Gerry had been dealing with scandals after The Golden Bachelor season 1 star's newfound fame had pushed some people from his past to come clean about his true nature. When Gerry and Theresa announced their divorce just three months into their marriage, it became clear that Gerry was the issue in their relationship.\n\nRelated\n\n20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\n\nReality TV is more popular than ever. With so many to choose from, here are some of the best reality TV shows to stream or watch right now.\n\n8 Gerry Didn't Want To Move For Theresa\n\nHe Refused To Leave His Indiana Lakehouse\n\nClose\n\nAfter Gerry and Theresa got engaged, there was a lot of discussion surrounding whether or not the pair were going to live in Gerry's native Indiana, or Theresa's native New Jersey. While the states aren't as far apart as some, there were a lot of miles between where they chose to build their lives, and it was a concern for Bachelor Nation where the couple would decide to live together. Some felt that they should choose to live in Gerry's beautiful Indiana lakefront home, while others felt that Theresa's young grandchildren in New Jersey were the priority.\n\nBachelor Nation, unfortunately, seemed to be discussing the issue more than Gerry and Theresa were, especially with the press. When prodded about it, the couple continually shared that they would be discussing it between themselves and figuring something out moving forward, but it was clear that neither was budging on wanting to be near their family. Gerry especially felt strongly that he wanted to live in Indiana for the rest of his life, and seemed to refuse to make a sacrifice and move for Theresa.\n\n7 Gerry Didn't Reveal His Hidden Relationship On The Show\n\nHe Wasn't Honest About His Past\n\nClose\n\nAlthough Bachelor Nation met Gerry as a widower who hadn't dated seriously since his wife died, many believed that he hadn't dated at all in the years after his wife had tragically passed away. Gerry didn't refute this, and in fact seemed to double down on the fact that he'd been single for the last several years, not even showing interest in dating again. This made his decision to go on The Golden Bachelor both more romantic and more confusing, as he didn't appear to have much interest in meeting someone new, but clearly wanted to do so.\n\nDuring the run of The Golden Bachelor, toward the end of the season, Gerry was called out in the press for having lied about the fact that he had dated after his wife died. While he tried to explain that he hadn't dated seriously, one of Gerry's exes anonymously shared an account of her relationship with Gerry. Though she kept her identity a secret, the woman gave credible evidence about her relationship with Gerry and hurt his reputation.\n\n6 Gerry Was Upset Theresa Didn't Quit her Job For Him\n\nHe Wanted Her To Give Up Everything\n\nClose\n\nWhile Gerry had been upfront about the fact that he was a retired restauranteur during his time as The Golden Bachelor, his past was a little less credible by the time the show finished airing. Gerry and Theresa were in two very different places when she accepted his proposal. While Gerry had retired, Theresa was still working full-time in her job back in New Jersey, which meant it would make much less sense for her to move unless she planned on retiring.\n\nThough Gerry knew that Theresa had more happening at home and it would be easier for him to relocate, he wanted Theresa to quit her job and move to Indiana with him. Gerry's inability to let go of the dreamhouse he'd designed with his late wife was understandable, but irritating for both Bachelor Nation and Theresa. It was clear that he didn't want to let go of the place, but asking Theresa to upend her life was difficult.\n\n5 Gerry Gave Up On Theresa Quickly\n\nHe Didn't Put Effort Into Making It Work\n\nClose\n\nWhile Gerry was certain that Theresa was the one for him on The Golden Bachelor, it was jarring to see how quickly he became disinterested. Gerry and Theresa's relationship was one of the strongest on the series, with the couple having connected on the first night and continuing to deepen that connection all season long. While some felt that Gerry's connection with Leslie was stronger, his relationship with Theresa seemed to fit what he wanted more in the long term.\n\nThough it was obvious that the couple worked well together, the issues that Gerry and Theresa had to face in order to come together were larger than anticipated. When Gerry realized just how much they needed to figure out before they could be happily married and settled down, he was quick to become disinterested. Gerry's ability to let go of his relationship with Theresa so quickly was confounding.\n\n4 Gerry Has A Bit Of An Ego\n\nHe Was Only Interested In His Own Fame\n\nClose\n\nAlthough Gerry was painted as a kind, wholesome man who didn't appear to have much of an ego, the opposite was proven to be true throughout The Golden Bachelor and afterward. Gerry was made to seem like he was a kind, gentle guy who didn't need to be taken down a peg, as life had done that for him. Instead, Gerry's attitude quickly began to rear its ugly head when he was in control of the narrative.\n\nWhile Gerry and the women of The Golden Bachelor season 1 all seemed to get along, it quickly became clear who he was interested in and who he wasn't. Though Gerry was complimentary to all the women, his ego was quick to make it obvious if he didn't like someone. When it came to Theresa, Gerry's ego presented itself in different ways, asking her to make major sacrifices for their relationship when he wasn't willing to.\n\n3 Gerry Seems To Move On Quickly from Relationships\n\nHe's Able To Discard His Feelings Quickly\n\nClose\n\nAlthough Gerry and Theresa's relationship was short-lived, likely, Gerry has already begun to move on given his track record in moving on from relationships. Gerry and Theresa's marriage wasn't the first relationship he ended without much of a second glance, considering what came out about his past relationships during the end of The Golden Bachelor season 1's run. Gerry, who had been made out to be a perpetually single man after his wife's death, moved on from his last relationship quickly before becoming The Golden Bachelor.\n\nThe relationship that Gerry hid from Bachelor Nation was a serious one, which was troubling to learn after he'd sworn he hadn't dated. The woman he'd been with shared that though they'd been living together for months and dating for over a year, Gerry had gone on to become The Golden Bachelor quickly after their split. The fact that Gerry moved on so quickly is a huge red flag.\n\n2 Gerry Likely Only Got Married For The Fame\n\nHe Wanted To Find His Own Niche\n\nAlthough Bachelor Nation would surely like to believe that Gerry and Theresa got married because of their feelings for one another, the quick marriage makes it seem like at least one half of the couple got married for the fame it would bring them. While Theresa doesn't seem interested in fame, Gerry absolutely does. He's made it clear through the public appearances he's given after The Golden Bachelor, and the fact that he seems to be trying to hold on to his reality TV fame.\n\nGerry has been speculated to have participated on the show as a way to get famous, but the fact that he got married to Theresa in just a month's time after the season ended made it clear that the marriage, at least for him, was for fame. Gerry's inability to fade from the public eye has been irritating for Bachelor Nation. Rather than taking a step back to reevaluate, he's been posting frequently on social media and trying to stay relevant.\n\n1 Gerry Didnt Spend A Lot Of Time With Theresa Post-Wedding\n\nHe Left Her Alone With Her Family\n\ng\n\nClose\n\nAlthough Gerry seemed to be interested in spending time with Theresa after The Golden Bachelor finished airing and they could finally be together, in practice he wasn't interested in getting to know Theresa better. The couple were able to get together after their time on the series, but it appeared infrequent from the way they shared about it on social media, and the fact that they were seen in different places by the press more often than not. The fact that Gerry and Theresa struggled to connect after the show was over was a sign that their connection wasn't strong.\n\nWith Gerry and Theresa moving in entirely different directions, it didn't make sense that the couple weren't trying to settle into a routine together. When it became clear that Gerry didn't want to bring Theresa into his life, it should've been understood that the relationship had failed. The Golden Bachelor himself wasn't exactly golden.\n\nSource: The Golden Bachelor/Instagram\n\nThe Golden Bachelor\n\nWhere to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nThe Bachelor returns to TV with The Golden Bachelor, a romantic reality competition series created for ABC.

He tries to make her jealous by flaunting his love life, but she has moved on. Their unwillingness to compromise on living arrangements led to the marriage's end.\n\nThe Golden Bachelor's Gerry Turner recently settled his divorce from Theresa Nist, but it seems he has since changed his mind and wants his wife back. Gerry, a widowed retired restaurateur, met 70-year-old day trader Theresa on night one of the Bachelor spin-off's inaugural season, and the two shared an instant connection. Though the competition was stiff with 22 incredible single women vying for Gerry's heart, he has his final rose and a Neil Lane diamond to Theresa.\n\nSeveral weeks after The Golden Bachelor season 1 finale, Gerry and Theresa were married in a nationally televised dream wedding. As they rode off into the sunset together, hopes were high that the older couple had found love again later in life. Sadly, that story turned out to be cruel fiction as Gerry and Theresa announced their split in April, only three short months after the Golden wedding. Since their split, it has become increasingly clear that Gerry regrets the split and wants to win his wife back, but it may be far too late.\n\nRelated\n\n20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\n\nReality TV is more popular than ever. With so many to choose from, here are some of the best reality TV shows to stream or watch right now.\n\nGerry Tried To Make Theresa Jealous\n\nHe Flaunted His Love Life To Make Her Jealous\n\nClose\n\nDuring a recent TMZ interview, Gerry made comments about his love life that seemed designed to get a reaction out of Theresa. He revealed, that since being single, women have been sliding into his DMs and even approaching him in person to hand him their phone numbers. Gerry claims that, though he has graciously accepted the phone numbers and messages from interested women, he hasn't contacted any of them. This reads as a warning to Theresa that if she doesn't act quickly, she may lose her chance to get back together with The Golden Bachelor.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Gerry had tried to make Theresa jealous since they announced their Golden divorce. According to IndyStar, a local Indiana paper, Gerry was spotted at a dating event in May, a few short weeks after announcing his divorce from Theresa. The TinCaps Love and Roses Night event in Fort Wayne, Indiana, includes a series of challenges in which singles compete to meet each other and play for a Fort Wayne dating package.\n\nThough it's unclear whether Gerry was participating in the dating event or just hosting it, he clearly hoped that it would remind Theresa that he's still desirable to other women.\n\nGerry Made A Pointed Joke\n\nIndiana Isn't That Bad\n\nIn June, Gerry hosted a fundraising event on the lake and posted several photos taken throughout the day. \"Great friends coming together for fun and fundraising,\" read Gerry's caption. The album of photos commemorates Gerry's fun charity event on the lake, and, in one of the photos, the Golden Bachelor alum Gerry prominently wears a graphic tee shirt that reads, \"Indiana. It's Not That Bad.\" Gerry's shirt was a message for Theresa, who famously didn't want to move to Indiana.\n\nWhen Gerry and Theresa met on night one of The Golden Bachelor, Theresa lived in New Jersey, near her children and grandchildren, and she went back home after the season had finished filming, while Gerry returned home to Indiana, where he lived near his family. After the wedding, Theresa was reluctant to leave her family to move to Indiana, and Gerry didn't want to move away from his family to live in New Jersey.\n\nThe bottom line is that the marriage ended because neither Gerry nor Theresa were willing to sacrifice their status quo to be with each other.\n\nShould Theresa Give Gerry Another Chance?\n\nShe Doesn't Want Gerry Back\n\nSince The Golden Bachelor couple announced their split, there has been a great deal of speculation about Gerry and Theresa's post-divorce love lives. While Gerry has been hosting dating events and making comments about women sliding into his DMs, Theresa has stayed quiet about her love life. Though Gerry's recent behavior suggests that he wants Theresa back, it's also clear that Theresa has moved on and doesn't share Gerry's desire to give their marriage another shot.\n\nTheresa still lives in New Jersey with her daughter, son, and six grandchildren, while Gerry is still in Indiana with his two daughters and two granddaughters. Unless one of The Golden Bachelor season 1 alums decides to make the big move away from their family, it's time for Gerry to stop pining for Theresa, and move on with his life.\n\nThe Golden Bachelor season 1 is available to stream on Hulu.\n\nSources: TMZ, IndyStar, Gerry Turner/Instagram\n\nThe Golden Bachelor\n\nTV-14\n\nCompetition\n\nReality\n\nRomance\n\nWhere to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nThe Bachelor returns to TV with The Golden Bachelor, a romantic reality competition series created for ABC.

(He Has A Controversial Status Now)", "body": "I'm Convinced The Golden Bachelor's Gerry Turner Never Truly Loved Theresa Nist (Does He Regret The Relationship?)\n\nSummary\n\nGerry Turner, the pioneer of The Golden Bachelor spinoff, could potentially have his own spinoff show in the future. Gerry made strong romantic connections on the show but faced backlash for his controversial decisions. Despite the controversies, Gerry is still a prominent figure in reality TV and could potentially make a comeback on television.\n\nGerry Turner was the first The Golden Bachelor lead, and there is potential for him to get his own spinoff. 72-year-old Gerry pioneered the Bachelor Nation spinoff which focused on highlighting the dating life of seniors. Gerry met 22 women at the beginning of his season and won viewers' hearts with his charm and backstory. Gerry was married to his wife Toni Turner for 43 years before she passed away unexpectedly from a bacterial infection in 2017. Gerry came into The Golden Bachelor experience with an open heart, empathy, and a strong desire to find the woman he couldn't live without.\n\nGerry made strong connections with many of The Golden Bachelor women, but he ultimately got the dating pool down to his top three: Leslie Fhima, Theresa Nist, and Faith Martin. He went on hometown dates with the three women and told Leslie and Faith that he loved them. However, he sent Faith home and took Theresa and Leslie to the fantasy suite dates in Costa Rica. Gerry made Leslie think that she would win his heart after telling her she was the one. But Gerry blindsided Leslie after he had a very connecting date with Theresa, and ultimately proposed to her.\n\nRelated\n\n20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\n\nReality TV is more popular than ever. With so many to choose from, here are some of the best reality TV shows to stream or watch right now.\n\nHow Was Gerry Perceived In The Golden Bachelor?\n\nGerry Turned On The Charm\n\nClose\n\nGerry came off as a genuine soul immediately on The Golden Bachelor. His reactions to all the women's limo introductions were very telling of his open personality and ability to find positive qualities in everybody. He did a good job at being very present on all of his dates and separating his feelings for each woman he made a connection with. When Gerry did send his romantic connections home he did so with grace, vulnerability, and respect. He walked several of the women out of the mansion and explained his elimination choices well.\n\nGerry was a very relatable figure during his time on The Golden Bachelor , and that's why he became so popular with the show's audience.\n\nGerry even opened up about wanting to have a sex life as a senior, which only made him more resonant. While Gerry did have many instances that showed his good nature, he did make decisions at the end of his journey and afterward that marred his reputation.\n\nGerry Is Not The Man Fans Thought He Was\n\nGerry Lied\n\nGerry's first controversial move was when he made Leslie think she was the one only to let her down by telling her he was choosing Theresa. Leslie got her heart broken, and while Gerry was sympathetic to it he could have handled the situation better and not led Leslie on. Gerry and Theresa got engaged at the end of The Golden Bachelor, and they had their Golden Wedding shortly after on January 4, 2024. In a wild turn of events, however, Gerry and Theresa announced their divorce (via Good Morning America) just four months later.\n\nThe pair cited their inability to blend their lives together and said they had been living separately. They presented a united front and said they were parting ways amicably. Gerry and Theresa's divorce news made Gerry look really bad and like he was being inauthentic the whole time on The Golden Bachelor because he didn't seem to try very hard to make it work with Theresa. There were also rumors that Gerry was not happy with Theresa wanting a prenup, which speaks to his potential for wanting something to gain by marrying Theresa.\n\nIt also came out via an ex-girlfriend of Gerry's that Gerry started dating again very shortly after his wife passed away. On the show, Gerry said that he was just getting ready to date again. Gerry's ex also exposed his alleged poor treatment of her, saying that he criticized her weight and kicked her out of his house with no warning. Gerry's image was tarnished by the allegations and he has not publically refuted that he lied about his dating history.\n\nGerry could have been putting on a charming front for The Golden Bachelor viewers, when in actuality he was being disingenuous. Gerry has also been spotted at dating events, which means he is moving on quickly and may not have been completely invested in his relationship with Theresa to begin with. In any case, Gerry perception by The Golden Bachelor community is not the greatest right now, but that could be good for a return to TV screens.\n\nGerry Is Still A Huge Reality TV Figure\n\nGerry Is Relishing His Celebrity Status\n\nClose\n\nGerry's name is larger than life now in the reality TV world, and he has been relishing the fame. He has made appearances on podcasts and talk shows and has even rubbed shoulders with the Kardashian clan. Gerry is enjoying his reality TV fame, and he may not want to relinquish it. Given his now-controversial status since his alleged lies were exposed and his marriage to Theresa didn't last, Gerry is still relevant.Bachelor Nation and reality TV fans are still curious to know about Gerry's life, and there is room for him to make a public comeback.\n\nWhat Kind Of Bachelor Spinoff Could Gerry Attain?\n\nThere Are Several Options\n\nSince appearing on The Golden Bachelor, Gerry has been on Celebrity Family Feud with Theresa when they were together and a host of other alums from his season. It was just announced that Gerry and Theresa will be contestants on Celebrity Family Feud once again, despite their divorced status. Gerry's willingness to go on TV again signals his continued interest in being in the spotlight. He has room to repair his image in several ways.\n\nGerry could take over as host of The Golden Bachelorette or future seasons of The Golden Bachelor and replace Jesse Palmer.\n\nThat would make him one of the main faces of the franchise. If that's not a route that gets taken, now that Gerry is single, he could appear in Joan Vassos' pilot season of The Golden Bachelorette as a contestant. Moreover, Gerry could have his own spinoff about finding love again or become The Golden Bachelor for a second time.\n\nThe Golden Bachelor is available to stream on Hulu.\n\nSource: Good Morning America/YouTube\n\nThe Golden Bachelor\n\nTV-14\n\nCompetition\n\nReality\n\nRomance\n\nWhere to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nThe Bachelor returns to TV with The Golden Bachelor, a romantic reality competition series created for ABC.

Despite a whirlwind engagement and marriage, Gerry's lack of remorse and quick return to dating suggest he may not have loved Theresa. Gerry's cavalier attitude towards his relationships raises questions about his sincerity and the authenticity of his love for Theresa.\n\nThe Golden Bachelor star Gerry Turner met Theresa Nist on the show, but after their Golden wedding and quickie divorce I'm certain Gerry never actually loved Theresa, even if he doesn't regret their relationship. While many were excited to learn that Gerry would become the lead of The Golden Bachelor season 1, the excitement surrounding his casting died down when his scandalous behavior became a part of the equation. Gerry had been sold as a wholesome father and grandfather, he was revealed to have had a troubling relationship after his wife's passing that didn't look good for his clean image.\n\nGerry and Theresa's relationship was interesting for viewers throughout The Golden Bachelor's inaugural season, and once their engagement was announced after the finale aired, things kicked into high gear. The couple shared during the live Golden Bachelor finale that they'd be getting married in a month and that ABC would be airing their nuptials with a live TV special. As things became more serious, the issues surrounding Gerry's life before the show began piling up, making it clear that he wasn't the person that The Golden Bachelor promoted. The real Gerry doesn't seem to feel any remorse over the divorce.\n\nRelated 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\n\nReality TV is more popular than ever. With so many to choose from, here are some of the best reality TV shows to stream or watch right now.\n\nGerry Has Been Flaunting His Love Life Too Much\n\nThough Gerry and Theresa's divorce hasn't even been finalized yet, the former Golden Bachelor star has been open about his love life after announcing his split. Gerry, who was originally promoted as someone who hadn't dated after his wife died even though that's since been disproven, has been upfront about the fact that in the future, he wants something different than what he had with Theresa. Flaunting his love life, Gerry hasn't been taking any time to reflect on what happened on The Golden Bachelor or afterward before moving into the next chapter of his dating life.\n\nGerry Dipped His Toes In The Dating Pool Soon After The Divorce\n\nWhile there isn't a specific timeline for starting to date after a divorce, Gerry took the smallest amount of time possible to grieve his relationship with Theresa before moving back into the dating pool. Though Gerry's time with Theresa was reportedly some of the best he'd ever had, The Golden Bachelor star chose to begin dating again almost immediately after his divorce from Theresa was announced. Although the exes have both seemed to be interested in moving on quickly, Gerry's attitude surrounding his dating life was unbelievably cavalier, making me wonder if he ever loved Theresa in the first place.\n\nGerry Never Seemed Affected By The Divorce\n\nAlthough Gerry and Theresa went onto a news show to disclose the details surrounding their split and share a statement about the change in their lives, Gerry felt almost entirely detached from their divorce otherwise. With Gerry withdrawn and seemingly unaffected by his whirlwind divorce from Theresa, I think his heart was never in the relationship. Gerry's behavior makes it seem like he never loved Theresa, as he didn't find it difficult to move on after their marriage ended. The Golden Bachelor doesn't feel remorse about the show or his marriage, as it's brought him exposure and more romance opportunities.\n\nSource: The Golden Bachelor/Instagram\n\nThe Golden Bachelor Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nThe Bachelor returns to TV with The Golden Bachelor, a romantic reality competition series created for ABC.

Signs point to Gerry's potential regret over the end of his marriage, including his lack of posts and comments about his romantic options. Despite logistical challenges, it seems like Gerry and Theresa's short-lived marriage may have been essentially loveless, as shown by their quick split.\n\nThe Golden Bachelor's Gerry Turner has largely disappeared from the public eye since settling his divorce from Theresa Nist, and there are signs that he's regretting his failed marriage. When the 72-year-old retired restaurateur was announced as the lead of the Bachelor spin-off show, incredible single women in their 60s and 70s applied in droves for a chance to win the tall, attractive widower's heart. The show was an instant hit. After an entertaining season of dates, outings and tears, Gerry gave his final rose, and a Neil Lane diamond ring, to 70-year-old day trader Theresa Nist.\n\nGerry and Theresa wasted no time planning their Golden Bachelor wedding, and they were married in January, just a few short weeks after going public with their relationship. The couple rode off into the sunset together, but they circled back only three months later to announce their split in April. Since news of the Golden divorce settlement in June, very little has been seen of Gerry, and he stopped posting on social media. Could Gerry's sudden radio silence be due to the fact that he was regretting the end of his marriage to Theresa?\n\nRelated\n\n20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\n\nReality TV is more popular than ever.

Since news of Theresa and Gerry's divorce settlement broke in June, Gerry has been extremely quiet on social media. He hasn't posted to Instagram since June.\n\nA few weeks may not seem like a long time, but compared to the previous rate at which he was posting, a few weeks of silence is a lifetime.\n\nOther Signs Gerry Regrets Divorcing Theresa\n\nIs He Trying To Make Her Jealous?\n\nGerry's radio silence since his divorce settlement news wouldn't be the biggest deal on its own, but some of Gerry's other recent behavior also points to the possibility that Gerry's working through heartbreak. Since the divorce, there has been a lot of speculation about Gerry and Theresa's love lives. The Golden Bachelor was recently interviewed by TMZ, and he made some comments about the current state of his love life that raised eyebrows.\n\nGerry claimed that, since becoming single again, his social media account has been flooded by single women sliding into his DMs to express their romantic interest. He also said that women were even approaching him on the street to give him their phone numbers. Gerry claimed that he wasn't ready to start dating again, so he had yet to contact any of the women. However, it felt like he was telling this story to remind Theresa that he was a highly desirable man with plenty of romantic options.\n\nWhy Couldn't Gerry & Theresa Make It Work?\n\nLocation, Location, Location\n\nA relationship's complicated, especially if it starts on a reality television show between two strangers who live far away from each other. Before joining the cast of The Golden Bachelor season 1, Gerry lived in Indiana, where he had resided with his late wife of 43 years, Toni Turner, who passed away in 2017. Theresa lived in New Jersey, where she had lived with her husband of 42 years, until he passed in 2014. Since they both lived near their children and grandchildren, each was unwilling to uproot their life to pursue a new relationship with a relative stranger.\n\nThey spent months traveling back and forth to make the marriage work, but ultimately, neither wanted to be in a long-distance marriage.\n\nIn reference to Gerry and Theresa's dispute over living arrangements, Gerry posted a photo to Instagram in which he's wearing a graphic tee shirt that reads, \"Indiana. It's Not That Bad.\" The shirt may have been a tongue in cheek message from Gerry to Theresa about her refusal to move to the Hoosier state. It's great that Gerry has a sense of humor about the divorce, but the post was his last time Gerry was seen on Instagram.\n\nThough logistics were a big part of the Golden divorce, there's likely more to the story. The bottom line is that if Gerry and Theresa were really in love, they would have moved heaven and earth to make it work. The fact that they gave up after only three short months says that The Golden Bachelor season 1 couple simply weren't that into each other. Thankfully, the couple had a prenup so they were able to walk away from the marriage with their finances in order. However, Gerry's recent hiatus from social media suggests that he's actually licking his wounds.\n\nGerry Turner\n\n72-years-old\n\nRetired restaurateur\n\nIndiana\n\nWidower\n\nTheresa

ABC airs couples' episode despite Gerry and Theresa's divorce announcement to the public. Despite challenges in divorce proceedings, exes Gerry and Theresa remain civil for the public eye.\n\nThe Golden Bachelor exes Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist may be setting their divorce in real-time, but the former couple are about to appear on another reality TV show after their split. Gerry, who was chosen as the first Golden Bachelor prior to the show's inaugural season, was sold to viewers a wholesome, sweet guy who was looking for love after tragically losing his wife. Though Gerry thought he found love with Theresa, it came to pass that he wasn't the person who Bachelor Nation thought when it was revealed that he'd had some scandals hidden in his closet.\n\nAlthough Gerry and Theresa were moving in a good direction during their time on The Golden Bachelor, things took a turn for the worse after their live televised wedding ceremony. When it was clear the couple weren't living together after their wedding, Gerry and Theresa revealed they were getting a divorce, shocking Bachelor Nation. Now, months after their split, the exes will be appearing on an episode of ABC's Celebrity Family Feud, which was filmed before their split. Playing against other Bachelor Nation couples, Gerry and Theresa's team will be comprised of their families, who joined in on the classic competition.\n\nRelated\n\n20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\n\nReality TV is more popular than ever. With so many to choose from, here are some of the best reality TV shows to stream or watch right now.\n\nShould ABC Have Scrapped Gerry & Theresa's Family Feud Episode?\n\nClose\n\nWhile ABC has other Bachelor Nation-themed episodes that it could run in place of the Gerry and Theresa Family Feud episode, the network doesn't appear to care that the couple is now divorced. Having announced their split just days after their Celebrity Family Feud taping, it's possible the network was aware they'd be splitting up after they filmed the series, but it's also possible they weren't aware of what was to come. Gerry and Theresa, who will go up against other Bachelor Nation alumni, have been aware of the episode coming for months, but should it still be airing post-split?\n\nEven though Gerry and Theresa's relationship has been picked apart in a way that leaves little to the imagination, seeing them on Celebrity Family Feud could be confusing for Bachelor Nation. While it's likely the show will be edited in a way that will remove any mentions of the future or their relationship in general, Gerry and Theresa's episode could cause some commotion for those who are less aware of what's going on between the Golden exes. While Gerry and Theresa's episode is airing, it probably should've been taken off the schedule to limit questions and concerns from the audience.\n\nAlthough Gerry and Theresa have been struggling through their divorce, with the proceedings having stalled out more than once, the former couple have been keeping things civil as they've publicly divorced. With the exes about to appear on Celebrity Family Feud, things will certainly get confusing for some Bachelor Nation fans who aren't keeping up with the pair online. Although they'll always be the first couple of The Golden Bachelor, Gerry and Theresa's episode of classic competition the series may be a strange addition to their resumes.\n\nSource: Theresa Nist/Instagram\n\nThe Golden Bachelor\n\nWhere to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nThe Bachelor returns to TV with The Golden Bachelor, a romantic reality competition series created for ABC.

Gerry told TMZ in June that he's searching for someone who's \"a good friend and someone who loves adventure, travel and is able to be on the move.\"\n\nThe Celebrity Family Feud episode \"Meghan Trainor vs. Tori Kelly and Golden Bachelor vs. Bachelor Nation\" airs Tuesday, July 16, at 8 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_hudgins@usmagazine.com", "name": "Ryan Hudgins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelor_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bachelor (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul's_Drag_Race_(season_10)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RuPaul's Drag Race (season 10)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan_Trainor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan Trainor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Shallcross", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zach Shallcross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tori_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tori Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_Family_Feud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity Family Feud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreconcilable_differences", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irreconcilable differences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/When-Gerry-Turner-and-Theresa-Nists-'Celebrity-Family-Feud-Episode-Airs-.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722189", "eventUri": "eng-9722189", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 115, "textEnd": 122, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Despite creating a strong connection with Gerry, 72, Joan left the show early due to a family emergency. She further elaborated on the situation during the Women Tell-All in November 2023, explaining that she went home because her daughter had \"a really serious case of postpartum depression.\"\n\n\"She needed me. She needed her mom and I didn't think twice. I knew I had to be there. I heard it in her voice. I could not get on that plane fast enough,\" Joan recalled about her daughter.\n\nHowever, Joan assured fans that \"everything is great\" now with her daughter and granddaughter.\n\nWhile Joan didn't find love with Gerry, it was revealed that she will get a second chance at finding her happily ever after on reality TV when she was named the first Golden Bachelorette during the ABC upfront on May 14.\n\nOne day after the announcement, Joan took to Instagram to express her excitement over the news.\n\n\"The first Golden Bachelorette ... I truly can't believe it! I'm positively overwhelmed by the love and support you are all sending my way. Thank you @abc for picking me and @bachelornation for rooting for me!\" she wrote alongside a promo video for the season. \"As I embark on this journey, I hope to make you all proud, follow my heart, and have a lot of fun along the way. I'm honored to represent all of the golden ladies out there, turns out we aren't invisible after all.\"\n\nAfter Joan left The Golden Bachelor, Gerry ultimately proposed to Theresa Nist during the November 2023 finale. The pair wasted no time and tied the knot during a televised ceremony in January.\n\nDespite seeming madly in love, Gerry and Theresa, 70, shocked fans when they announced their plans to divorce during a joint appearance on Good Morning America in April. They explained that they were \"dissolving [their] marriage\" because they couldn't decide on a place to live. Gerry currently lives in Indiana, and Theresa is located in New Jersey.\n\nAfter explaining that they're both \"dedicated\" to their families, Gerry said it was difficult for either of them to relocate. \"So we look at these conversations and we both think it's best for the happiness of each of us to live apart,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "lifeandstylemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life & Style"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_schaffstall@lifeandstylemag.com", "name": "Katherine Schaffstall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelorette_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bachelorette (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelor_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bachelor (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Postpartum depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promo_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Promo (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/joan-golden-bachelorette-first-night.jpg?crop=0px%2C290px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722189", "eventUri": "eng-9722189", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 1112, "textEnd": 1118}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

A Toast to the Greatest 'Toon Character Ever\n\nABC's golden girl! The Golden Bachelorette will premiere this fall on the network, and Bachelor Nation fans are looking forward to seeing Joan Vassos get a second chance at love in her golden years.\n\nFilming is currently underway. Host Jesse Palmer recently shared a photo of Joan on set in a gorgeous gown at the Bachelor mansion. \"It's been a busy summer...\" he captioned the photo.\n\nFollowing the massive success of The Golden Bachelor, the spinoff was confirmed in February 2024. From the premiere date to the show's leading lady, get the latest updates about the first season of The Golden Bachelorette.\n\nJoan will be the show's inaugural leading lady. Joan was announced as the star of The Golden Bachelorette in May 2024. ABC released a promo with Joan looking radiant in a gold sequin gown. \"I'm Joan and I'm your first Golden Bachelorette,\" she said in the promo.\n\nJoan was a contestant during Gerry Turner's season of The Golden Bachelor. The 61-year-old had to leave the show in Week 3 to help take care of her daughter.\n\nThe Maryland native works as a school administrator. She has four kids and two grandchildren. She was married to her husband for 32 years before he died and applied to be on The Golden Bachelor to start looking for love again.\n\n\"If it ends up in engagement, I'm open to that,\" Joan told CNN ahead of filming her season. \"I do believe this process works. I've seen it work for so many couples on The Bachelor, so I believe in the process. If it ends up in engagement, that's great. If it ends up in, you and I are going to get to know each other better in the outside world, that's perfect also.\"\n\nAll My Children icon Susan Lucci was offered the Golden Bachelorette, but she turned down the offer. \"I think I'm just a fan... it wasn't for me but it's something that I do love to watch,\" she told ET.\n\n\"I think that my dad is such an amazing man, and he would go through that journey really well,\" Kelsey told TV Insider. \"I think that it would really open him up to love again, and maybe some new friendships and new experiences. So I fully support my dad in that. I'm trying to talk him into it.\"\n\nWill there be a Golden Bachelor Season 2?\n\nABC has not announced whether or not The Golden Bachelor will return for a second season. Gerry ushered in a new era of reality dating when he made his debut as the Golden Bachelor in the senior citizen spinoff. The first season of The Golden Bachelor was a ratings hit, so it wouldn't be a surprise if ABC renewed the show.\n\nAt the end of the season, Gerry and Theresa Nist got engaged and married in a January 2024 TV wedding. However, just three months later, Gerry and Theresa broke up. The couple cited their living situation as the reason behind their divorce.\n\nCould Gerry try and find love again a little closer to home in The Golden Bachelor Season 2?

Fan favorite contestant Susan Noles revealed that none other than Bradley Cooper expressed his adoration, while her castmate Kathy Swarts had a message for Eddie Murphy, who recently spoke out about his own fandom of the show, hilariously expressing his frustration with Gerry and Theresa Nist's divorce.\n\nFans of The Golden Bachelor immediately fell in love with Susan Noles for her fun and hilarious personality, and while some Bachelor franchise contestants have found fame outside of the franchise, not everybody receives the kind of flattery that's followed Susan. I mean, how many people can count 12-time Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper amongst their biggest fans? Susan recalled her run-in with the Maestro star to US Weekly, saying:\n\nI can't imagine how surreal a moment that must have been for the 67-year-old wedding officiant to have Bradley Cooper call himself your biggest fan. However, that certainly wasn't the first time Susan Noles received such praise. The Kardashians matriarch Kris Jenner sent a special message to her doppelg\u00e4nger during The Golden Bachelor's \"Women Tell All\" to say that the whole cast had been an inspiration to her family and that Susan, in particular, was \"amazing.\"\n\nThe feedback that Susan Noles said she gets from fans, including about her friendship with fellow cast member Kathy Swarts, speaks to the spinoff's overarching theme of hope and love, which is what Kathy said in her response to Eddie Murphy's criticism.\n\nEddie Murphy recently revealed that he was also a big fan of The Golden Bachelor, but like so many of us, he was disappointed when Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist announced they were divorcing after just three months of marriage. \"What kind of shit is that?\" he proclaimed, and it seems Kathy Swarts is willing to tell him exactly what kind of shit that is. She told US Weekly:\n\nWhat, no \"Zip it!\"? While it was super frustrating to see the relationship that we watched develop on The Golden Bachelor falter so quickly after The Golden Wedding aired live on ABC, Kathy Swarts implored Eddie Murphy to not let that overshadow the larger message of the show. Gerry Turner and the rest of the cast discussed grief and loss in powerful ways, with many coming to the realization that their love lives weren't over just because of the stage of life they were in.\n\nIt was about finding hope -- whether the contestants were widowed, divorced or otherwise -- that they could find love again. Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist did find love, and even when they announced their split, they remained confident that they could find love again.\n\nWe'll have to see what Bradley Cooper, Eddie Murphy and other A-listers have to say when Joan Vassos' own journey premieres on the 2024 TV schedule this fall with The Golden Bachelorette.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "heidi_venable@cinemablend.com", "name": "Heidi Venable", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gerry Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kardashians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Kardashians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg\u00e4nger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doppelg\u00e4nger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A-list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kris Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surrealism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelorette_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bachelorette (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ufKvAsNxA8vPPgQDRF5xVB-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722189", "eventUri": "eng-9722189", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

There are going to be 90-minute episodes from start to finish here, meaning that there will be more opportunities in order to ensure that we get to know a lot of the guys taking part.\n\nIf you watched The Golden Bachelor this past season, then you more than likely know a few things about Joan already. She ended up having to leave Gerry Turner's season early in order to be there for her family, but it was clear that she had an almost-immediate connection with him. Had she not left, who knows? She could have been there for the long haul but regardless, she now has an opportunity to craft her own love story and there could be some really great moments that go along with that.\n\nThe most important thing with this arm of the story right now is rather simple: The people involved need to find a way in order to ensure that the contestants know what they are in for, and also that there's a real chance things can work after the fact.

Mercedes contends the UAW claims have no merit.\n\nThe U.S. government raised concerns with Germany about how Mercedes-Benz is dealing with the UAW's organizing drive at its plant in Alabama -- an unusual move as workers prepare to vote on unionization next week.\n\nOfficials recently spoke about allegations by the UAW against Mercedes that include firing union activists and holding a mandatory meeting at which an executive discouraged unionization, according to a U.S. government official familiar with the discussion.\n\nThe conversation included commitments that the governments will work together to promote unions and employee rights, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe sensitive communications.\n\nMercedes, based in Stuttgart, Germany, denied wrongdoing, saying in a statement that the company does not believe the UAW claims have merit and has not interfered or retaliated against employees seeking unionization.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has said he's the most union-friendly president in U.S. history and he picketed briefly with the UAW last fall. He has received the UAW's endorsement for the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nThe German embassy declined to comment.\n\nVW precedent\n\nAbout 5,200 workers at Mercedes facilities in Vance and Woodstock, Ala., are slated to vote on joining the UAW on May 13 through 17, a pivotal test of the union's reinvigorated strength.\n\nBuoyed by victories last year against Detroit's automakers, the union is aiming to organize roughly 150,000 more workers at 14 automakers, including many where it's suffered prior defeats.\n\nThat campaign secured a landmark win last month when workers at Volkswagen Group's 4,300-employee Tennessee auto plant voted to join the UAW, with the union getting 73 percent of the vote.\n\nBut Mercedes is proving a tougher target. While the company's official principles include a section on executives remaining neutral during organizing campaigns, the UAW has alleged in complaints that the automaker repeatedly broke the law in Alabama.\n\nThe European Commission, which represents the European Union in international affairs, also raised the Alabama situation with Mercedes.\n\nThe organization conveyed that \"we expect them to respect both local law and European values\" in advance of the Alabama election, said Olof Gill, a commission spokesperson.\n\nMercedes acknowledged speaking with \"various authorities,\" including members of the European Commission.\n\nIn an emailed statement late last week, the company said Mercedes respects the right of employees to unionize and will ensure they have the chance to make an informed choice.\n\nUnions are more prevalent and powerful in Germany than in the U.S.\n\nMercedes employees in Germany are covered by a union contract, have representatives on the board and elect members to a works council that has a say in its decision-making.\n\nIn an emailed statement Monday, Ergun L\u00fcmali, the works council's chairman, encouraged Alabama employees to vote for the UAW and said it was monitoring the UAW's activities and the company's behavior.\n\nIn February, the CEO of Mercedes-Benz U.S., Michael G\u00f6bel, held a meeting with the plant's workforce where he suggested that a union would mean strikes, costly dues and obstacles to conflict resolution.\n\nMercedes informed employees last week that it was abruptly replacing G\u00f6bel, who would move effective immediately to a new role.\n\nThe anti-union push is \"every day -- you are walking around thinking, 'What is next?'\" Mercedes employee Brett Garrard said on a Thursday presentation for investors held by the SOC Investment Group, a union-affiliated shareholder advocacy organization.\n\n\"Everyone is so tired of it.\"", "source": {"uri": "autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Silvia, American University School of International Service\n\nWorkers at two Mercedes plants near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, will soon vote for the first time on whether they want to join a union.\n\nUntil recently, it would have been safe to presume that a majority of the 5,200 people eligible to participate in this election - scheduled to run May 13-17, 2024 - would reject this opportunity to join the United Auto Workers.\n\nThe UAW, which has about 150,000 members employed by Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, made eight failed attempts to unionize foreign-owned auto plants in the South over the past 35 years. Two of those drives aimed to organize the entire Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nBut the third time the UAW tried to organize the VW plant, it prevailed, winning 73% of all ballots cast in an election held there in April.\n\nI conduct research about organized labor in the United States and other countries. My most recent book, \"The UAW's Southern Gamble: Organizing Workers at Foreign-owned Vehicle Plants,\" highlights the big challenges workers and the UAW have long faced when trying to organize auto plants in the South. In my view, the union was finally able to succeed in Chattanooga because of its new leadership and closer cooperation with VW workers in Germany.\n\nAs I explain in my book, one reason it took the UAW so long to score its first plantwide win was that an employer playbook for discouraging unionization had worked according to plan.\n\nThe automotive companies operating in the American South had largely located their plants in rural areas with little union membership. They screened out hires who might be sympathetic to unions and divided the workforce by using temp agencies to fill a significant share of positions. They deployed television monitors throughout the plant to run pro-company and anti-union messaging. And they donated lavishly to local churches, charities and politicians to undercut local support for unionization.\n\nAt the same time, Southern political and business leaders sought to attract investment - especially from foreign-owned manufacturers - by offering massive subsidies, low taxes, lower labor costs and a largely compliant workforce.\n\nSouthern autoworkers get paid less than than their Northern peers and have, until now, had little say over what happens in their workplace.\n\nThis model succeeded. Today, roughly 30% of U.S. auto workers are in the South, up from around 15% in 1990.\n\nWhenever the UAW has sought to unionize the industry throughout the region, the Southern political establishment, which the Republican Party dominates, has pushed back.\n\nMost recently, six Southern GOP governors encapsulated that tradition in a joint letter shortly before the VW vote. In it, they denounced the UAW's organizing drive as \"special interests looking to come into our state and threaten our jobs and the values we live by.\"\n\nThe UAW's win in Tennessee suggests that this model has begun to break down. Three factors can explain why it may no longer work.\n\nFirst, the election of Shawn Fain as UAW president in March 2023 marked a turning point. The charismatic electrician from Kokomo, Indiana, whom MotorTrend recently named \"Man of the Year,\" wasted no time shifting the UAW away from its prior accommodation with automakers.\n\nFain used forceful rhetoric and innovative tactics to score wins at the bargaining table throughout the UAW's concurrent strikes at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis in the fall of 2023.\n\nThe new contracts that followed gave workers substantial pay and benefits increases and restored cost-of-living adjustments. Those deals also eliminated a two-tier wage structure that paid workers hired since 2007 significantly less for doing the same job than colleagues with more seniority.\n\nBy the end of 2023, the UAW had shown Southern autoworkers that it could deliver gains that their employers were unlikely to grant on their own. More autoworkers throughout the region became interested in joining the union as a result.\n\nSecond, the UAW revamped its approach to labor organizing.\n\nOut went its top-down approach, led by union staffers who weren't necessarily the most skilled at organizing. Under Fain's leadership, the UAW hired Brian Shepherd - a proven organizer from the Service Employees International Union - to take charge.\n\nShepherd has empowered the automotive employees who were supportive of unionization to tailor the organizing drive to what they thought would work best.\n\nFor example, at the Mercedes plant, committed employees began to distribute union authorization cards far earlier than UAW had previously recommended, and it dispensed with visiting undecided workers at their homes because they thought that tactic would be counterproductive in the South.\n\nShepherd has hired professional organizers to back up his team, and he's promoted the creation of much more highly structured networks within plants than the voluntary organizing committees the UAW had traditionally used.\n\nThese changes have paid off. More Southern workers have signed cards authorizing the UAW as their collective bargaining agent than ever before.\n\nThird, the UAW's relationship with Volkswagen's German works council leadership, which represents employees in the workplace, has dramatically improved. A works council is an elected body of employees anchored in German law that represents employee interests at the workplace and company levels. It is distinct from the German metalworkers union, IG Metall, which has always been supportive of unionization at German-owned auto plants in the American South.\n\nTies between the UAW and the works council were strained during the 2014 and 2019 organizing campaigns. But the works council leadership changed in 2021.\n\nThis time, the German works council intervened in several instances to soften VW management's resistance to unionization and to urge Chattanooga employees to vote for the UAW.\n\nJust because the UAW won by almost a 3-to-1 margin in Chattanooga doesn't mean that victory at Mercedes in Alabama or elsewhere is a sure thing.\n\nBoth the Alabama political establishment and the factory's management have fought this labor organizing campaign much harder at Mercedes than Volkswagen executives and Tennessee officials did ahead of the vote at the Chattanooga plant.\n\nForging a close relationship between Mercedes' German works council and the UAW has proved elusive. On the other hand, a core of Mercedes Alabama employees has proved particularly adept at organizing. They set up a dense network in the plant based on \"walkers\" - that is, people whose jobs require them to move about the plant.\n\nThey have also summarized their circumstances with snappy lines that have gone viral. For example, longtime Mercedes employee Jeremy Kimbrell declared \"We are going to end the Alabama discount\" - a reference to the lower pay they receive compared to their peers in Michigan and other more established automotive manufacturing hubs.\n\nMercedes management in Alabama has also made a series of moves that have enraged and emboldened the workers at that plant. It let pay stagnate for many years and instituted a deeply unpopular two-tier wage structure in 2020, which management quickly undid last year after the UAW's successful strikes.\n\nMercedes management judged the anti-union campaign to be going so badly that it fired the plant's chief executive officer, Michael G\u00f6bel, and replaced him with the current vice president of operations, Federico Kochlowski, just two weeks before voting was set to begin.\n\nSacking an unpopular plant manager is a common union-avoidance tactic, much like firing the head coach of a poorly performing sports team to appease fans. VW did it in 2019.\n\nThe outcome of the vote at the Mercedes plant is harder to predict than it was for the Volkswagen factory because Mercedes has never had a union recognition election before. One thing is certain, however: The UAW's organizing campaign is not ending there.\n\nFain has repeatedly declared that the UAW intends to get all U.S. autoworkers to join the union - potentially doubling the ranks of its members in the industry.\n\nThere are about a dozen more campaigns underway that could follow the vote at Mercedes. At least 30% of the workers at Toyota's Missouri engine plant and Hyundai's factory in Alabama have already embraced the UAW - a key first step toward a formal election.", "source": {"uri":

Two of those drives aimed to organize the entire Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nBut the third time the UAW tried to organize the VW plant, it prevailed, winning 73% of all ballots cast in an election held there in April.\n\nI conduct research about organized labor in the United States and other countries. My most recent book, \"The UAW's Southern Gamble: Organizing Workers at Foreign-owned Vehicle Plants,\" highlights the big challenges workers and the UAW have long faced when trying to organize auto plants in the South. In my view, the union was finally able to succeed in Chattanooga because of its new leadership and closer cooperation with VW workers in Germany.\n\nA successful model\n\nAs I explain in my book, one reason it took the UAW so long to score its first plantwide win was that an employer playbook for discouraging unionization had worked according to plan.\n\nThe automotive companies operating in the American South had largely located their plants in rural areas with little union membership. They screened out hires who might be sympathetic to unions and divided the workforce by using temp agencies to fill a significant share of positions. They deployed television monitors throughout the plant to run pro-company and anti-union messaging. And they donated lavishly to local churches, charities and politicians to undercut local support for unionization.\n\nAt the same time, Southern political and business leaders sought to attract investment - especially from foreign-owned manufacturers - by offering massive subsidies, low taxes, lower labor costs and a largely compliant workforce.\n\nSouthern autoworkers get paid less than than their Northern peers and have, until now, had little say over what happens in their workplace.\n\nThis model succeeded. Today, roughly 30% of U.S. auto workers are in the South, up from around 15% in 1990.\n\nWhenever the UAW has sought to unionize the industry throughout the region, the Southern political establishment, which the Republican Party dominates, has pushed back.\n\nMost recently, six Southern GOP governors encapsulated that tradition in a joint letter shortly before the VW vote. In it, they denounced the UAW's organizing drive as \"special interests looking to come into our state and threaten our jobs and the values we live by.\"\n\nStrong leadership\n\nThe UAW's win in Tennessee suggests that this model has begun to break down. Three factors can explain why it may no longer work.\n\nFirst, the election of Shawn Fain as UAW president in March 2023 marked a turning point. The charismatic electrician from Kokomo, Indiana, whom MotorTrend recently named \"Man of the Year,\" wasted no time shifting the UAW away from its prior accommodation with automakers.\n\nFain used forceful rhetoric and innovative tactics to score wins at the bargaining table throughout the UAW's concurrent strikes at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis in the fall of 2023.\n\nThe new contracts that followed gave workers substantial pay and benefits increases and restored cost-of-living adjustments. Those deals also eliminated a two-tier wage structure that paid workers hired since 2007 significantly less for doing the same job than colleagues with more seniority.\n\nBy the end of 2023, the UAW had shown Southern autoworkers that it could deliver gains that their employers were unlikely to grant on their own. More autoworkers throughout the region became interested in joining the union as a result.\n\nNew organizing approach\n\nSecond, the UAW revamped its approach to labor organizing.\n\nOut went its top-down approach, led by union staffers who weren't necessarily the most skilled at organizing. Under Fain's leadership, the UAW hired Brian Shepherd - a proven organizer from the Service Employees International Union - to take charge.\n\nShepherd has empowered the automotive employees who were supportive of unionization to tailor the organizing drive to what they thought would work best.\n\nFor example, at the Mercedes plant, committed employees began to distribute union authorization cards far earlier than UAW had previously recommended, and it dispensed with visiting undecided workers at their homes because they thought that tactic would be counterproductive in the South.\n\nShepherd has hired professional organizers to back up his team, and he's promoted the creation of much more highly structured networks within plants than the voluntary organizing committees the UAW had traditionally used.\n\nThese changes have paid off. More Southern workers have signed cards authorizing the UAW as their collective bargaining agent than ever before.\n\nGerman solidarity\n\nThird, the UAW's relationship with Volkswagen's German works council leadership, which represents employees in the workplace, has dramatically improved. A works council is an elected body of employees anchored in German law that represents employee interests at the workplace and company levels. It is distinct from the German metalworkers union, IG Metall, which has always been supportive of unionization at German-owned auto plants in the American South.\n\nTies between the UAW and the works council were strained during the 2014 and 2019 organizing campaigns. But the works council leadership changed in 2021.\n\nThis time, the German works council intervened in several instances to soften VW management's resistance to unionization and to urge Chattanooga employees to vote for the UAW.\n\nTougher territory\n\nJust because the UAW won by almost a 3-to-1 margin in Chattanooga doesn't mean that victory at Mercedes in Alabama or elsewhere is a sure thing.\n\nBoth the Alabama political establishment and the factory's management have fought this labor organizing campaign much harder at Mercedes than Volkswagen executives and Tennessee officials did ahead of the vote at the Chattanooga plant.\n\nForging a close relationship between Mercedes' German works council and the UAW has proved elusive. On the other hand, a core of Mercedes Alabama employees has proved particularly adept at organizing. They set up a dense network in the plant based on \"walkers\" - that is, people whose jobs require them to move about the plant.\n\nThey have also summarized their circumstances with snappy lines that have gone viral. For example, longtime Mercedes employee Jeremy Kimbrell declared \"We are going to end the Alabama discount\" - a reference to the lower pay they receive compared to their peers in Michigan and other more established automotive manufacturing hubs.\n\nMercedes management in Alabama has also made a series of moves that have enraged and emboldened the workers at that plant. It let pay stagnate for many years and instituted a deeply unpopular two-tier wage structure in 2020, which management quickly undid last year after the UAW's successful strikes.\n\nMercedes management judged the anti-union campaign to be going so badly that it fired the plant's chief executive officer, Michael G\u00f6bel, and replaced him with the current vice president of operations, Federico Kochlowski, just two weeks before voting was set to begin.\n\nSacking an unpopular plant manager is a common union-avoidance tactic, much like firing the head coach of a poorly performing sports team to appease fans. VW did it in 2019.\n\nAn outcome that's hard to predict\n\nThe outcome of the vote at the Mercedes plant is harder to predict than it was for the Volkswagen factory because Mercedes has never had a union recognition election before. One thing is certain, however: The UAW's organizing campaign is not ending there.\n\nFain has repeatedly declared that the UAW intends to get all U.S. autoworkers to join the union - potentially doubling the ranks of its members in the industry.\n\nThere are about a dozen more campaigns underway that could follow the vote at Mercedes. At least 30% of the workers at Toyota's Missouri engine plant and Hyundai's factory in Alabama have already embraced the UAW - a key first step toward a formal election.", "source": {"uri":

While the company's official principles include a section on executives remaining neutral during organizing campaigns, the UAW has alleged in complaints that the automaker repeatedly broke the law in Alabama.\n\nThe European Commission, which represents the European Union in international affairs, also raised the Alabama situation with Mercedes.\n\nThe organization conveyed that \"we expect them to respect both local law and European values\" in advance of the Alabama election, said Olof Gill, a commission spokesperson.\n\nMercedes acknowledged speaking with \"various authorities,\" including

informed choice.\n\nUnions are more prevalent and powerful in Germany than in the U.S.\n\nMercedes employees in Germany are covered by a union contract, have representatives on the board and elect members to a works council that has a say in its decision-making.\n\nIn an emailed statement Monday, Ergun L\u00fcmali, the works council's chairman, encouraged Alabama employees to vote for the UAW and said it was monitoring the UAW's activities and the company's behavior.\n\nIn February, the CEO of Mercedes-Benz U.S., Michael G\u00f6bel, held a meeting with the plant's workforce where he suggested that a union would mean strikes, costly dues and obstacles to conflict resolution.\n\nMercedes informed employees last week that it was abruptly replacing G\u00f6bel, who would move effective immediately to a new role.\n\nThe anti-union push is \"every day -- you are walking around thinking, 'What is next?'\" Mercedes employee Brett Garrard said on a Thursday presentation for investors held by the SOC Investment Group, a union-affiliated shareholder advocacy organization.\n\n\"Everyone is so tired of it.\"", "source": {"uri": "europe.autonews.com", "dataType": "news",

Silvia, Professor of International Relations, American University School of International Service\n\nWorkers at two Mercedes plants near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, will soon vote for the first time on whether they want to join a union.\n\nUntil recently, it would have been safe to presume that a majority of the 5,200 people eligible to participate in this election - scheduled to run May 13-17, 2024 - would reject this opportunity to join the United Auto Workers.\n\nThe UAW, which has about 150,000 members employed by Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, made eight failed attempts to unionize foreign-owned auto plants in the South over the past 35 years. Two of those drives aimed to organize the entire Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nBut the third time the UAW tried to organize the VW plant, it prevailed, winning 73% of all ballots cast in an election held there in April.\n\nI conduct research about organized labor in the United States and other countries. My most recent book, \"The UAW's Southern Gamble: Organizing Workers at Foreign-owned Vehicle Plants,\" highlights the big challenges workers and the UAW have long faced when trying to organize auto plants in the South. In my view, the union was finally able to succeed in Chattanooga because of its new leadership and closer cooperation with VW workers in Germany.\n\nAs I explain in my book, one reason it took the UAW so long to score its first plantwide win was that an employer playbook for discouraging unionization had worked according to plan.\n\nThe automotive companies operating in the American South had largely located their plants in rural areas with little union membership. They screened out hires who might be sympathetic to unions and divided the workforce by using temp agencies to fill a significant share of positions. They deployed television monitors throughout the plant to run pro-company and anti-union messaging. And they donated lavishly to local churches, charities and politicians to undercut local support for unionization.\n\nAt the same time, Southern political and business leaders sought to attract investment - especially from foreign-owned manufacturers - by offering massive subsidies, low taxes, lower labor costs and a largely compliant workforce.\n\nSouthern autoworkers get paid less than than their Northern peers and have, until now, had little say over what happens in their workplace.\n\nThis model succeeded. Today, roughly 30% of U.S. auto workers are in the South, up from around 15% in 1990.\n\nWhenever the UAW has sought to unionize the industry throughout the region, the Southern political establishment, which the Republican Party dominates, has pushed back.\n\nMost recently, six Southern GOP governors encapsulated that tradition in a joint letter shortly before the VW vote. In it, they denounced the UAW's organizing drive as \"special interests looking to come into our state and threaten our jobs and the values we live by.\"\n\nThe UAW's win in Tennessee suggests that this model has begun to break down. Three factors can explain why it may no longer work.\n\nFirst, the election of Shawn Fain as UAW president in March 2023 marked a turning point. The charismatic electrician from Kokomo, Indiana, whom MotorTrend recently named \"Man of the Year,\" wasted no time shifting the UAW away from its prior accommodation with automakers.\n\nFain used forceful rhetoric and innovative tactics to score wins at the bargaining table throughout the UAW's concurrent strikes at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis in the fall of 2023.\n\nThe new contracts that followed gave workers substantial pay and benefits increases and restored cost-of-living adjustments. Those deals also eliminated a two-tier wage structure that paid workers hired since 2007 significantly less for doing the same job than colleagues with more seniority.\n\nBy the end of 2023, the UAW had shown Southern autoworkers that it could deliver gains that their employers were unlikely to grant on their own. More autoworkers throughout the region became interested in joining the union as a result.\n\nSecond, the UAW revamped its approach to labor organizing.\n\nOut went its top-down approach, led by union staffers who weren't necessarily the most skilled at organizing. Under Fain's leadership, the UAW hired Brian Shepherd - a proven organizer from the Service Employees International Union - to take charge.\n\nShepherd has empowered the automotive employees who were supportive of unionization to tailor the organizing drive to what they thought would work best.\n\nFor example, at the Mercedes plant, committed employees began to distribute union authorization cards far earlier than UAW had previously recommended, and it dispensed with visiting undecided workers at their homes because they thought that tactic would be counterproductive in the South.\n\nShepherd has hired professional organizers to back up his team, and he's promoted the creation of much more highly structured networks within plants than the voluntary organizing committees the UAW had traditionally used.\n\nThese changes have paid off. More Southern workers have signed cards authorizing the UAW as their collective bargaining agent than ever before.\n\nThird, the UAW's relationship with Volkswagen's German works council leadership, which represents employees in the workplace, has dramatically improved. A works council is an elected body of employees anchored in German law that represents employee interests at the workplace and company levels. It is distinct from the German metalworkers union, IG Metall, which has always been supportive of unionization at German-owned auto plants in the American South.\n\nTies between the UAW and the works council were strained during the 2014 and 2019 organizing campaigns. But the works council leadership changed in 2021.\n\nThis time, the German works council intervened in several instances to soften VW management's resistance to unionization and to urge Chattanooga employees to vote for the UAW.\n\nJust because the UAW won by almost a 3-to-1 margin in Chattanooga doesn't mean that victory at Mercedes in Alabama or elsewhere is a sure thing.\n\nBoth the Alabama political establishment and the factory's management have fought this labor organizing campaign much harder at Mercedes than Volkswagen executives and Tennessee officials did ahead of the vote at the Chattanooga plant.\n\nForging a close relationship between Mercedes' German works council and the UAW has proved elusive. On the other hand, a core of Mercedes Alabama employees has proved particularly adept at organizing. They set up a dense network in the plant based on \"walkers\" - that is, people whose jobs require them to move about the plant.\n\nThey have also summarized their circumstances with snappy lines that have gone viral. For example, longtime Mercedes employee Jeremy Kimbrell declared \"We are going to end the Alabama discount\" - a reference to the lower pay they receive compared to their peers in Michigan and other more established automotive manufacturing hubs.\n\nMercedes management in Alabama has also made a series of moves that have enraged and emboldened the workers at that plant. It let pay stagnate for many years and instituted a deeply unpopular two-tier wage structure in 2020, which management quickly undid last year after the UAW's successful strikes.\n\nMercedes management judged the anti-union campaign to be going so badly that it fired the plant's chief executive officer, Michael G\u00f6bel, and replaced him with the current vice president of operations, Federico Kochlowski, just two weeks before voting was set to begin.\n\nSacking an unpopular plant manager is a common union-avoidance tactic, much like firing the head coach of a poorly performing sports team to appease fans. VW did it in 2019.\n\nThe outcome of the vote at the Mercedes plant is harder to predict than it was for the Volkswagen factory because Mercedes has never had a union recognition election before. One thing is certain, however: The UAW's organizing campaign is not ending there.\n\nFain has repeatedly declared that the UAW intends to get all U.S. autoworkers to join the union - potentially doubling the ranks of its members in the industry.\n\nThere are about a dozen more campaigns underway that could follow the vote at Mercedes. At least 30% of the workers at Toyota's Missouri engine plant and Hyundai's factory in Alabama have already embraced the UAW - a key first step toward a formal election.\n\nStephen J.

The conversation included commitments that the governments will work together to promote unions and employee rights, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe sensitive communications.\n\nMercedes, based in Stuttgart, Germany, denied wrongdoing, saying in an statement that the company doesn't believe the UAW claims have merit and hasn't interfered or retaliated against employees seeking unionization. The German embassy declined to comment.\n\nAbout 5,200 workers at Mercedes facilities in Vance and Woodstock, Alabama, are slated to vote on joining the UAW on May 13 through 17, a pivotal test of the union's reinvigorated strength.\n\nOn a Roll\n\nBuoyed by victories last year against Detroit's automakers, the union is aiming to organize roughly 150,000 more workers at 14 automakers, including many where it's suffered prior defeats. That campaign secured a landmark win last month when workers at Volkswagen AG's 4,300-employee Tennessee auto plant voted to join the UAW, with the union getting 73% of the vote.\n\nBut Mercedes is proving a tougher target. While the company's official principles include a section on executives remaining neutral during organizing campaigns, the UAW has alleged in complaints that the automaker repeatedly broke the law in Alabama.\n\nThe European Commission, which represents the European Union in international affairs, also raised the Alabama situation with Mercedes. The organization conveyed that \"we expect them to respect both local law and European values\" in advance of the Alabama election, said Olof Gill, a commission spokesperson.\n\nMercedes acknowledged speaking with \"various authorities,\" including members of the European Commission. In an emailed statement late last week, the company said Mercedes respects the right of employees to unionize and will ensure they have the chance to make an informed choice.\n\nUnions are more prevalent and powerful in Germany than in the U.S. Mercedes employees in Germany are covered by a union contract, have representatives on the board and elect members to a works council that has a say in its decision-making. In an emailed statement Monday, Ergun L\u00fcmali, the works council's chairman, encouraged Alabama employees to vote for the UAW and said it was monitoring the UAW's activities and the company's behavior.\n\nIn February, the chief executive officer of Mercedes-Benz US International Inc., Michael G\u00f6bel, held a meeting with the plant's workforce where he suggested that a union would mean strikes, costly dues and obstacles to conflict resolution. Mercedes informed employees last week that it was abruptly replacing G\u00f6bel, who would move effective immediately to a new role.\n\nThe anti-union push is \"every day -- you're walking around thinking, 'What's next?'\" Mercedes employee Brett Garrard said on a May 2 presentation for investors held by the SOC Investment Group, a union-affiliated shareholder advocacy organization. \"Everyone's so tired of it.\"", "source": {"uri": "supplychainbrain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "supplychainbrain.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_busting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union busting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woodstock, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Woodstock, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Works council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.supplychainbrain.com/ext/resources/2023/05/01/MERCEDES-BENZ-iStock--franz12--1028682748.jpg?height=418&t=1686242581&width=800", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542752", "eventUri": "eng-9542752", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "dateEnd": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1111, "textEnd": 1128}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 3349, "textEnd": 3354}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Though the union has claimed a historic victory at Volkswagen's Chattanooga factory in April, the push for unionization at Mercedes' Vance manufacturing plant was met with resistance from the corporate structure.\n\nAccording to a March 2024 report by local Alabama publication AL.com, workers have gone to the NLRB and accused the three-pointed star of retaliating against workers at its Alabama plants for organizing or showing support for the UAW.\n\nIn a statement provided by the UAW, multiple Mercedes workers including Lakeisha Carter, Al Ezell and Taylor Snipes, received some sort of retaliatory punishment, or were terminated because of their pro-union stance by plant managers.\n\nSnipes told the UAW that he was terminated for having his phone on the factory floor, and recalled an intimidating meeting he had with management after he spoke up about being made to attend meetings to watch \"anti-union videos that are full of lies.\"\n\n\"During the meeting, I told management that it was suspicious that I was being called into the office on the same day that I spoke up in anti-union meeting,\" said Snipes. \"My manager said the two had nothing to do with one another, but then proceeded to aggressively interrogate me about why I support having a union.\"\n\nRelated: The UAW secured a historic win with VW, but its next challenge won't be easy\n\nMercedes-Benz U.S. International (MBUSI) told AL.com at the time that it had \"\"not interfered with or retaliated against any Team Member in their right to pursue union representation, and we do not agree that the claims have any merit.\"\n\n\"We look forward to presenting our case to the NLRB,\" Mercedes-Benz said. \"Additionally, MBUSI rejects claims that it has denied any Team Member leave for their union affiliation. Following the UAW's nationwide campaign to increase its membership, MBUSI wants to ensure its team members make an informed decision.\"\n\nMore Labor:\n\nOn April 3, the UAW filed charges against Mercedes-Benz Group AG in the automaker's home country, citing seven instances of documented anti-union practices that they allege are in violation of Germany's Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains, which prohibits German firms from disregarding worker's rights to form trade unions.\n\nIf found guilty, Mercedes could be face billions of Euros in penalties, fines and a ban on government contracts in Germany.\n\nIn a statement, MBUSI said that it \"respects our team members' choice whether to unionize and we look forward to participating in the election process to ensure every team member has a chance to cast their own secret-ballot vote, as well as having access to the information necessary to make an informed choice.\"\n\nA vote on whether to allow UAW representation at Mercedes' Vance plant in Alabama will take place from May 13-17.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n\nThe Arena Media Brands, LLC THESTREET is a

Two previous union drives there had failed.\n\nIt's a signal victory in the UAW's $40 million campaign to organize approximately 150,000 workers at foreign-owned, nonunion automakers across the South, including BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mercedes, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo, as well as domestic electric vehicle makers Lucid, Rivian and Tesla.\n\nThe UAW's next test will be a union vote at two massive Mercedes-Benz plants near Tuscaloosa, Alabama. It's a right-to-work state in the Deep South, where low taxes and labor costs are touted to potential employers as a benefit. Not a surprise that historically, the state has been hostile to unions.\n\nBut some of that may be changing.\n\nAt the sprawling Barber Motorsports Park on the outskirts of Birmingham, a huge crowd packed the bleachers and lawns at the Children's of Alabama Indy Grand Prix. It was a sunny Sunday on the last weekend in April.\n\nAfter a solemn singing of the national anthem, an announcement boomed from the jumbotron screens along the 2.38-mile track: \"It's time for those most famous words in all of sports. ... Drivers, start your engines!\"\n\nAs the IndyCars began zooming around the track -- they do 90 laps, a total of 207 miles -- some spectators noticed something going on above. A small airplane circled for several hours, pulling a banner that read: \"SUPPORT AUTO WORKERS -- UNIONSOLIDARITY.US\"\n\nThe message, paid for by More Perfect Union, a pro-labor group that supports union organizing across the region, was meant to build awareness and momentum for UAW organizing in Alabama. The aerial banner had also been flown over a public event in Tuscaloosa the previous day.\n\nSpecifically, the stunt was aimed at urging thousands of Mercedes-Benz workers in central Alabama to vote yes in their union election May 13 through May 17, overseen by the National Labor Relations Board; to join the United Auto Workers; and to help spread unionization across the South.\n\nIndyCar fan Scott Taylor, taking a break from watching the race, said he isn't a fan of the UAW. \"The reason Mercedes came to Alabama was because there wasn't a union,\" he said. \"If you make yourself the same price as the guys in Detroit, you're gonna drive Mercedes out of here.\"\n\nBut the UAW also had supporters in the crowd. Carlton Vaughn was shopping the vendor tents for IndyCar merch with two friends. \"Unions in America have been not looked at in a good light, and that's part of a bigger issue,\" he said. \"If you want people who are going to get behind your cause and you're a union worker in the automotive industry, the race is the way to do it. I'm down. I'm going to check out the website and see what's going on.\"\n\nAbout half an hour west of Birmingham along Interstate 20 is Mercedes-Benz's giant production complex, encompassing two huge factories, the company's U.S. headquarters, test tracks and other facilities. It's located in the tiny town of Vance, Alabama, on 1,000 acres of rolling hills in a sparsely populated rural area about 20 miles east of Tuscaloosa, which is home to the University of Alabama.\n\nThe land was gifted to Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, or MBUSI, in the early 1990s. Mercedes has invested as much as $7 billion since then to develop and expand the site, which is the company's U.S. production hub for luxury SUVs and electric batteries.\n\nThe company employs about 5,200 production workers, who earn some of the highest blue-collar wages in the state.\n\nTwo weeks before the historic unionization vote at MBUSI, Chandler was at UAW Local 112, headquarters for the workers' vote yes campaign. It's a busy office with pro-union posters on the walls and T-shirts, hats, visors and other UAW paraphernalia piled on tables. The union hall is tucked into a strip mall flanked by a Dollar General and a Family Dollar store, along a two-lane highway a few miles from the main Mercedes plant.\n\nChandler makes $24.50 an hour as an assembly worker after being at Mercedes for a year. (For the first six months, she was a temp working for a contractor.) She said the pay is better than most jobs in local manufacturing. But the work is hard, and she struggles to make ends meet living in Tuscaloosa, a college town where rents are high for the region.\n\n\"The work is definitely something to get used to,\" she said. \"It never really gets better, you just adapt to it. It's extremely tiring. Some nights I have to fight with myself to just get in the shower and make sure I put food in my body.\n\n\"I'm not too much of a picky worker,\" Chandler continued. \"I know I didn't come to work at a cupcake factory. But I do feel like I should be properly compensated -- especially from the wear and tear that it causes on your body. \"\n\nChandler takes inspiration from her brother, a union autoworker at Ford in Michigan, who just got a big raise under the UAW's new contract. \"When he talks about all the great things the UAW has done for them,\" Chandler said, \"I figure we deserve that just like they do. So I've really pushed hard to start unionizing.\"\n\nMercedes worker Jay White, 56, lives in a comfortable ranch home with a pool out back in the small town of Brent, Alabama, about 20 miles from the plant. White said he's doing just fine without the UAW. \"We work in a facility that's air-conditioned and heated, as clean as we can keep it,\" he said. \"We are not abused, we are not pulling fresh lumber off the green chain, laying asphalt in 120-degree weather. We have a very nice job.\"\n\nWhite is active in the MBUSI Workers Information Committee, a group that urges fellow workers to vote no on unionizing. Its homepage says: \"This group was formed to educate employees about the radical and self-serving agenda of the UAW. Help us spread the word that the Union is not needed at Mercedes!\" White posts material online and distributes paraphernalia like anti-UAW hats at the plant.\n\nHe makes the top wage at Mercedes, $34 an hour -- before a team leader premium and a shift differential for his nighttime work schedule. And with Alabama's low cost of living, he said, he's doing as well as UAW workers in the North.\n\n\"Intellectually, I don't agree with the way the union operates today,\" White said. \"We recognize individual responsibility. That's why we're a right-to-work state.\"\n\nWhich contributes to the anti-union environment in Alabama. Gallup, which tracks labor unions' popularity in the U.S., recently found that 67% of people in the South disapprove of unions. In the rest of the country, it's slightly less than 50%.\n\nThe company also has a website opposing the UAW. And managers have been showing vote-no videos to workers in the plants. One, titled \"What do unions cost?\" included this messaging: \"Strikes can make really good headlines for unions. But there is another side to them they don't always talk about. During a strike, employees don't get paid by their employer. And in the state of Alabama, striking employees don't get unemployment. . . . So the next time someone asks you to vote for the union, make sure to ask them to put in writing what you'll get in return. And if you don't want the union, vote no the week of May 13th.\"\n\nAccording to the NLRB's press office, the agency is currently investigating four UAW complaints of unfair labor practices in the latest organizing campaign: \"alleging Mercedes unlawfully fired three employees for engaging in protected activities, imposed discipline on employees for discussing unionization at work, and prohibited the distribution of union materials and paraphernalia at its Vance, AL facility.\"\n\nMercedes-Benz did not respond to questions in time for Marketplace's deadline.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican political and business leaders in Alabama have warned that unionization could drive major employers out. After six Republican governors of Southern states (Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas) issued a joint statement opposing the UAW's union drive at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey posted this on X:\n\nLeaders of the Business Council of Alabama are also inveighing against an expansion of unionization. Executive Vice President Clay Scofield, a Republican who just left the state Senate after serving for 13 years, wrote this for the group's website: \"Like a manufacturing tidal wave, Toyota Mazda, Honda, and Hyundai each built large and impressive facilities in Alabama, but just as a tide comes in, it can also quickly recede if the labor unions are successful in planting roots here.\"\n\nMercedes worker and union drive leader Jeremy Kimbrell, who has 24 years' tenure at MBUSI, said managers are warning workers of similar dire consequences if the union is voted in. For instance, that their jobs will be shipped to Mexico. But he's not buying it.\n\n\"To build what we already have in Vance, Alabama, at a new location,\" Kimbrell said, \"I feel confident $6 billion to $8 billion is what it would take.\"\n\nUniversity of Alabama labor economist Peter Brummund thinks the notion that Mercedes and other major manufacturers will exit the state -- after putting down roots because of Alabama's favorable business climate, tax incentives and inexpensive land and labor -- is far-fetched, at least in the short term.\n\n\"Mercedes has been here for a long time,\" Brummund said. \"The other manufacturers have made significant investments in their plants here in Alabama. It's going to be hard for them to leave.\"\n\nUnions have suffered multiple organizing failures in the South. Jeremy Kimbrell said he's been involved in several unsuccessful attempts to unionize Mercedes-Benz in Alabama; the UAW lost two votes in Tennessee before finally winning representation this year. But this time, Brummund said, \"I don't think it's unthinkable they can win.\"\n\nPolitics favors the anti-UAW side, he added. But economics leans the other way.\n\n\"Alabama's definitely Republican. But I think when you see similar workers making more, yeah sure, I'm going to vote Republican on those other issues, but when it comes to pay increase, that's in your pocket,\" he said.\n\n\"The strikes up in Detroit -- those were definitely first and important,\" Brummund continued. \"But I think UAW progress being made in Tennessee, in North Carolina, opens the door more. People in Alabama see they have more of an opportunity, because it's just next door.\"\n\nAfter next week's NLRB-supervised vote at Mercedes, the UAW organizing drive has its sights set on a Hyundai plant in Montgomery, Alabama, and a Toyota facility in Troy, Missouri, where workers are already gathering signatures on union cards.", "source": {"uri": "marketplace.org", "dataType": "news",

Two of those drives aimed to organize the entire Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nBut the third time the UAW tried to organize the VW plant, it prevailed, winning 73% of all ballots cast in an election held there in April.\n\nI conduct research about organized labor in the United States and other countries. My most recent book, \"The UAW's Southern Gamble: Organizing Workers at Foreign-owned Vehicle Plants,\" highlights the big challenges workers and the UAW have long faced when trying to organize auto plants in the South. In my view, the union was finally able to succeed in Chattanooga because of its new leadership and closer cooperation with VW workers in Germany.\n\nA successful model\n\nAs I explain in my book, one reason it took the UAW so long to score its first plantwide win was that an employer playbook for discouraging unionization had worked according to plan.\n\nThe automotive companies operating in the American South had largely located their plants in rural areas with little union membership. They screened out hires who might be sympathetic to unions and divided the workforce by using temp agencies to fill a significant share of positions. They deployed television monitors throughout the plant to run pro-company and anti-union messaging. And they donated lavishly to local churches, charities and politicians to undercut local support for unionization.\n\nAt the same time, Southern political and business leaders sought to attract investment - especially from foreign-owned manufacturers - by offering massive subsidies, low taxes, lower labor costs and a largely compliant workforce.\n\nSouthern autoworkers get paid less than than their Northern peers and have, until now, had little say over what happens in their workplace.\n\nThis model succeeded. Today, roughly 30% of U.S. auto workers are in the South, up from around 15% in 1990.\n\nWhenever the UAW has sought to unionize the industry throughout the region, the Southern political establishment, which the Republican Party dominates, has pushed back.\n\nMost recently, six Southern GOP governors encapsulated that tradition in a joint letter shortly before the VW vote. In it, they denounced the UAW's organizing drive as \"special interests looking to come into our state and threaten our jobs and the values we live by.\"\n\nStrong leadership\n\nThe UAW's win in Tennessee suggests that this model has begun to break down. Three factors can explain why it may no longer work.\n\nFirst, the election of Shawn Fain as UAW president in March 2023 marked a turning point. The charismatic electrician from Kokomo, Indiana, whom MotorTrend recently named \"Man of the Year,\" wasted no time shifting the UAW away from its prior accommodation with automakers.\n\nFain used forceful rhetoric and innovative tactics to score wins at the bargaining table throughout the UAW's concurrent strikes at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis in the fall of 2023.\n\nThe new contracts that followed gave workers substantial pay and benefits increases and restored cost-of-living adjustments. Those deals also eliminated a two-tier wage structure that paid workers hired since 2007 significantly less for doing the same job than colleagues with more seniority.\n\nBy the end of 2023, the UAW had shown Southern autoworkers that it could deliver gains that their employers were unlikely to grant on their own. More autoworkers throughout the region became interested in joining the union as a result.\n\nNew organizing approach\n\nSecond, the UAW revamped its approach to labor organizing.\n\nOut went its top-down approach, led by union staffers who weren't necessarily the most skilled at organizing. Under Fain's leadership, the UAW hired Brian Shepherd - a proven organizer from the Service Employees International Union - to take charge.\n\nShepherd has empowered the automotive employees who were supportive of unionization to tailor the organizing drive to what they thought would work best.\n\nFor example, at the Mercedes plant, committed employees began to distribute union authorization cards far earlier than UAW had previously recommended, and it dispensed with visiting undecided workers at their homes because they thought that tactic would be counterproductive in the South.\n\nShepherd has hired professional organizers to back up his team, and he's promoted the creation of much more highly structured networks within plants than the voluntary organizing committees the UAW had traditionally used.\n\nThese changes have paid off. More Southern workers have signed cards authorizing the UAW as their collective bargaining agent than ever before.\n\nGerman solidarity\n\nThird, the UAW's relationship with Volkswagen's German works council leadership, which represents employees in the workplace, has dramatically improved. A works council is an elected body of employees anchored in German law that represents employee interests at the workplace and company levels. It is distinct from the German metalworkers union, IG Metall, which has always been supportive of unionization at German-owned auto plants in the American South.\n\nTies between the UAW and the works council were strained during the 2014 and 2019 organizing campaigns. But the works council leadership changed in 2021.\n\nThis time, the German works council intervened in several instances to soften VW management's resistance to unionization and to urge Chattanooga employees to vote for the UAW.\n\nTougher territory\n\nJust because the UAW won by almost a 3-to-1 margin in Chattanooga doesn't mean that victory at Mercedes in Alabama or elsewhere is a sure thing.\n\nBoth the Alabama political establishment and the factory's management have fought this labor organizing campaign much harder at Mercedes than Volkswagen executives and Tennessee officials did ahead of the vote at the Chattanooga plant.\n\nForging a close relationship between Mercedes' German works council and the UAW has proved elusive. On the other hand, a core of Mercedes Alabama employees has proved particularly adept at organizing. They set up a dense network in the plant based on \"walkers\" - that is, people whose jobs require them to move about the plant.\n\nThey have also summarized their circumstances with snappy lines that have gone viral. For example, longtime Mercedes employee Jeremy Kimbrell declared \"We are going to end the Alabama discount\" - a reference to the lower pay they receive compared to their peers in Michigan and other more established automotive manufacturing hubs.\n\nMercedes management in Alabama has also made a series of moves that have enraged and emboldened the workers at that plant. It let pay stagnate for many years and instituted a deeply unpopular two-tier wage structure in 2020, which management quickly undid last year after the UAW's successful strikes.\n\nMercedes management judged the anti-union campaign to be going so badly that it fired the plant's chief executive officer, Michael G\u00f6bel, and replaced him with the current vice president of operations, Federico Kochlowski, just two weeks before voting was set to begin.\n\nSacking an unpopular plant manager is a common union-avoidance tactic, much like firing the head coach of a poorly performing sports team to appease fans. VW did it in 2019.\n\nAn outcome that's hard to predict\n\nThe outcome of the vote at the Mercedes plant is harder to predict than it was for the Volkswagen factory because Mercedes has never had a union recognition election before. One thing is certain, however: The UAW's organizing campaign is not ending there.\n\nFain has repeatedly declared that the UAW intends to get all U.S. autoworkers to join the union - potentially doubling the ranks of its members in the industry.\n\nThere are about a dozen more campaigns underway that could follow the vote at Mercedes. At least 30% of the workers at Toyota's Missouri engine plant and Hyundai's factory in Alabama have already embraced the UAW - a key first step toward a formal election.", "source": {"uri":

Though the union has claimed a historic victory at Volkswagen's Chattanooga factory in April, the push for unionization at Mercedes' Vance manufacturing plant was met with resistance from the corporate structure.\n\nAccording to a March 2024 report by local Alabama publication AL.com, workers have gone to the NLRB and accused the three-pointed star of retaliating against workers at its Alabama plants for organizing or showing support for the UAW.\n\nIn a statement provided by the UAW, multiple Mercedes workers including Lakeisha Carter, Al Ezell and Taylor Snipes, received some sort of retaliatory punishment, or were terminated because of their pro-union stance by plant managers.\n\nSnipes told the UAW that he was terminated for having his phone on the factory floor, and recalled an intimidating meeting he had with management after he spoke up about being made to attend meetings to watch \"anti-union videos that are full of lies.\"\n\n\"During the meeting, I told management that it was suspicious that I was being called into the office on the same day that I spoke up in anti-union meeting,\" said Snipes. \"My manager said the two had nothing to do with one another, but then proceeded to aggressively interrogate me about why I support having a union.\"\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99\n\nRelated: The UAW secured a historic win with VW, but its next challenge won't be easy\n\nMercedes-Benz U.S. International (MBUSI) told AL.com at the time that it had \"\"not interfered with or retaliated against any Team Member in their right to pursue union representation, and we do not agree that the claims have any merit.\"\n\n\"We look forward to presenting our case to the NLRB,\" Mercedes-Benz said. \"Additionally, MBUSI rejects claims that it has denied any Team Member leave for their union affiliation.

Amazon countered with a pro-company website, encouraging workers to \"Do It Without Dues.\"\n\nThe circumstances are different at Mercedes however.\n\nThe RWDSU vote came after only about 30% of the workforce in Bessemer had signed union cards, while roughly 70% in Tuscaloosa County have signed them.\n\nThe UAW is employing its own website, which provides a plant schedule for voting, and FAQs for the election, such as, \"Will forming a union result in the closure of our plant?\" (the union says no, as you might expect) and \"Will we have to go on strike?\"\n\n\"Our right to strike is the most powerful tool we have as workers. But strikes are rare, and we decide when to strike. Under the UAW Constitution, a strike requires the approval of 2/3 of participating workers in a democratic strike authorization vote,\" the site states in answer to the question.\n\nThe website also provides video testimonials from pro-union Mercedes workers and information about last year's \"Stand Up\" strike against the Big Three American automakers.\n\nBut the anti-union forces have won one aspect of the Google battle - put \"Mercedes UAW Alabama\" into the search engine, and the first link visible is to a pro-company page, \"The Truth About the UAW,\" a sponsored site.\n\n\"There are large numbers of employees who do not support the UAW's effort to unionize at Mercedes.\n\nMany are afraid to speak out but recognize the UAW's \"toxic effects on the workplace,\" the site states, with employees in videos criticizing the union push.\n\nIn February, the CEO of the Business Council of Alabama, Helena Duncan, also announced a website, Alabama Strong, online advertisements, and a campaign to \"provide Alabamians with a full and thorough picture of the economic dangers that unionization presents.\"\n\nThat site presents anti-union information in large white letters against a black background, warning about union dues, strikes, layoffs and plant closures.\n\nStrategy for conducting a union drive has appeared somewhat different with Mercedes-Benz than the Amazon fight. When the RWDSU first tried to unionize Amazon's Bessemer warehouse in 2021, they relied on several celebrity endorsements, such as actor Danny Glover, rapper Killer Mike and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and even got an endorsement from President Joe Biden.\n\nThe strategy garnered a lot of publicity nationally for the vote, which ultimately went against the union. A second vote is still in dispute.\n\nAs for Mercedes-Benz, UAW President Shawn Fain visited with some workers in March, and has traded barbs with Gov. Kay Ivey.\n\nBut Fain's visit was publicized largely after the fact, and his statements have come through livestreamed speeches during similar union drives against Volkswagen and Daimler Truck.",

Concurrently, the union's president is driving efforts to unionize plants in the southern US, including those owned by Asian and European automakers. This push recently triumphed at Volkswagen's Chattanooga plant, where 73% of workers voted to join the UAW. The focus now shifts to an impending unionization vote at a Mercedes Benz factory in Alabama, set to take place in mid-May.\n\nThe UAW's recent victories are sending shockwaves across the automotive industry, prompting giants like Toyota, Honda, and Volkswagen to hike wages proactively -- a move to stay competitive and ward off further unionization. These adjustments ripple through the industry, influencing labor market dynamics and operational costs.\n\nThe bigger picture: Gearing up for an electric future.\n\nThe UAW is strategically focusing on the electric vehicle (EV) market by allocating $40 million to organize workers at non-union auto factories and EV battery plants.

Alabama House debate stirs passion ahead of UAW push", "body": "Alabama lawmakers are poised to adopt a measure Democratic critics derided Tuesday as \"anti-union\" amid a rising current of unionization efforts at automobile manufacturers including a crucial vote next week at a Mercedes Benz plant in Vance.\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey could soon sign SB231, after it received a 72-29 vote on the Alabama House floor following a spirited debate that included jabs at Alabama's history toward thwarting unionizing efforts.\n\nIt was the second time in two weeks that the House debated and voted on the bill, as Tuesday's version is considered a final version adopted out of a join House and Senate conference committee.\n\nAlabama is one of 27 \"right-to-work\" states, allowing employees to refrain from union membership. The state enshrined its pushback from unions in 2016, when voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment that guarantees that workers in Alabama cannot be forced to join labor groups or pay dues, even if their employer is unionized.\n\n\"Alabama doesn't like unions, and the governor made a statement a few weeks ago that she didn't want the union,\" said Rep. Berry Forte, D-Eufaula, who was once a longtime member of the United Steelworkers. \"Why is the South so afraid of unions?\"\n\nIvey is expected to sign the legislation. She blasted efforts by United Auto Workers (UAW) earlier this year, saying their effort places Alabama's \"model for economic success\" as \"under attack.\"\n\nUnder SB231, economic incentives the state approved to lure a company to Alabama would be withheld if the firm voluntarily recognizes a union or does not hold a secret ballot during union elections. Union elections are typically done through secret ballots.\n\nAlso disqualifying is if a company voluntarily discloses an employee's personal contact information to a labor organization or a third-party acting on behalf of a labor group without the employee's prior written consent.\n\nThe Alabama Department of Revenue would be charged with handling investigations into potential violations, according to the bill.\n\nThe bill sets a date of Jan. 1, 2025, to revoke economic incentives. In other words, any benefits given to companies before New Year's Day would be protected from the bill.\n\nThat date is notable given that a key union vote is set to occur next week at the Mercedes Benz plant in Vance that involves approximately 5,000 employees. The auto manufacturer, which operates the plant a 25-minute drive east of Tuscaloosa, won a $253 million economic package from the state in 1993.\n\nA union drive is also underway at the Hyundai plant in Montgomery. Under federal law, workers can request unionization if 30% of workers at a specific workplace sign union authorization cards. The UAW said it requests elections once it gets 70% backing for union support at a specific workplace.\n\n\"If UAW gets a foothold in Alabama, all of the rest of the companies will organize right behind them,\" Forte said. \"They will have a good contract. I know the governor is shaking now. It probably will pass.\"\n\nOther Democratic lawmakers questioned the intent of the legislation. Similar legislation is under consideration in Georgia and Tennessee. The UAW recently scored its first major win in the South, when 73% of workers cast votes to support unionization at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga.\n\n\"That leads me to believe there are some nefarious tactics in the background causing us to take this road,\" said state Rep. Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville, the chamber's Minority Leader. \"I don't see this as what it appears to be on the surface as the reason for (SB231). I think there are some other reasons for it.\"\n\nThe legislation's House sponsor said the Democratic critics were overselling the bill's intent.\n\nState Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, said SB321 was not aimed at blocking unionizing efforts, but was put into place to prevent secret unionization elections he argued could be used to intimidate Alabama workers.\n\n\"If a union comes in and you cast a vote and the current situation is a card with your name on it, people would know how you voted,\" Stadthagen said. \"In a way, this is a harmless bill to make people feel comfortable.\"\n\nHe said his concern with union votes that occur when someone signs their name to a card, and in which others can see how their colleague is voting.\n\n\"People would know how you voted,\" Stadthagen said. \"In other states, there are certain entities going to their house to get their votes this way. Nationwide, certain things have happened. Think about these employees working to provide for their families and how stressful that will be. This would be protection for them to make them feel comfortable for them and their companies.\"\n\nHe also gave an example of a single mother working at a factory intimidated by men \"who wanted her to do something.\"\n\n\"You don't think she'd be intimidated?\" Stadthagen said during a floor debate with Forte, who responded, \"The union will put something in the contract to protect. No one will fool with her. If you do, you're automatically gone. Women came up from the ladder from no where to make as much as men.\"\n\nStadthagen replied, \"Absolutely. But in any situation, anyone can feel intimidate for a number of reasons. They will not make the right decision that is best for them, but will do what is best for the (work or cultural) environment.\"\n\nThe debate over SB231 comes as union members is steadily rising in Alabama, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Alabama had 156,000 union members last year, or 7.5% of the workforce, up from a historic low of 5.9% in 2021, and 7.2% in 2022.\n\nAlabama, like other Southern states, still lags behind the national averages for union membership which is around 10%. But 11 other states had union membership below 5%, with South Carolina having the lowest participation rate at 2.3%.\n\nThe last major unionization effort at a manufacturing plant in Alabama occurred in 2021, when thousands of hourly workers at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer voted nearly two-to-one against unionizing during a secret, mail-in election.\n\nThe UAW's interest in Alabama comes after union strikes at Big Three Detroit automakers -- General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis -- led to contracts with higher pay and arguable better working conditions. The UAW is now targeting 13 nonunion automakers, including the Mercedes-Benz site in Vance.\n\nVoting is scheduled to take place May 13 and 17 on whether workers will join the UAW. Vote totals are expected May 17.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type":

Workers at the VW plant voted in late April to unionise by a margin of 73% in favour of the UAW, a strong showing that came after two previous losses at the same facility.\n\nThe UAW and labour academics have said that the company is resisting unionisation efforts more heavily than VW did, which could make winning at Mercedes more difficult.\n\nJeremy Kimbrell, a union drive leader at the factory, said Mercedes has been trying to counter unionising by hiring anti-union consultancy RWP.\n\nKimbrell's claims were read out at the Mercedes annual meeting by a representative of Germany's Association of Critical Shareholders (DKA), which represents small investors on environmental, social and governance issues.\n\nMercedes declined to comment on whether it had hired RWP, a consultancy whose CEO on LinkedIn describes the firm as helping companies to remain union-free. RWP's CEO also declined to comment on whether Mercedes was a client.\n\nThe UAW is hoping to continue its success in the South by riding a surge in public support for unions and capitalising on the record contracts it secured with Detroit's automakers last fall. In late April, it also finalised an agreement with truck maker Daimler Truck, a victory that some industry observers said could help boost support at Mercedes.\n\nDaimler Truck's locations are dotted throughout the South around the Mercedes plant.

In the long run, neither may come out on top.\n\nTwo weeks ago, workers at Volkswagen's Chattanooga, Tennessee, factory voted for United Auto Workers representation. Much has been written about how \"historic\" this decision is. The Chattanooga plant makes VW the frst foreign-owned car manufacturer in the South to unionize.\n\nWhat isn't being discussed: How big government and big labor colluded to sway the vote and why VW employees are likely to regret it.\n\nThe union successfully organized Volkswagen's Pennsylvania facility in 1978. Years of labor unrest followed, with VW eventually shuttering the plant in 1987.\n\nCrucial to UAW's campaign was the promise that VW workers would receive the same rich $108,000 annual pay package (equivalent to a Silicon Valley software developer's income) that the union won for Detroit Three blue-collar workers last fall.\n\nBut there was a stick to go along with the carrot. In a not-so-subtle threat to all 13 non-union auto companies being targeted by the UAW, 33 Democratic Party senators sent a letter earlier this year demanding that they remain neutral in the union's campaign.\n\n\"We believe a neutrality agreement is the bare minimum standard manufacturers should meet in respecting workers' rights,\" wrote the senators, before getting to the point. \"Especially as companies receive and benefit from federal funds related to the electric vehicle transition.\"\n\nThese are dramatically different times in the U.S. auto industry since the UAW last tried to organize VW's Chattanooga plant in 2019. Today's industry is being forced by U.S. governments -- at both the federal and state levels -- to manufacture electric vehicles to solve the manufactured climate crisis.\n\nFailure to meet government sales mandates will be met with massive fines that increase by leaps and bounds after 2026. California, the nation's biggest auto market, will, for example, require that 35% of automaker sales be of battery-powered vehicles by 2026.\n\nFailure to meet that number will cost them $20,000 per vehicle for every vehicle below the threshold. The percentage jumps to 43% in 2027, 51% in 2028, 59% in 2029, and 68% in 2030 on the way to outlawing the sales of gasoline cars in 2035. Federal penalties are similarly harsh.\n\nTesla aside (as an EV-only seller, it is not only exempt from penalties but also receives generous subsidies), just 5% of sales today are electric, with 50% of EV buyers returning to a gas car when they go back to market.\n\nTo help automakers meet the arbitrary sales goals, the U.S. government is greasing the \"EV transition\" skids with billions in federal aid under the Inflation Reduction Act to construct battery plants and sweeten each EV purchase with $7,500. To gain that subsidy, the Biden administration prefers that EVs be domestically produced -- preferably with UAW labor that ultimately fills Democratic election fund coffers.\n\nAn admirer of Communist Chinese industrial policy, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm is determined to follow in China's EV footsteps. \"China ... has adopted 14 five-year plans that are focused on dominating supply chains and manufacturing products that we used to excel in. They're producing huge volumes of solar panels and EVs,\" she told media allies at the National Press Club in February. \"But we are fighting back.\"\n\nVW got the message. In 2019 it played a part in the union's narrow defeat by actively discouraged unionization, creating a website touting the benefits of a non-union shop and linking to anti-UAW editorials and articles about UAW corruption, while warning that overly expensive labor could be replaced by automation.\n\nVW was notably neutral in its handling of this year's UAW campaign and will pay the price for the union victory. VW's non-union labor costs on the popular VW Atlas SUV and VW ID.4 electric vehicle are 30% less than its U.S. competitors.\n\nWith a UAW shop, VW will lose its competitive cost advantage over Detroit automakers -- a big reason it located its sprawling 350,000-square-foot facility in right-to-work Tennessee in 2011 -- and be forced to submit to inefficient UAW work rules.\n\nBut the cost equation may be changing as governments dictate product planning.\n\nFord lost over $4 billion on its EV operations last year, and VW EV sales have cratered in Europe, where EVs are also mandated.\n\nVW has dealt with unions for years in Europe; the company may feel the cost of unionization is a necessary price to stay in the good graces of Democrats who control the subsidy spigot. \"VW is accustomed to a union environment in Germany,\" said veteran industry analyst and Seeking Alpha columnist Doron Levin. \"But the UAW is likely to be more adversarial and militant than Germany's metal workers union.\"\n\nIt's the second time VW's U.S. facilities have opened their doors to the UAW. The union successfully organized Volkswagen's Pennsylvania facility in 1978. Years of labor unrest followed, with VW eventually shuttering the plant in 1987. Let's see what happens in Tennessee.\n\n\"Every autoworker in this country deserves their fair share of the auto industry's record profits, whether at the Big Three or the Non-Union Thirteen,\" UAW president Shawn Fain said in response to the senators' February letter. \"It's time for the auto companies to stop breaking the law and take their boot off the neck of the American autoworker, whether they're at Volkswagen, Toyota, Tesla, or any other corporation doing business in this country.\"\n\nFain says he plans to unionize all of the non-union auto plants. His next target? Mercedes-Benz's Alabama plant.\n\nWhat's missing in Fain's triumphant bluster is any sense that unionization could have serious downsides for workers.\n\nBig Three automakers are accelerating robotic automation in their plants to replace expensive worker jobs. In union-heavy Europe, meanwhile, the high costs and low demand for EVs have led to thousands of layoffs in the last year as carmakers and their suppliers struggle to meet governments' socialist EV vision\n\nThe EV mandates should remind us of when the heavy hand of government forced bankers to give mortgages to uncreditworthy borrowers in the 1990s. That turned out well, didn't it? Now the government wants control of the auto industry. The United Kingdom tried this decades ago. It ended up selling off domestic automakers and more or less destroying the once-proud British car industry,\n\nIf Granholm really wants to beat China, she should consider the effect that top-down increases in labor costs will have on America's ability to compete. In the short term, consumers will have to bear higher prices; in the long term, workers may endure decreased job security. Sounds like a great leap backward to us.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The conversation included commitments that the governments will work together to promote unions and employee rights, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe sensitive communications.\n\nMercedes, based in Stuttgart, Germany, denied wrongdoing, saying in an statement that the company doesn't believe the UAW claims have merit and hasn't interfered or retaliated against employees seeking unionization. The German embassy declined to comment.\n\nAbout 5,200 workers at Mercedes facilities in Vance and Woodstock, Alabama, are slated to vote on joining the UAW on May 13 through 17, a pivotal test of the union's reinvigorated strength.\n\nOn a Roll\n\nBuoyed by victories last year against Detroit's automakers, the union is aiming to organize roughly 150,000 more workers at 14 automakers, including many where it's suffered prior defeats. That campaign secured a landmark win last month when workers at Volkswagen AG's 4,300-employee Tennessee auto plant voted to join the UAW, with the union getting 73% of the vote.\n\nBut Mercedes is proving a tougher target. While the company's official principles include a section on executives remaining neutral during organizing campaigns, the UAW has alleged in complaints that the automaker repeatedly broke the law in Alabama.\n\nThe European Commission, which represents the European Union in international affairs, also raised the Alabama situation with Mercedes. The organization conveyed that \"we expect them to respect both local law and European values\" in advance of the Alabama election, said Olof Gill, a commission spokesperson.\n\nMercedes acknowledged speaking with \"various authorities,\" including members of the European Commission. In an emailed statement late last week, the company said Mercedes respects the right of employees to unionize and will ensure they have the chance to make an informed choice.\n\nUnions are more prevalent and powerful in Germany than in the US. Mercedes employees in Germany are covered by a union contract, have representatives on the board and elect members to a works council that has a say in its decision-making. In an emailed statement Monday, Ergun L\u00fcmali, the works council's chairman, encouraged Alabama employees to vote for the UAW and said it was monitoring the UAW's activities and the company's behavior.\n\nIn February, the chief executive officer of Mercedes-Benz US International Inc., Michael G\u00f6bel, held a meeting with the plant's workforce where he suggested that a union would mean strikes, costly dues and obstacles to conflict resolution. Mercedes informed employees last week that it was abruptly replacing G\u00f6bel, who would move effective immediately to a new role.\n\nThe anti-union push is \"every day -- you're walking around thinking, 'What's next?'\" Mercedes employee Brett Garrard said on a Thursday presentation for investors held by the SOC Investment Group, a union-affiliated shareholder advocacy organization. \"Everyone's so tired of it.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_busting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union busting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woodstock, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Woodstock, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Works council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542752", "eventUri": "eng-9542752", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "dateEnd": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1122, "textEnd": 1139}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

representation.\n\nAt the meeting, the US representatives reminded their German counterparts of their respective governments' commitments to work together to promote trade unions and workers' rights.\n\nMercedes has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that it believed the UAW allegations have no merit, and that there had been no interference or retaliation against workers campaigning for union representation.\n\nThe European Commission has also urged Mercedes to respect local laws and European values.\n\nThe vote due to take place between May 13-17 was ordered by the US National Labour Relations Board after it ruled that enough of the company's 6,000 workers had signed union cards supporting representation.\n\nUS government officials raised concerns that the company had fired union activists, retaliated against union activists and are holding mandatory meetings where Mercedes executives are discouraging workers from unionising.\n\nThe Morning Star has seen company documents

Workers at the VW plant voted in late April to unionize by a margin of 73% in favour of the UAW, a strong showing that came after two previous losses at the same facility.\n\nThe UAW and labour academics have said that the company is resisting unionisation efforts more heavily than VW did, which could make winning at Mercedes more difficult.\n\nJeremy Kimbrell, a union drive leader at the factory, said Mercedes has been trying to counter unionising by hiring anti-union consultancy RWP.\n\nKimbrell's claims were read out at the Mercedes annual meeting by a representative of Germany's Association of Critical Shareholders (DKA), which represents small investors on environmental, social and governance issues.\n\nMercedes declined to comment on whether it had hired RWP, a consultancy whose CEO on LinkedIn describes the firm as helping companies to remain union-free. RWP's CEO also declined to comment on whether Mercedes was a client.\n\nThe UAW is hoping to continue its success in the South by riding a surge in public support for unions and capitalizing on the record contracts it secured with Detroit's automakers last fall. In late April, it also finalised an agreement with truck maker Daimler Truck, a victory that some industry observers said could help boost support at Mercedes.\n\nDaimler Truck's locations are dotted through the South around the Mercedes plant. Additionally, Daimler and Mercedes have shared history: Daimler AG spun off Daimler Truck in early 2022, and then became Mercedes-Benz Group. Mercedes retains a 30% stake in Daimler Truck, according to a company spokesperson.

Mercedes-Benz, lured to Alabama by relatively low wages and a generous economic incentive package from the state in 1993, is widely credited with kickstarting Alabama's automotive industry and setting a template still followed by the state's industrial recruiters today.\n\nUnited Auto Workers has tried to organize the factory for years, including an effort in 2014. But none have gotten as far as the current drive.\n\nThe union said in February that a majority of workers had signaled support for the potential union through signing union cards. The union called for the vote in April saying a supermajority of employees had signed a petition for a union, though it did not provide precise numbers. The UAW said in January that it would call for an election when 70% of workers signed union authorization cards.\n\nBrett Garrard, team leader and supply chain operator at the Mercedes battery plant wears a wrist band reading \"Stand Up\" at the UAW Local 112 headquarters in Vance, Ala., on May 2. / Alabama Reflector Photo by Will McLelland\n\nWorkers who support the union have cited pay and benefit stagnation, uncertain shift scheduling and the use of temp workers in pushing for the union. While autoworkers around the state generally make more than the median household income ($64,682 in a year versus $59,674), a November study by Alabama Arise, a nonprofit that advocates on poverty and working class issues, found that wage growth had stalled.\n\nThe study found further disparities in wages between men and women, and white workers and workers of color. Dev Wakeley, worker policy advocate at Arise, said Monday that unionization could help with these disparities.\n\n\"I think that would be a huge benefit of unionizing,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Arise, real wages for plant employees declined by 11% from 2002 to 2019. The report also found that Alabama workers' wages trailed those of autoworkers in other states and found Black workers, Hispanic workers and women were paid substantially less in the state automotive industry.\n\nGarrard said that previous union drives lost momentum because managers would change personalities promise they're listening.\n\n\"But in 20 years I've heard the story,\" he said. \"I haven't seen the fruits of it.\"\n\n\"(Mercedes-Benz U.S. International) fully respects our team members' choice whether to unionize, and we look forward to participating in the election process to ensure every team member has a chance to cast their own secret-ballot vote, as well as having access to the information necessary to make an informed choice,\" wrote a Mercedes-Benz spokesperson Monday. \"We will continue to share facts and opinions through open and direct communication to support our team members in making an informed decision.\"\n\n(READ MORE: Tennessee's GOP governor says Volkswagen plant workers made a mistake in union vote)\n\nWorkers have said they have seen anti-union presentations at the plant. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey has also criticized the union drive.\n\n\"Since Mercedes-Benz announced they were making our state home to their first U.S. manufacturing facility in 1993, tens of thousands of Alabama families have been positively impacted,\" Ivey wrote in a statement Monday. \"Let me be crystal clear that Joe Biden's UAW has no interest in seeing Alabamians succeed. Instead, their interest here is ensuring money from hardworking Alabama families ends up in the UAW bank account. That is why they are willing to spend $40 million to gain a foothold in the Southeast's automotive powerhouse.\"\n\nA range of thoughts\n\nDuring a shift change at the Mercedes-Benz plant on Thursday, employees expressed a range of views on the union vote. Some said the jobs were better than comparable ones in the area.\n\nJason Cook, a team leader in the paint shop, declined to say which way he would vote, but he said he felt that current jobs were good for the area.\n\n\"I mean, I give my opinion that way,\" he said. \"But I do see some things from the pro side where they could have some legitimate reasons to actually vote it in.\"\n\nJames Williams, who works in the body shop, said he would vote no for similar reasons.\n\n\"I don't think you'll find any better than what we've got anywhere around here,\" he said.\n\nAs he spoke, Williams shouted at a colleague who was headed toward the turnstile about the union -- \"You want a 'yeah,' that's a 'yeah' right there,\" he said.\n\nWilliam Steward, who works in paint, said that he was a yes vote because he wanted more people to advocate for them.\n\n\"We don't really have anybody that fights for us,\" he said.\n\nGarrard said he began to sense changes at the plant in 2008. Employees, he said, were forced into buyouts with callback rights, but they were replaced with temporary employees.\n\n\"You know, 20 years is a long time,\" he said. \"I've seen several different CEOs come and go. And the story is always the same. 'Hey, it'll get better. We're listening to you.' But it doesn't. They give you a $2 an hour raise, they up your insurance premiums on the back end of it. So where'd the raise go? Not in our bank account.\"\n\nAustin Brooks, left, and Brett Garrard talk about their efforts to unionize Mercedes workers during an interview at the UAW Local 112 headquarters in Vance, Ala., on May 2. / Alabama Reflector Photo by Will McLelland\n\nGarrard said recent UAW victories had encouraged organization. He said there is momentum this time. The UAW won a major strike last year against the Big Three automakers and \"oh man, there was a buzz, it was electric;\" Volkswagen gets a union and \"wow, there's momentum, we could do this, maybe someone will hear us,\" and Daimler Truck wins a contract and \"it was big for them, as it should be.\"\n\nOpposition\n\nAlabama officials have not shied away from their own opposition to the union. Ivey has repeatedly called UAW an out-of-state interest group and accused the organization of threatening the state's economic development model. Last month, Ivey signed a letter ahead of the Chattanooga vote suggesting that voting for a union would cost jobs.\n\n\"We need your efforts to serve as a model to other local areas grappling with this threat from Detroit,\" she said in February. \"Alabamians work harder than anyone and make the best automobiles in the world. And we must not let UAW tell us any different.\"\n\n(READ MORE: UAW puts VW Chattanooga on notice about plant changes)\n\nThe Business Council of Alabama has also opposed the union. It has launched an anti-union website and wrote that unionization could harm Alabama's economy.\n\n\"I remain confident that Alabama's workers are too smart and savvy to fall for the claims of snake oil salesmen who peddle UAW union membership as the magic elixir that will fix all that ails us,\" wrote Clay Scofield, a council executive vice president and a former Alabama Senate majority leader.\n\nA message seeking comment was left with the council Monday. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 7.5% of Alabama's workforce belonged to a union in 2023, the highest rate in the South.\n\nGarrard and Brooks said that managers at the plant, as well as an app, have been advocating against the union.\n\nGarrard provided some materials that wrote such as stating that public shaming could result from not paying union dues and information about UAW officials having been convicted for embezzlement.\n\nGarrard said he's not worried about the plant moving out of Alabama because of a potential union, saying supply and demand fluctuates. He said there were buyouts and cutbacks around 2008, but when the economy strengthens, people buy cars and production increases.\n\n\"They're going to build this car, and they're going to build it in Alabama,\" he said. \"There's billions of dollars invested in it. Our politicians made sure they had an easy avenue to get here. They're not going anywhere. They just want -- they don't want things to change. They don't want us breaking the status quo.\"\n\nVoting\n\nVoting on the union will start Monday and run through May 17. The National Labor Relations Board, which oversees union elections, said it plans to count ballots and announce the totals on May 17.\n\nSome workers said Thursday they were undecided. Dante Keller, cell operator, said he was waiting to see who would speak about insurance, including retirement insurance.\n\nGarrard and Brooks said workers ought to have a greater share of the company's profits. They noted the Vance plant manufactures luxury SUV models, including the GLE and GLS, as well as the EQS and EQE, two luxury electric cars.\n\n\"We're building Mercedes, we're building a luxury vehicle,\" Garrard said, \"so if any auto worker is deserving of a share in the profits -- \"\n\n\"Then it should be the luxury car brand,\" Brooks finished.\n\nGarrard also said southern autoworkers shouldn't be punished for where they work.\n\n\"I'm proud to be a southerner,\" he said. \"I'm hardworking. Mercedes says that's why they came here. Because they're hardworking people. So pay us what we're worth. Treat us like we are the family you claim we are, because I don't treat my family this way.\"\n\nRead more at AlabamaReflector.com.", "source": {"uri": "timesfreepress.com", "dataType": "news",

Just a 25-mile stretch of I-20, between Tuscaloosa and Birmingham. Here, union hopes have been raised, dashed and dragged out over years.\n\nThis is the Deep South, after all, where anti-union attitudes are enshrined in state constitutions.\n\nA major test of those attitudes comes in a week, when more than 5,000 workers at a Mercedes-Benz plant will begin voting on whether to join the United Auto Workers union. It's the latest expression of deep worker dissatisfaction in a part of the state that's home to two other fiercely-fought labor disputes, all situated right off the same highway.\n\nInside the seven-million-square-foot Mercedes plant in Vance, Ala., the journey to this dramatic juncture has been neither straight nor smooth.\n\nYou hear it in the story of Jacob Ryan.\n\nWhen Ryan first got to Mercedes as a temporary employee 10 years ago, he remembers a coworker handing him a pro-union flier in the lobby.\n\n\"I read it and ended up throwing it away before I got to my team room,\" Ryan says. \"I didn't want to be seen with a flier.\"\n\nHe feared it would jeopardize his future at the company.\n\nLike his coworkers, Ryan knew the jobs at Mercedes were highly desirable. In a region that had lost its steel and textile industries long ago, the auto plant offered wages and benefits comparable to union jobs up north. The UAW didn't stand a chance in this environment.\n\nIn fact, a key reason the Alabama auto jobs even existed was because of the lack of unions. Alabama was among several southern states that lured foreign automakers with big incentives and the promise that unions would never be welcome. Within just a few decades, not just Mercedes, but Honda, Hyundai, Toyota and Mazda were all building cars in Alabama, adding tens of thousands of well-paying jobs to the state's economy.\n\nIn 2016, the state doubled down on its anti-union stance. Alabama voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment protecting the state's right to work law. Workers here cannot be forced to join unions or pay dues, even if their workplace is unionized.\n\nAmid all of this, efforts by the UAW to drum up union support at Mercedes sputtered along for decades, gaining little ground. Until now.\n\nAsk workers what changed, and they'll point to a number of factors, with two that stand out.\n\nFirst, they say life at Mercedes changed over the past five years. Wage growth slowed, and in early 2020, the company introduced a two-tier wage system. New hires would never earn as much as coworkers hired before them, even when doing the same job.\n\nMercedes declined to comment on these changes or its pay structure, but East Carolina University professor AJ Jacobs, author of The New Domestic Automakers in the United States and Canada, says Mercedes has been facing competition from other luxury carmakers and pressure to transition to electric vehicles.\n\n\"They need to cut, cut, cut, due to the enormous transition costs,\" Jacobs wrote in an email.\n\nA second turning point came last fall, with the UAW strike against Ford, General Motors and Stellantis (formerly Chrysler), which scored big wins for workers.\n\nIn Alabama, Jeremy Kimbrell, who's worked for Mercedes since 1999, was listening closely to the UAW's newly-elected president Shawn Fain railing against stratospheric CEO pay at Detroit's Big 3 automakers as worker wages were going backwards.\n\n\"You can tell right off, man, this guy don't play,\" says Kimbrell.\n\nJust over a week after the Big 3 autoworkers ratified their record contracts, Mercedes workers began signing union cards. In three months, the UAW announced it had a majority of workers at the plant on board.\n\nAs the union campaign picked up steam, the company announced raises and an end to the two-tier pay system, according to workers who were agitating to join the union.\n\n\"They were hungry for it,\" Kimbrell says. \"I've just been blown away by the lack of division inside the plant.\n\nAnd now, Ryan, who once feared holding a flier, is the guy handing them out.\n\nMercedes, for its part, has been trying to convince workers that they don't need a union.\n\n\"We believe open and direct communication with our team members is the best path forward to ensure continued success,\" Mercedes said through a statement provided to NPR.\n\nTwo weeks before the union election, the company announced a leadership change in Alabama. Workers say they're being told to give their new CEO a chance.\n\nAnd for months, there have been the videos. According to workers, Mercedes has been starting every shift with videos suggesting unions are more trouble than they're worth. One mentions a long, painful and unsuccessful labor fight just across the I-20, with the implied lesson: Just because you have a union doesn't mean you get what you want.\n\nUnder the rolling hills of Brookwood, Ala., are a series of mines that produce metallurgical coal, the kind used in steelmaking. In 2021, about a thousand coal miners represented by the United Mine Workers of America went on strike and stayed on strike for nearly two years.\n\nIt was a long time coming. The problems started in 2015 when the company that owned these mines declared bankruptcy, blaming a sharp drop in coal prices and high labor costs.\n\nA year later, Wall Street investors bought the business, renaming it Warrior Met Coal. Workers agreed to big cuts to their pay and benefits in a bid to save their jobs.\n\nThe miners believed the cuts were temporary. But five years later, they were still working the same jobs for less money. Feeling betrayed, they called a strike and demanded their old wages and benefits back.\n\nWith workers out of the mines for months on end, a food bank was set up. Donations were collected from around the country. The workers did collect strike pay from their union -- around $800 every two weeks -- but it was a struggle for miners like Antwon McGhee, who were accustomed to bringing home bigger paychecks for their dangerous work.\n\n\"I had house notes that I had to catch up on and some friends I had to go to to borrow money for those house notes,\" says McGhee, a 17-year veteran of the coal company.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's financial picture was looking up. Steel prices were skyrocketing. Warrior Met brought in miners from out of state, and profits soared.\n\nFinally, in 2023, the union called uncle and ended the strike. Many of the miners had already crossed the picket line or left for other jobs. A couple hundred went back underground to work in the mines, without a new contract.\n\nNegotiations continue to this day, with little movement. Hourly wages continue to be below where they were in 2016, according to the union. Still, McGhee maintains that he doesn't regret the strike.\n\n\"If you have something that you believe in, you fight for it, win or lose,\" he says.\n\nWhen it comes to the challenges that unions face, what's happening at Warrior Met is Exhibit A. Companies with resources can push back against unions, dragging out disputes for years. Another example of this lies just half an hour east along I-20.\n\nIn late 2020, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union stunned corporate America and the American public when amid the dark days of COVID, it announced it had collected enough employee signatures to call for a union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Ala.\n\nFor the first time, thousands of hourly workers at an Amazon facility in the U.S. would vote on whether to unionize.\n\n\"It was really exciting,\" says Isaiah Thomas, a college student who worked on the docks at the warehouse. \"To hear that workers were trying to unionize was a sense of hope.\"\n\nDescribing the job as \"hell on earth,\" Thomas says workers were fed up with the constant monitoring and the ever-present fear of being fired for working too slowly. Some felt underpaid at a time when the company was raking in profits due to the pandemic.\n\nBut when the mail-in ballots were tallied, the vote was nearly two to one, against unionizing.\n\nAmong those voting no was JC Thompson, who sought a job at Amazon weeks after the warehouse opened, drawn by the starting wage of $15 an hour.\n\n\"Way above minimum wage, and you didn't need a degree,\" says Thompson.\n\nWhen pro-union coworkers talked to him about unionizing, he'd simply ask why?\n\nTo the argument that workers needed more money, he'd respond, \"Well, who don't need more money?\"\n\nBut the union's loss at Amazon in 2021 was not the final word. Labor officials found Amazon had illegally interfered in the union campaign, including by getting the U.S. Postal Service to install a mailbox on site where workers could drop their ballots. The union charged it was an intimidation tactic that kept some workers from voting out of fear that Amazon was surveilling the mailbox.\n\nA do-over election was held a year later. That time, the election was too close to call, and again there were complaints that the election was tainted.\n\nA new hearing is underway in Birmingham, which could lead to a third election.\n\nStill, Michael Foster, who led the organizing at Amazon for the union, remains undaunted.\n\n\"This is not a rabbit race. This is a race for the turtles,\" he says.\n\nHe points to everything that's unfolded since the first Amazon vote: new unions at Starbucks, Trader Joes, REI. Strikes from coast to coast. The hot labor summer of 2023.\n\n\"I believe that's what our fight was for,\" says Foster. \"To wake up a sleeping giant.\"\n\nBack at Mercedes, assembly worker Moesha Chandler, who joined the company early last year, is unbothered by the disappointments that have unfolded elsewhere along the highway she takes to work.\n\nInside the plant, enthusiasm for the union is undeniable, she says. \"They're like 'What's the next move? What's the next step?'\"\n\nWith the election at Mercedes nearing, Chandler's mind has already jumped ahead. She's been thinking about what it'll take to get a union contract.\n\n\"I know that we're going to have to strike, but I'm ready for it,\" she says.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news",

The accusation would be a violation of Germany's new law on global supply practices, if the German courts find the company guilty.\n\n\"Mercedes wants to tell you that a union is not the way to go, but guess what? Unions are the only reason that America has made it this far and they're going to be the only reason America makes it further than we ever have,\" Mercedes plant worker Austin Rose.\n\nEmployees at the Vance plant supporting the union said they want better pay and working conditions. The German auto company spent $1.9 billion of increased revenue on stock buybacks, according to UAW. Stock buybacks allow companies to create more value for shareholders.\n\nFormer U.S. Sen. Doug Jones, who represented Alabama from 2017 until 2020 when he was ousted by U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, said companies need to re-prioritize their checkbook.\n\n\"They need to be working with them, and promote them and build that economy because we've got so many people in this state who need that extra boost,\" Jones said.\n\nRose said Mercedes does offer promotions, but the people he has seen promoted are turning a blind eye to internal problems.\n\n\"I have watched people get walked out for bringing up topics that need to be brought up. And I have watched people get promoted for not bringing up anything and watching everyone get injured,\" Rose said.\n\nUnionization efforts at the Vance plant have been under way since 2023 alongside efforts at automaker plants around the South. Most recently, a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, voted to unionize in April.\n\nVoting at MBUSI begins Monday, May 13, and employees can cast their vote until May 17. Votes will be counted May 17. Some workers said they're confident this time the vote will have a different outcome.\n\n\"We know that we're going to get that yes vote, and we know we're going to win and Mercedes is going to learn real quick that we're a power to be reckoned with,\" David Johnson said.\n\nLast week, MBUSI announced Federico Kochlowski is taking over as president for Michael Goebel, who is being reassigned.\n\nIn a Mercedes-Benz U.S. International Facebook post regarding the decision, Federico Kochlowski said:\n\n\"Our Alabama Team Members have a reputation for doing things differently. As CEO, I look forward to embracing those differences and helping our Team Members continue to build the kind of company and culture they're proud to be a part of.\"", "source": {"uri": "wvua23.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WVUA23"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_U.S._International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz U.S. International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Labor Relations Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Jones_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Jones (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Tuberville", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Tuberville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.wvua23.com/content/uploads/archive_media/rayos-bdaaaed4408a24e899ed66086855e4cb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542752", "eventUri": "eng-9542752", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 2241, "textEnd": 2247}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 2289, "textEnd": 2295, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

However, as a share of the American workforce, union membership hit a new low. Today only one in 10 workers in America wear the union badge.\n\nBack in 1983, union membership was as high as 20.1 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Yet, every day we hear of some effort to unionize workers across a wide spectrum of companies and industries. Starbucks, CVS and Amazon come to mind. In 2023, the United Auto Workers occupied headlines for months as they negotiated new contracts with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis -- and won.\n\nIt turned out that these hard-fought labor agreements marked the biggest win for the auto unions in 40 years. This was followed by wins by UPS workers and Hollywood writers in their labor contracts. These victories on the labor front have inspired and galvanized efforts to organize across the nation. Even the live performers at Disneyland are organizing a vote to join the Actor's Equity Association.\n\nThe UAW, emboldened by their victories last year, has set its sights on the South where unions have been a non-starter historically. This region of the country has opposed unions from legal, business, political, and cultural standpoints. But that has not deterred the UAW.\n\nLast month the first crack in that southern wall of opposition appeared when Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga, Tenn. voted to become the only non-Detroit automotive assembly plant to be unionized. This was the third time since 2014 that unions fought for the right to organize at that plant.\n\nAlso in April, the UAW reached a deal with Daimler Truck In North Carolina that averted a strike and gave workers a 25 percent increase in wages over the next four years. The agreement also included profit sharing, automatic cost-of-living increases, and equalized pay among workers at all of Daimler's North Carolina factories. Next month, the Mercedes-Benz plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama will be voting to unionize as well.\n\nGovernors in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas are fighting back. They have been denouncing the UAW and its efforts. In most of these states \"right to work\" laws do make it more difficult for unions to collect dues, but not impossible.\n\nHowever, countering that pressure are the results of a Gallup Poll that indicates an overwhelming majority of Americans (seven out of 10) approve of labor unions. Another poll by the UAW last year indicated that 91 percent of Democrats, 69 percent of independents and 52 percent of Republicans supported unions and their goals. And well they should, given that a study by the Center for American Progress indicated that there is a large wealth gap between workers in unions and those non-union workers across all education levels.\n\nThey found union workers make 10-15 percent more than their non-organized brethren. The median wealth of those in unions was $338,482 compared to $199,948 for nonunion workers. However, many other benefits accrue to union workers over time. Job security, defined benefit retirement plans, better health care, and even higher homeownership rates.\n\nUnionized workers lacking a high school degree make more than three times the wealth of their nonunion peers. Those with some college education, like nurses or dental hygienists, earn 2.5 times more. Unionized teachers, college professors, journalists and government employees also do better than their nonunionized peers.\n\nWhile the overall number of union members is still tiny compared to the overall workforce, unions do tend to have an outsized influence on the fortunes of the workforce. Their battle for better pay and benefits has had a trickle-down effect. Their gains have been known to impact and influence the economic well-being of most U.S. workers over time.\n\nSome point out that the unions' success of late may have more to do with the tightness of the labor market than the prowess of unions. Companies, worried about attrition, may be more willing to negotiate rather than suffer employee departures or suffer strikes. Whatever the case, I will always be on the side of the worker and as such applaud the recent trend and hope it continues.", "source": {"uri": "berkshireeagle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Voting begins on whether workers will be represented by the United Auto Worker (UAW) on May 13 through 17 and results will be announced May 17 by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). UAW has been on a roll. Southern worker oppression, tough and unapologetic, seems crumbling. A rather festive weekend of worker support events attracted community supporters in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa.\n\nThe United Auto Workers has filed a complaint with the NLRB of illegal company captive employee meetings and firing of workers who are advocating for unionization. Spokesman for Mercedes denies those allegations. This union battle follows a massive win of workers at the Tennessee Volkswagen plant, another German auto giant in which workers chose the United Auto Workers by a landslide. In Alabama, the main issue is pay and use of \"temp workers.\" A company spokesperson would not comment on pay structure.\n\nUnionizing workers catch more hell in the South with elected leaders promising industrialists to provide docile workers in anti-union environments, nearly free land and no or low property taxes, and companies sometime keep state withholding taxes.\n\nBut feeling the power grip over workers slipping Governor Kay Ivey spoke in the media to company officials: \"you need to fix this\" referring to the system of threats and intimidation unique in the South. Alabama is a right to work state. That means every attempt of workers to organize is met with crushing company and government opposition. Employers can use the capital punishment for workers -- firing -- with no recourse. Workplaces that have unions provide a level of protection against unreasonable employer actions complained of at Mercedes Benz. Conversations with workers and community leaders show excitement and anticipation.\n\nSeveral Democratic Party leaders came to support workers in weekend events in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa. The festive events with barbeque, music, and gelato in toasty heat. Former U.S. Senator Doug Jones, Alabama Democratic Party assistant chairperson Tabitha Isner, Birmingham's Joshua Raby, the party Disability Chair were among many others that mixed with community leaders supporting workers.\n\nSenator Jones said he was expecting as big a landslide in Alabama as at the Volkswagen vote in Tennessee.\n\nAustin Brooks, an employee who has been at the plant two years was excited. But Brooks says workers are frightened to the extent that many will not take a union flyer. Austin says employees are temps for a year, and if they don't rub anybody the wrong may become permanent.\n\n10-year employee Jacob Rines, was a temp worker at Mercedes for 5 years 2 months and 19 days before he was hired full-time. The six-foot six husky guy may have rubbed someone the wrong way. This present campaign is his second time supporting unions at the factory. The rapid pace that workers have signed cards to unionize, he says, is amazing. He contributes worker excitement to the Big Three Automakers, GM, Ford, and Chrysler, contracting last year with United Auto Workers in a big 25 percent and higher pay raise. \"It is proving that with a union we can win and get our fair share of representation,\" Rine said.\n\nDr. Pam Foster, a medical doctor and medical school professor, said she is excited about the \"possibilities of a union victory in Alabama.\" She is an Alabama leader in the Poor People's Campaign that will bring its leader the Rev. Dr. William Barber to Mercedes' Vance factory on May 13, the day voting begins. Barber's presence will certainly boost a vote for unionization.\n\nThe South's continued history of slavery, division and oppression of workers, is on the line. Tennessee, Alabama, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, and Mississippi governors released a joint letter recently urging their followers to hold the line and not allow United Auto Workers to win at Volkswagen, Mercedes and other southern plants. That did not work in Tennessee.\n\nNow local chambers of commerce, some elected and appointed officials are busy trying to hold the line, reportedly through fear and intimidation tactics. There are anit-worker videos and ads on television outlets, radio stations, Facebook, Instagram and newspapers. State and company pressure for a no vote is on.\n\nFormer crimson tide and NFL cornerback Antonio Langham was at a rally held at Tuscaloosa's Christian Community Church and encouraged workers. Langham said NFL players got better health care because of the NFL Players Association fighting for workers against team owners. With the UAW, workers can do the same, he said.\n\nNo one that this writer met in a two-day swing through Alabama seemed to know much about Mercedes Benz history. The company has unions in its German factories. Its existence in Alabama seems contingent on keeping an anti-union environment.\n\nThe company seems to have decided to go along with the South's program. Fear in the workplace is an example. The company has a history of going along with the program.\n\nWhen Hitler rose to power in 1932 Mercedes factories had 6,000 plus employees. As Hitler made war in Europe Germany's troops captured hundreds of thousands of Jews and others. 60,000 became slaves in Mercedes factories. The auto giant had 68,000 plus workers by the end of WWII. The company apologized in the 1980's and paid a small $12 million reparations to its victims.\n\nThe company did not respond to questions about its WWII history.", "source": {"uri":

The union said 3,097 workers voted in favor and 683 were against the contract.\n\nProduction workers voted 81% to ratify the deal, while skilled trades workers voted 90% in favor. Voting by Ford's 57,000 union members will continue through Nov. 17.\n\nWorkers went on strike at the assembly plant Sept. 15 after the union's contract with Ford expired. They remained on the picket lines until Oct. 25, when the union announced the tentative deal with Ford.\n\nLocal union leaders from across the country at Jeep maker Stellantis voted unanimously on Thursday to send the contract to members for a vote. General Motors local leaders will meet on Friday. Dates for member voting at GM or Stellantis were not yet clear.\n\nMarick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who follows labor issues, said the vote at the Ford factory is a positive sign for the union.\n\n\"These workers are deeply in the know about the overall situation,\" he said. \"I think that they responded to it with such high levels of approval it is perhaps reflective of how the broader workforce represented by the UAW feels about this contract.\"\n\nMasters says union officials still have to make their cases to the membership, but \"certainly this would appear to be a harbinger of good news.\"\n\nThe deals with all three companies are generally the same, although there are some differences. All give workers 25% general pay raises with 11% upon ratification. With cost of living pay, the raises will exceed 30% by the time the contracts end on April 30, 2028. Workers hired after 2009 without defined benefit pensions will get 10% annual company contributions to 401(k) plans, and they'll get $5,000 ratification bonuses.\n\nOn Thursday night, Fain and Vice President Rich Boyer told workers in an online presentation that the union's strikes got every last dime possible out of Stellantis.\n\nThe top assembly plant wage at the company will go from $31.77 per hour to $42.24 by the end of the contract, Boyer said.\n\nThe union said it saved jobs at a plant in Belvidere, Illinois, that Stellantis wanted to close. Plus, workers at a new joint-venture electric vehicle battery factory planned for Belvidere will be Stellantis employees and leased to the joint venture, Fain said.\n\nWorkers at the plant will be under the UAW national contract and will make over $30 per hour by the end of the contract, with the chance to bargain for more later, Fain said.\n\nFain said terrified auto executives at nonunion plants are raising wages, citing an increase this week at Toyota factories in an effort to keep the UAW from organizing their plants.\n\n\"Even though you're not yet members of our union,\" Fain said to Toyota workers, \"that pay raise Toyota is giving you is the UAW bump. UAW, that stands for 'You Are Welcome.'\"\n\nUAW workers began their strikes with targeted walkouts at all three automakers that escalated during a six-week period in an effort to pressure the companies into a deal. GM was the last company to settle early Sunday morning.\n\nAt its peak 46,000 union members had gone on strike at eight assembly plants and 38 parts warehouses across the nation. The union has about 146,000 members at all three of the Detroit auto companies.\n\n-- -- --\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that 82% of workers at Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant voted in favor of the tentative contract agreement, not 81%.", "source": {"uri": "thegardenisland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Garden Island"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@thegardenisland.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellantis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stellantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Picketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Assembly_Plant", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Assembly Plant"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeep"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wayne, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wayne, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wayne State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401(k)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "401(k)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belvidere,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belvidere, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belvidere, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Floral", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Floral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.thegardenisland.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/web1_14368092-6a3e77b9058b41759dda6afa13576334.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542752", "eventUri": "eng-9542752", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-17", "textStart": 605, "textEnd": 612}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-15", "textStart": 660, "textEnd": 668}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-25", "textStart": 755, "textEnd": 762}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Enter your email to subscribe.\n\nThe United Auto Workers recently scored the largest union victory in decades in the South. Their success at a Tennessee Volkswagen plant could be a turning point for labor in a region long known for governmental hostility to unions.\n\nThe next test will be a UAW election scheduled for the week of May 13 at a Mercedes-Benz factory in Alabama, a state that has attracted so much auto investment it has earned the nickname \"the Detroit of the South.\"\n\nIf the roughly 5,000 Mercedes workers vote to unionize, the ripple effects could empower workers nationwide.\n\nFor decades, Southern states have pursued \"low-road\" development strategies, luring investors with massive public subsidies and repressive labor policies. This has pitted workers across the country against each other, undercutting everyone's ability to secure fair compensation.\n\nAlabama has spent $1.6 billion to woo Mercedes, along with Toyota, Hyundai, and Honda. All these foreign companies' operations in the South are non-union, in contrast to the unionized Big Three of Ford, GM, and Stellantis.\n\nThis foreign investment has created thousands of Alabama jobs -- but with weak worker protections, the state remains one of the nation's poorest. And while these companies have enjoyed rising corporate profits, they have left workers behind.\n\nAn in-depth report by the nonprofit group Alabama Arise found that inflation-adjusted average pay for the state's autoworkers has dropped by 11 percent over the past 20 years to $64,682. Meanwhile, CEO pay stands at $13.9 million at Mercedes and $6.9 million at Toyota.\n\nThe foreign-owned firms' payrolls also reflect Alabama's long history of racial discrimination, with Black and Latino workers earning substantially less than their white counterparts. By contrast, the Economic Policy Institute has found that union workers make 10.1 percent more on average than non-union workers.\n\nThe benefits are even greater for workers of color. Unionized Black workers make 13.1 percent more than non-union Black workers in comparable jobs -- and Latino union members make 18.8 percent more than non-union Latino workers.\n\nEquitable pay practices boost local economies by putting more money in workers' pockets for groceries, housing, and other goods and services from local businesses. And that's good for families of every color.\n\nBut Alabama Governor Kay Ivey doesn't see things that way. Before the UAW vote in Tennessee, she joined GOP governors from Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas to discourage VW workers from voting yes with unfounded threats of mass layoffs.\n\nWhen 73 percent of those autoworkers voted for the UAW, it was a strong rebuke of the region's low-road, anti-worker model. So corporate lobbyists in the region have enlisted state legislators and cabinet officials in a sustained campaign to blunt organizing momentum.\n\nA new poll indicates that 52 percent of residents in this deep-red state support the autoworkers' union drive, while just 21 percent are opposed. This echoes a 2022 poll commissioned by the Institute for Policy Studies in Jefferson County, Alabama, where workers were attempting to unionize an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer. That survey showed nearly two-thirds support.\n\nWhile the Alabama Amazon campaign fell short in the face of aggressive anti-union tactics, increased public approval of unions is a testament to many years of community and labor organizing.\n\nThe fact that a large majority of workers at the Mercedes-Benz plant signed petitions earlier this year in support of the election is encouraging. We need a New South economic structure based on fairness and equity. Organized labor is an essential partner in that mission.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Next up, workers at a Mercedes-Benz facility in Vance, Alabama will vote on whether to join the UAW starting May 13, and the outcome could help determine whether the union's success in Tennessee will have a domino effect on other workplaces in the region.\n\nUnion density in Tennessee hovers around 6% and other states have even lower union density: Virginia's is slightly over 4%, North Carolina's is under 3% and South Carolina has the lowest union density in the country, counting just over 2% of workers. All of these states are \"right-to-work,\" which union members and organizers say is a misnomer. In reality, right-to-work laws\u2009 -- \u2009which ban union security agreements (meaning that unionized workplaces are prohibited from requiring all workers to pay union dues)\u2009 -- \u2009make unions weaker and smaller.\n\nThis new wave of organizing won't be the first time unions have seriously attempted to organize workers in states unfriendly to labor. In the mid-1940s, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) launched \"Operation Dixie\" in hopes of unionizing Southern workers, particularly those in the textile industry. Their goal was not just to improve Southern workers' lives or grow their ranks, but also to maintain union strength in the North, as industries began relocating to the South due to lack of union density. But Operation Dixie failed in large part due to racist Jim Crow laws and other racial conflicts in the region, the legacies of which workers still deal with today.\n\nLeonard Riley, a 48-year member of International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) Local 1422 in Charleston, South Carolina, tells In These Times, \"our governor Henry McMaster says, 'come to South Carolina, we work for less.' That's how you market your state?\" Riley is referring in part to a joint statement released by the governors of Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, Mississippi, and South Carolina prior to the union election at the Volkswagen plant, which said that \"Unionization would certainly put our states' jobs in jeopardy.\"\n\nThe lack of union density has created a feedback loop: working people may not know what unions are or may not know any union members, and lack experience with what union organizers call \"the union difference,\" i.e. the ways unions materially improve people's lives. (On average, union members make 14% more than nonunion workers. They're also more likely to have benefits like employer-provided healthcare and a pension.) Riley says, \"when you live a certain way for all of your life, you become accustomed to not having things you should have. When you get a victory like the UAW's in Chattanooga, a win that survived intimidation by the bosses and public pressure, it allows all laboring people to see what they deserve.\"\n\nThis is not the first time the UAW has tried to organize at Volkswagen. The union ran campaigns in 2014 and 2019, and fell short both times, although both previous elections were close -- in 2014, the vote count was 712-626, and in 2019, it was 833-776. But the political terrain has shifted significantly over the last decade, with workers taking action against powerful employers like Starbucks and Amazon; participating in high-profile strikes, like the 75,000 employees at Kaiser Permanente last year; and the fact that unions have their highest approval rating since 1965.", "source": {"uri": "inthesetimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "In

A change in leadership at VW's joint works council in Germany, which represents workers and has four seats on Volkswagen's supervisory board.\n\nIn 2021, Daniela Cavallo, the daughter of an Italian guest worker and an advocate for parental leave, was named chairperson of the VW works council, replacing Bernd Osterloh, who had publicly said he would not support the UAW's efforts to organize in Chattanooga. Cavallo \"was much more responsive to the UAW when they spoke to her,\" says Silvia. \"And that resulted in a toning down in Volkswagen's approach to the whole thing.\"\n\nCase in point: In 2019, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee spoke against the union at a mandatory meeting for each shift in the Chattanooga plant, at the plant. This time around, the governor gave a single \"Vote no\" speech that was not mandatory, and not within the plant. Silvia speculated that the VW worker's council might have pushed for the muted response.\n\nA day before the union election, however, Lee joined other southern governors in signing a letter saying a \"yes\" vote compromised jobs and Southern \"values.\"\n\nThe second factor that helped VW unionize \"is something that often results in unionization: the way they dealt with paid time off,\" says Silvia.\n\nIn 2018, Volkswagen Chattanooga implemented a vacation policy that forced workers to take their vacation days during the plant's annual shutdown, rather than allow them to go with no pay for all or part of the shutdown, and then take vacation days when they wanted.\n\n\"That's what triggered the organizing drives at Volkswagen that happened in 2019,\" says Silvia. \"And they hadn't changed that policy.\"\n\n\"Paid time off was the one that ticked people off the most,\" Silvia reiterates. \"Back in 2018, when they made the change, 40 people went off the floor in a group and complained. They went up to the personnel manager's office and said, \"Change this policy.\"\n\n\"The fact that they didn't fix this, between 2019 and now led people to think, 'Well, we gave them a chance. They're not going to change things on their own, so we'll bring in the UAW.\"\n\nBrian Shepherd, the UAW's new director of organizing, came from the Service Employees International Union. \"His experience was organizing in Nevada and in Texas,\" says Silvia. \"So he's worked in the South and in the Southwest, and he really has taken a different approach toward organizing than the UAW had previously.\"\n\nShepherd's approach has been to decentralize the UAW's organizing power. In the past, says Silvia, \"the UAW was pretty top down, and the way they did their organizing drives -- they had a model that they stuck to pretty closely. He's been much more able and willing to go with local people who are the more activists in each place, going with their ideas when they say, 'We think this would work, or we don't think this thing that you usually do would work here.' He's been pretty flexible around that,\" adding that while Shepherd's plan was in motion at VW, \"that's really paid off the most at the Mercedes plant.\"\n\n\"[The strike] showed to workers that the UAW can deliver,\" says Silvia. \"Before that, when you looked at the UAW, the UAW reps would say our contract is better than what you're getting paid.\"\n\nThe old UAW had been focused on giving concessions and settling for lower wage increases in exchange for employment security. New leadership under Fain was different. \"In this contract, they could say, we showed that we can get you significantly more than your company is offering you. We did this with the Big Three; we can do this for you. I think that made a huge difference.\"\n\nAfter the Big 3 contracts were set, \"the UAW started getting all of these hits of people signing authorization cards, from old organizing drives,\" says Silvia. \"They had never taken the website down, and all of a sudden they're getting all these hits from, you know, [Toyota workers in] Georgetown, Kentucky, different places, obviously Mercedes. When they saw that, it was clear that the thinking was, 'We've got a moment here, we've got a momentum, so we should act while we have momentum.'\"", "source": {"uri": "industryweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndustryWeek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_putre@industryweek.com", "name": "Laura Putre", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Works council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniela_Cavallo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniela Cavallo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Lee_(Tennessee_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Lee (Tennessee politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_time_off", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paid time off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisory_board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supervisory board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Employees_International_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Service Employees International Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgetown, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgetown, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://img.industryweek.com/files/base/ebm/industryweek/image/2024/05/663ad5e806bb2350069dba8a-mercedes_best_banner_credit_uaw_cropped.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542752", "eventUri": "eng-9542752", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Does it matter for workers?", "body": "Unions are said to be having a moment. The story goes something like this: Helped by a presidential administration that touts itself as the \"most pro-union in history,\" labor unions -- after decades of decline -- are winning big victories against anti-union corporations and extracting impressive concessions for their workers. But is it all true?\n\nThere has certainly been a lot of union activity. Last year we witnessed a significant increase in strikes and threats of strikes. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the country lost 16.6 million labor days to work stoppages last year. You have to go all the way back to 2000 to find this level of union disturbance.\n\nIn addition, the United Auto Workers reached an agreement with Ford that included wage hikes of 25%. Similar agreements with Stellantis and General Motors followed. Other unions won contract gains at large employers such as UPS and Hollywood TV and film studios. Then there was the much-celebrated UAW victory in a representation election at Volkswagen in Tennessee and progress made at some Starbucks stores.\n\nAll the same, talk of a union renaissance might be much ado about nothing. Union membership as a share of wage and salary workers has declined steadily from 28.3% in 1967 to an all-time low of 10% in 2023. Although the absolute number of union workers has recently risen, it hasn't kept up with the growth of the total number of American workers.\n\nNational Review's Dominic Pino has been following unions comprehensively. He never forgets to report both their wins and their losses. For instance, workers at a unionized Nissan facility in Somerset, New Jersey, are in the process of decertifying from the UAW. The same happened at various non-Starbucks coffee shops.\n\nThese events are in line with the overall trend for UAW, Pino notes, as \"membership declined last year to 370,000. It was nearly 400,000 in 2020, and it peaked at 1.5 million in 1970.\" To be fair to the labor movement, part of this decline could be because UAW bosses have been pretty corrupt. For instance, National Review reported that \"in December 2020, the UAW reached a settlement with the Department of Justice after a yearslong fraud and corruption investigation. More than a dozen top union officials, including two former presidents, were convicted of crimes for embezzlement of workers' dues.\"\n\nIt could also be that unions aren't so much about fighting for the cause of blue-collar workers as they used to be. Indeed, 49% of union members worked for the government in 2023. Thirty-three percent of public-sector employees are in unions, as opposed to just 6% of the private sector. In the case of UAW, about 100,000 members work in higher education, including graduate student workers statistically likely to go on to non-blue-collar jobs. I believe public-sector unions shouldn't exist. Taxpayers -- the ones paying the bills when government unions successfully negotiate pay and benefits hikes -- are not adequately represented at the negotiation table. In fact, with their political donations, public-sector unions help decide who sits on the other end of that negotiating table.\n\nBy contrast, private unions have every right to exist, but this doesn't mean they're a good thing on net for workers. A September 2023 National Bureau of Economic Research paper looked at what a unionized workforce does to incentives and investment. While unionized plants pay higher wages and benefits than do nonunionized ones, they also \"experience higher rates of closure, reduced investment, and slower employment growth.\" In other words, your unionized job might pay more, as long as it doesn't go away -- and good luck finding another like it. The result holds also for partially unionized plants.\n\nIntroducing more competition to the private-sector union business model could help. For that, my colleague Liya Palagashvili suggests ending the exclusive-representation clause that \"provides government-granted monopoly status to a union supported by 51 percent of an employer's workers, giving it the sole authority to negotiate. This means that if some workers want a different union -- for example a newer one that might raise the bar in terms of what it can offer -- they are out of luck.\" Today, these workers aren't allowed to engage in any negotiations with their employers, and they still have to pay the original union's fees.\n\nThe bottom line is that unions aren't really going through a renaissance. All things considered, their failure is most workers' gain.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They screened out hires who might be sympathetic to unions and divided the workforce by using temp agencies to fill a significant share of positions.

The story goes something like this: Helped by a presidential administration that touts itself as the \"most pro-union in history,\" labor unions -- after decades of decline -- are winning big victories against anti-union corporations and extracting impressive concessions for their workers. But is it all true?\n\nThere has certainly been a lot of union activity. Last year we witnessed a significant increase in strikes and threats of strikes. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the country lost 16.6 million labor days to work stoppages last year. You have to go all the way back to 2000 to find this level of union disturbance.\n\nIn addition, the United Auto Workers (UAW) reached an agreement with Ford that included wage hikes of 25 percent. Similar agreements with Stellantis and General Motors followed. Other unions won contract gains at large employers such as UPS and Hollywood TV and film studios. Then there was the much celebrated UAW victory in a representation election at Volkswagen in Tennessee and progress made at some Starbucks stores.\n\nAll the same, talk of a union renaissance might be much ado about nothing. Union membership as a share of wage and salary workers has declined steadily from 28.3 percent in 1967 to an all-time low of 10 percent in 2023. Although the absolute number of union workers has recently risen, it hasn't kept up with the growth of the total number of American workers.\n\nNational Review's Dominic Pino has been following unions comprehensively. He never forgets to report both their wins and their losses. For instance, workers at a unionized Nissan facility in Somerset, New Jersey, are in the process of decertifying from the UAW. The same happened at various non-Starbucks coffee shops.\n\nThese events are in line with the overall trend for UAW, Pino notes, as \"membership declined last year to 370,000. It was nearly 400,000 in 2020, and it peaked at 1.5 million in 1970.\" To be fair to the labor movement, part of this decline could be because UAW bosses have been pretty corrupt. For instance, National Review reported that \"in December 2020, the UAW reached a settlement with the Department of Justice after a yearslong fraud and corruption investigation. More than a dozen top union officials, including two former presidents, were convicted of crimes for embezzlement of workers' dues.\"\n\nIt could also be that unions aren't so much about fighting for the cause of blue collar workers as they used to be. Indeed, 49 percent of union members worked for the government in 2023. Thirty-three percent of public sector employees are in unions, as opposed to just 6 percent of the private sector. In the case of UAW, about 100,000 members work in higher education, including graduate student workers statistically likely to go on to non-blue collar jobs.\n\nI believe public sector unions shouldn't exist. Taxpayers -- the ones paying the bills when government unions successfully negotiate pay and benefits hikes -- are not adequately represented at the negotiation table. In fact, with their political donations, public sector unions help decide who sits on the other end of that negotiating table.\n\nBy contrast, private unions have every right to exist, but this doesn't mean they're a good thing on net for workers. A September 2023 National Bureau of Economic Research paper looked at what a unionized workforce does to incentives and investment. While unionized plants pay higher wages and benefits than do nonunionized ones, they also \"experience higher rates of closure, reduced investment, and slower employment growth.\" In other words, your unionized job might pay more, as long as it doesn't go away -- and good luck finding another like it. The result holds also for partially unionized plants.\n\nIntroducing more competition to the private sector union business model could help. For that, my colleague Liya Palagashvili suggests ending the exclusive-representation clause that \"provides government-granted monopoly status to a union supported by 51 percent of an employer's workers, giving it the sole authority to negotiate. This means that if some workers want a different union -- for example a newer one that might raise the bar in terms of what it can offer -- they are out of luck.\" Today, these workers aren't allowed to engage in any negotiations with their employers, and they still have to pay the original union's fees.\n\nThe bottom line is that unions aren't really going through a renaissance. All things considered, their failure is most workers' gain.", "source": {"uri": "reason.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reason"}, "authors": [{"uri": "veronique_de_rugy@reason.com", "name":

Support our cause, or you will not get our endorsement.\"\n\nAt this week's conference, support for Biden among union members has varied from enthusiastic to uncertainty about whether to even vote come Election Day.\n\nCaroline Loveless, a Waterloo, Iowa, resident and retired UAW member, said she would enthusiastically vote for Biden, recalling his appearance on a picket line during last fall's strike. She said his appearance should remind union members that Biden is on their side.\n\n\"I hope they don't get amnesia,\" Loveless said, \"come Election Day.\"\n\nWilliam Louis of Groton, Connecticut, another member, said that while he is \"fed up with politicians\" he will reluctantly vote for Biden, though he said the president had not fully earned members' vote given the current state of the economy.\n\nLouis said Biden would get his vote because Trump, the likely Republican nominee, \"was a terrible president.\"\n\nLeo Carrillo, a member from Kansas City, said Biden's appearance on the picket line showed that \"he was there for us,\" and helped him to decide to vote for Biden in November.\n\n\"For me it meant a lot\" that a sitting president would show that level of solidarity to autoworkers, Carrillo said. \"But there's more work to be done,\" he said, pointing to the PRO Act -- proposed legislation that would make it easier to unionize on a federal level. The legislation advanced to the U.S. Senate but does not have enough support to survive in case of a filibuster.\n\nBiden could run into dissent, however, over his support for Israel in its war on Hamas in Gaza. Some younger members of the union were less enthusiastic about the president for that reason.\n\nJohannah King-Slutzky, a Columbia University graduate student and member of the student workers union within the UAW, was one of several attendees who chanted \"ceasefire now\" during Fain's afternoon speech Monday. The union called for a ceasefire in Gaza in December.\n\n\"Right now he's done nothing to earn my vote,\" King-Slutzky said, because \"he has not acted with urgency to stop the genocide in Gaza.\"\n\nThe union has a lengthy process to determine its endorsements that involves the rank-and-file, but it's unclear how far along that is.\n\nFain, the first UAW president directly elected by members, took office after a huge bribery and embezzlement scandal that ended with two union presidents serving prison time. So he's making sure to follow union procedures on the endorsement and show that members made the decision, even though there's no way the UAW would back Trump, said Brian Rothenberg, a former union spokesman.\n\nThe UAW, with roughly 380,000 members, is normally one of the last unions to endorse presidential candidates, Rothenberg said. For example, the union didn't endorse Biden in 2020 until April 21.\n\nIn a November interview with The Associated Press, Fain made clear that he personally supports Biden, as he railed against Trump.\n\nFain pointed to Biden's trip to the GM parts warehouse, which is believed to be the first time a sitting president appeared with union picketers.\n\nAbout that same time, Trump held a rally at a nonunion auto parts maker near Detroit, which Fain said was odd. Biden's administration also supported the union's bid to persuade Stellantis to reopen a shuttered plant in Belvidere, Illinois, and joined Fain in the city 70 miles (113 kilometers) northwest of Chicago to celebrate its reopening, Fain said.\n\nTrump, Fain said, didn't come to Detroit when the UAW was on strike while he was president in 2019, and he talked about moving auto jobs to southern states where pay is lower.\n\n\"Actions speak louder than words,\" Fain said. \"But this process belongs to the membership, and we'll make those decisions when it's time.\"\n\nArt Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University, said he would be surprised to see the union endorse Biden at this point in the campaign. The UAW, he said, would hold more leverage over legislation and other items if it waits until closer to the election to announce who it's backing.\n\n\"There's no big hurry in terms of the UAW and their timeframe,\" he said.\n\nRothenberg said a union endorsement is important because polling shows many UAW members are often undecided in the spring before a presidential election.\n\nInternal UAW polling typically shows that in the spring and early summer, 30% of members support the GOP, 30% support Democrats and the remaining 40% swing between parties, he said. By Election Day, members and UAW retirees usually vote 60% Democratic, said Rothenberg, now a public relations consultant in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nThe endorsement also could sway nonunion blue-collar white males, who have been voting more for Republicans than in the past, Rothenberg said.", "source": {"uri": "thegardenisland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Garden Island"}, "authors":

The union's leader is all in for campus lawbreaking and he's denouncing Israel for its war against Hamas.\n\n\"UAW President Shawn Fain chose to dive into the debate over anti-Israel campus protests this week and how police should respond. Writing on X (formerly Twitter), he said his union opposes 'the mass arrest or intimidation of those exercising their right to protest, strike, or speak out against injustice.' That would be a fine statement in a vacuum. In the context of the protests, it's a defense of mass trespassing and harassment of Jewish students at Columbia, UCLA and elsewhere.\"\n\nWhat we are seeing here is another betrayal of mainstream Americans by the left. I would be willing to bet my house that Mr. Fain is out of sync with a majority of his members. As the WSJ put it:\n\n\"Those views may come as a surprise to Volkswagen workers in Tennessee, who chose to unionize last month, or Mercedes workers in Alabama, who will decide whether to join the UAW by May 17. The union is eager to organize workers at fast-growing southern plants, and it's promising higher wages. But its pitch is conspicuously light on solidarity with Hamas and Ivy League delinquents, though worker dues will support Mr. Fain's ideological causes.\"\n\n\"Late night host Bill Maher slammed the student loan forgiveness scheme as guests agreed the political ploy hasn't turned around his struggling poll numbers.\n\n\"The comedian, 68, said the forgiveness plans are particularly offensive to him amid rampant anti-Israel protests occupying college campuses across the nation, as he sees them as 'supporting Jew hating.'\n\n\"'So, colleges constantly raise tuition, then the kids take out more loans, then the government comes by and pays those loans,' he said.\n\n\"'So, my tax dollars are supporting this Jew hating? I don't think so.'\"\n\nSo what gives? Why is Mr. Fain, in a manner typical of the left these days, going against the wishes of his own working-class members?\n\nAccording to the WSJ, it's those so-called \"elites\" again.\n\n\"Mr. Fain's anti-Israel policy may be aimed at appeasing a separate, growing constituency within the UAW: graduate students. By last year more than a quarter of the union's 400,000 members were university employees, mostly assistants and adjuncts. Columbia's chapter demanded that the university divest from Israel, and its members showed up to the protest. UAW members were among those arrested when police swept campuses Tuesday night.\"\n\nAnother way to term these \"elite\" graduate students is \"conformists\" because that is indeed what they are. Despite or because of their educations, they think alike like automatons.\n\nMr. Fain might consider joining them. The labor movement used to be predominantly anti-communist (i.e., the AFL-CIO's George Meany). These days, something else is at work. Perhaps, in the case of UAW leadership, a form of globalism, since the mandated electric car has led to nothing but a financial disaster for American auto companies and, therefore, a dismal future for their workers.\n\nI have been a union official myself -- a member of the Writers Guild of America West board of directors in the 1990s -- and have seen this weird dichotomy firsthand. When unions strive for better pay and fringes (health, pension, and so forth) for their members, they are doing something positive. When they take political positions extrinsic to their mission -- as the Writers Guild does repeatedly now, alas -- they are betraying those members who do not approve of those positions by what is in essence taxing them, through dues, for what they don't want.\n\nNeedless to say, it's not just union members who have to deal with unfair taxation or dues. It's all of us and is as old as the Boston Tea Party or older. By now, most of us are onto this, as indicated by Mr. Maher's panel.\n\nTime much better spent, for those who haven't seen it and even for those of us who have, would be viewing the aforementioned \"On the Waterfront.\" Younger people especially may not know it. Indeed, they may not know that Hollywood once made movies with real power, that were patriotic in the deepest sense, a few anyway.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A fair shot and a fair wage.\"\n\nHe praised the union members as \"as tough, tough, tough as they come.\" Someone in the audience shouted to the president, \"That shirt looks good on you.\"\n\n\"I've worn this shirt a lot, man,\" Biden responded. \"You have no idea. I've been involved with the UAW longer than you've been alive.\" The crowd roared with laughter.\n\nBiden visited a UAW picket line in Michigan in September to support the union during its targeted strikes against Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Dodge and Ram vehicles. The strikes have ended and contracts are still being finalized.\n\n\"He came out and stood with the picketers,\" said Matt Franzen, the local UAW president who introduced Biden. \"He's always been for us, with us. He proved that.\"\n\nBiden reminded the audience that Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, visited a nonunion facility on his own trip to Michigan.\n\n\"I hope you guys have a memory,\" Biden said. \"Where I come from, it matters.\"\n\nBiden's reelection campaign on Thursday released a video that criticizes Trump's record on autoworkers and manufacturing while showing the former president playing golf. Another clip shows Biden speaking through a bullhorn at the UAW picket line. \"Joe Biden doesn't just talk, he delivers,\" the narrator says.\n\nBiden learned that the Stellantis factory could close during a trip to Chicago on June 28, when he spoke about the economy.\n\nThe prospect became an immediate priority for Biden. He ordered up an economic analysis and spoke to company officials about the plant, according to White House officials. The Democratic president wanted to show that his policies could deliver for workers, rather than repeat the decades of factory closures that had gutted parts of the Midwest and fed into a deep political divide.\n\nThe reopening \"goes to the heart of who he is, the heart of his vision for the country and how he's led,\" said Jen O'Malley Dillon, White House deputy chief of staff.\n\nStellantis agreed to hire back 1,200 employees to build pickup trucks and to add 1,300 more workers for a battery factory.\n\nThe resolution of the strike was an early victory for what Biden says is a worker-centered economy. But the success of the factory and of the tentative contract with workers will ultimately hinge on the ability of automakers to keep generating profits as they shift toward electric vehicles in a competitive market.\n\nMany voters still feel dour about the overall economy, and there is an open question as to whether the UAW contract and signs of wages outpacing inflation can change their views. In polls, U.S. adults have consistently given Biden low marks on the economy after a burst of inflation as the pandemic began to recede.\n\nO'Malley Dillon said the UAW contracts and the auto plant reopening reflect a larger focus on workers by the president. Unionized nurses, truck drivers and others also negotiated to receive pay raises by pushing their employers to recognize the value of their work. On Wednesday, Hollywood actors joined script writers by achieving a tentative contract agreement after a prolonged strike. It reflects a broader trend over the past year that was made possible in part by a strong job market as the unemployment rate is at a healthy 3.9%.\n\nLabor unions tend to be reliable supporters of Democrats. But by speaking at factories and union halls, Biden is also trying to reach disaffected blue-collar voters who found a voice in Trump.\n\nBiden argues that innovations within the auto sector such as EVs should not lead to layoffs and factory closures.\n\nTrump has said that the rise of EVs backed by the Biden administration will cause factory job losses. He has suggested that the work will migrate to China and that the United States should stick with gasoline-powered vehicles, even though the emissions worsen climate change.\n\nBiden has a slightly better record on auto industry jobs than Trump. During Trump's presidency, the number of manufacturing jobs in the sector peaked at a little more than 1 million in early 2019 and then began to decline, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There are nearly 1.1 million auto manufacturing jobs under Biden.\n\nThe EV shift does carry a risk for automakers. Sales have started to slow amid concerns about recharging and the expensive price of the vehicles, despite tax incentives designed to improve affordability.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden met with UAW President Shawn Fain and Gov. J.B. Pritzker, D-Ill. The president also headlined a fundraiser for his reelection campaign later Thursday.\n\nDuring the nearly 45-day strike that hit the automakers, the White House chose to talk to all parties while letting the UAW execute its strategy of targeted work stoppages. Biden took the step of joining workers on the picket line, a presidential first.\n\nIn calls that White House officials had with Stellantis, the company was never pressured to open the Belvidere factory, but Biden raised the matter. His choice to sympathize with workers as the strike escalated carried some political risk as high interest rates on auto loans and inflation coming out of the pandemic have become points of criticism by Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe contracts, if approved by 146,000 union members in the coming weeks, would dramatically raise pay for autoworkers. They would get pay increases and cost-of-living adjustments that would translate into a 33% wage gain. Top assembly plant workers would earn roughly $42 per hour.", "source": {"uri": "thegardenisland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Garden Island"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@thegardenisland.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellantis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stellantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Picketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belvidere,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belvidere, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belvidere, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dodge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Living wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeep"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Deputy_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Deputy Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

In his video, he uses phrases from the Bible to tie his faith to the union fight.\n\nFaiz Shakir, founder and director of More Perfect Union Solidarity, had an interesting challenge in creating the 30-second spots: how to distill down complicated questions of labor history, wages, benefits, and workers' rights into bite-sized bits that will play in red state, right-to-work Alabama.\n\nHe said the group used polling and cultural commonalities, such as faith and football, to bridge the ideological gap. It was also necessary to have individual pro-union workers tell their stories.\n\n\"The gateways in are a little different, all based off the assumption that once we start talking about the basic reasons for a union, i.e., better wages, better retirement, better health care, better working conditions, that they're going to speak to you,\" he said. \"Understanding that the politics is going to be across the board, it's going to be different, it's going to be varied. Giving people a way to access this is everything.\"\n\nThe group is also hosting a \"Party for the Working Class\" Saturday at Brock's Gap Brewing Co. in Hoover at 4 p.m. The event will feature free Saw's BBQ, live music, kids' activities, and Mother's Day flowers for the first 150 people.

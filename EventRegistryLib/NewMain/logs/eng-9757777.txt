AP\n\nThe Canada women's football team assistant coach and a team analyst have been booted out of the Paris Olympics 2024 on Wednesday after a spying scandal broke out. Canada's head coach Bev Priestman has also removed herself from the Group A opening match against New Zealand on Thursday. The New Zealand women's team claimed that their training session on Monday was disrupted by a drone flown by a staff member of Canada.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) said on Wednesday it had taken action to remove two members of staff from their Olympic squad, who were gold medallists at the Tokyo Games, while Priestman would not take charge against New Zealand on Thursday.\n\n\"Joseph Lombardi, an unaccredited analyst with Canada Soccer, is being removed from the Canadian Olympic Team and will be sent home immediately,\" COC said in a statement.\n\n\"Jasmine Mander, an assistant coach to whom Mr. Lombardi reports to, is being removed from the Canadian Olympic Team and will be sent home immediately.\"\n\nLombardi was handed an eight-month suspended jail term and his material was confiscated, a French court said.\n\nFIFA opens proceedings\n\nFIFA said on Wednesday it had opened proceedings against Canada Soccer, Priestman, Lombardi and Mander due to a potential breach of the body's disciplinary code.\n\n\"The matter will be submitted for the consideration of the Disciplinary Committee in the next days,\" FIFA said in a statement.\n\nPriestman apologised for what had happened and said ultimate responsibility lay with her.\n\n\"On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologize to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada,\" she said.\n\n\"This does not represent the values that our team stands for. I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program.\n\n\"Accordingly, to emphasize our team's commitment to integrity, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match on Thursday. In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld.\"\n\nCanada launches independent external review\n\nCanada Soccer said on Wednesday it would launch an independent external review that will not only address the circumstances of the matter but also look into the historical culture of competitive ethics within all of its programs.\n\n\"Canada Soccer has always sought to prioritize integrity and fair competition, and we understand that competing with honesty is a baseline expectation for all Canadians,\" Canada Soccer President Peter Augruso and CEO Kevin Blue said in a statement.\n\n\"We failed to meet those expectations in this case, and for that, we apologize.\"\n\nThe incident was reported by the NZOC to the police and to the International Olympic Committee's integrity unit.\n\n\"The NZOC and New Zealand Football are committed to upholding the integrity and fairness of the Olympic Games and are deeply shocked and disappointed by this incident, which occurred just three days before the sides are due to face each other in their opening game

Two other staffers have been removed from the team and are being sent home from the games.\n\nThe Canadian women's soccer team are the defending Olympic champions after winning gold at the Tokyo games in 2021. According to TSN, the New Zealand team is currently ranked 28th. Taking Priestman's place as head coach during tomorrow's match will be the team's assistant coach, Andy Spence.\n\nAn existing ban on flying drones around Paris is being strictly enforced by security during the 2024 Summer Olympics, which officially start tomorrow. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said Tuesday that security forces are intercepting an average of six drones each day using equipment such as electronic signal jammers, according to France 24.\n\nOn Monday, a drone was spotted flying over a practice session held by the New Zealand women's soccer team in Saint-\u00c9tienne, France, a city located about six hours south of Paris. The incident was reported to French authorities who located and detained the drone's operator, described by the COC as a \"non-accredited\" support member of the Canadian soccer team's staff, according to the CBC.\n\nThe New Zealand Olympic Committee \"formally lodged the incident with the [International Olympic Committee] integrity unit\" and asked the COC for a full review, according to a statement released by the New Zealand Olympic Committee yesterday.\n\nThe COC and head coach Priestman apologized to the NZOC and announced several disciplinary actions after reviewing Monday's events and a previous drone incident during a New Zealand practice on July 19th.\n\nIn addition to accepting Priestman's decision to be removed from coaching the team's opening match against New Zealand, two other members -- Joseph Lombardi, an \"an unaccredited analyst with Canada Soccer,\" and Jasmine Mander, an assistant coach -- are being removed from the Canadian Olympic Team and being sent home. The COC says that Canada Soccer staff will also \"undergo mandatory ethics training.\"", "source": {"uri": "theverge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Verge"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_liszewski@theverge.com", "name": "Andrew Liszewski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Priestman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bev Priestman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Attal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Attal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Olympic_Committee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Olympic Committee"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_union_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand national rugby union team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sports_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sports Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_24", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France 24"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Soccer_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Soccer Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yteELhr5KuR62Si9VI6eL6Oww-s=/0x0:4637x3000/1200x628/filters:focal(2377x642:2378x643)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25543869/2156400456.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 1933, "textEnd": 1942}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

These decisive actions will help ensure that individuals are held accountable and preserve the integrity of the game and fair play for all athletes.\"\n\nThis week's incident isn't the first time suspicions of surveillance have shadowed a Canadian match.\n\nIn 2021, Honduras' men's soccer team was visiting Toronto for the two countries' 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifier match. Prior to the game, the visiting team held a training session that stopped abruptly after a drone was spotted hovering over the pitch, according to reports from The Associated Press citing Honduran media.\n\n\"I'd imagine there's probably a lot of people in Canada that fly drones, I'm sure ... And when a big team like Honduras turn up I'm sure people are probably interested in what they're doing when they come into our country.\" Canada's then-coach John Herdman was quoted to say in a report published the day before the match.\n\n\"So I know for sure we won't be heading into people's countries too early because with drones these days, people can obviously capture footage. You've got to be really careful.\"\n\nThe 2021 men's qualifier ended in a 1-1 draw, and Canada went on to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 36 years. The team was later eliminated in the group stages of the tournament, falling to Morocco, Croatia and Belgium.\n\nCanada and New Zealand's women's soccer teams will face off Thursday at 11 a.m. Central European Time (5 a.m. EDT), their opening tournament match for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.\n\nWith the Olympics starting this week, punishment for Canada Soccer could be announced in the coming days. When it comes to using drones as a form of cheating, Mount Allison University women's soccer coach Derek O'Keeffe says this could be a learning experience.\n\n\"I think it's important that as coaches, staff, directors, I think it's important you educate your staff in terms of the use of drones, and obviously the use of fair sports and play,\" O'Keeffe said. \"We're educating our coaches about all those things regarding fair play, sportsmanship and just being honest.\"\n\nSoccer journalist John Molinaro says expulsion from the tournament wouldn't fit the crime.\n\n\"I think kicking Canada out of the tournament would be an extreme measure and I can't seem to see it happening,\" Molinaro said, adding that Priestman could be suspended or there might be financial penalties levelled against Soccer Canada.\n\n\"I don't think we've heard or seen the last of this.\"\n\nFormer professional soccer player and longtime Nova Scotia coach Costa Elles says spying on a practice can clearly give a team an advantage.\n\n\"I think you'll be able to handle the pressure and hopefully they'll get through it but it doesn't make them feel good walking on a pitch and get ready to compete.\"", "source":

She said she would \"voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match\" against New Zealand \"to emphasize our team's commitment to integrity,\" and \"with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld.\"\n\nNeither she nor Canada soccer, though, clarified whether or not she had knowledge of the drone operation.\n\nThe New Zealand Olympic Committee initially raised the issue with a Tuesday statement. When team members noticed the drone at a Monday session, they \"immediately reported the incident to police,\" the NZOC said.\n\nFrench authorities are on high alert this week ahead of Friday's Opening Ceremony, an open-air extravaganza on the River Seine. Amid security concerns, they have been strictly enforcing a ban on drones at and around Games venues throughout France. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said Tuesday that authorities were intercepting an average of six drones per day.\n\n\"Systems are in place to allow us to very quickly intercept [drones] and arrest their operators,\" Attal said. \"We can't allow anything to slip past us.\"\n\nThey have taken down drones flown by tourists, presumably unaware of the restrictions, Attal said.\n\nWhat they likely didn't anticipate was needing to police the reigning Olympic women's soccer champions ahead of a matchup with an underdog.\n\nCanada won gold in Tokyo. It opens its title defense Thursday in Saint-\u00c9tienne, several hours south of Paris, against New Zealand, the least-fancied team in a four-team group also featuring France and Colombia.\n\nBoth Canada and New Zealand have been training in the region ahead of the opener. After reporting the drone to police, the NZOC also said that it lodged a formal complaint with the International Olympic Committee, and \"asked Canada for a full review.\"\n\nThe IOC said in a Wednesday statement that it \"welcomes the actions announced today by the Canadian Olympic Committee,\" that it received the complaint, and that it \"is looking into it.\"\n\n\"At the Olympic Games,\" the IOC concluded, \"we expect all the teams to behave and compete with respect.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Olympic_Committee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Olympic Committee"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Priestman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bev Priestman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Soccer_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Soccer Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Attal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Attal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5O7gn.e3kbNYVOZ_RY8n2Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/fdaed860-498f-11ef-bf1e-0775b7444117", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Apparently, they spotted a drone flying over them on Ferns training session in Saint-\u00c9tienne, France. They acknowledged the French local authorities about the issue. Their surprise came when they found out the operator was a member of Team Canada's support staff.\n\nTeam New Zealand complained\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, New Zealand announced that it has filed a complaint with the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) integrity unit over a drone that flew over one of their training sessions earlier this week.\n\nThe New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) published a statement in their official web page regarding this matter:\n\nOn July 22, a drone was flown over the New Zealand women's football team training session in St Etienne.\n\nTeam support members immediately reported the incident to police, leading to the drone operator, who has been identified as a support staff member of the wider Canadian Women's football team, to be detained.\n\nThe NZOC has formally lodged the incident with the IOC integrity unit and has asked Canada for a full review.\n\nTeam Canada has issued an apology and is investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident.\n\nThe NZOC and New Zealand Football are committed to upholding the integrity and fairness of the Olympic Games and are deeply shocked and disappointed by this incident, which occurred just three days before the sides are due to face each other in their opening game of Paris 2024.\n\nAt this time the NZOC's main priority is to support the New Zealand women's football athletes and wider team as they start their campaign.\n\nDesire to clarify the facts\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee denied any connection with this incident stating that the person detained does not belong to the Canada's Soccer support team. They also expressed they feel shocked and disappointed by this allegations.\n\nThe COC is currently investigating the matter and would address the ending of the story as soon as possible.

As part of the collateral damage, two staff with the women's team have been \"sent home immediately\" and their head coach will be absent when Canada take on New Zealand in their Olympic opener on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) said a \"non-accredited member of the Canada Soccer support team\" had been detained by French authorities in Saint-\u00c9tienne, a city 250 miles south of Paris, for improperly using a drone. The arrest follows a separate incident in which a drone was used to record New Zealand's training sessions.\n\nHead coach Bev Priestman, who led the Canadian team to gold three years ago in Tokyo, denied any involvement in the scheme - but said she would voluntarily \"step aside\" for the first game.\n\n\"Irrespective of the details, I'm ultimately accountable for this team,\" Priestman said on Wednesday afternoon following a team practice. \"By no means did I direct the individuals ... I'm still learning the details and obviously this is all unfolding. But again, I think the important thing right now is to look forward, put the actions in place and take the sanctions.\"\n\nThe COC said staff at the football team had been \"transparent and cooperative throughout the process\". Assistant coach Andy Spence will be in charge of the defending champions when they face New Zealand.\n\nThe dramatic shake-up came after New Zealand's Olympic Committee told the IOC that suspicious drones flew over team practices on two occasions.\n\n\"The NZOC and New Zealand Football are committed to upholding the integrity and fairness of the Olympic Games and are deeply shocked and disappointed by this incident, which occurred just three days before the sides are due to face each other in their opening game of Paris 2024,\" the sports body said in a statement.\n\nFollowing the allegations, the COC investigated and subsequently removed assistant coach Jasmine Mander and Canada Soccer analyst Joseph Lombardi from the team's staff and said they were \"immediately sent home\".\n\nLombardi admitted to using the drone to capture New Zealand players carrying out instructions given by their coach. Mander was also interviewed by officials but denied any involvement in the recordings and was cleared of wrongdoing.\n\nThe COC said that football staff will be required to undergo mandatory ethics training.\n\n\"Fair play is the highest principle of sport. The actions of those involved do not reflect Canada's values or the values of sport,\" Carla Qualtrough, Canada's minister of sport and physical activity, wrote in a post on social media. \"I support the sanctions being imposed by the Canadian Olympic Committee, their apologies to New Zealand, and the decision of Head Coach Bev Priestman ... These decisive actions will help ensure that individuals are held accountable and preserve the integrity of the game and fair play for all athletes.\"\n\nThe scandal has dampened spirits as Canada look to defend their Olympic title.\n\n\"Obviously it's not ideal, especially with such a big tournament on the horizon,\" Canadian centre back Vanessa Gilles told reporters. \"But at the end of the day we're all professionals.

The incident involved a drone reportedly flown by Canadian staff over New Zealand's training session, disrupting their preparations. This led to FIFA initiating disciplinary proceedings against Canada Soccer, Priestman, and the implicated staff members.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) responded by removing two staff members from their Olympic squad, who were previously gold medalists at the Tokyo Games. Additionally, Priestman was sidelined from coaching the team in their upcoming match against New Zealand on Thursday.\n\n\"Joseph Lombardi, an unaccredited analyst with Canada Soccer, is being removed from the Canadian Olympic Team and will be sent home immediately,\" COC said in a statement.\n\n\"Jasmine Mander, an assistant coach to whom Mr. Lombardi reports to, is being removed from the Canadian Olympic Team and will be sent home immediately.\"\n\nThe fallout continued as a French court handed an eight-month suspended jail term to one of the staff members involved, identified as Lombardi, and confiscated the materials associated with the incident. FIFA announced that it had opened proceedings against Canada Soccer, Priestman, Lombardi, and another staff member, Mander, for a potential breach of the organization's disciplinary code.\n\n\"The matter will be submitted for the consideration of the Disciplinary Committee in the next days,\" FIFA said in a statement.\n\nPriestman apologized to the New Zealand football team and its staff and took responsibility for the incident.\n\n\"On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologize to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada,\" she said.\n\n\"This does not represent the values that our team stands for.

The allegations come ahead of Thursday's opening match at the tournament between defending Olympic champions Canada and New Zealand.\n\n\"On July 22, a drone was flown over the New Zealand women's football team training session in St Etienne,\" the NZOC said. They reported that the support members quickly reported the incident to the police. This led to the drone operator, identified as a support member of the broader Canadian Women's football team, being detained.\n\nNZOC has formally complained to the IOC integrity unit and have notified Canada for a full review and that the whole situation is about \"integrity and fairness.\" Team Canada, in response, have issued an apology and are themselves investigating the events that led such a bizarre situation.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee have said that they are aware that a \"non-accredited\" member of its support was using a drone to record the Silver Ferns' practice. They have further said that they stand with \" fair play.\" They added that they were \"reviewing the next steps\" and would cooperate with the IOC, the Paris organising committee, and FIFA.\n\nThe COC's official statement was,\"The Canadian Olympic Committee stands for fair-play and we are shocked and disappointed.

A head coach taking herself off the sideline. Now FIFA's disciplinary committee is involved and more developments could be coming.\n\nThe Canadian women's soccer team's Olympic title defence is off to a rocky start due to a drone scandal on the eve of the Paris Games.\n\n\"Obviously it's not ideal, especially with such a big tournament on the horizon,\" said Canadian centre back Vanessa Gilles. \"But at the end of the day we're all professionals. We're all going to make the most out of the situation we're put in.\n\n\"We're going to lean on each other.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Canadian Olympic Committee announced a list of \"sanctions and consequences\" after reviewing a drone incident Monday and learning of another last Friday at a New Zealand team practice.\n\nIt's believed a \"non-accredited\" staff member used an aerial device to record the New Zealand team during practice, the COC said.\n\nCanadian assistant coach Jasmine Mander and analyst Joseph Lombardi were \"sent home immediately,\" the COC said, adding that it had accepted the decision of coach Bev Priestman to remove herself from coaching the opening match against New Zealand on Thursday.\n\nPriestman held a brief media availability after guiding her squad through a one-hour practice session at Stade Auguste Dury.\n\n\"My reaction was you feel like this program has let the country down,\" she said. \"That, for me, that's why I took the proactive step to do what I felt was the right thing. Irrespective of the details, I'm ultimately accountable for this team.\"\n\nFIFA, the sport's governing body, said later Wednesday that it had opened proceedings against Canada Soccer, Priestman, Lombardi and Mander.\n\n\"The matter will be submitted for the consideration of the disciplinary committee in the (coming) days,\" the release said.\n\nThe COC said that Canada Soccer staff will be required to undergo mandatory ethics training. The committee added it has been in contact with the IOC and FIFA and further action may be taken if necessary.\n\n\"On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologize to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada,\" Priestman said in the COC release. \"This does not represent the values that our team stands for.\"\n\nBoth Mander and Lombardi were included on the team's six-member coaching staff list at the Games. Lombardi, who the COC called an unaccredited analyst, reports to Mander.\n\n\"By no means did I direct the individuals,\" Priestman said. \"I'm still learning the details and obviously this is all unfolding. But again, I think the important thing right now is to look forward, put the actions in place and take the sanctions.\"\n\nAssistant coach Andy Spence will be in charge on the Canadian sidelines in the Group A opener at Geoffrey-Guichard Stadium.\n\nEighth-ranked Canada captured Olympic gold three years ago in Tokyo. New Zealand is ranked 28th in the world.\n\nCanadian forward Janine Beckie called the news \"definitely disappointing and shocking\" but noted the players were \"incredibly resilient.\"\n\n\"Together we are still digesting it ourselves and are just really 100 per cent focused on the game,\" she said.\n\nNew Zealand's Olympic Committee alerted police after a drone was flown over the team's practice Monday, and the COC confirmed Tuesday that a \"non-accredited\" member of Canada's soccer team staff had been detained by French authorities.\n\nAccording to CBC Sports, a Saint-Etienne prosecutor issued a press release stating that the detainee admitted to capturing images of New Zealand players applying instructions from their coach, allowing him to learn their tactics.\n\nThe detainee accepted a suspended sentence of eight months' imprisonment and the confiscation of his drone, the release said, after he was tried under a procedure of Appearance on Recognition of Guilt and charged with maintaining an unmanned aircraft over a prohibited area.\n\nThe NZOC also registered a complaint with the International Olympic Committee's integrity unit and asked Canada for a full review. The COC apologized to the NZOC and that country's soccer federation, stating it was \"shocked and disappointed\" over the conduct.\n\n\"It's ultimately compromised, I think, the integrity of our match,\" said New Zealand interim head coach Michael Mayne. \"We're controlling what we can control. It's an overwhelming feeling of disappointment and I know the players are feeling the same.\"\n\nCOC chief executive officer David Shoemaker and chief sport officer Eric Myles were scheduled to hold a virtual media availability later Wednesday.\n\nIt's not the first time a Canadian soccer team has been involved in a drone controversy involving an international rival's training session.\n\nIn 2021 at Toronto, Honduras stopped a training session ahead of its men's World Cup qualifier against Canada after spotting a drone above the field, according to reports in Honduran media. The teams played to a 1-1 draw.\n\nFrench security forces guarding Paris 2024 sites are intercepting an average of six drones per day, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said Tuesday.\n\nAttal added the drones are often operated by \"individuals, maybe tourists wanting to take pictures.\"\n\n\"That's why it's important to remind people of the rules. There's a ban on flying drones,\" he said, according to multiple news outlets.\n\n\"Systems are in place to allow us to very quickly intercept (drones) and arrest their operators.\"", "source":

Police tracked the drone back to a staffer with the Canadian women's soccer team, and the fallout of the incident has been fast.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) removed two staffers, shared the findings of a second drone incident and announced that coach Bev Priestman will remain in her role -- but won't coach against New Zealand on Thursday.\n\nThe two teams face off in the opening game of Group A play Thursday at 11 a.m. ET, but questions about Canada's activity won't end there.\n\nHere's what we know so far.\n\nNew Zealand team staff members noticed a drone flying above their practice in Saint-\u00c9tienne, France, on Monday and notified police. Law enforcement tracked the drone back to its operator, Joseph Lombardi, an \"unaccredited analyst\" with the Canadian women's team, the COC said.\n\nThe \"unaccredited analyst\" distinction is only important from an Olympics perspective, with the number of accreditations limited for national teams to use. Lombardi is listed on Canada Soccer's staff as the National Development Centre Ontario and Women's U-20 Director.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee said Wednesday that a separate drone incident at New Zealand training -- on July 19 -- had come to light. The COC confirmed Lombardi used a drone \"to record the New Zealand women's football team during practice.\"\n\nThe COC apologized to New Zealand's players, federation and the International Olympic Committee, saying it was \"shocked and disappointed.\"\n\nLombardi and Jasmine Mander, an assistant coach who oversees Lombardi, were sent home from the Olympics.\n\nWithout naming him, a Saint-\u00c9tienne prosecutor said a 43-year-old Canadian man received an eight-month suspended sentence in French court for filming the two training sessions, according to the Associated Press.\n\nOn Wednesday, COC CEO David Shoemaker said that they had offered legal support and consular services to both Lombardi and Mander, as well as offering mental health support to the entirety of Canada's Olympic delegation.\n\nPriestman said Tuesday she would remove herself from managing the team during Thursday's game against New Zealand, while Shoemaker clarified Wednesday that she will remain in her role as coach for the rest of the tournament.\n\n\"We thought about all repercussions for Bev,\" Shoemaker said. \"At the end of the day, the drone footage related to the filming of two New Zealand practices remained in the hands of the pilot of the drone.\"\n\n\"I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program,\" Priestman added. \"Accordingly, to emphasize our team's commitment to integrity, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match on Thursday. In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old has been with Canada Soccer as the women's national team head coach since October 2020, departing her previous role as an assistant coach with England. She guided Canada to their gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics. The team underperformed at the 2023 World Cup, exiting in the group stage.\n\nEarlier this year, she signed a contract extension with Canada Soccer to keep her in the role through the 2027 World Cup.\n\nThis is the biggest remaining question -- with FIFA's pending investigation the biggest hurdle for her to clear. As of right now, the only consequence is one she imposed herself: she will not be on the sidelines for Thursday's match against New Zealand.\n\nHer reputation, however, is very much at risk. She has apologized publicly multiple times already, saying that she is the one ultimately accountable as the leader of the program and responsible for the actions of her staff.\n\nDue to strict European regulations that have been in place since 2021, drone hobbyists are barred from flying the aircrafts over people and can not share images or recordings without the other party's consent.\n\nDrones have been a story across the Paris Games, with French prime minister Gabriel Attal saying Tuesday that an average of six drones per day have been intercepted at Olympic sites, mostly from tourists trying to capture footage of the spectacle.\n\nShoemaker, the COC CEO, said that after reviewing the incident, they were satisfied with the proactive measures they had taken so far.\n\n\"I, with the facts available to me, made judgments that I think properly addresses the situation,\" Shoemaker said. \"An important factor here is that we did most of this with the full and complete cooperation of Canada Soccer, who I believe also is committed to fully determining root causes as it relates to these kinds of techniques and other pressures that coaches might feel they're under. In order to give their team the best chance of winning.\"\n\nShoemaker stressed that he believed Priestman's account that she was unaware of her staff's actions. He did say that if any new information were to be presented that suggested otherwise, the COC would \"reserve the right to impose further sanctions.\"\n\nFIFA said Wednesday it would investigate all potentially involved parties in the drone surveillance, including Priestman and Canada Soccer. It did not issue a precise timeline for when this might be resolved, with Priestman due to be back on the sideline for Canada's second group-stage match against France on Sunday in Saint-\u00c9tienne.\n\nAccording to Shoemaker, New Zealand also asked FIFA to not award Canada any points if it was to win Thursday's match, but he did not provide any further details or if FIFA was considering such a sanction.\n\nOn Wednesday, Canada Soccer issued its own statement, with president Peter Augruso and general secretary/CEO Kevin Blue expressing their \"unequivocal disapproval\" over the actions of the women's national team's staff.\n\nThey also pledged the federation would proceed with its own independent, external review, separate from the one launched by FIFA's disciplinary committee.\n\n\"This review will address the circumstances of the current matter, and more broadly, will seek to understand the historical culture of competitive ethics within all of our programs,\" they said. \"The outcome of this review will be shared publicly and corrective actions, if necessary, will be taken.\"\n\nIn a statement Thursday morning in New Zealand, New Zealand Football CEO Andrew Pragnell called for \"urgent action\" to be taken to \"address this integrity breach.\"\n\n\"To hear now that the Canadian team had filmed secret footage of our team training at least twice is incredibly concerning and if not treated urgently could have wider implications for the integrity of the tournament,\" Pragnell's statement said.\n\n\"We note that there have been some admissions by the Canadian National Olympic Committee, and they have taken their own sanctions against the Canadian team, however, considering the seriousness of the situation, and the potential implications to the sporting integrity of the entire tournament, we have referred the matter to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee seeking urgent action,\" the statement continued.", "source": {"uri":

They quickly reported it to the police, who identified the culprit as a member of the Canadian women's soccer support team. Although the person behind the drone wasn't named, Canada issued a statement describing them as a \"non-accredited member of the Canada soccer support team\" and denounced the act, emphasizing their commitment to fair play.\n\nThe timing of this incident is crucial, as Canada is set to play against New Zealand in their first game of the 2024 Paris Olympics women's soccer tournament. It appears the drone was being used to gain an advantage by spying on New Zealand's training session. With Group A featuring tough competition from France, Canada, New Zealand, and Colombia, every bit of information could be seen as crucial.\n\nThe police detained the staff member responsible for the drone, and the New Zealand Olympic Committee reported the incident to the International Olympic Committee. The Canadian Olympic Committee issued an official apology, expressing shock and disappointment. They emphasized their dedication to fair play and apologized to New Zealand Football and the affected players.\n\nCanada's head coach, Bev Priestman, will not be coaching the first game against New Zealand. An investigation revealed two incidents of drones flying over New Zealand's training sessions, leading to this decision. Additionally, two staff members from Canada Soccer are being sent home, and the entire staff will undergo mandatory ethics training.\n\nFIFA has opened proceedings against Bev Priestman, Jasmine Mander, and Joseph Lombardi for potential breaches of the FIFA Disciplinary Code and Regulations of Olympic Football Tournaments. The drone pilot received a suspended eight-month sentence from French prosecutors, meaning the sentence will only be served if the pilot is caught again.\n\nThe New Zealand Football Federation has referred the incident to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, ensuring that the matter is taken seriously and addressed appropriately.\n\nThis scandal, dubbed a sequel to \"Spygate,\" has stirred significant controversy right before the 2024 Paris Olympics. With the Canadian team's reputation on the line and disciplinary actions underway, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of sportsmanship and ethical conduct in competitive sports.", "source": {"uri": "businessupturn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Upturn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spygate_(NFL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spygate (NFL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Priestman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bev Priestman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Soccer_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Soccer Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Disciplinary_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Disciplinary Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_ice_hockey_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national ice hockey team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football at the Summer Olympics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.businessupturn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/safeimagekit-GettyImages-2155448281-1024x576.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 150, "textEnd": 157}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Suspecting skullduggery, the New Zealand squad called the local police, and gendarmes located and then detained the nearby drone operator. He turned out to be one Joseph Lombardi, an \"unaccredited analyst with Canada Soccer\" -- and he was apparently spying on the New Zealand practice and relaying information to a Canadian assistant coach.\n\nOn July 23, the New Zealand Olympic Committee put out a statement saying it was \"deeply shocked and disappointed by this incident, which occurred just three days before the sides are due to face each other in their opening game of Paris 2024.\" It also complained to the official International Olympic Committee integrity unit.\n\nEarly today, July 24, the Canadian side issued its own statement saying that it \"stands for fair-play and we are shocked and disappointed. We offer our heartfelt apologies to New Zealand Football, to all the players affected, and to the New Zealand Olympic Committee.\"\n\nLater in the day, a follow-up Canadian statement revealed that this was actually the second drone-spying incident; the New Zealand side had also been watched by drone at its July 19 practice.\n\nTeam Canada announced four responses to these incidents:\n\n\"Joseph Lombardi, an unaccredited analyst with Canada Soccer, is being removed from the Canadian Olympic Team and will be sent home immediately. Jasmine Mander, an assistant coach to whom Mr. Lombardi report sent [sic], is being removed from the Canadian Olympic Team and will be sent home immediately. [The Canadian Olympic Committee] has accepted the decision of Head Coach Bev Priestman to remove herself from coaching the match against New Zealand on July 25th. Canada Soccer staff will undergo mandatory ethics training.\"\n\nDrones are now everywhere -- swarming the skies over Ukraine's battlefields, flying from Houthi-controlled Yemen to Tel Aviv, scouting political assassination attempt options. Disney is running an 800-drone light show in Florida. The roofer who recently showed up to look at my shingles brought a drone with him. My kid owns one.\n\nSo, from a technical perspective, stories like this little spying scandal are no surprise at all. But for the Olympics, already awash in high-tech cheating scandals such as years-long state-sponsored doping campaigns, drone spying is just one more depressing example of how humans excel at using our tools to ruin good things in creative new ways.\n\nAnd it's a good reminder that every crazy example in those terrible HR training videos your boss makes you watch every year are included for a reason. So if you see \"drone ethics\" creeping into your compliance program right after sections on \"how to avoid being phished\" and \"don't let anyone else follow you through the door after you swipe your keycard\"... well, now you know why.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nate_anderson@arstechnica.com", "name": "Nate Anderson",

Amid security concerns, they have been strictly enforcing a ban on drones at and around Games venues throughout France. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said Tuesday that authorities were intercepting an average of six drones per day.\n\n\"Systems are in place to allow us to very quickly intercept [drones] and arrest their operators,\" Attal said. \"We can't allow anything to slip past us.\"\n\nThey have taken down drones flown by tourists, presumably unaware of the restrictions, Attal said.\n\nWhat they likely didn't anticipate was needing to police the reigning Olympic women's soccer champions ahead of a matchup with an underdog.\n\nCanada won gold in Tokyo. It opens its title defense Thursday in Saint-\u00c9tienne, several hours south of Paris, against New Zealand, the least-fancied team in a four-team group also featuring France and Colombia.\n\nBoth Canada and New Zealand have been training in the region ahead of the opener. After reporting the drone to police, the NZOC also said that it lodged a formal complaint with the International Olympic Committee, and \"asked Canada for a full review.\"\n\nThe IOC has not yet commented, and did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. It's unclear if Canada might be punished.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee said it was \"shocked and disappointed\" after learning of the incident.\n\n\"We offer our heartfelt apologies to New Zealand Football, to all the players affected, and to the New Zealand Olympic Committee,\" the COC said in its statement. \"We are reviewing next steps with the IOC, Paris 2024, Canada Soccer, and FIFA [soccer's global governing body].

The Canadian women's soccer team has come under scrutiny after two staff members were dismissed for allegedly using a drone to spy on New Zealand's practice sessions.\n\nThe controversy began on Monday when New Zealand Football lodged a complaint with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) about drones hovering over their closed training sessions.\n\nIn response to the allegations, the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) launched an investigation and confirmed that two staff members were involved. Assistant coach Jasmine Mander and analyst Joseph Lombardi were identified as responsible parties. Both were immediately removed from the Canadian Olympic team and sent home. The COC has also issued a public apology to New Zealand Football and emphasized its commitment to fair play and sportsmanship by making its staff undertake mandatory ethics training.\n\nCanada's head coach, Bev Priestman, took accountability for the incident by voluntarily stepping down from coaching the upcoming match against New Zealand. She expressed deep regret for the actions of her team members and assured the public that such behavior does not reflect the team's values.\n\n\"I am ultimately responsible for the conduct in our program,\" Priestman said. \"Accordingly, to emphasize our team's commitment to integrity, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match on Thursday. In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld.\"\n\nDuring a press briefing, COC chief executive David Shoemaker corroborated that Priestman had \"no involvement, no knowledge\" of the incident. \"We thought about all repercussions for Bev. At the end of the day, the drone footage related to the filming of two New Zealand practices and it remained in the hands of the pilot of the drone and the advantage that, I guess, was intended to be obtained was not attained, at least to the best of our ability to ascertain.\"\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the Paris Olympics incident is not the first time a Canadian soccer team has tried to spy on an international rival's training session with a drone. According to media reports, in 2021, Honduras stopped a training session ahead of its men's World Cup qualifier against Canada after spotting a drone above the field.

Canada head coach Bev Priestman has stood herself down from overseeing Friday's opening match against New Zealand, while Joseph Lombardi, an \"unaccredited analyst,\" and assistant coach Jasmine Mander have been sent home amid multiple investigations.\n\nMuch of the drama played out in a series of sternly-worded statements.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) said it was \"shocked and disappointed\" with the conduct of the two members of its football team and apologised to the New Zealand team.\n\nThe COC added that the staff of Canada Soccer would undergo \"mandatory ethics training\".\n\nPriestman later followed up with an apology of her own.\n\n\"On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologise to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada. This does not represent the values that our team stands for,\" she said.\n\n\"I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program. Accordingly, to emphasize our team's commitment to integrity, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match on [Friday]. In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld.\"\n\nFifa then got in on the act, posting a statement on its website confirming its disciplinary committee has \"opened proceedings\" against Canada Soccer, Priestman, Lombardi and Mander to look into potential breaches of the world governing body's rules.\n\nThe incident appears to fall within a jurisdictional matrix. The New Zealand Olympic team have also logged a complaint with the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) integrity unit, while French authorities are investigating how the security breach occurred.\n\nLombardi was detained by local police on Monday night following a complaint from New Zealand Football.\n\nThe only officials to front were New Zealand chef de mission Nigel Avery and the NZOC's public affairs director Ashley Abbott earlier in the day.\n\n\"This is an incident that goes against everything we stand for, with our values, our commitment to an even and fair playing field,\" Avery told a media conference.\n\nAvery said the NZOC's focus in on supporting the Fern's from both a \"wellbeing and performance standpoint\" as the team prepares for Friday morning's opener.\n\n\"They haven't had a smooth build-up and this is something they have to overcome.\n\n\"To say it's an unwanted distraction is an understatement.\"\n\nThe Ferns team departed for France in a state of turmoil, after coach Jitka Klimkova stepped aside from the Paris campaign following a failed \"restorative process\" to rebuild relationships in the team. The move came after Klimkova was in June cleared by an employment investigation - although the details of what kicked off the investigation remain a mystery.\n\nLate last night, in the midst of the extraordinary twists and turns of the spying saga came a further blow.\n\nFootball Ferns captain Ali Riley, who was seeking to join a select group of women to compete at a fifth Olympic Games, was withdrawn on medical grounds.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc",

The manager, however, is not sick or dealing with some sort of injury. Instead, Canada has come under fire for allegedly spying on their first opponents of the upcoming tournament.\n\nAn uncredited member of the Canadian women's national team allegedly flew drones over New Zealand's practice on two separate occasions. Both incidents occurred within the last week. The two teams face off on Thursday, July 25. It is the opening match of Group A in the competition. Hosts France and Colombia are also in the group as well.\n\nAccording to reports, the drone was first spotted by New Zealand team members on July 19. Some assumed the incident was perhaps just an accident. Nevertheless, the drone was once again spotted over New Zealand's training facility three days later. Olympic officials were immediately made aware of the situation.\n\nFrench authorities then detained the drone operator, believed to be Joseph Lombardi. Lombardi is an uncredited analyst with Canada Soccer. Canada has since removed him from the team. Jasmine Mander, an assistant coach to Priestman, is also returning home. Lombardi supposedly reports directly to Mander regularly.\n\nDue to the series of incidents, Priestman has officially announced that she has \"voluntarily withdrawn\" from the match against New Zealand. \"On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologize to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada. This does not represent the values that our team stands for,\" stated Priestman.\n\n\"I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program. Accordingly, to emphasize our team's commitment to integrity, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match on Thursday. In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interest of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld.\"\n\nNew Zealand's Olympic Committee also announced that they are \"deeply shocked and disappointed\" by the incident. Team officials also revealed that Canada has personally apologized for the events and is undergoing an internal investigation on the matter.\n\nThe Canucks are the reigning Olympic champions after their triumph at the tournament in 2021. Canada topped powerhouse Sweden in the final in Japan on penalty kicks. New Zealand, on the other hand, finished bottom of Group G during the previous games, a group that also featured the USWNT. Canada currently ranks eighth in the world by FIFA, 20 spots above New Zealand.\n\nThe upcoming matchup between the two teams will be the opening women's soccer match of the 2024 Summer Olympics. After facing New Zealand, Canada will play hosts France on July 28. Priestman will be back on the sidelines for the game. The Canucks will then finish off Group A with a matchup against 22nd-ranked Colombia on July 31.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Priestman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bev Priestman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_women's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada women's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Soccer_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Soccer Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_women's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States women's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://worldsoccertalk.com/api/request-image/?proxy=https://ds-images.bolavip.com/news/image?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.worldsoccertalk.com%2Fjpg%2Ffull%2FWST_20240724_WST_518068_Canada-Olympics-spying.jpg[ampersand]width=1200[ampersand]height=740", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 517, "textEnd": 524}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 720, "textEnd": 727}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "textStart": 2795, "textEnd": 2802}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 2946, "textEnd": 2953}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The COC reportedly confirmed that it was Lombardi who flew the drone over the New Zealand trainings.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Priestman apologized to New Zealand's players and staff, as well as Team Canada.\n\n\"This does not represent the values that our team stands for,\" Priestman said.\n\nLate Monday morning, the supervisor of the Olympic training sites in Saint-Etienne alerted police to the presence of a drone hovering above Auguste Dury stadium, where the New Zealand team had been practicing, according to a statement from the Saint-Etienne prosecutor's office.\n\nWithout naming Lombardi, the prosecutor's office said that the drone's pilot, a 43-year-old Canadian, was taken into custody and questioned.\n\nOn two separate occasions, he \"had effectively filmed the closed-door training of the New Zealand women's team, with the help of a drone,\" the statement read.\n\nThe footage taken on July 22 show the New Zealand players applying instructions given to them by their trainer, as well as images taken on July 20 -- a previously unknown instance that he admitted during questioning -- when they were training in the Michon stadium in Saint-Etienne.\n\nHe told officers during that the videos \"had helped him learn the tactics of the opposing team,\" according to the statement.\n\nThe prosecutor's office also questioned the assistant trainer from the Canadian team, whom the drone pilot had told about his visit to the New Zealand team's training site. She had no knowledge of the acts and was exonerated, the office said.\n\nThe man was charged with maintaining an unmanned aircraft over a prohibited area, an offense that carries a maximum prison sentence of one year and a fine of 45,000 euros ($49,000).\n\nAccompanied by a lawyer, the prosecutor's statement read, the man accepted a sentence of 8 months in prison, as well as the confiscation of his drone and other electronic equipment seized from his hotel room.\n\nMeanwhile, Canada Soccer will conduct an independent external review of the incident and the sport's international governing body FIFA has launched disciplinary proceedings.\n\nThe Kiwis used the drama as motivation during Thursday's game against Canada, scoring the opening goal.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_bowman@npr.org", "name": "Emma Bowman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Priestman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bev Priestman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_women's_national_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand women's national cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Soccer_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Soccer Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_league_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand national rugby league team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_ice_hockey_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national ice hockey team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4027x2265+0+210/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F09%2F4a%2F1a7ff1164f63b7fe238edc8a1bba%2Fap24207640504301.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 1747, "textEnd": 1754}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 1865, "textEnd": 1872}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Additionally, Group A proves to be challenging with France, Canada, New Zealand, and Colombia matched up.\n\nThe police detained the staff member and New Zealand's Olympic Committee notified the International Olympic Committee of the occurrence.\n\nMORE: Who will win the gold medal for women's soccer?\n\nCanada has since come out with an official statement, apologizing for the incident while also condemning the \"non-accredited member of the Canada soccer support team.\"\n\n\"The Canadian Olympic Committee stands for fair-play and we are shocked and disappointed,\" the statement read. \"We offer our heartfelt apologies to New Zealand football, to all the players affected, and to the New Zealand Olympic Committee.\"\n\nIt's uncertain what the punishment will be for either the staff member or the Canadian squad. The team said it is \"reviewing next steps with the IOC, Paris 2024, Canada soccer and FIFA.\" It also stated there will be an update to come.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_women's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada women's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Olympic_Committee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Olympic Committee"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/GettyImages-2155448281.jpg?itok=0SQnSFcS", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 229, "textEnd": 236, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Canada's assistant coach Jasmine Mander and analyst Joseph Lombardi have been sent home in reaction to the scandal.\n\n\"I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program,\" Priestman said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Accordingly, to emphasise our team's commitment to integrity, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match on Thursday.

New Zealand reported the incident to the French police as well as making a complaint to the International Olympic Committee's integrity unit.\n\nCanada confirmed that a \"non-accredited\" member of their team staff had been detained by French authorities for flying the drone.

Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said on Tuesday that the machines are often operated by \"individuals, maybe tourists wanting to take pictures.\"\n\nHe added: \"That's why it's important to remind people of the rules. There's a ban on flying drones. Systems are in place to allow us to very quickly intercept [drones] and arrest their operators.\"\n\nCanada won gold in Tokyo after claiming back-to-back bronze medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games.

Two members of the team's coaching staff were expelled, and the head coach decided to step aside for the opening match.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) reported this Wednesday that an unaccredited member of Canada's support staff was detained by French authorities for flying a drone over New Zealand's training facilities. The New Zealand committee had previously filed a complaint with the police, which led to the clarification of the facts.\n\nThe convicted individual is named Joseph Lombardi, a technical analyst who is part of the Canadian setup but does not have official accreditation for the Paris Olympic Games. Lombardi admitted to using the drone to capture the opposing coach's instructions. \"I acknowledge that my actions were a serious breach of ethics. I deeply regret compromising the integrity of the competition and apologise to everyone affected,\" he stated in his declaration.\n\nThe prosecutor of Saint Etienne handling the case, David Charmatz, sentenced the accused to eight months in prison, although without incarceration. Charmatz explained that examination of the drone showed that, in addition to recording the New Zealand team on Monday, it had also done so two days earlier at another stadium in the area. The sentence also includes the confiscation of the drone.\n\nIn response to the incident, the COC decided yesterday to expel Lombardi from the Canadian Olympic team and send him back to Canada immediately. The same measures have been taken with assistant coach Jasmine Mander, who received the espionage report. Although Mander denied any involvement in the matter and was cleared of complicity, the COC processed her disassociation to maintain trust in the team, the integrity of the sport, and its ethical standards.\n\nIn response to the scandal, head coach Bev Priestman, who led the team to gold in Tokyo 2020, decided to voluntarily step away from the bench for the first match against New Zealand taking place this afternoon. \"Although I did not personally direct the actions of those involved, as head coach, I am responsible for the team's behaviour. I apologise to the players and staff of New Zealand. This situation does not reflect the values we uphold,\" Priestman declared, assuming responsibility.\n\nFor their part, the COC emphasised that despite the incident, the team has been transparent and cooperative during the investigations. Additionally, the staff will undergo mandatory training in sports ethics. \"Transparency and cooperation have been key throughout this process. We will continue to review the situation and take further action if necessary,\" said a spokesperson for the organisation.\n\nCarla Qualtrough, Canadian Minister of Sport and Physical Activity, also commented on this uncomfortable episode. \"Fair play is the highest principle in sport. I fully support the sanctions and Coach Priestman's decision to step aside for the first match. These decisions are crucial to maintaining the integrity of the game and respecting the Olympic spirit,\" Qualtrough wrote on social media.\n\nThe scandal has also affected the atmosphere within the Canadian team just before their crucial match against New Zealand. Defender Vanessa Gilles commented on the situation, saying, \"Obviously, it's not ideal to enter such an important tournament under these circumstances. However, we are professionals and are committed to doing our best. We will support each other and focus on the match.\"", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.insidethegames.biz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karate@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Karate", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "javier_carro@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Javier Carro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_union_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand national rugby union team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Etienne_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Etienne (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Priestman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bev Priestman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Gilles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanessa Gilles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Organising_Committee_of_the_Olympic_and_Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carla_Qualtrough", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carla Qualtrough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_ice_hockey_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national ice hockey team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://cdn.dmcl.biz/media/image/300394/o/GettyImages-1332716649.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

New Zealand claims the staffer recorded their practice with a drone.\n\nThe New Zealand Olympic Committee said in a statement that it formally lodged the incident with the IOC integrity unit and asked Canada for a full review.\n\nThe COC also said it is reviewing next steps with the IOC, Paris 2024, Canada Soccer and FIFA, and will provide a further update Wednesday.\n\nSecurity for the Olympic Games has ramped up in recent weeks. France's Prime Minister Gabriel Attal told the French newspaper Le Monde Monday that security is intercepting an average of six drones per day.\n\nWhile tourists wanting to take pictures are believed to be flying most of the devices, Attal says it's important to remind people there's a ban on using drones.\n\n\"We can't allow anything to slip past us,\" he said.\n\nLe Monde also reported that other anti-aircraft defences are in place, including a 150-kilometre radius around Paris, which will be completely closed off Friday during the opening ceremony, and 18,000 French troops have been deployed to secure this summer's Olympic Games.\n\nCanada and New Zealand kick off the Olympic competition Thursday at 11 a.m. EDT.

Two Canadian Women's Soccer Coaches Sent Home After Illegal Drone Use", "body": "Two Canadian Olympic women's assistant soccer coaches have been dismissed by the team after two incidents of reportedly using drones to spy on New Zealand's team ahead of their first match against each other.\n\nCanadian team soccer analyst Joseph Lombardi and assistant coach Jasmine Mander were sent home from the Paris Olympics after New Zealand saw Lombardi using a drone during one of their private soccer practices, presumably to get an illegal and unfair advantage on the team's game plan. New Zealand team officials immediately contacted the International Olympic Committee, which alerted French law enforcement and took the two Canadian assistant soccer coaches into custody while also revealing that there was a separate drone spying incident as well.\n\nAlthough it's unclear if the Canadian teams knew what the two coaches were doing (plausible deniability, anyone?) Canadian head coach Bev Priestman voluntarily stepped down from coaching the team's first Olympic match against New Zealand.\n\n\"On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologize to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada,\" Priestman said via a statement. \"This does not represent the values that our team stands for. I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program. In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld.\"\n\nThe IOC is continuing its investigation, but already some are wondering if the Canadian women - who won their first women's soccer Olympic gold medal during the last Summer Olympics, were also illegally spying on their opponents.\n\nThe incident is being likened to 2007's NFL Spygate scandal in which the New England Patriots were caught videotaping the rival New York Jets defensive coaches' signals from the opposing sideline during a game between the two teams. The NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell would end up fining Patriots head coach Bill Belichick the maximum allowed penalty of $500,000, the team $250,000 and a forfeit of their 2008 NFL Draft first-round pick for having knowledge of the spying incident.\n\nMeanwhile, as the Olympic Committee's investigation continues, we'll hopefully soon find out to what extent Canada was illegally using drones to cheat.\n\nWe'll also see if the tape and subsequent game plan was passed to Team Canada and if it has an advantage when it plays New Zealand in the first round of the Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_gunzelman@outkick.com", "name": "Mike Gunzelman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_league_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand national rugby league team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_ice_hockey_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national ice hockey team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Priestman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bev Priestman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plausible deniability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/07/CANADIAN-SOCCER-DRONE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

So why is Bev Priestman still the coach?", "body": "PARIS -- Bev Priestman cannot coach Canada at these Olympics, at the least. She is the coach of the defending gold-medal women's soccer team, but she cannot coach here, not after the drone scandal that rocked Canada before the team played its first match in France. Not now.\n\nAnd yet, it appears she will. There is also a question of whether Priestman should coach Canada again at all, of course, but that's a question that can't be answered until after the Olympics.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe scandal broke late Tuesday night: A Canada team staffer named Joey Lombardi was arrested earlier this week for flying a drone over a New Zealand practice, in advance of the Canada-New Zealand opening match Thursday in Saint-\u00c9tienne.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThere is a drone ban around Paris; it is well-publicized at a Games where security is being taken very seriously. French president Emmanuel Macron said the other day six drones per day are being intercepted around Olympic sites; the communications director of the Brazilian team was nabbed for using a drone near the Olympic Village.\n\nIt turns out Lombardi took drone footage of two New Zealand practices. According to a prosecutor's statement obtained by the CBC, New Zealand spotted the drone and stopped practice, Lombardi was located and arrested, and sung like a canary. He said he was spying to learn about tactics; assistant coach Jasmine Mander, to whom Lombardi reports, claimed to know nothing about his actions to police. Lombardi, meanwhile, pled to an eight-month suspended sentence that mostly seems to mean he leaves France. Mander has served with the national team since Tokyo 2021; Lombardi worked with the women's team at the 2023 Women's World Cup, and has served on staff at six FIFA under-20 or under-17 tournaments. Neither is new to Canada Soccer.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee's version of consequences, though, is where this stops short. Lombardi and Mander were kicked off the team and hustled onto the next plane home; Canada Soccer staff were ordered to undergo ethics training; and the COC accepted Priestman's offer to sit out coaching the New Zealand game, with assistant Andy Spence in her place.\n\nWhen asked why he believed Priestman's denial of involvement, Canadian Olympic Committee CEO David Shoemaker more or less said they didn't have evidence the obtained footage was ever used, that he believed Priestman's denial, and that it was a fact that she was not involved. He also said, \"winning the right way is the only way for us.\"\n\nIs it? The COC, which in fairness is largely a marketing and logistics and lobbying operation, doesn't seem to have wondered how Mander could have acted without Priestman's authorization and approval. In an interview with The Canadian Press in Saint-\u00c9tienne, she said, \"By no means did I direct the individuals,\" but that stretches credulity to the breaking point. You can plausibly accept that this is relatively common practice in soccer, even beyond the drone accusations levelled at Canada's men's team before a match with Honduras in 2021. It's possible and even probable that Canada isn't alone in the soccer spy game.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut it's very hard to imagine a team staffer -- an assistant to an assistant coach -- going out to a New Zealand practice and launching a drone to spy on the team without approval, on the staff of a detail-oriented head coach who has a budget so limited she nearly left the program late last year and who searches for every advantage. Where was that drone information going to end up? Who is to say Lombardi didn't talk about what he saw with the team? And for that matter, why did Lombardi bring a drone to Paris in the first place? Whose drone was it?\n\nFIFA announced it was opening disciplinary proceedings against Priestman, Mander and Lombardi; Canada Soccer said it would launch an independent investigation.\n\nLook, lately Canada has been good for at least one very bad decision per non-Beijing 2022 Games. In Pyeongchang, a Canadian ski cross racer, his wife, and a coach drunkenly stole a bright red Humvee after a night out and drove it back to the Olympic Village, wearing their bright red Canada jackets. But that was easy: They were sent home. In Tokyo three years ago, there was a late outbreak of forbidden co-country athlete partying, hotel room trashing and mascot theft, which was apparently started by Canadians. Again, that's easy: You send them home.\n\nHere, relieving Bev Priestman of her duties for the defending gold medallists would require the confidence that she is truly in charge of her staff, which shouldn't be much of a leap, but it's one the Canadian Olympic Committee is unwilling to make. Canada got caught cheating at the Olympics, and decided the responsibility was as narrow as it can plausibly be. They should hope it doesn't become some kind of national shame.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bruce_arthur@thestar.com", "name":

Following these events, Bev Priestman, the head coach of the Canadian team, announced her decision to abstain from participating in the team's opening match of their Olympics gold medal defence against New Zealand.\n\nThis series of events unfolded after French authorities detained a staff member for piloting the drone over New Zealand's training, an act aimed at gathering intelligence on their tactical preparations.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) has been informed of a second similar incident involving New Zealand, prompting an official complaint from the latter to the IOC integrity unit, seeking clarification and action from Canada.\n\nIn response, the COC has engaged with both the IOC and FIFA. \"The COC is in contact with the IOC and in contact with FIFA. Canada Soccer has been transparent and cooperative throughout the process. The COC will continue to review this matter and may take further action if necessary,\" the COC said.\n\nBev Priestman expressed her stance on the matter, stating her belief that her presence on the bench for the upcoming match against New Zealand would be inappropriate.\n\nShe extended an apology to the New Zealand Football team and staff, as well as to the players of Team Canada, admitting, \"On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologise to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada. This does not represent the values that our team stands for. I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our programme. Accordingly, to emphasise our team's commitment to integrity, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match on Thursday.\"\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Cheap shot, really.\"\n\nLater, Chote said: \"I think the Canadians are embarrassed and the Football Ferns have the moral high ground.\"\n\nThe COC announced Lombardi and the assistant coach he reports to are being sent home, while head coach Bev Priestman was removing herself from Thursday's match.\n\nBut, frankly, that doesn't seem like enough. FIFA has opened an investigation and further sanctions could be forthcoming.\n\nIt's hard to fathom why Priestman, whether she had any knowledge of this or not, should coach another game at this Olympics. She's the head coach, so essentially the CEO, of the program.\n\nDavid Shoemaker, the CEO of the COC, was asked at least three times during a video news conference on Wednesday why he didn't suspend Priestman.\n\n\"I was persuaded by the fact that Bev Priestman had no involvement, no knowledge of the incident,\" Shoemaker said of a coach who guided Canada to Olympic gold in her first major tournament with the squad after getting the job in 2020.\n\n\"Those who had direct involvement were removed from Team Canada.\"\n\nPerhaps noticing the mood of the Zoom room at the end of the press conference, Shoemaker, unprompted, encouraged FIFA and Canada Soccer (which announced it is conducting an independent review) to \"do what they are setting out to do.\"\n\nWhile they do that, New Zealand can have a little chuckle. And, by the way, Shoemaker said New Zealand also has asked the powers that the Canadians not be awarded points in the standings if they win the game.\n\n\"If you're for the Football Ferns, you take it as a badge of pride,\" New Zealand sports commentator Elliott Smith said on Sports Fix.\n\n\"...I don't know why exactly Canada would bother.\"\n\nNo matter what you think of Ben Johnson and the drug-tainted field at the 1988 Olympics, he was seemingly trying to gain an edge on some of the world's best by using performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nThe New Zealand team, conversely, is not an international power. It has never made it out of the group stage at a World Cup and has done so at the Olympics just once. What's more, New Zealand made an abrupt coaching change just last month.\n\nCanada, meanwhile, has won women's soccer medals at the past three Olympics before crashing out early at last year's World Cup.\n\nAs for Lombardi being listed originally as an unaccredited analyst, that is simply administrative talk that means nothing. Shoemaker said sports associations are given out only so many accreditations and it simply becomes a numbers game.\n\nLombardi, who was given an eight-month suspended sentence by French authorities, was listed on the press release when the Olympic team was announced. He also worked under John Herdman with previous Canadian men's teams, among other assignments. He is not some intern.\n\nFor Canada Soccer, this is a return to the bad old days. There was such optimism earlier this month when new men's coach Jesse Marsch, hired by new CEO Kevin Blue, guided that squad to a surprising semifinal appearance at Copa America.\n\nFor years, it was the men's program spinning its wheels while the women succeeded on the world stage -- in spite of constant off-field bumbling by Soccer Canada.\n\nBlue, through zero fault of his own, now has a major problem on his hands.\n\nOn Thursday, the soccer world will be rooting for New Zealand.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnet.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnet"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It doesn't conform to our standards of fair play and our values at the Canadian Olympic Committee.\"\n\nShoemaker said if any facts were to become known in the future suggesting Priestman was involved then the COC reserves the right to impose further sanctions.\n\nCanada Soccer is launching an independent external review into the matter while global soccer's governing body FIFA has begun disciplinary proceedings.\n\nShoemaker also said he felt there was no need for Priestman to miss more than one game since, according to him, she was not in possession of any footage from New Zealand's training sessions.\n\n\"We thought about all the repercussions for Bev,\" said Shoemaker. \"At the end of the day the drone footage related to the filming of two New Zealand practices remained in the hands of the pilot of the drone and the advantage that I guess was intended to be obtained was not obtained.\"\n\nShoemaker also said that while he is not aware of any calls for the women's team to be disqualified from the Olympics he did say New Zealand Football registered a complaint to FIFA, asking that Canada not be awarded any points if they win.\n\nNew Zealand Football have released their first statement on the spying incident.\n\nThe statement does not confirm whether New Zealand Football has asked for Canada not to receive any points should they win, though NZF CEO Andrew Pragnall said they are seeking urgent action from world governing body FIFA.\n\n\"There is no place for this type of action in football and it is critical that urgent action is undertaken to address this integrity breach.\n\n\"To hear now that the Canadian team had filmed secret footage of our team training at least twice is incredibly concerning and if not treated urgently could have wider implications for the integrity of the tournament.\n\n\"We note that there have been some admissions by the Canadian National Olympic Committee, and they have taken their own sanctions against the Canadian team, however, considering the seriousness of the situation, and the potential implications to the sporting integrity of the entire tournament, we have referred the matter to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee seeking urgent action.\"", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They found footage of that practice and of an earlier one.\n\nBut a COC news release issued on July 1 listed Lombardi as an official member of the women's national team's six-person coaching staff, led by head coach Bev Priestman.\n\nCanada Soccer spokesperson Paulo Senra confirmed on Thursday afternoon that Lombardi remains the director of the federation's Women's Excel program, described on its website as a means for players to progress from youth levels to the national team.\n\nIn a video posted online last month by Ontario Soccer, the provincial body's manager of match official development, David Barrie, said Lombardi \"served as Canada national's team staff coach, performing... analysis for both the men's and women's national team programs -- senior and youth levels.\"\n\nAccording to a staff list posted online for a CONCACAF Nations League qualifying match in 2019, Lombardi served as \"performance analyst support\" for the men's national team, under then-head coach John Herdman.\n\nA Canadian Press report from 2018 referred to Lombardi as a \"key member of Herdman's team.\"\n\nIn 2021, the Honduran men's team stopped a training session in Toronto ahead of its World Cup qualifier against Canada after spotting a drone above the field, according to reports in Honduran media at the time.\n\n\"I'd imagine there's probably a lot of people in Canada that fly drones, I'm sure,\" Herdman told reporters in September 2021. \"And when a big team like Honduras turn up I'm sure people are probably interested in what they're doing when they come into our country.\"\n\nPriestman served as assistant coach to Herdman, when he led Canada's women's national team. Both coaches were raised in Consett, a small town in the north of England.\n\nPriestman has apologized for the drone flights and said she did not \"direct\" those responsible. She withdrew from Olympic coaching duties for one game and did not attend her team's 2-1 win over New Zealand on Thursday.\n\nAsked by CBC Sports on Wednesday whether she was aware of the drone use, Priestman did not directly respond.\n\n\"I would just like to apologize to our country but also to New Zealand,\" she said. \"There's deep ills regarding this moment, and those don't necessarily sit directly with me, but ultimately I am accountable for any action that happens inside this camp.\"\n\nCOC chief executive officer David Shoemaker said earlier he believes Priestman had \"had no involvement, no knowledge\" of the flights.\n\n\"Those who had the direct involvement in the incident we removed from Team Canada,\" he said.\n\nSoccer's world governing body, FIFA, says it has opened disciplinary proceedings against Lombardi, Mander and Priestman.\n\n\"Did she know about this? Unfortunately, if she did, I feel like maybe she should be sent home,\" said Carrie Serwetnyk, a former member of the women's national team who was inducted into Canada's soccer hall of fame.\n\nFrench prosecutors said the man who was arrested had accepted a suspended sentence of eight months' imprisonment, after he was charged with maintaining an unmanned aircraft over a prohibited

Cue Canada Soccer.\n\nA non-accredited member of the Canadian women's national team staff, identified as Joseph Lombardi, flew a drone over New Zealand's private training session, violating Olympic, FIFA, and French laws and labelling the defending Olympic champions as cheaters in the eyes of the world on the eve of their tournament opening match.\n\nFrench authorities detained Lombardi, and on Wednesday, the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) announced that he committed two offenses of spying on New Zealand sessions, resulting in an eight-month delayed prison sentence for breaking drone laws on July 20 and July 22.\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, the COC confirmed that both Lombardi and his primary report, longtime assistant Jasmine Mander, had been removed from the team's staff. Head coach Bev Priestman also volunteered to sit out the match against New Zealand on Thursday.\n\nTo say things have not gone according to plan would be an understatement. On Thursday, as Canada takes the field for the first time in their gold medal defence, the world will be against them.\n\nRelated Read: Canada kick off gold medal defence amid spy controversy and Olympic chaos\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) expressed support for the COC's actions after the incident. However, the CanWNT and its staff could face further repercussions. According to COC CEO David Shoemaker, the New Zealand Olympic Committee has requested that Canada receive no points if they win the match.\n\nYikes.\n\nFIFA will also investigate the situation, noting that Priestman, Mander, and Lombardi might have breached Olympic and FIFA competition regulations.\n\nIn 2021, John Herdman's CanMNT faced similar drone-related accusations from Honduras before a World Cup qualifier.\n\nThe COC stands by Priestman, who claimed she had no involvement with the drones, did not see any footage, and that stepping back from the opening match demonstrates her commitment to fair play.\n\nLegally, the COC has provided Lombardi and Mander with ombudspersons to explain their rights, and Global Affairs Canada has offered additional legal and consular support, particularly to Lombardi, who faces a delayed eight-month prison sentence.\n\nLombardi was tried under Appearance on Recognition of Guilt after facing a public prosecutor on charges of \"maintaining an unmanned aircraft over a prohibited area,\" according to a CBC translation from the Saint-Ettiene prosecutor. He accepted the suspended eight-month sentence in the presence of his lawyer.\n\nFrench law offers little recourse against the Canadian team from a footballing standpoint, and the COC has also provided mental health support for Mander and Lombardi. However, the sporting repercussions could be significant.\n\nCanada will enter its Olympic opener with assistant coach Andy Spence at the helm. Spence, who joined the CanWNT in 2022, previously coached Everton's WSL team and served as an assistant with England's U19 and U21 sides.\n\nDespite Spence's capabilities, the loss of Lombardi and Mander, along with Priestman's absence, creates an unwelcome distraction. This is especially troubling for a team that has excelled in Olympic performances since their bronze medal run in London 2012 and enters as reigning champions, particularly after a disappointing 2023 World Cup marred by labor disputes with Canada Soccer.\n\nThe looming threat of a points-less victory, should a decision be reached between the NZOC, IOC, and FIFA before kickoff, adds to the tension.\n\nMoving forward, multiple organizations are conducting thorough investigations. The IOC and FIFA are looking into the matter at the NZOC's request, while the COC defers to Canada Soccer, which has announced an independent external investigation.\n\nThe CanWNT finds itself in an unexpected and challenging position as they aim for a fourth consecutive Olympic medal and a gold defense. For women's soccer players, it's already a grueling period, with the prospect of playing six matches in 18 days while missing the Opening Ceremony and much of the Olympic fanfare.\n\nThe Opening Ceremonies take place on Friday, but for CanWNT the tournament couldn't have started much worse.", "source": {"uri": "wakingthered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Waking The Red"}, "authors": [],

by Marcelo Bielsa-esque 'spygate' controversy", "body": "Former Leeds United boss Marcelo Bielsa (Image credit: Peter Powell)\n\nThe Leeds United 'spygate' saga was one of the stories of the 2018/19 season in English football.\n\nThe incident saw the former Whites head coach admit that his staff had spied on their opponents all season after a member of his backroom staff was spotted outside the Derby County training ground before the two sides were due to meet in the Championship.\n\nThis led to Bielsa holding a remarkable press conference where he explained exactly why he had done it and went through his entire pre-match analysis routine in breathtaking detail.\n\nVIDEO How Gareth Southgate Evolved England (And Why He HAD To Go)\n\nBielsa would end the press conference by ultimately admitting that he only did it 'because I think I'm stupid', but it would appear that these tactics have been in play at the Olympic Games.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) announced on Tuesday that an assistant women's football coach and an analyst had been sent home following accusations that they had spied on an opponent.\n\nThis came after the New Zealand team said that a drone had been spotted overhead during a training session on Tuesday, and that it had been operated by a staff member from the Canada women's side.\n\n\"Team support members immediately reported the incident to police, leading to the drone operator, who has been identified as a support staff member of the wider Canadian Women's football team, to be detained,\" the New Zealand Olympic Committee said in a

Assistant coach Andy Spence will serve as the team's interim coach throughout the rest of the Olympics.\n\nThough a Canada soccer staffer was caught flying a drone over New Zealand training earlier this week in France, which is what sparked the scandal in the first place, the issue has apparently been going on for quite some time. According to TSN, both the men's and women's national teams have \"relied on drones and spying for years.\" They even apparently used them to film closed door training sessions of opponents during their gold medal run in the 2021 Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nA Canadian soccer staffer, Joseph Lombardi, was detained by French police earlier this week after he was caught flying a drone over New Zealand practices multiple times ahead of their group stage game on Thursday. French police searched his hotel room and found drone footage from two closed training sessions, which he told police \"had helped him to learn the tactics of the opposing team.\" Lombardi was charged with flying an unmanned aircraft over a prohibited area, and he accepted an eight-month suspended sentence.\n\nThe incident prompted multiple investigations. Lombardi and assistant coach Jasmine Mander, who is Lombardi's boss, were both removed from the Canadian delegation and sent home as punishment. Priestman self-imposed a one-game suspension, and she was not on the sidelines for Thursday's win over New Zealand.\n\n\"I am ultimately responsible for the conduct in our program,\" Priestman said in a statement earlier this week while saying that she didn't have knowledge of the drone operation.\n\nNow, Priestman is on her way home early.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Priestman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bev Priestman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Spence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Spence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Soccer_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Soccer Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sports_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sports Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(punishment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (punishment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_sentence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suspended sentence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/L6ALSHX6CNjgjaZkjJTBJA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03Nzg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/d68dbbb0-4adf-11ef-b7fd-93be0c0d4f46", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Head coach Bev Priestman - who has previous links to New Zealand - has also stood down from Thursday's match against the Ferns.\n\n\"On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologize to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada. This does not represent the values that our team stands for,\" Priestman said. \"I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program. Accordingly, to emphasize our team's commitment to integrity, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match on Thursday. In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld.\"\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee have also said their staff will undergo mandatory ethics training.\n\nThe inside word here is that the COC are scrambling, desperate to avoid any further sanctions, with financial penalties likely. A Canadian journalist admitted it was highly embarrassing.\n\nThe Herald can also reveal that Fifa may become involved. Though the Olympics comes under the IOC, Fifa is responsible for elements of the football program and it appears likely the matter may be referred to the all powerful Fifa Integrity unit.\n\nThe Herald attempted to question COC officials in Paris on Tuesday afternoon but their large office at the main press centre was empty, with padlocks across the door.\n\nThe motivation is still unclear - and that is the biggest lingering question. The NZOC and chef de mission Nigel Avery declined to respond to the Herald's question, when asked if this was a matter of Lombardi going rogue, or something more sinister and pre-planned.\n\n\"It's a great question but we just don't know,\" said Avery. \"We know an amount of information and are investigating further.\"\n\nThe drama started on 11:40pm on Tuesday night with the NZOC press release. The Herald had heard rumours of something happening in Saint Eitenne on Tuesday afternoon but was unable to confirm exactly what.\n\nNZOC head of communications Ashley Abbott defended the process, when asked why it had taken so long to inform the public and media.\n\nIt takes a while to be able to understand exactly what had happened,\" said Abbott. \"On the 22nd, a drone was flown over the New Zealand team football training, in Saint Etienne. The New Zealand team support staff noticed the drone and reported it to the police. That person was detained.\"\n\nAbbott said Team Canada confirmed that Monday's footage had been used for scouting purposes. Meanwhile, the NZOC want answers from Canada, and have lodged the incident with the IOC integrity unit.\n\n\"This incident is against that we stand for, with our values, with our commitment to an even and fair field of play,\" said Avery. It's not the topic we want to be talking about. Extremely disappointed and shocked, Integrity is one of our five key pillars. It's also taking away from us from an energy perspective. Concerned about our team; haven't had a smooth buildup so far and this is another thing to overcome.\"\n\nAbbott and Avery said there had been numerous meetings with the Canada Olympic Committee - they have apologised to us, they are deeply embarrassed, shocked.\"\n\nThey didn't want to speculate on possible outcomes - saying that the IOC will go through their own processes..\n\nAvery also said it was quite complex. \"It wasn't in the field of play, it's wrong to speculate.\"\n\nThere have been other security breaches using drones in France, but they have been related to teams going outside their training zone. Drones are not permitted at all in Paris but are allowed in most of the other venues, including where the Football Ferns and Oly-Whites are based.\n\nAbbott said the footage from Monday was around five minutes, though it could have been longer. \"That footage is with police.\"\n\nIt's a bit of a riddle why Canada even bothered. They are the reigning Games champions while the Ferns are relative minnows, only here via one of the easiest Olympic qualification paths in world sport (playing amateur Oceania teams). New Zealand hasn't beaten Canada since 1987, and have been on the wrong end of some heavy scorelines since then.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"},

The COC added in a statement released at 1:24 a.m. local time that assistant coach Andy Spence will lead the defending gold medallists for the remainder of the tournament. Canada's camp was thrown into disarray this week after two team staffers were sent home for allegedly using a drone to spy on a New Zealand practice. Priestman denied any involvement, but did not attend Thursday's 2-1 victory over New Zealand as FIFA - soccer's world governing body - and the International Olympic Committee investigate. Canada Soccer CEO and general secretary Kevin Blue said in the COC release \"additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\" He added Priestman is suspended from her duties until the end of the tournament and the completion of the organization's independent external review.

An uncredited Canadian women's national team member recently flew a drone over New Zealand's practice. The issue, however, was not an isolated incident. The drone interrupted the Football Ferns' training on two separate days.\n\nTeam New Zealand contacted French authorities and Olympic officials following the second incident. An investigation remains ongoing, but authorities quickly apprehended the drone operator. As a result, the Canadian member and an assistant coach have both been removed from the team.\n\nCanada's head coach, Beverly Priestman, also recently announced that she would not be on the sidelines for the upcoming matchup between the two teams. Canada faces New Zealand in their opening 2024 Olympics game on Thursday.\n\nDespite the self-imposed suspension, New Zealand Football CEO Andrew Pragnell is calling for more regarding the situation. The executive claims to have contacted FIFA directly and asked the governing body to take \"urgent action\" on the matter.\n\n\"There is no place for this type of action in football and it is critical that urgent action is undertaken to address this integrity breach,\" Pragnell said in a statement released on Thursday.\n\n\"To hear now that the Canadian team had filmed secret footage of our team training at least twice is incredibly concerning and if not treated urgently could have wider implications for the integrity of the tournament.\"\n\n\"We note that there have been some admissions by the Canadian National Olympic Committee, and they have taken their own sanctions against the Canadian team, however, considering the seriousness of the situation, and the potential implications to the sporting integrity of the entire tournament, we have referred the matter to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee seeking urgent action.\"\n\nWhile FIFA investigates the issue, the drone operator in question has already received their punishment from French police. According to reports, authorities arrested the uncredited team Canada member earlier in the week. Authorities confiscated the drone and found video of New Zealand's practice from two different days. Police say that the footage \"would have allowed him to know the tactics of the opposing team.\"\n\nThe Canadian drone operator picked up an eight-month suspended prison sentence for their actions. A suspended sentence means that the offender likely will not serve the aforementioned time in jail. Instead, it works almost like probation. If the defendant goes on to break similar laws in the near future, they could serve out their sentence behind bars. The move is typically a deterrent against future potential crimes.\n\nCanada and New Zealand face off on Thursday, July 25 in Saint-Etienne. The matchup is likely to be contentious and will be immensely important to both sides. The two teams are in Group A alongside hosts France. FIFA currently ranks Les Bleues second in the world. They are one of the tournament's favorites as the host. Losing Thursday's game would put either Canada or New Zealand behind the eight-ball in the competition.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Priestman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bev Priestman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Team New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_women's_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand women's national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_women's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada women's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_ice_hockey_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national ice hockey team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(punishment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (punishment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_sentence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suspended sentence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://worldsoccertalk.com/api/request-image/?proxy=https://ds-images.bolavip.com/news/image?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.worldsoccertalk.com%2Fjpg%2Ffull%2FWST_20240725_WST_518317_Beverly-Priestman-Canada-Women.jpg[ampersand]width=1200[ampersand]height=740", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 2776, "textEnd": 2783}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

According to The Telegraph's report, Canadian team staff allegedly recorded training of their rivals, New Zealand, against whom defending champions Canada will play their opening game. After France authorities detained the staff on grounds of unfair activities, the team's head coach withdrew from the opening game and the two accused staff members were sent back immediately.\n\nCanada' Olympic authorities also apologized following the capture of the team's staff by France authorities, which has now become a point of controversy, right before the commencement of the Paris Olympics 2024.\n\nCanadian Olympic Committee (COC) recently issued a public statement apologizing for this incident and has acknowledged the detaining of a 'non-accredited' team staff, following a complaint by New Zealand Football, says The Telegraph's report. Meanwhile Canadian coach Priestman claimed that he would recuse himself from coaching the team for the upcoming match keeping in mind the standards of integrity in sports.\n\nFIFA, has also, reportedly, opened an investigation into this incident against Canada Soccer, administrators, the detained staff as well as the team's coach. A disciplinary committee is seriously looking into the allegations and complaints around the use of unfair means during such a prestigious event like the Paris Olympics.\n\nMeanwhile, there are also claims that at least six flying drones are being intercepted by French authorities everyday, according to a statement by French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, mostly around the sites where the main events are to take place. These drones are majorly operated by tourists who want an eagle eye view on the proceedings of the Paris Olympics 2024, while forgetting that there is a strict ban on flying drones near the Paris Olympics premises.\n\nWhat is the spy drone allegation at the Paris Olympics all about?\n\nThe Paris Olympics 2024, where Canada's women's football team is set to participate, was tainted with allegations of spy drone being used by Canadian staff, to record training footage of their opening match opponents, New Zealand.\n\nIs Canada's women's football team a medal contender?\n\nThe Canadian women's football team is a strong medal contender this time too, as last time in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, they were medal winners.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Attal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Attal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Soccer_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Soccer Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of France"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112017089,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-2350,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Though Priestman will miss the opening match against New Zealand, disciplinary actions were taken against two staff members.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) is confident women's soccer head coach Bev Priestman had no knowledge of the spying incident that has engulfed her squad in scandal ahead of their gold medal title defense at the Paris Olympics. The COC said on Wednesday it accepted Priestman's decision to remove herself from Thursday's opening match against New Zealand while two Canadian team staff members were sent home amid allegations of drone use at two New Zealand practices.\n\nDavid Shoemaker, the CEO of the COC, was asked repeatedly during an online media availability how Priestman avoided suspension and why he was comfortable with her resuming her coaching duties after Thursday's game. \"I was persuaded by the fact that Bev Priestman had no involvement, no knowledge in the incident,\" Shoemaker told reporters. \"Those who had the direct involvement in the incident we removed from Team Canada.\n\n\"There is no room for that in Team Canada. It doesn't conform to our standards of fair play and our values at the Canadian Olympic Committee.\" Shoemaker said if any facts were to become known in the future suggesting Priestman was involved then the COC reserves the right to impose further sanctions.\n\nCanada Soccer is launching an independent external review into the matter while global soccer's governing body FIFA has begun disciplinary proceedings. Shoemaker also said he felt there was no need for Priestman to miss more than one game since, according to him, she was not in possession of any footage from New Zealand's training sessions.\n\n\"We thought about all the repercussions for Bev,\" said Shoemaker. \"At the end of the day the drone footage related to the filming of two New Zealand practices remained in the hands of the pilot of the drone and the advantage that I guess was intended to be obtained was not obtained.\" Shoemaker also said that while he is not aware of any calls for the women's team to be disqualified from the Olympics he did say New Zealand Football registered a complaint to FIFA, asking that Canada not be awarded any points if they win on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Priestman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bev Priestman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_ice_hockey_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national ice hockey team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Soccer_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Soccer Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/22_07_2020_11_18_31_0109211.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

She was an assistant on the 2021 gold medal-winning team in Tokyo and a former kinesiology student at the University of British Columbia, Mander began her coaching career as a teenager, attending a FIFA regional coaching workshop in Canada in 2014.\n\nMander's brother, Amar Mander, is reportedly a team physiotherapist for the New Zealand women's team.\n\nAhead of the Paris 2024 Olympics opening soccer match between Canada WNT and the New Zealand WNT, Canadian coaching staff and team analyst Joseph Lombardi was caught and arrested for spying on the opposing team during one of their training sessions. According to a statement from the New Zealand Olympic Committee, Jitka Klimkova's side had reported to police after they spotted a drone flying near their training ground. The French authorities eventually responded and quickly detained the pilot, who was later identified as Lombardi.\n\nJoseph Lombardi is a Canadian soccer coach who was born on May 24, 1981 in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. Lombardi is one of the coaching staff members of the Canadian WNT, working as a technical coach under Bev Priestman. Joseph earned his Canada Soccer Coaching B Diploma in 2006, and then his Canada Soccer Coaching A Diploma in 2009.\n\nJoseph Lombardi is currently 43 years old and stands at a height of 173 cm.\n\nAfter obtaining his coaching certifications, Lombardi served as a regional coach with the Ontario Soccer Association, He later served as a coach for the Canada Soccer women's national youth program in 2012. During this time, he made contributions to six FIFA youth tournaments from 2012 to 2022.\n\nHe also notably served as a part of the team staff at the latest FIFA Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand back in 2023. Lombardi was most recently serving as a technical coach under Bev Priestman for the Canada Women's national team. Aside from his roles with the WNT, Lombardi has also worked for the CanMNT. He served under former coach John Herdman and Eric Tenllado for the U15s.\n\nParis authorities have previously issued a strict no-drone flying policy around the city and some specific places. As such, the French police have booked Joseph Lombardi for \"flying an unmanned aircraft over a prohibited area.\" Moreover, Lombardi himself admitted to the wrongdoing. Following the turn of events, authorities have sentenced to 8 months in jail along with a \u20ac45,000 fine.\n\nInterestingly, the Canadian coach had previously flew the drone on July 19 as well. Following further investigations, authorities found out that another assistant coach named Jasmine Mander was also involved. As a result, she got removed from the team. Jasmine is a native of Richmond, B.C. and played a key role in the 2021 gold medal-winning team in Tokyo.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsgrail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsGrail"},

But with the stadium emptied, VAR referees determined the play was offside, ruling out the goal.\n\nThe contentious game then resumed in an empty stadium.\n\nArgentina head coach Javier Mascherano referred to the fiasco as a \"circus,\" according to The Athletic -- a sentiment that Argentine soccer legend Lionel Messi appeared to echo in an Instagram Story.\n\nThe Olympic Games formally kick off on Friday, with the Opening Ceremony starting at 1:30 p.m. ET.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nDit artikel is oorspronkelijk verschenen op z24.nl", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "geoff_weiss@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Geoff Weiss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Olympic_Committee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Olympic Committee"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Priestman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bev Priestman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Mascherano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Javier Mascherano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66a26f012d66759f66fe4775?format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Women's Soccer Team Days Before Olympic Showdown", "body": "Canada's women's soccer team is gearing up to defend its gold medal at the Olympics in Paris, but some major drama is already brewing after a staffer was caught using a drone to spy on New Zealand's squad ahead of their upcoming matchup.\n\nIn 2021, Canada's women's soccer team headed to Tokyo hoping to improve on the back-to-back bronze medals they managed to secure in London and Rio and managed to do exactly that by staging an impressive run that ended with them topping Sweden in a shootout in the gold medal game.\n\nAs a result, expectations are pretty high heading into the 2024 Summer Olympics, but things took a very interesting turn thanks to what unfolded in France on Monday.\n\nCanada and New Zealand will kick off the women's tournament when they face off at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in the city of Saint-Etienne on Thursday in a game where the team from the Great White North is listed as the heavy favorite (New Zealand failed to exit the group stage in Japan, and its quarterfinals appearance in London remains its best Olympics result to date).\n\nAccording to the National Post, we have a fresh new SpyGate on our hands after New Zealand spotted a drone hovering over its practice session on Monday before alerting police, who were able to track down the operator who was identified as a \"non-accredited\" member of Canada's support staff.\n\nNew Zealand understandably decided to file a complaint with the integrity committee operated by the IOC, and while they haven't taken any official action as of this writing, the Canadian Olympic Committee swiftly dismissed the staffer in question (as well as assistant coach Jasmine Mander) after discovering a drone had also been used for similar purposes last week.\n\nCanada head coach Bev Priestman also issued a self-imposed punishment by announcing she won't be on the sidelines when her team faces off against New Zealand and also issued a formal apology.\n\nIf this is any indication of what's to come, we're in for a very spicy Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But this Olympics scandal isn't going away", "body": "SAINT \u00c9TIENNE, France -- New Zealand women's soccer coach Michael Mayne didn't blame the loss on Canada's spying scandal, which was pretty decent of him. New Zealand went up 1-0 on a shocking early corner, surrendered a goal right before the half -- \"coach killer,\" Mayne called it, grimly -- and gave up the winner in the 79th minute to Evelyne Viens. Canada beat New Zealand 2-1 to open their Olympics as defending gold medallists, because Canada always beats New Zealand. Like, pretty much always.\n\nThe Star In Paris Opinion Bruce Arthur: Canada got caught flying a drone over a soccer practice. So why is Bev Priestman still the coach?\n\nRelieving the women's coach of her duties would require the confidence that she is in charge of her staff, which shouldn't be much of a leap. But\n\nAnd Mayne acknowledged the scandal was tough for his players. He, like them, was disappointed in Canada. He was asked about Canada coach Bev Priestman's story, which is that a member of her staff decided to spy on another team without telling the head coach, twice. Mayne was asked what would he would do if that happened on his staff.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"Yeah, it wouldn't,\" said Mayne. He's an affable, bearlike, unshaven bloke, but he was deadly serious about that.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThis was the game Priestman offered to sit out after Canada staffer Joey Lombardi was arrested and convicted of flying a drone over the stadium while the Kiwis were practicing. Lombardi and his direct superior, assistant coach Jasmine Mander, were kicked off the team and sent home. The Canadian Olympic Committee accepted Priestman's explanation, which was that she didn't tell her staff to spy on another team.\n\nWhich means in the best-case scenario, Priestman lost control of her staff to an alarming degree. In the slightly worse scenario, she created an environment where she didn't HAVE to tell her assistants to spy on other teams, even at the Olympics.\n\nAnd of course, that leaves the worst-case scenario, which is that of course Priestman knew, that this was not a one-off event, and that if you are spying on a New Zealand team that Canada hasn't lost to since 1987, then maybe you just spy on pretty much anybody. Maybe, on a team whose budget was never too generous and which has recently been cut, you do anything you can to gain an edge.\n\nThis also doubles, unfortunately, as the most likely scenario. Priestman still hasn't been asked how in the world she couldn't have known.\n\nBecause this would be an embarrassment for any Canadian Olympic team, but it's worse when it's the defending champions. That gold medal was the high point in Canadian soccer history. It's been a rough couple years -- at war with their federation over equal treatment and compensation, budget and staff cuts, testimony before Parliament, a lawsuit, all as extra sponsorship and broadcasting money is sucked away by a brutally limiting long-term contract that Canada Soccer signed two years before she took the job. According to sources, Priestman nearly left late last year: there were rumours she was a candidate to coach Team USA, and also looked at at least one pro job.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut that gold medal in Tokyo happened, and now this team has been tarnished in some people's eyes; it doesn't matter if everybody cheats, because not everyone got caught at the Olympics, and Canada did. For the record, the interim coach, assistant Andy Spence, said he had no knowledge of the spying scheme. Mayne, for his part, said the corner that New Zealand scored on wasn't new: it was part of the package the Ferns had worked on during one of the spying sessions. He noted that he couldn't alter too much, anyway.\n\nOlympics And Paralympics Canada's soccer drone scandal is wild. There's been plenty of wacky and weird Olympic drama over the years\n\nPooping in a river. Faking a motorcycle crash. Being attacked by a priest. The Olympics have a long history of bizarre scandals.\n\n\"We had one (practice) session, you can't change too much: it's next to impossible,\" said the Ferns coach. \"So you can tweak a couple things. But the reality is, it's like, do we change a lot and maybe come out and not be as prepared?\"\n\nLook, Canada was better: bigger, faster, more skilled, more cohesive. Clo\u00e9 Lacasse finished a one-touch passing symphony from Ashley Lawrence, Jesse Fleming, and Nichelle Prince just before halftime, and you could almost see Canada exhale. The second half was dominant, and Fleming finally sent a long-distance ball right on the money to Viens for the winner. Mayne gave Canada full marks, as did his players.\n\nBut he was also asked if it felt like the integrity of the competition had been compromised, and he said, \"It's hard not to have that feeling. It is hard.\"\n\nMake no mistake: Priestman has been a jewel in this country, on and off the field. It wasn't just John Herdman who built the program back from the dark ages. Priestman has succeeded under difficult circumstances.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut this scandal isn't going away. There's a FIFA investigation, and a Canada Soccer investigation, and if the Canadian Olympic Committee hadn't been bowled over by Priestman's denial of responsibility behind the scenes -- her indignation, her embarrassment, her conviction -- then the COC might have made sure her presence didn't tar whatever this team does here.\n\nBut when she coaches again at these Games, it will.",

It's all over a reported drone scandal!\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics hasn't even officially started and there's already an alleged cheating scandal. Drones were spotted flying over closed practices sessions leading to an investigation. Now, the defending Gold Medal champions could be in some trouble!\n\nWhy Is Canada Women's Soccer Coach Stepping Down From Opener?\n\nThe Summer Olympics are always a great watch. You get the track and field events, basketball, gymnastics, swimming, and more! One of those sports included under said \"more\" category would be soccer. In the Tokyo Olympics, the Canada women's soccer team captured the Gold Medal defeating Sweden in the Finals. However, their road to a repeat just got a little more difficult.\n\nAccording to AP News, an investigation was started after New Zealand complained about drones flying over their closed practice sessions earlier in the week. Following the investigation, two staff members on Canada women's soccer team, Assistant Coach Jasmine Mander and analyst Joseph Lombardi, were sent home, per AP. Now, Coach Bev Priestman is reportedly voluntarily removing herself from the opener against New Zealand in the name of sportsmanship. Assistant Coach Andy Spence will lead the team in Bev's absence.\n\nPriestman tells AP, \"By no means did I direct the individuals. I'm still learning the details and obviously this is all unfolding. But again, I think the important thing right now is to look forward, put the actions in place and take the sanctions.\" The Associated Press reports that a French court sentenced a 43-year-old Canadian man to an 8-months suspended sentence for filming 2 of New Zealand's training sessions with a drone. That man identified himself as an independent sports analyst for the Canadian federation.\n\nInterestingly, this isn't the first time a drone with a Canada connection has been spotted filming a practice session. The Associated Press reports Honduras had to stop a training session in 2021 in Toronto because a drone was spotted flying above the pitch. Canadians are supposed to be famous for being kind and friendly. This doesn't seem to fit that description. It's good to see Canada taking the Olympics seriously and clearly they want to win some medals. However, you have to win them honorably! Otherwise, you'll have to wait for the Winter Olympics in 2 years so you can win that Hockey Gold.", "source": {"uri": "wrif.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRIF Rocks Detroit"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cort_freeman@wrif.com", "name": "Cort Freeman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_women's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada women's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Priestman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bev Priestman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winter Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honduras"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Honduras"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://content.bbgi.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2024/07/GettyImages-1332698510_1721913771_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

In that case, the source said, a Canadian contractor was caught attempting to film a private Panama training and a complaint was made by the Panamanian Football Federation to Canada Soccer and to Concacaf, the soccer confederation that governs the sport in North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nThe historical spying allegations come with the Canada's women's soccer team program under intense scrutiny at the Olympics in Paris.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee said on Wednesday that assistant coach Jasmine Mander and analyst Joseph Lombardi had left the team and returned to Canada after Lombardi was caught using a drone to spy on two of New Zealand's closed training sessions. On Thursday, Canada beat New Zealand 2-1 in their Olympic tournament opener.\n\nLombardi was caught by French police on Monday, after they saw him retrieve a drone that had been flying over the New Zealand team's training, The Globe and Mail reported. The Globe reported that police retrieved footage of a second New Zealand training session from the drone and also obtained text messages between Lombardi and Mander. The text messages reportedly showed that Mander was aware of Lombardi's activities.\n\n\"This is awful, the worst-case scenario,\" said Amy Walsh, a former women's national team player who now co-hosts a podcast about soccer called Footy Prime. \"I feel sick to my stomach, genuinely nauseated. I understand when you get to a high-level people will be ruthless and do whatever they can to gain a competitive advantage but this is so far over the line.\n\n\"The players are benefitting from the coaches cheating. There's a certain amount of blind trust players have that coaches are doing things the right way and this is the ultimate betrayal.\"\n\nStaff and contractors connected to the men's national team have also filmed the closed training sessions of competitors, one of the sources told TSN, adding that Canada used a drone to record a U.S. training session before a Nov. 15, 2019, game in Florida. The U.S. won that game 4-1.\n\nTwo years later, Honduras stopped a training session in Toronto during World Cup qualifiers after someone spotted a drone overhead.\n\n\"I'd imagine there's probably a lot of people in Canada that fly drones, I'm sure,\" then-Canada coach John Herdman said at the time. \"And when a big team like Honduras turn up I'm sure people are probably interested in what they're doing when they come into our country. So I know for sure we won't be heading into people's countries too early because with drones these days, people can obviously capture footage. You've got to be really careful. So yeah, you got to be careful in CONCACAF. It's a tricky place.\"\n\nSome staff and contractors were told the filming was part of their jobs and that they could lose their positions with the federation if they did not go along with the demands, one of the sources said in a series of interviews with TSN on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\"In a couple of scenarios, people have been pushed and have been told, 'You have to give 110 percent and this is part of the job so if you don't feel comfortable with doing this, you do not have a place on the team',\" the source said. \"It's not something that's talked about and it's not something there are a lot of text messages about because of how sensitive this is. Some of the people who have had to do the filming or review the filming have said to a few staff members how uncomfortable it was for them.\"\n\nBoth sources asked for anonymity because they said they were afraid the federation would retaliate against them. It's unclear whether any players were aware of the strategy to record practices.\n\nOne of the sources said the spying included a Team Canada coach filming two of Japan's closed-door training sessions during the 2021 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Canada tied Japan 1-1 in its first game during those Olympics.\n\n\"It was a little bit tricky during that time, given the fact that we were under a lot more restrictions, but there were ways to kind of sneak out of the hotel without people knowing,\" the source told TSN. \"In Tokyo, a lot of the facilities were a little bit more open so in some cases, you could see from behind bushes or behind fences or behind trees. It wasn't that complicated, because they didn't have the big mesh walls. So as long as you were close enough to the facility, you're able to see if you're in a hidden location.\"\n\nThe source said they weren't aware if spying occurred in other games during those Olympics.\n\nTwo years after the Tokyo Olympics, a Canada Soccer contractor who was scheduled to travel to Australia for the 2023 World Cup was told their responsibilities would include trying to record training sessions of opposing teams. When the contractor said they wouldn't agree to do that, their trip was canceled and a Canada Soccer staff member flew there in their place to do the recording, the source said.\n\nTSN has reviewed text message correspondence of a women's national team coach discussing secret filming of their opponents' training sessions ahead of games in 2022 against Costa Rica, South Korea and Trinidad.\n\nOne of the sources said the strategy for filming opposing teams' practices in Canada was relatively easy because Canada Soccer staff knew where they were practicing and what hotels they were staying in.\n\n\"When you're abroad, it requires a little bit more research. When you are in Concacaf events, you do have the ability of finding out where the rest of the teams are training because Concacaf, FIFA, and the Olympics, they all publish where the teams are training in one way or another,\" the source said. \"You also know just by looking at the social medias from the other teams and seeing what pictures they are posting.\"\n\nBoth sources said there is a lot to be learned from filming an opponent's practice.\n\n\"You get to know their formations, their starting lineup,\" one of the sources said. \"You also look at who is taking a penalty kick and their set pieces.\"\n\n\"Most people see this as cheating, which it is,\" one of the sources said. \"Some of our coaches just see it as a competitive advantage and justify it by saying everyone does it, which is also not true. Not everyone cheats and neither should we.\"\n\nIn an interview on Wednesday with a CBC reporter, women's team head coach Bev Priestman did not answer directly when she was asked if she was aware of the drone filming.\n\n\"On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologize to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada. This does not represent the values that our team stands for,\" Priestman said in a statement on Wednesday. \"I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program. Accordingly, to emphasize our team's commitment to integrity, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match on Thursday. In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld.\" Both FIFA and Canada Soccer announced investigations into the allegations of spying on Wednesday. Canada Soccer said its investigation would be conducted by an independent third party and would focus on the drone incident in France and more broadly, the historical ethical practices of both the men's and women's national team programs. The investigation findings will be made public, Canada Soccer said.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Probably not, given their long history of judging corruption, state boycotts and widespread doping.\n\nBut the news which broke on Tuesday, three days before the opening ceremony and hours before the first action in the 2024 Games' football tournament, meant that the cherished Olympic values of fair play stood in tatters even before organisers emblazoned that message across the Parisien sky and the River Seine.\n\nThat it was Canada who performed such an egregious breach of the rules -- by all stereotypes a country known for its people being polite, respectful, laidback and just terribly nice -- only adds to the ironic drama.\n\nThere are five rings in the Olympic logo -- take just two of them intertwined, and they resemble a pair of binoculars.\n\nSo this is what happened...\n\nOn Tuesday, at a training session ahead of their opening match of the group stage in Saint-Etienne on Thursday, staff members from the New Zealand women's football team noticed a drone hovering above them.\n\nThey called the on-site police, who detained the device's operator, who was later revealed to be a staff member from the Canadian team, the reigning Olympic women's champions, and their opponents in that opener today.\n\nIn an initial statement, the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) apologised -- but more was to come.\n\nThe following day, it became clear that there had been two drone incidents, with the other taking place five days earlier, on July 19. Now facing severe sanctions, the COC needed to act.\n\nJoseph Lombardi, an \"unaccredited analyst\", and Jasmine Mander, a member of the coaching staff who oversees Lombardi, have been removed from the team and sent home and Canada's English head coach Beverly Priestman has voluntarily stepped down from being on the touchline for the New Zealand game.\n\n\"On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologize to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada,\" Priestman said. \"This does not represent the values that our team stand for.\"\n\nThat final sentence is a little difficult to justify, given that spying on another team's training is hardly an accidental action -- nobody finds themselves flying a $2,000 piece of tech over their next opponents -- twice -- by mistake. Rather, it comes as a product of culture and command.\n\n\"I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program,\" Priestman added. \"Accordingly, to emphasize our team's commitment to integrity, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match on Thursday. In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld.\"\n\nThis may be new to the Olympics -- but spying in football is old business.\n\nTeams sending scouts to watch the next side they are going to play at training probably predates the invention of the offside rule. In fairness, though, we do not know if ancient Olympian Theagenes of Thasos sent emissaries to watch Arrichion of Phigalia working on his moves.\n\nIn international football, France men's manager Didier Deschamps noticed a drone above his players as they trained at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil -- it was never discovered which, if any, of their group-stage rivals Ecuador, Honduras and Switzerland it belonged to.\n\nGo back two more decades and ahead of a vital away World Cup qualifier against Norway in 1993, England manager Graham Taylor was so convinced his team were being watched that he moved their training base to a military facility. The issue? That new location was near the house of the chief sportswriter of one of Norway's leading newspapers, who subsequently published their tactics the next morning. England lost, 2-0, in Oslo, ended up missing out on the 1994 World Cup, and Taylor got sacked.\n\nSimilarly, in a case of paranoia outweighing perspective, the Chilean football federation once sent up their own device to destroy a drone hovering over their session before a match against Argentina. It was perhaps football's first case of aerial warfare since Roy Keane's infamous tackle on Alfie Haaland. In this case, it turned out the questionable drone was a surveying tool being used by a Chilean telecommunications company.\n\nBut there is one example of spying which did emanate from South America -- when, in early 2019, Leeds United's Argentine head coach Marcelo Bielsa admitted sending an intern to watch the following weekend's opponents Derby County work on their formation, set pieces and so on. It was not the first time.\n\n\"We watched training sessions of all the opponents before we played them,\" Bielsa, now Uruguay's head coach said. In Argentina, this practice was common apparently, and one he had continued after coming to work in Europe.\n\nDerby and Frank Lampard, their manager at the time, were furious. When Bielsa rang the former Chelsea and England midfielder to explain himself, there was no apology -- but instead, in broken English, he attempted to remove any ambiguity around the circumstances.\n\nLeeds won the ensuing match, 2-0 -- and the following week, Bielsa held an unprecedented press conference for local journalists, 66 minutes long, in which he used a PowerPoint presentation to demonstrate the full extent of the analysis he carried out on opposition clubs.\n\nFor Bielsa, who held open training sessions throughout his time at Athletic Bilbao in Spain, watching teams going through their tactical preparations like this was not spying, but simply gathering information.\n\nIt was later pointed out by Leeds fans that, as a player, Lampard has been part of a Chelsea side which profited from similar, um, info-gathering missions.\n\nIn an interview with UK newspaper the Telegraph, former Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas admitted that, in his time as an assistant at the London club under Jose Mourinho, he would \"travel to training grounds, often incognito, and look at our opponents' mental and physical state before drawing my conclusions\". Chelsea won the Premier League title twice with Mourinho and Villas-Boas in situ.\n\nGiven the amount of information that rival clubs can draw on, some coaches are simply not too bothered by allegations of spying. In 2018, German Bundesliga side Werder Bremen used a drone to spy on Hoffenheim -- but Hoffenheim's coach Julian Nagelsmann, now manager of Germany's national team, brushed off its impact.\n\n\"I'm not really angry at the analyst doing his job,\" Nagelsmann said, before adding it was \"commendable\" that Bremen were going to such lengths to try to win.\n\nSimilarly, in the aftermath of the Leeds incident, former striker Gary Taylor-Fletcher recalled an incident from his Lincoln City side's 2003-04 League Two play-off semi-final second leg away to Huddersfield Town.\n\nWhile the Lincoln players were receiving their half-time team talk, Taylor-Fletcher tweeted, a polystyrene ceiling tile broke and then fell down -- revealing the sizable heft of longtime Huddersfield kit man Andy Brook listening from the cavity above. Lincoln went on to lose the tie, while their opponents lost their dignity -- but did end up getting promoted. And Taylor-Fletcher can't have been too annoyed because, a year later, he left Lincoln for... Huddersfield.\n\nFootball is not alone in this sort of espionage -- and other sports can be much more high-tech.\n\nThe McLaren Formula 1 team were given the largest fine in sporting history -- $100million -- and thrown out of the sport's 2007 Constructors' Championship after senior engineer Mike Coughlan received technical design documents which had been leaked from rivals Ferrari.\n\nThere have also been several high-profile incidents in American football.\n\nAlso in 2007, the New England Patriots, the most successful NFL team of recent years with six Super Bowl wins since the turn of the century, were punished for recording the defensive signals given to players during a game by coaches of the New York Jets. New England's legendary head coach Bill Belichick was fined $500,000 -- the maximum allowed by the league, and the most in NFL history -- while the team were denied their first-round pick in the following year's player draft.\n\nDoes cheating prosper? Well, New England won all 16 games in the 2007 regular season -- but were surprisingly beaten in the Super Bowl by the New York Giants.\n\nAnd it's not just the professionals in the gridiron game. Last October, the University of Michigan's head coach Jim Harbaugh was suspended over a similar sign-stealing scandal which quickly escalated to involve allegations also levelled at several other college teams. Harbaugh was banned for several games, but Michigan went on to win the U.S. college national championship on his return. Harbaugh has since moved on to become head coach of the NFL's Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nSo this is the bottom line: teams cheat.\n\nIn a multimillion (or even billion) dollar/pound/euro industry, marginal gains like those detailed here are worth the risk of detection. For every Canada, Leeds and Michigan caught, there are clubs and sides whose operatives get away with it.\n\nWidespread but not necessarily endemic, it is both serious and not serious, funny and infuriating, the natural by-product of a game being taken as lifeblood.\n\nBack in the ancient Olympics, contemporary accounts reveal athletes being bribed to say they were from certain city-states rather than others -- facing a potential punishment of public flogging if they were caught.\n\nThings have not really changed -- and the punishment, at least to the guilty party's public reputation, is not so different either.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_whitehead@nytimes.com", "name": "Jacob Whitehead", "type":

It doesn't conform to our standards of fair play and our values at the Canadian Olympic Committee.\"\n\nShoemaker said if any facts were to become known in the future suggesting Priestman was involved then the COC reserves the right to impose further sanctions.\n\nCanada Soccer is launching an independent external review into the matter while global soccer's governing body FIFA has begun disciplinary proceedings.\n\nShoemaker also said he felt there was no need for Priestman to miss more than one game since, according to him, she was not in possession of any footage from New Zealand's training sessions.\n\n\"We thought about all the repercussions for Bev,\" said Shoemaker. \"At the end of the day the drone footage related to the filming of two New Zealand practices remained in the hands of the pilot of the drone and the advantage that I guess was intended to be obtained was not obtained.\"\n\nShoemaker also said that while he is not aware of any calls for the women's team to be disqualified from the Olympics he did say New Zealand Football registered a complaint to FIFA, asking that Canada not be awarded any points if they win on Thursday.\n\n(Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Toby Davis)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_ice_hockey_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national ice hockey team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Priestman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bev Priestman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(punishment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (punishment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Soccer_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Soccer Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/theprint_default_image_new.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757777", "eventUri": "eng-9757777", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 100, "relevance": 1}

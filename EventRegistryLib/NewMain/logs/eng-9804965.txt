The rapper, who recently announced that she is expecting her third child with estranged husband Offset, shared the details of the incident on X Spaces.\n\n\"I was going down the stairs, and I slipped a little,\" Cardi B explained. \"I practically fell, but I was trying to prevent myself from falling, so I was holding myself on the railing. My foot still slipped, and I kind of busted my a*s.\" Despite her efforts to prevent a full fall, the impact was significant. \"I felt a weird jerk, like a pop, and I couldn't get up really.\"\n\nThe incident occurred shortly before the artist publicly revealed her pregnancy on August 1, just one day after filing for divorce from Offset. Cardi B, who is already a mother to 6-year-old daughter Kulture Kiari and 2-year-old son Wave Set, was left in immense pain following the fall. She described feeling a sharp pain in the area where she is carrying the baby, which caused her concern.\n\nAfter falling asleep, Cardi B awoke to a terrifying realization. \"I couldn't move my bottom at all,\" she said. \"Like, just moving my feet was hurting the bottom of my stomach. I couldn't move.\" Alarmed by her condition, she went to the hospital, where doctors discovered that she had torn a ligament in her pelvis.\"I dilated, and I was having contractions every two minutes for a whole 24 hours,\" Cardi B revealed. The medical team monitored her closely as she endured intense pain and was unable to move for two days straight. To ensure the safety of both mother and child, Cardi B was advised to stay in bed and undergo physical therapy.\n\nThe news of Cardi B's third pregnancy surprised fans, especially given the recent turbulence in her relationship with Offset. The couple, who married in 2017, has had a rocky journey, including a previous divorce filing in September 2020 that was later called off. However, the July 2024 divorce filing suggests that their relationship is again on uncertain ground.\n\nCardi B took to Instagram to announce her third pregnancy, sharing the joyous news with her millions of followers. The post, which featured a stunning photo of Cardi cradling her baby bump, quickly went viral, garnering an outpouring of love and support from fans and fellow celebrities. \"With every ending comes a new beginning! I am so grateful to have shared this season with you, you have brought me more love, more life and most of all renewed my power! Reminded me that I can have it all! You've reminded me that I never have to choose between life, love, and my passion! I love you so much and can not wait for you to witness what you helped me accomplish, what you pushed me to do! It's so much easier taking life's twists, turns and test laying down, but you, your brother and your sister have shown me why it's worth it to push through!\" she wrote.\n\nPage Six confirmed that Cardi B had filed for divorce. While there have been rumors of Offset infidelities, it appears like the split was mutual and amicable, with sources claiming the couple had been growing apart. \"That's what drove her to this decision more than anything else,\" said an insider. This is something she wants to do.\"\n\n\"It's not something that happened overnight... They've both been on the same page. There wasn't [pushback]. They've grown apart and that feeling has gotten stronger over time. It's become unavoidable.\"\n\nThe relationship seems complicated, but Cardi says they're best friends, making it even harder to split ways. When asked what she decided to do about the marriage, she told the outlet, \"We think it through because we love each other. It's not even about love. We're best friends. And it's like, 'OK. Well, there was a time that I didn't have a best friend, or I didn't have a support system.' It's not even about 'How do you leave a partner?'

THEY LIVE MORE COMFORTABLE THAN ME OMG,\" a third said.\n\nThe snap comes just one day after Cardi revealed she had a \"freak accident\" that almost \"cost\" her little one growing inside her belly. \"I had a f-cking freak accident. I don't know how something -- well, it wasn't little, it actually hurt,\" she said on a recent X Spaces chat, per People Magazine.\n\n\"It doesn't really happen often, but it become [sic] so big to the point I was literally paralyzed and that little thing almost cost me my little one to come.\"\n\nThe \"I Like It\" artist went on to explain, \"I was going down the stairs and I slipped a little. I practically fell, but I was trying to prevent myself from falling, so I was holding myself on the railing. My foot still slipped, and I kind of busted my a--.\"\n\n\"I felt a weird jerk, like a pop, and I couldn't get up really,\" she added. \"When I woke up, I couldn't move my bottom at all. Like, just moving my feet was hurting the bottom of my stomach. I couldn't move. I felt like paralyzed.\"\n\nFortunately, \"it didn't\" result in a pregnancy loss and she is \"feeling good\" since the incident. \"I came home, but I came home high as a kite,\" she said with a chuckle. \"Today, I woke up sober, honey. I'm dying, If I don't feel good in four hours, I'm going to the hospital and I don't give a f-ck.\"\n\n\"I'mma exaggerate this sh-t so I can get more morphine. Morphine me down! I don't give a damn,\" she said again.\n\nCardi B and Offset, who tied the knot in September 2017, have had their share of ups and downs over the years.\n\nTheir relationship hit a rough patch in late December 2018 when Offset's infidelity came to light, resulting in a short-lived separation. However, the couple reunited in early 2019, but the two have called it off as Cardi filed for divorce, aiming for primary custody of their kids--daughter, Kulture, 5, and a son, Wave, 2--and showing no signs of backing down.\n\n\"It's not something that happened overnight... They've both been on the same page. There wasn't [pushback]. They've grown apart and that feeling has gotten stronger over time. It's become unavoidable,\" a source who spoke to Page Six said.\n\nShortly after the news of her divorce filing broke, Cardi B announced she was expecting another child. \"With every ending comes a new beginning! I am so grateful to have shared this season with you, you have brought me more love, more life and most of all renewed my power!\" she wrote on Instagram at the time.\n\n\"Reminded me that I can have it all!

A few years ago, during an Instagram Live session, she confessed to drugging and robbing men while she worked as a stripper. At the time, there was a mix of outrage and indifference from the public. But now, with her recent comments, the discussion has been reignited with a ferocity that calls into question both her actions and the public's response.\n\nIt's not uncommon for celebrities to say things that spark controversy. After all, controversy often equals attention, and attention in the entertainment world can translate into fame and fortune. But when Cardi B boasts about drugging and robbing men, it raises questions about her understanding of morality and ethics.\n\nWhy does she feel it's acceptable to drug men, rob them, and then flaunt it as if it's something to be proud of? Is it a reflection of her past struggles, a way to reclaim power in a world that has often disempowered women like her? Or is it simply a lack of empathy, a complete disregard for the well-being of others in favor of her own survival and success?\n\nThe fact that she doesn't care about the men she victimized is troubling. It suggests a deep-seated rage or resentment towards men, which might stem from her own experiences with exploitation and objectification. But does that justify her actions? Absolutely not. While it's important to understand the context of someone's behavior, it doesn't excuse the harm they cause to others.\n\nOne of the most glaring issues in this situation is the double standard that seems to exist when it comes to holding celebrities accountable for their actions. If Cardi B were a man, there's no doubt that the public outcry would be much louder. Imagine a male rapper admitting to drugging and robbing women - the backlash would be immediate and severe. The media would crucify him, his career would likely be over, and the calls for legal action would be deafening.\n\nBut Cardi B, being a woman, seems to be granted a certain level of leniency. Some argue that this is because society still struggles to view women as perpetrators of serious crimes, especially against men. There's an underlying assumption that women, even those who commit crimes, are less dangerous and therefore less deserving of punishment. This is not only a disservice to the victims but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes about gender and violence.\n\nThe narrative that Cardi B's actions are somehow less serious because her victims were men who were allegedly soliciting sex is problematic. It suggests that these men \"deserved\" what happened to them because of their behavior. But no one deserves to be drugged, robbed, or taken advantage of, regardless of their actions. The idea that men are inherently less deserving of sympathy or protection is a dangerous one, and it only serves to further entrench gender biases in society.\n\nDespite her controversial statements and actions, Cardi B remains incredibly popular. She has a massive fan base that seems to support her no matter what she does or says. But why do people continue to support someone who openly admits to committing crimes and shows no remorse for her actions?\n\nPart of the reason might be her authenticity. Cardi B is known for being brutally honest about her life, her struggles, and her past. This honesty resonates with many people, especially those who have faced similar challenges. Her rise from poverty to superstardom is a classic rags-to-riches story, and her fans admire her for her resilience and tenacity.\n\nHowever, there's a fine line between being authentic and being reckless. While it's important to be true to oneself, it's equally important to recognize when one's actions are harmful to others. Cardi B's refusal to acknowledge the gravity of her actions and her blatant disregard for her victims' well-being is not something to be admired. It's a sign of a deeper issue that needs to be addressed, both within herself and within society as a whole.\n\nThe public's reaction to Cardi B's recent comments has been mixed, to say the least. On one hand, there are those who defend her, arguing that she's simply being real and that her actions were a result of the circumstances she found herself in. These fans often cite the fact that the men she targeted were allegedly soliciting sex from her, implying that they somehow deserved what happened to them.\n\nOne fan commented, \"I'm ok with that Cardi, do your thing.\" This type of response highlights a disturbing trend where criminal behavior is excused or even celebrated if it's committed by someone who is perceived as being \"real\" or \"authentic.\" It's as if being honest about one's actions somehow makes them less wrong.\n\nOthers, however, are not so forgiving. They point out the hypocrisy in the way Cardi B is treated compared to how a male celebrity would be treated in the same situation. \"She won't get canceled for this,\" one person wrote. \"Drugging and raping/robbing people is cool as long as women are doing it.\"\n\nThis sentiment reflects a growing frustration with the double standards that exist in society, particularly when it comes to issues of gender and accountability. Many people feel that if Cardi B were a man, her career would be over by now. But because she's a woman, she's allowed to get away with behavior that would be considered unforgivable if the roles were reversed.\n\nCardi B's comments also raise questions about her overall attitude towards men. Does she have a deep-seated rage towards men that is reflected in her actions and statements? Or does she simply not care about anyone's well-being but her own?\n\nSome have speculated that her behavior is a result of her experiences as a stripper, where she likely encountered countless men who saw her as nothing more than an object for their pleasure. It's possible that her actions were a way of reclaiming power in a situation where she felt powerless. But even if that's the case, it doesn't justify her behavior. Revenge, no matter how justified it may feel, is not an excuse for committing crimes.\n\nOthers believe that Cardi B's attitude is indicative of a larger societal problem, where people are increasingly willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead, regardless of who gets hurt in the process. In a world where success is often measured by wealth and fame, there's little room for morality or ethics. Cardi B's comments are a stark reminder of the dangers of this mindset and the harm it can cause.\n\nThe idea that it's somehow acceptable to harm others as long as they belong to a certain group is a dangerous one. Unfortunately, it's a mindset that seems to be gaining traction in today's society. One fan's comment, \"That's how a lot of women feel about men and I'm sure the number is increasing. Men are also more and more aware of that. Guess we'll have to see who wins the 'IDGAF about the other gender' Olympics,\" captures this sentiment perfectly.\n\nThere's a growing divide between men and women, fueled by a lack of understanding and empathy on both sides. This divide is only widened when public figures like Cardi B make comments that reinforce harmful stereotypes and encourage a lack of compassion for the opposite gender. Instead of fostering understanding and respect, these attitudes only serve to deepen the rift between men and women, making it harder to bridge the gap.\n\nPerhaps the most troubling aspect of this entire situation is the way in which criminal behavior is being normalized. When celebrities like Cardi B are allowed to boast about committing crimes without facing any real consequences, it sends a dangerous message to society. It suggests that as long as you're famous or popular enough, you can get away with anything.\n\nThis normalization of criminal behavior is not only harmful to the victims but also to society as a whole. It erodes the moral fabric of our communities and creates a culture where people are more concerned with getting ahead than with doing what's right. If we continue down this path, we risk creating a world where empathy, compassion, and justice are no longer valued.\n\nCardi B's recent comments have sparked a much-needed conversation about the double standards that exist in society when it comes to holding celebrities accountable for their actions. While she may be one of the most successful and influential female rappers of our time, that doesn't give her a free pass to commit crimes and boast about them without facing any consequences.\n\nIt's time for society to take a stand against this type of behavior, regardless of who the perpetrator is. Whether male or female, rich or poor, famous or unknown, everyone should be held to the same standards of accountability. Only then can we hope to create a world where justice, empathy, and compassion are valued above all else.\n\nCardi B's story is a reminder that success and fame do not absolve one of responsibility. It's a wake-up call for all of us to reflect on the type of behavior we're willing to accept from our public figures and the impact that acceptance has on our society as a whole. If we continue to turn a blind eye to the actions of those we idolize, we risk losing sight of what truly matters: our humanity.", "source": {"uri": "thyblackman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThyBlackMan"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamar_jackson@thyblackman.com", "name": "Jamar Jackson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardi_B", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cardi B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stripper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(John_Lennon_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imagine (John Lennon song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Objectification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hypocrisy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDGAF_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IDGAF (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridge (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compassion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenge"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://thyblackman.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Cardi-Bs-Shocking-Confession-Ill-Drug-and-Rob-Men-Again---Fans-React-to-Her-Controversial-Remarks.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804965", "eventUri": "eng-9804965", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

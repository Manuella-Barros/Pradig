MCPS spokesperson Chris Cram said Taylor's contract would not be finalized until he is formally appointed by the board on June 25.\n\nTaylor, who graduated from Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in 1996, has more than 25 years of experience as an educator, including 12 in district-level leadership and six years as superintendent, according to school board President Karla Silvestre.\n\nIn a release, the board described Taylor, who was named Virginia Region III Superintendent of the Year in 2024, as a \"strong transformational leader.\"\n\n\"Dr. Taylor cares deeply about Montgomery County where he was raised and educated,\" the board said. \"He recognizes the challenges facing MCPS and is ready to lead the district forward.\"\n\nIn his remarks Monday, Taylor said he would focus on school safety, developing mutual trust and transparency-and creating equity.\n\n\"The experience of some students in Gaithersburg is wildly different from the experiences of some students in Potomac,\" he said. \"We have to name it.\"\n\nThough Taylor is coming from a school district with a much smaller budget, he said his finance background has prepared him to supervise the $3.32 billion MCPS spending plan approved for the fiscal year starting July 1.\n\n\"The fundamentals don't change,\" he said.\n\nDuring the interview process, the board noted, Taylor emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability, saying \"all things begin and end with the culture leadership creates.\"\n\nTaylor, a father of five, said in the board's release that he and his family are looking forward to moving to the county. In addition to graduating from B-CC High, Taylor attended Somerset Elementary School in Chevy Chase and Westland Middle School in Bethesda.\n\nTaylor holds a doctorate in education from the University of Virginia and a master's in business administration from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, according to the board.\n\nOn Friday, the board issued a release saying it would name the new superintendent Monday afternoon. According to the release, the board \"conducted a thorough national search that included robust community input. This input helped shape a leadership profile that guided the board during candidate review. Community leaders were also included in the interview process.\"\n\nMembers considered \"a number of experienced, diverse, and highly-qualified candidates,\" the release said.\n\nFollowing the departure of McKnight, the board began conducting the search for a new school superintendent for the second time in three years.\n\nMcKnight's resignation came following the turmoil over the school system's mishandling of sexual harassment and bullying complaints made against a former middle school principal, Joel Beidleman. In March, MCPS released the terms of McKnight's separation agreement with the school board following Freedom of Information Act requests by MoCo360 and other local media. McKnight was to receive a total of $1.3 million from the district, MCPS said.\n\nShortly after McKnight resigned, the board appointed Monique Felder, a former MCPS administrator, to serve as interim superintendent. Felder's contract is set to expire on June 30. It is not known whether Felder was a candidate for the permanent superintendent post.\n\nDuring an interview with MoCo360 prior to the announcement, Taylor acknowledged he needed to rebuild trust in MCPS.\n\n\"I don't think it's a secret that Montgomery County Public Schools has had a rough year. And I think that it's critically important that the school system build trust with county government and build trust with the community,\" he said. \"And I think that there's some things that we can do to increase engagement, increased visibility and to have some shared conversations about what the future direction of Montgomery County is.\"\n\nThe school board began its nationwide search for a new superintendent in February. In early April, it announced the hiring of Florida-based Greenwood Asher & Associates to conduct the search.\n\nIn addition to hiring a search firm, the school board placed a high priority on hearing from residents about what they wanted in the next MCPS superintendent.\n\nThe school board held three in-person forums in early April, plus an online forum and focus groups, and conducted a survey. Gathering feedback from the school community was one of the first of three phases in the board's process for finding a new superintendent.\n\nAt the public forums, community members shared that they were looking for an experienced leader and a good communicator who would respect staff and understand the concerns of the district's community.\n\nThe public's feedback was recorded by school board members, MCPS leaders and staff and then aggregated to create a leadership profile. The profile was expected to be used to help the search firm and the board as it interviewed and selected candidates, according to school board Chief of Staff Lori-Chris Webb.\n\nIn May the school board reviewed candidate applications and interviews were held in June.\n\nSince the public forums, little information had been shared by the school board about the superintendent search process or the candidates.", "source": {"uri": "moco360.media", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoCo360"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elia_griffin@moco360.media", "name": "Elia Griffin", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Photo courtesy Montgomery County Public Schools\n\nStafford County, Virginia, Public Schools Superintendent Thomas Taylor will be the next superintendent for Montgomery County Public Schools, school system officials announced Monday.\n\nThe selection of Taylor followed a national search that consisted of community forums, focus groups and a districtwide survey, among other outreach intended to collect local input, and follows the tumultuous departure of former Superintendent Monifa McKnight in February. Taylor will be formally appointed at the school board's June 25 business meeting, according to officials.\n\nDuring Taylor's introductory news conference Monday, Montgomery County Board of Education President Karla Silvestre pointed to his long resume of school leadership and expertise on school policy as well as a background in finance.\n\n\"This unique marriage of an instructional leader with deep understanding of school finance is a powerful combination in a school leader,\" Silvestre said at the news conference.\n\nTaylor has more than 25 years of experience in education, with about 12 years of district-level leadership and six as a superintendent. For his performance in Stafford County, he was named the 2024 Virginia Region III Superintendent of the Year.\n\nIn Stafford County, Taylor oversaw 4,300 employees in 33 schools teaching 31,000 students with a $415 million budget. In Montgomery County, he will be in charge of almost 25,000 employees in 211 schools with a student body of 160,554 and a more than $3 billion operating budget.\n\nWhen asked about how he will approach handling the transition to a much larger budget, Taylor said he believes his previous experience -- including as interim chief financial officer of Chesterfield County Public Schools in Virginia -- is \"scalable.\"\n\n\"In building a budget, the fundamentals don't change despite the size, and it is something that I'm actually looking forward to,\" he said.\n\nIn Stafford, Taylor oversaw the construction of three new schools, launched a strategic plan for the district and established two partnerships with the JED Foundation to implement direct mental health support for students, according to a news release from that county's public school system.\n\nHe has a doctoral degree in education from the University of Virginia and a master's of business administration from the College of William and Mary.\n\nIn addition to his professional history, Taylor has personal ties to the district -- he was attended Montgomery County Public Schools from kindergarten through his senior year of high school, he said Monday.\n\n\"I'm really excited to get reacquainted with our community and to make new relationships,\" Taylor said. \"I'm confident that you will see and hear from me a lot, but please know that you can always count on me to do a lot of listening.\"\n\nIn his remarks Monday, Taylor stressed his intent to focus on collaboration, campus safety and student equity across the district, noting that \"the experience of some students in Gaithersburg is wildly different than the experience of some students in Potomac.\"\n\nTaylor, who made local headlines in January as the head of Stafford County Public Schools when he posted a rap video announcing the district's first snow day of the year, emphasized his desire to foster a campus culture built on values like \"mutual respect and innovation.\"\n\n\"I'm not here to bring a wrecking ball to anything, but rather to preserve that which is already working and enhance those areas that need improvement,\" he said.\n\nMonday's announcement follows the February resignation of McKnight, who was about two years into her four-year contract when she announced her departure.\n\nMcKnight left amid controversy over the school system's handling of sexual harassment and bullying allegations against former Farquhar Middle School Principal Joel Beidleman, who was promoted under her leadership.\n\nMcKnight received $1.3 million as part of a separation agreement with the district and agreed not to sue the school board.\n\nInterim superintendent Monique Felder remained in the position following McKnight's departure and will transition out of the position in the coming weeks.\n\nWhen asked Monday about how he plans to approach allegations of misconduct, Taylor said the district must \"take everything very seriously\" and pay close attention to how such issues come about.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's his most recent post in career as an educator that spans more than 25 years, including 12 in district-level leadership and six years as a superintendent, according to MCPS.\n\nIf Taylor is formally appointed by the school board on June 25, as expected, he will take charge of a district serving 211 schools and more than 160,000 schools on a $3.32 billion budget. It's the state's largest school system in a county that has changed much since he was an MCPS student, becoming majority minority in roughly the decade after he graduated. That change has presented the school system with challenges both financial and academic as it strives to provide equity for all students.\n\nTaylor also faces the task of restoring trust in the school system in the aftermath of a controversy over sexual allegations involving a former middle school principal that led to the February resignation of former Superintendent Monifa McKnight.\n\nIn addition, this spring's budget season has also created tension between the school board and some members of the County Council, which allotted the highest-ever spending for MCPS -- though that amount was still $30 million less than what the school system says it needs.\n\nBefore the school board's announcement, MoCo360 talked with Taylor at the district's Rockville headquarters to discuss why he wanted to be MCPS superintendent and how he'll approach the job.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhy did you apply and what qualifies you to lead the state's largest school system?\n\nWell, I will say that I think everybody has that \"drop everything\" job. Like, you know, that position is open, you're going to drop everything and apply for [it]. That for me, that's being the superintendent of my home district. I have a great affinity for Montgomery County as a former student and as a resident. The teachers changed my life in Montgomery County for the better. I became a teacher because of the teachers that I had in Montgomery County and it set me on the path of education.\n\nI also think that Montgomery County has tremendous potential. I think that this [district] has a legacy of academic success in Montgomery County, but there are also some areas in need of improvement and I'm really excited to use some of my experience and some of my background to help support my home community.\n\nHow long have you been an educator?\n\nAlmost 25 years in public education. I've been a teacher, a principal, superintendent in two locations and deputy superintendent of a much larger school district. Not larger than Montgomery County. Very few districts are larger than Montgomery County. But my educational career has kind of led me to this point and I'm really excited to leverage six years of superintendent experience in two different places and put that to good use in Montgomery County.\n\nWhat would you like the MCPS community to know about you?\n\nI hope that folks can expect me to be high energy, that they can expect me to be a good listener, and that they can expect to see me. And that I want to be accessible in the community. And that I want to hear what they have to say because it's their kids and their school system. I want students in particular to feel like they have a voice and that they're empowered to take control of their destinies, their futures.\n\nMontgomery County is very diverse, in terms of its ethnic, racial and economic makeup. What experience do you have in working with diverse school communities?\n\nSo that diversity is a huge strength. And both in Stafford County where I have been most recently serving and in Chesterfield County, both of those districts are majority nonwhite, and the demographics are very similar to Montgomery County. Both have a growing [English for Speakers of Other Languages] population. And to me, that's a passion of mine-to get great, high performance out of our students in spite of any background that they may have. Their ZIP code or their demographics shouldn't be a determining factor of their success. And I'm really proud of that work.\n\nWhat areas of improvement do you see for MCPS? And how do you plan to approach them?\n\nI don't think it's a secret that Montgomery County Public Schools has had a rough year. And I think that it's critically important that the school system build trust with county government and build trust with the community. And I think that there are some things that we can do to increase engagement, increase visibility, and to have some shared conversations about what the future direction of Montgomery County is.\n\nAs strong as our academic legacy is, there are some areas in need of improvement in terms of literacy. Graduation rates are generally pretty high, but our Hispanic students are lagging on [their] graduation rate and there's a big gap between them and other students in the county. I think that there are some areas that really do need some improvement and I think that there are some processes, structures and systems that we can put in place that will help teachers and help principals and take a few things off their plates.\n\nYou mentioned that it's been a tough year for MCPS, especially with the erosion of trust with the public, the MCPS community and local elected leaders. How will you try to restore that trust?\n\nI think there are two critical things that Montgomery County Public Schools will need to have and as the superintendent, I will be mainly responsible for this-being transparent. It's a cornerstone of trust and having some metrics for accountability. I think that those are really important. The work of building trust is long and difficult and hard, but it's 100% worth it. As far as we need to go, we're only going to move at the speed of trust. So even with the improvements that we need to make, we need to be mindful of the fact that we're only going to make as much progress as the trust that we have in the community. So being visible and being accessible and listening to the many voices who all have value in our community is really important.\n\nWhat are some of your other priorities in your new role?\n\nI think coming back from the pandemic, across the country -- this is not just a Montgomery County challenge -- making sure that our students have access to the resources they need for their well-being and making sure that we are doing everything that we can in the literacy space so that students are prepared for their next step in life, whatever that may be.\n\nDo you have a passion project that you're really excited to work on?\n\nSo that's a great question. And I would say that my passion project is engaging with the community and really hearing from lots of different perspectives on how things are going for themselves, how things are going for their kids, what their outlook is on the future. And so, I would say if I had a passion project, it's maybe not, you know, something that we would call a project but maybe it's an activity and it's listening to what folks have to say about their school system and about their county, and how they think that they can make it better.\n\nFor years, MCPS has focused on achieving equity for all students and closing the achievement gap. What are you planning to do to address inequity in MCPS?\n\nI think it really boils down to this: despite our really rich legacy and history of academic excellence, that also comes with a history of inequities in our county. And I think that we need to be responsible and call that out that some students in one part of the county may have a very different experience than other students in another part of the county. As a consequence of the experience that they've had, they may have different outcomes.\n\nI think it's our responsibility to create equitable access to a lot of opportunities for students to excel and to provide the support necessary for students to do their very best work and for teachers to do their very best work. And so for that to occur, we need to have an equity mindset as an organization. And we need to be focused on the differing needs of our students, the differing needs of our staff, the different needs of our communities, and be really attentive to that and build systems and structures that are going to support that.\n\nWhat will you be doing within the coming months to be more visible, address transparency and build trust with the public?\n\nI am fully aware that it's summer. So we will have a lot of engagement events for me to get reacquainted with the community and for me to hear from a lot of different people.\n\nInitially I'm going to focus a lot on our internal staff and our internal community and start some of the groundwork with them just mainly because they're accessible in the summertime. That will start to branch out as we get into the start of the school year and late into the summer. And not to say that we won't have community engagement events this summer. We will, but I also acknowledge that they might not be well attended because it's summer.\n\nAnd so we want to have lots of touch points and opportunities for the community to make sure that their voices are known and be really deliberate about seeking out voices that historically have been marginalized and that we haven't heard from a lot. And identifying that, calling it out and seeking their input on some of the decisions that we need to make moving forward.\n\n\"One of the biggest things that -- and I'm really excited about this -- is the strategic plan. It's time for Montgomery County to adopt a new, long-range strategic plan. That is really exciting. And it's also a great opportunity for community voices to come to the table and share their ideas about the school system and where it should be going and how we're going to get there. It's not going to be my vision. It's going to be a shared vision.\n\nCan you explain a bit about the strategic plan?\n\nMost organizations, whether they're a business, a nonprofit or school system, usually adopt a plan that is not just for one year, but really a multiple-year plan. They set out goals that they want to accomplish and then strategies on how they're going to achieve those goals. And then they typically align that to a budget. So that's a big job, big work, but it's also a great opportunity for people to engage and to articulate what's important to them in the community and what's important to them in the schools.\n\nSo there is one on the [MCPS] website. And I think it is coming to completion soon, if not already. But I will say that, you know, strategic plans can sit on the shelf, or they can be a part of your average everyday dialogue and the things that are important to your daily work. My hope is that we have a culture of support, a culture of innovation, a culture of mutual respect and caring and that the strategic plan can be a part of that culture on a regular basis.", "source":

Taylor will be formally appointed at the school board's June 25 business meeting, according to officials.\n\nDuring Taylor's introductory news conference Monday, Montgomery County Board of Education President Karla Silvestre pointed to his long resume of school leadership and expertise on school policy as well as a background in finance.\n\n\"This unique marriage of an instructional leader with deep understanding of school finance is a powerful combination in a school leader,\" Silvestre said at the news conference.\n\nTaylor has more than 25 years of experience in education, with about 12 years of district-level leadership and six as a superintendent. For his performance in Stafford County, he was named the 2024 Virginia Region III Superintendent of the Year.\n\nIn Stafford County, Taylor oversaw 4,300 employees in 33 schools teaching 31,000 students with a $415 million budget. In Montgomery County, he will be in charge of almost 25,000 employees in 211 schools with a student body of 160,554 and a more than $3 billion operating budget.\n\nWhen asked about how he will approach handling the transition to a much larger budget, Taylor said he believes his previous experience -- including as interim chief financial officer of Chesterfield County Public Schools in Virginia -- is \"scalable.\"\n\n\"In building a budget, the fundamentals don't change despite the size, and it is something that I'm actually looking forward to,\" he said.\n\nIn Stafford, Taylor oversaw the construction of three new schools, launched a strategic plan for the district and established two partnerships with the JED Foundation to implement direct mental health support for students, according to a news release from that county's public school system.\n\nHe has a doctoral degree in education from the University of Virginia and a master's of business administration from the College of William and Mary.\n\nIn addition to his professional history, Taylor has personal ties to the district -- he was attended Montgomery County Public Schools from kindergarten through his senior year of high school, he said Monday.\n\n\"I'm really excited to get reacquainted with our community and to make new relationships,\" Taylor said. \"I'm confident that you will see and hear from me a lot, but please know that you can always count on me to do a lot of listening.\"\n\nIn his remarks Monday, Taylor stressed his intent to focus on collaboration, campus safety and student equity across the district, noting that \"the experience of some students in Gaithersburg is wildly different than the experience of some students in Potomac.\"\n\nTaylor, who made local headlines in January as the head of Stafford County Public Schools when he posted a rap video announcing the district's first snow day of the year, emphasized his desire to foster a campus culture built on values like \"mutual respect and innovation.\"\n\n\"I'm not here to bring a wrecking ball to anything, but rather to preserve that which is already working and enhance those areas that need improvement,\" he said.\n\nMonday's announcement follows the February resignation of McKnight, who was about two years into her four-year contract when she announced her departure.\n\nMcKnight left amid controversy over the school system's handling of sexual harassment and bullying allegations against former Farquhar Middle School Principal Joel Beidleman, who was promoted under her leadership.\n\nMcKnight received $1.3 million as part of a separation agreement with the district and agreed not to sue the school board.\n\nInterim superintendent Monique Felder remained in the position following McKnight's departure and will transition out of the position in the coming weeks.\n\nWhen asked Monday about how he plans to approach allegations of misconduct, Taylor said the district must \"take everything very seriously\" and pay close attention to how such issues come about.", "source": {"uri": "marylandmatters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maryland Matters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rosanne_skirble@marylandmatters.org", "name": "Rosanne Skirble", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "william_j_ford@marylandmatters.org", "name": "William J.

He has led the district of about 32,000 students since in 2021.\n\nTaylor, an alumnus of Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, characterized the Montgomery job as a \"return home.\"\n\n\"MCPS has so much to be proud of and yet there is still much to be done to guarantee that every child has access to a great education in our county,\" Taylor said in a statement. \"I am here to listen and to work collaboratively with our entire community to find solutions that will move Montgomery County and its school district forward.\"\n\nIf Taylor is approved by the board, he will begin July 1.\n\nTaylor will succeed interim Superintendent Monique Felder, who was appointed by the school board in February after the departure of former superintendent Monifa B. McKnight. He will take charge of a school system that has been under scrutiny for months over its handling of employees' complaints of harassment and other misconduct, after an investigation by The Washington Post revealed a former middle school principal was promoted despite reports about his conduct. The former principal, Joel Beidleman, is no longer an employee of the district and has previously denied many of the allegations.\n\nIn its statement Monday, the school board said that Taylor recognized the challenges facing the school system. They said that during the interview process, Taylor told board members, \"All things begin and end with the culture leadership creates.\"\n\nTaylor has been an educator for more than 25 years. He holds a doctorate in education from the University of Virginia and a masters of business administration from the College of William & Mary.\n\nAs superintendent of Stafford County, he established two \"first of its kind\" programs, according to a news release from the school board. One program was a partnership with the Internal Revenue Service that trained students to assist with federal income tax preparation for low-income families. Another program was a partnership with the Fredericksburg Food Bank to open food closets at schools.\n\nHe also helped create \"open source curriculum hubs, \"a program that allowed teachers to exchange teaching materials with one another.\n\nHe is also known for his humor. In January, he posted a viral rap video he posted announcing that his previous school district would be closing schools on a snow day, in which he dubbed himself \"Dr. T\" and \"Supe Snow.\"\n\nTaylor will take over the Montgomery County schools post after a tough budget season for the system. The district reconciled a $30 million budget shortfall, which it reconciled in part by making further cuts to its central office. As such, he will have no deputy superintendent working alongside him -- after the board approved a budget that cut the position.\n\nAdditionally, two key administrative roles -- chief of staff and chief operating officer -- do not have currently permanent people in place. Henry Johnson, a former Northwood High School principal, is temporarily serving as chief of staff.\n\nAnd just this past weekend, chief operating officer Brian Hull left the school system.\n\nOn Monday, district spokeswoman Liliana L\u00f3pez declined to specify the circumstances behind Hull's departure, saying state law prevents the district from commenting on personnel matters.\n\nAs chief operating officer, Hull oversaw the district's finances, transportation, facilities management and labor relations. An organizational chart reflects that Human Resources and Development had been overseen by Hull, but the office has been reporting to Johnson since March, L\u00f3pez said. Hull was not one of the employees who was involved in Beidleman's promotion, according to a law firm's report and previous reporting by The Post.\n\nHull served as acting superintendent twice in the past year. He declined to comment on his departure.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Beidleman, who is no longer with the school system, has denied the allegations. While the January report did not specifically address what happened with Beidleman, it faulted many aspects of MCPS' investigative processes and its failures to address problems that had been flagged four times in recent years.\n\n\"Positive progress [is] being made in areas of protocol, data management, communications and more,\" Interim MCPS Superintendent Monique Felder said Thursday. \"We have communicated repeatedly to staff where to find and how to utilize the multiple ways to report incidents.\"\n\nJohnson said MCPS will explain in depth how the new system works and how faculty can report incidents if needed during sessions before the school year starts in late August.\n\nIn addition to those steps, the school system also has extended its email retention period by three years to keep email records available for a longer period of time for potential investigatory purposes, Felder said.\n\nIn April, MCPS created a Corrective Actions Progress Report dashboard on its website, as recommended in the report by the inspector general's office. The site was not updated again until Thursday.\n\nThe dashboard is a \"tool to show the community the progress that we are making to meet\" the recommendations outlined in the report, Board of Education President Karla Silvestre said during an April 25 board meeting.\n\nThe Corrective Actions Progress Report webpage outlines the status of steps MCPS is taking following the investigation of its mishandling of employee complaints of sexual harassment and bullying against Beidleman.\n\nAs of Thursday, the dashboard indicated the school system has made some progress in addressing the majority of the report's recommendations.\n\nJessica Boone, who was hired on a temporary contract in April to work on reform efforts as part of the MCPS Department of Compliance and Investigations (DCI), told the council committees that she believes her changes have helped improve the efficiency and culture of the DCI office. She said a new office policy requires employees to check at the beginning and end of each work day to see if any complaints have been submitted.\n\n\"We're moving towards a great culture in the office,\" Boone said. \"I see a much more collaborative approach.\"\n\nThe controversy involving Beidleman erupted about two months after the school board approved in June 2023 his appointment as principal of Paint Branch High School in Burtonsville while MCPS was investigating complaints against him. Following his appointment, The Washington Post published a report in August that detailed years of alleged misconduct from Beidleman and inaction from MCPS officials in charge of investigating complaints. The resulting controversy led to widespread distrust and concern from many in the school community as well as local elected officials.\n\nIn February former MCPS Superintendent Monifa McKnight resigned after the school board allegedly asked her to step down. About a week later, the school board appointed Felder to serve as the interim superintendent as the board conducted a national search for a new superintendent. Thomas Taylor, superintendent of Stafford County Public Schools in Virginia, was nominated for the role on Monday.\n\nCouncilmember Gabe Albornoz (D-At-large) said he is concerned about the number of acting and temporary employees who worked on the district's reform efforts, saying he's worried about the potential for progress not continuing.\n\n\"We hope that the new leadership continues to build off of the work that has been completed and that we don't start over again, or go in another direction,\" Albornoz said.\n\nCouncilmember Dawn Luedtke (D-Dist. 7) requested the school system look at ways to prevent or identify abuse of the reporting system She said she was concerned about the potential for employees to file false complaints as their own form of harassment against other employees.\n\n\"These are complex behaviors,\" she said, noting that a victim of bullying could possibly engage in similar conduct \"towards subordinates or back in a retaliatory fashion. It's a known phenomenon.\"\n\nCouncil Vice President Kate Stewart (D-Dist. 4) asked MCPS to submit a progress update by Aug. 12.", "source": {"uri": "moco360.media", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoCo360"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ginny_bixby@moco360.media", "name": "Ginny Bixby", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical-Copyright_Protection_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_County_Public_Schools_(Maryland)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery County Public Schools (Maryland)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superintendent (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_County,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery County, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery County, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_Central_Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director of Central Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_County_Public_Schools", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stafford County Public Schools"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint_Branch_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paint Branch High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boone_County,_West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boone County, West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boone County, West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burtonsville,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burtonsville, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Burtonsville, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://moco360.media/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/062024jointmtg-e1718918274590.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659815", "eventUri": "eng-9659815", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-26", "textStart": 59, "textEnd": 66, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 2355, "textEnd": 2363}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-12", "textStart": 5213, "textEnd": 5220}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

During the past year, her office has received more than 400 complaints on its hotline, of which about 175 were related to MCPS, she said. The number of calls is 130% higher than during the previous year.\n\nDr. Henry Johnson, acting chief of staff at MCPS, said the Department of Compliance and Investigation, said all recommendations made by the OIG are \"in progress.\"\n\nSome changes have been adopted, according to Jessica Boone, acting director of the Department of Compliance and Investigation. Now, anonymous complaints are handled the same as complaints attached to a particular person, she said.\n\nA person filing a complaint is told within 24 hours that their complaint has been received. The filer also will be told the results of the complaint when the matter is completed, Boone said.\n\nShe said that staff in her office will be trained on how to deal with complaints. MCPS staff will be trained on new policies, including the mandating of reporting by supervisors of any romantic or sexual relationship among employees who work under the supervisor.\n\n\"I am confident we aren't missing any complaints,\" Boone said of her office, which has six investigators.\n\nThe Department of Compliance and Investigations deals with between 25 and 30 calls per week. There have been 180 consultations since April 29.\n\nAs the committee meeting closed, Councilmember Will Jawando thanked MCPS and OIG staff for providing updates, adding, \"This is progress.\"", "source": {"uri": "mymcmedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Montgomery Community Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "suzanne_pollak@mymcmedia.org", "name": "Suzanne Pollak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical-Copyright_Protection_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inspector general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_County_Public_Schools_(Maryland)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery County Public Schools (Maryland)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_County,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery County, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery County, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workplace bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boone_County,_West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boone County, West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boone County, West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.mymcmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/facebook-mcps-montgomery-county-public-schools-sign.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659815", "eventUri": "eng-9659815", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 2249, "textEnd": 2257}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

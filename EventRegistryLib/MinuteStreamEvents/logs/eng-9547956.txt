United aim to sell Sancho and Mason Greenwood, hoping for between \u00a370-80 million for both. Without Erik Ten Hag, there's a slight possibility Sancho could stay at United, but his future remains uncertain.\n\nManchester United will have looked at Jadon Sancho's involvement in getting Borussia Dortmund into the Champions League final with a tinge of 'what if' with the winger set to feature against Real Madrid at Wembley - though it could spark a summer move for him with Dortmund keen on a permanent deal for their former star winger.\n\nSancho joined Dortmund back in 2017 from Manchester City and instantly became a star in west Germany, with his 50 goals in just 137 games for the club marking him as a future star and alongside Erling Haaland, the pair formed a deadly partnership that saw them win the DFB-Pokal in 2021 and come close to breaking Bayern Munich's spell as the dominant Bundesliga side.\n\nHis performances saw United become the club to swoop for his talents, paying just over \u00a370million to bring the winger to Old Trafford and whilst his first season was decent, a slowly collapsing relationship with Erik Ten Hag had the winger training with youth teams and being omitted from matchday squads. And now, his rebirth at Dortmund means that the German club are interested in permanently ending his Red Devils hoodoo, according to the Manchester Evening News.\n\nJadon Sancho: Transfer News Latest Sancho looks unlikely to wear a Man Utd shirt ever again\n\nThe report states that United have told Sancho that he can leave the club, alongside Mason Greenwood, in the summer, despite Sancho, who earns \u00a3275k-a-week at Old Trafford, getting back to his best in recent weeks via a loan spell at Borussia Dortmund. The Englishman reached the Champions League final against all odds as the German outfit beat Paris Saint-Germain in Tuesday's semi-final, meaning they will take on Real Madrid at Wembley at the start of June aiming to clinch just their second Champions League title.\n\nWhilst Sancho and Greenwood are both set to return to United at the end of their loan spells, the 'plan' is to sell both players in the summer for a huge rebuild with the Red Devils aiming for a figure between \u00a370million and \u00a380million for the pair, though a deal could be easier to do for Sancho.\n\nDortmund are keen to bring him back to the Signal Iduna Park on a permanent deal, having impressed there prior to his move to United and again in the second half of the current season. Sancho, meanwhile, is ready to end his nightmare spell at Old Trafford and return to the club where he made his name. Concrete discussions between United and Dortmund are thought to be likely to take place after the Champions League final.\n\nSancho could garner interest from elsewhere, but a deal to sell him straight back to Dortmund is seen as the easiest deal to complete. The report states that the duo have a strong working relationship amid Sancho's loan move in January, and having received the majority of Sancho's \u00a36.5million loan fee as a result of Dortmund reaching the final, the Red Devils are happy with their financial reward.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Jadon Sancho's best goalscoring season was his 17 Bundesliga strikes for Dortmund back in 2019/20\n\nThere is one drawback; both clubs need to work around FFP regulations and so finding a deal that suits all parties will be key to any move, whilst Sancho will have to take a pay cut from the wages he earns at Old Trafford. Any deal taking him back to Germany could even smash Dortmund's transfer record, which is the \u00a330million they spent on Ousmane Dembele - but their increased finances after their run to the final could help that immensely.\n\nIf Dortmund decide that a deal is too expensive to pursue, United would have to open their doors to another move; but his strong performances in the Champions League means that he could've opened the door for other suitors with another loan move not being ruled out.\n\nOne thing that is certain is Sancho won't work under Ten Hag, with the report labelling their working relationship \"irreconcilable\"; though the Dutchman's potential exit this summer means there is a slight possibility Sancho could stay under new management.\n\nJadon Sancho's Manchester United future Sancho has been a wasted signing at Old Trafford\n\nThere appears to be little chance of a return for Sancho though with new management, you can never say never. A homegrown talent having spent his youth days at Manchester City, the London-born winger has all the tools to become a regular for United and with Antony struggling on the right-hand side under Ten Hag, you would imagine that Sancho would fare better than his Brazilian team-mate.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford could battle away for the left-hand side slot based on whoever is in the best form, and a new right-winger could be ideal for United - though they are thought to be looking at Crystal Palace star Michael Olise.\n\nRelated Man Utd Expect Thomas Tuchel Talks to 'Progress' This Week Manchester United have reportedly opened the door for Thomas Tuchel to join from Bayern Munich.\n\nStatistics courtesy of Transfermarkt.

If Sancho is able to lift the Champions League trophy at Wembley on June 1, United are likely to recoup a significant chunk of the \u00a373million they paid Dortmund for him in the summer of 2021.\n\nDespite his rebirth since joining Dortmund on loan in January, United still plan to cash in on Sancho and sell him to the highest bidder this summer. Even if Erik ten Hag is replaced as United boss, the club's stance is that both parties would be better off if Sancho moved on.\n\nWhether Ten Hag's successor would share that view remains to be seen but, as it stands, Sancho is unlikely to pull on a United shirt again. That is a great shame because, as the 24-year-old has proved with the revival of his career back at Dortmund, he is a player blessed with rare gifts.\n\nThe problem for Sancho is that he showcases his talent too fleetingly, which has been a recurring theme in his turbulent career. If a talent unfulfilled is indeed the greatest waste of all, then Sancho is the embodiment of that maxim - a hugely talented player but one unable to unlock it on a consistent basis.\n\nAs a teenager, he frustrated his coaches at Manchester City with his attitude, his unwillingness to wait any longer to break into Pep Guardiola's side leading to his move to Dortmund. That bold move proved the making of Sancho, who plundered 50 goals in 137 appearances, which earned him his move to United and the long-awaited chance to shine in the Premier League.\n\nBut while he thrived at Dortmund, Sancho's old failings resurfaced at United, where he was unable to settle and produce the sparkling form that made him such a hot property in Germany. His spectacular fall-out with Ten Hag, when he took to social media to publicly question his manager's authority and claim he had been made a scapegoat, proved the beginning of the end for Sacho.\n\nSancho was frozen out at Manchester United by Erik ten Hag\n\nExiled from the first-team and their training facilities for four months, salvation came in the form of Dortmund, where Sancho has flourished in familiar surroundings and rediscovered his mojo. In the Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint Germain, Sancho tormented their left-back, Nuno Mendes, and was voted man of the match in the first leg.\n\nIn the second leg, although he only lasted 67 minutes - a legacy of his enforced lengthy exile at United - he still probed and caused PSG problems with his quick feet, pace and willingness to take on opponents.\n\nThe irony of Sancho's plight is that he would never have found himself playing in the Champions League final - the biggest club game in world football - had Ten Hag not gone public on his feelings about him.\n\nSancho's performances have seen his transfer market value soar\n\nAfter United's 3-1 defeat at Arsenal in September, Ten Hag was asked the reason for Sancho's omission and claimed it was because the winger had not trained properly, which led to their public spat.\n\nBut Ten Hag unwittingly did Sancho a favour, the winger now playing with a smile on his face and on the cusp of winning the Champions League, a competition for which United failed to qualify for next season. In that respect, Sancho has had the last laugh on Ten Hag and United.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

His return to Borussia Dortmund has rejuvenated him, helping him rediscover his best form. Sancho impressed in the Champions League semi-finals against Paris Saint-Germain, playing a crucial role in Dortmund's success to help them reach a Champions League final.\n\nJust six months ago, Jadon Sancho was in no man's land. He had been exiled by Manchester United after a falling out with Erik ten Hag, wasn't even training with his teammates and questions were being raised about his attitude and professionalism. Despite the Red Devils having no interest in playing the Englishman, there was almost a reluctance from clubs in Europe to even make a move for him.\n\nFast-forward half a year and Sancho is a Champions League finalist, potentially just 90 minutes away from winning the biggest club competition in the world. It's a remarkable turnaround for the forward and goes to show just how quickly fortunes can change in football, but how has he reached this point? A lifeline from a former club, a whole lot of hard work and a star-making show against one of Europe's biggest teams.\n\nSancho Was Exiled from Manchester United A falling out with Erik ten Hag saw him banished\n\nAfter joining United in 2021, the Red Devils thought they'd signed one of the most promising young forwards in the world. Considering his performances for Borussia Dortmund in Germany, why wouldn't they? Instead, though, he struggled in Manchester and didn't even come close to replicating the level of output he was creating in the Bundesliga.\n\nHis form was way too inconsistent and the situation quickly frustrated both the club and Sancho himself. It all reached a boiling point when he was dropped by Ten Hag at the start of the 2023/24 season, with the manager publicly questioning his attitude and work rate in training. The Englishman hit back with a now-deleted statement on social media, and the relationship between the two crumbled. He was then banished from training with the first team and was forced to sit on the sidelines throughout the first half of the season.\n\nWith the manager demanding an apology, and Sancho not giving one, they were at a standstill, and he didn't play for the club from August to January. The club wanted rid of him in the winter transfer window, and while it initially seemed as though no one was willing to take him, he was offered a lifeline by some familiar faces.\n\nSancho's Return to Dortmund has Rejuvenated Him The forward is rediscovering himself\n\nA change of scenery is just what the doctor ordered and the opportunity to return to his former club, Borussia Dortmund, was the perfect chance for Sancho to get back to the player he was several years ago. Heading back to Germany and pulling on that famous black and yellow shirt once again did wonders for the Englishman and, despite missing months of action, he showed very little rust.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Across two spells with Borussia Dortmund, Jadon Sancho has 119 goal contributions in 155 games\n\nInstead, he quickly found his feet and has been a vital component for Dortmund in the months since he returned. He's not quite been as good as he was during his first spell in Germany, but Sancho has undoubtedly been better than he was during his time with the Red Devils and already has four goal contributions to his name.\n\nHe's been fearless going forward for the club and while they are currently on pace to finish outside of the top four in what's been a disappointing campaign domestically, they are thriving in Europe, and he has played a key role in that.\n\nJadon Sancho Statistics\n\nCategories\n\nManchester United 2022/23\n\nBorussia Dortmund 2023/24\n\nAppearances\n\n41\n\n18\n\nGoals\n\n7\n\n3\n\nAssists\n\n3\n\n2\n\nThe Englishman Stole the Show Against PSG He terrorised their defence in the first leg of the semi-finals\n\nWhile they haven't had the best of seasons in the Bundesliga, Dortmund have excelled in Europe and have reached the Champions League final for the first time in over a decade. No one gave the team a chance throughout the competition, but they've proven everyone wrong time and time again and there was no finer example of this than during the semi-finals against Paris Saint-Germain and Sancho was crucial to that.\n\nIn the first leg in Germany, the Englishman was untouchable. He drove forward and danced past the PSG defenders with ease, time and time again. They couldn't contain him and his 12 completed dribbles is better than anyone else in the Champions League this season. It was a dazzling performance, but in the second leg, he was forced to play a completely different role and managed to thrive in that too.\n\nRelated Comparing Jadon Sancho's Stats to Kylian Mbappe's From Dortmund 1-0 PSG The Englishman had a show-stealing performance in the Champions League semi-finals\n\nIn France, Kylian Mbappe was determined to push his side over the edge, and Sancho was required to play a more defensive role for his team and he managed to do a fine job in keeping the Frenchman relatively quiet. He worked his socks off and was rewarded with Dortmund beating PSG 1-0 in both games, securing a place in the Champions League final for the first time since 2013.\n\nIt's an incredible journey for Sancho and one that has to be all the sweeter considering his parent club United were demolished 4-0 by Crystal Palace just 24 hours earlier. The move has been a huge success for Sancho and it's no surprise that Dortmund are desperate to bring him back in the summer.\n\nStatistics courtesy of Transfermarkt and accurate as of 07.05.2024", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-07-may-2024-10-30-pm-9220_720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547956", "eventUri": "eng-9547956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Need Bayern or Madrid to absolutely break his heart in the final.'\n\nThere remains much scepticism around Sancho's next moves and whether he will return to Man United in the summer.\n\nMail Sport revealed last week that Man United delegates, including ex-sporting director John Murtough had met with Sancho while he was at Dortmund to discuss a permanent transfer away from the club.\n\n'Loool he's not coming back,' another fan added in reference to the video.\n\nIt comes after Ten Hag acknowledged Sancho's resurgence in Germany, with the United boss claiming that his form 'shows he represents a high value for Manchester United.'\n\nTen Hag had hinted that Sancho could be sold, claiming he 'represents big value for United'\n\nSancho met with United delegates in Germany over a permanent transfer away from United\n\nThis paper also understands that his work in helping push Dortmund to the Champions League final will trigger several significant bonuses in his loan deal.\n\nIt is claimed that Sancho, who joined signed for United in a \u00a373million deal back in 2021, has 'no intention' to return to Manchester United, per The Sun, who also claim that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and

Listen to the It's All Kicking Off! Man United Crisis Special podcast\n\nSince leaving Manchester United in the January transfer window following his fallout with Erik Ten Hag, Sancho has played a pivotal role in helping Borussia Dortmund reach their first Champions League final since 2013.\n\nThe 24-year-old English international put on a dazzling display as his side sent Kylian Mbappe and Co crashing out of the Champions League, after the visitors won 1-0 thanks to a header from seasoned veteran Mat Hummels.\n\nTheir 2-0 aggregate win over PSG means Edin Terzic's side return to the Champions League for the first time in eleven years where they will face either Bayern Munich or Real Madrid at Wembley.\n\nAlthough many Manchester United fans may have a bitter taste in their mouths seeing a United loanee reaching new heights outside of Old Trafford, it isn't a complete loss from a financial aspect.\n\nHere is how much Manchester United will pocket from Jadon Sancho's appearance in the 2023-24 Champions League final at Wembley.\n\nJadon Sancho has played a pivotal role in helping Borussia Dortmund reach the Champions League final for the first time in over ten years.\n\nSancho produced a man of the match display against French giants PSG to help Dortmund in 1-0 in their second-leg clash\n\nSancho joined the German outfit in January on loan after being shunned by United manager Erik Ten Hag\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nManchester United have already benefited from Sancho's return to Germany after the Londoner was ostracised by Erik Ten Hag earlier in the year after their public fallout.\n\nDortmund handed United \u00a33million for the return of Sancho to Signal Iduna Park plus an agreement to pay a chunk of his wages for his mid-season transfer.\n\nThe Red Devils are expected to receive even further compensation after it was revealed that the two clubs have an agreement in place, where the German outfit would pay the Manchester side a further \u00a33.4 based on Sancho's Champions League progress and appearances.\n\nIt is believed that most of the add-ons included in the loan contract have been fulfilled as a result of Sancho making the final, where he played an instrumental role in the German side reaching the final.\n\nSancho was signed by Manchester United in 2021 for \u00a373m\n\nThe English forward ended up leaving the club after a public bus-up with Reds manager Ten Hag\n\nSancho seems to be playing his best football once again under Edin Terzic at Signal Iduna Park\n\nThe Manchester United prodigy has enjoyed a remarkable turnaround in form since he left United earlier this year.\n\nOnly a few months ago, the 24-year-old was banished to train with the United U-19s after a altercation with Ten Hag and has not made an appearance for the Old Trafford outfit since August 26.\n\nAfter he refused to aplologise to the Dutch manager following the bust-up.\n\nFlash forward six months and the English forward is looking like his old self, showcasing his tremendous dribbling talents on Europe's biggest stage and wining man of the match awards.\n\nThe English forward who was brought from Dortmund to United in 2021 for \u00a373m in the hope of making him the poster boy for the new era at Old Trafford failed to hit the ground running on his arrival.\n\nIn 82 appearances for the Red Devils in all competitions, Sancho only managed to score 12 goals, nine of which were registered in the Premier League.\n\nSeeing the young forward shine at Dortmund many United fans will be hoping to see the 24-year-old return to Old Trafford.\n\nHowever is future remains unclear as Ten Hag is still manager at United and Dortmund are hoping they can secure a permanent deal for their star man.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

Champions League final with Borussia Dortmund according to reports.\n\nSancho was superb for the German outfit in both legs of their semi final against French giants Paris Saint Germain as Dortmund made their first Champions League final since 2013, winning 2-0 on aggregate.\n\nThe 24-year-old seems to have rediscovered his love of the game in Germany and looks much fitter and sharper following a difficult time in Manchester during the first half of the season.\n\nSancho joined Dortmund on loan in January following a very public falling out with Erik ten Hag, which saw him banished to train on his own as the Dutchman accused him of not training to the required standard.\n\nUnited do stand to benefit financially from Sancho's successful loan spell with The Evening Standard reporting the Red Devils are in line to receive \u00a33.5m after Sancho made the Champions League final, having received an initial \u00a33m to allow him to return to Germany.\n\nThe report adds that Sancho is set to hit most of the performance related targets, so United should get close to the full \u00a36.5m due.\n\nThe German outfit are believed to be keen on making the winger's move permanent in the summer, but a move could prove difficult given Sancho's wages and United's potential asking price.\n\nSancho has struggled to make an impact at Old Trafford and has only scored 12 goals in 82 appearances for the club.\n\nIt appears his days at Old Trafford are numbered even if Ten Hag is replaced as manager at the end of the season.\n\nThe England international won't be thinking about his future right now as he prepares for the Champions League final against Real Madrid at Wembley on June 1st.", "source": {"uri": "caughtoffside.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CaughtOffside"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Mats Hummels headed in the only goal as the German side produced a rear-guard action and rode their luck to upset the odds and book a place in the final against Bayern Munich or Real Madrid.\n\nSancho started both legs for Edin Terzic's side and appears to have rediscovered a love of football since re-joining Dortmund on loan from Manchester United in January. The 24-year-old winger left United under a cloud after a very public falling out with Erik ten Hag and Dortmund's run in the Champions League has given him the chance to send a message back to Old Trafford.\n\nSancho enjoyed himself after the win in Paris, with a video posted on social media showing him belting out Adele's ballad 'Someone Like You'. Dortmund's official accounts were also up to some mischief, mocking PSG with a historic tweet, and using Canadian rapper Drake to make a point about Sancho.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS! Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!\n\nThe club's Instagram account shared a picture of Sancho celebrating in Paris with Drake superimposed below. In the clip, Drake can be heard saying: \"To the rest of you, the non-believers, the under-achievers, the tweet and deleters... You guys make me sick to my stomach.\" Replying to the post, Sancho wrote: \"LOL FACTS!\"\n\nHe kept things more simple on his own page. To his 10 million followers, he wrote: \"Champions League Final! Wow wow wow, Unbelievable! @bvb09. WEMBLEY HERE WE COME!\"\n\nSancho has returned just three goals and two assists in 21 games for Dortmund since January, but his performances against PSG showed that statistics can be deceiving. He was a constant threat in the first leg, terrorising left-back Nuno Mendes with his fearless dribbling.\n\nThe United loanee is clearly enjoying himself with Dortmund, but he has remained tight-lipped about his future. United paid Dortmund \u00a373m for his services in the summer of 2021 and he is under contract there until June 2026.\n\n\"Obviously I came here at 17 and they gave me the opportunity to play professional football so I'm just delighted with all the staff and players that welcomed me back,\" he said after the first-leg win. Former goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, then directly asked whether he would remain with the club. Sancho replied: \"Who me? I really don't know. I'm just focused on the present right now.\"\n\nDortmund have two more matches in the Bundesliga before the Champions League final at Wembley on June 1. They will try to move up from fifth place, past RB Leipzig into fourth, when they face Mainz and Darmstadt.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Sancho played at the stadium twice for Manchester United last season, in both the FA Cup final and League Cup final defeats.\n\nHis last appearance there for England was way back in November 2020, and reports suggest that, despite his recent resurgence, the winger will not be selected for Gareth Southgate's Euros squad this summer.\n\nREAD MORE: Dortmund chief confirms Sancho plan\n\nREAD MORE: Sancho's United future and contract latest\n\nUnited are set to benefit from Sancho's success in Germany, with the i claiming that the club will receive \u00a33m for his progression to the Champions League final and that they could earn more if he gets his hands on the trophy.\n\nSome fans may be hoping that the 24-year-old stays at Old Trafford next season, despite his drab two-and-a-half seasons since his 2021 arrival from Dortmund, which cost \u00a373m. However, Rio Ferdinand believes that will only happen if the current manager is sacked.\n\nHe told TNT Sports: \"I think the only way he goes back to Manchester United is if Erik ten Hag isn't there. I don't think they can undermine the manager and let a player not apologise and then bring him back.\n\n\"I don't think they'll undermine the manager in that way. I think Ten Hag needs to be gone and out of the building for Jadon Sancho to come back. If he plays that way again tonight he really puts pressure on United and the people behind the scenes.\"\n\nDortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl says his club will consider negotiating a deal with United for Sancho in the summer. This is a change in tone from initial hesitancy over the attacker, who has three goals and two assists in 18 loan matches.\n\nIt seems Sancho is certainly enjoying himself back in yellow, being seen blasting out 'Someone Like You' by Adele from a speaker in the changing rooms after Dortmund's 2-0 semi-final aggregate win over Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nThe player later took to Instagram to write: \"Champions League Final! Wow, wow, wow, unbelievable Borussia Dortmund! \"WEMBLEY HERE WE COME!\"\n\nHe then replied with \"LOL FACTS!\" to an Instagram post depicting him over lyrics from rapper Drake, which say: \"To the rest of you, the non-believers, the under-achievers, the tweet and deleters...

The Bundesliga side backed up their 1-0 win on home soil by claiming victory by the same scoreline in Paris on Tuesday night.\n\nSancho was a key figure in both games as he continues to resurect his career at the club where he first made his name. The Englishman's performance in the first leg was particularly influential and the Manchester United loanee was then part of a gritty display in the Parc des Princes.\n\nHe posted a picture of the entire team on the pitch with yellow and black heart emojis. He also said: \"Wow, unbelievable @BVB. Champions League Final!\" Videos of the team celebrating then began to circulate on social media with Sancho leading them in a singing session to Adele's ballad 'Someone Like You'.\n\nIt has been quite the turnaround for Sancho, who was frozen out in Manchester after calling out Erik ten Hag on social media, claiming he was being made a \"scapegoat\" following his omission from the matchday squad early in the season.\n\nHe wasn't picked again by the Dutchman and, as all parties sought a resolution, he was allowed to leave in January with the expectation being that he will eventually depart permanently if Ten Hag does remain in his post. The pair's relationship has appeared beyond repair.\n\nEven before Ten Hag arrived in Manchester, Sancho had struggled to justify the \u00a370million United paid to sign him back in 2021. He regularly shone at Dortmund during his first spell but has been unable to replicate that kind of football in the Premier League.\n\nNow, back at the German side, he looks to be heading back to that level. Dortmund's domestic season has not been great with the team sat fifth, although that will be good enough for the Champions League. In Europe though they've come through the group of death and seen off some major sides in the knockout rounds.\n\nManager Edin Terzic has already admitted he doesn't know if Dortmund will be able to retain Sancho going forward with the finances set to be the major stumbling block. Nevertheless, their focus is now on Wembley, where they lost the Champions League final in 2013 under Jurgen Klopp.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Jadon Sancho reportedly wants to leave Manchester United during this summer's transfer window and would not be interested in a return even if Erik ten Hag lost his job as head coach.\n\nThe England international had a high-profile falling-out with Ten Hag in the first half of the 2023-24 campaign.\n\nSancho was a notable absentee from the squad against Arsenal in the Premier League at the start of September, and Ten Hag claimed that the ex-Manchester City youngster had been left out due to some poor performances on the training ground.\n\nThe forward took to social media to insist that was not the case, claiming that he had been made \"a scapegoat\", and having refused to apologise for his outburst, the 24-year-old was removed from the first-team picture.\n\nSancho returned to Borussia Dortmund on loan in January, and he has helped the Bundesliga giants reach the final of this season's Champions League.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nJadon Sancho 'wants to leave Man United this summer'\n\nThe attacker has made 18 appearances for BVB since his return, scoring three times and registering three assists, and the German club are keen to keep him this summer.\n\nDortmund's sporting director Sebastian Kehl has said that the Champions League finalists will \"try everything\" to re-sign the Englishman on a permanent basis.\n\n\"We will try everything to keep Jadon Sancho here. But Manchester United also sees how well he is playing at the moment. Maybe they also want to sell him for profit or bring him back.

his contract at Old Trafford.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nErik ten Hag 'set to be sacked this summer'\n\nThere have been claims that the forward could return to his parent club for the 2024-25 campaign if Ten Hag is sacked as head coach.\n\nThe Red Devils are allegedly planning to remove Ten Hag from his position once the current season has finished, with Thomas Tuchel potentially arriving from Bayern Munich as his replacement.\n\nHowever, according to talkSPORT, Sancho has made it clear that he does not want to play for Man United again even if there is a change of manager this summer.\n\nThe forward has scored 12 goals and registered six assists in 82 appearances for the 20-time English champions since his arrival from Dortmund in the summer of 2021.\n\nSancho initially represented Dortmund between 2017 and 2021 before moving to Old Trafford in a big-money deal, but he has failed to show his best form in English football.\n\nID:543124:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop

The statistics unsurprisingly show that Sancho has been far more effective when playing for the German team than he was for Manchester United. However, Sancho's United teammates may be partly to blame for his low assist numbers due to poor finishing.\n\nJadon Sancho will play in a Champions League final with Borussia Dortmund after their 2-0 aggregate win over Paris Saint-Germain in the last four. The England winger wasn't hugely effective in the second leg in Paris but starred in the first leg in Germany last week, earning the Man of the Match award.\n\nSancho was exiled by Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag at the beginning of the season after the winger effectively accused the Dutchman of lying when explaining why Sancho wasn't in the matchday squad for a game against Arsenal.\n\nSancho refused to apologise and was left out in the cold by Ten Hag, training with United's Under-18s before returning to Dortmund in a loan deal in January.\n\nSancho's Dortmund vs United stats (all competitions - as of 08/05/24)\n\nDortmund\n\nUnited\n\n155\n\nAppearances\n\n82\n\n53\n\nGoals\n\n12\n\n30.4\n\nExpected goals (xG)\n\n9.5\n\n0.43\n\nGoals per 90 minutes\n\n0.22\n\n0.27\n\nExpected goals per 90 minutes\n\n0.19\n\n59\n\nAssists\n\n6\n\n37\n\nExpected assists (xGA)\n\n10.7\n\n0.47\n\nAssists per 90 minutes\n\n0.11\n\n0.32\n\nExpected assists per 90 minutes\n\n0.21\n\n46.4%\n\nPercentage of shots on target\n\n33.3%\n\n80.6%\n\nPass completion rate\n\n83.1%\n\n0.89\n\nGoal-creating actions per 90 minutes\n\n0.44\n\n4.94\n\nShot-creating actions per 90 minutes\n\n4.19\n\n54.8%\n\nSuccessful take-on rate\n\n48.1%\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Jadon Sancho is the first Manchester United player to reach a Champions League final since 2011, when the Red Devils were beaten by Barcelona at Wembley.\n\nSancho's Borussia Dortmund stats 2017-2021, 2024-present\n\nEven without statistics, it's clear that Sancho has produced the best football of his career at Dortmund. Sancho first joined the Bundesliga club in 2017, spending four years there before signing for United, and he boasts an undeniably brilliant record for them.\n\nSancho has scored far more goals for Dortmund than he would have been expected to using the expected goals (xG) metric. Sancho's xG across his two spells at Dortmund is 30.4 but he has outperformed that expectation massively, netting 53 times.\n\nThe winger has averaged 0.43 goals per 90 minutes across his two spells at the Westfalenstadion and his assists record is similarly impressive, with the on-loan star averaging 0.47 assists per 90 minutes. Sancho has registered 59 assists for Dortmund, 22 more than he would have been expected to using the expected assists (xGA) metric.\n\nSancho has attempted 220 shots on goal for Dortmund, with 102 of them (46.4 per cent) hitting the target, while his pass completion rate is 80.6 per cent. He has averaged an impressive 0.89 goal-creating actions per 90 minutes, while he has also averaged 4.94 shot-creating actions per 90. In terms of his dribbling, Sancho has a successful take-on rate of 54.8 per cent.\n\nSancho's Manchester United stats 2021-2023\n\nSancho made 82 appearances for United and at the moment it feels unlikely that he will add to that tally. In those appearances, the winger scored 12 goals and registered six assists in all competitions. Sancho again outperformed his xG of 9.5, but at nowhere near the rate that he did at Dortmund.\n\nMeanwhile, Sancho's assists tally of six is significantly lower than than his xGA of 10.7. However, that is not an underperformance on Sancho's part, rather it suggests an issue with the players he was feeding the ball to at United not finishing the chances that they would have been expected to.\n\nContrastingly, as previously mentioned, Sancho has vastly outperformed his xGA across his two spells at Dortmund, suggesting that the players he has assisted for BVB have made far more of the chances created by Sancho than they would have been expected to.\n\nSancho has not been as accurate with his attempts on goal for United as he has been for Dortmund, hitting the target just 33.3 per cent of the time, as opposed to 46.4 per cent of the time for the German club.\n\nHis pass completion rate, however, is slightly better for United (83.1 per cent) than it was for Dortmund (80.6 per cent), and that statistic covers short-range, mid-range and long-range passes. That is about the only significant metric where Sancho has been better for United than he has for Dortmund, though, and even then it is marginal.\n\nSancho has averaged 0.44 goal-creating actions per 90 minutes for United - less than half of what he has averaged for Dortmund, while his average shot-creating actions of 4.19 per 90 minutes is also lower than it is at Dortmund (4.94).\n\nMuch of the confusion surrounding Sancho's issues at United centred around his struggles when attempting to dribble past players given that was one of his major strengths during his first spell at Dortmund, and he had a successful take-on rate at United of 48.1 per cent from 210 attempts as opposed to 54.8 per cent at Dortmund from 713 attempts.\n\nAll statistics via fbref and correct as of 08/05/2024.\n\nRelated Jadon Sancho Sends Message to Critics After Leading Dortmund Celebrations Jadon Sancho had a message for those that doubted him during his difficult spell at Manchester United as he led Borussia Dortmund's celebrations.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Unemployment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Unemployment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sancho-mbappe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547956", "eventUri": "eng-9547956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

They were among the most recent Manchester United players to grace a Champions League final, that being some 13 years ago.\n\nNow Jadon Sancho has joined them, becoming the first player on the Red Devils books to make a European Cup final since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013. The fact he'll be playing in the showpiece event for another club, all but sums up United and their haphazard decisions since the Scot's retirement.\n\nSancho had been frozen out in Manchester under Erik ten Hag after a social media spat landed him in hot water. Even before that, like so many expensive signings, the winger had been struggling to deliver, with a loan move away seen as the best outcome for now.\n\nThe England international, who has lost his place with the Three Lions since moving to United, has begun to rediscover his best form with the Bundesliga outfit as questions are, once again, asked about the Manchester outfit, their culture and their decision making.\n\nUnited played in four Champions League finals during the Ferguson era. They won the first two in 1999 and 2008 before losing to Barcelona in 2009 and 2011. Since then their European record has made for grim reading and that trend continued this term.\n\nThe likes of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer all struggled to make inroads in the Champions League with the team yet to make it past a quarter-final. This term Ten Hag saw his side knocked out in the group stages.\n\nSancho didn't feature in any of those games as he was frozen out of the first team. His only Champions League games have come in the yellow of Dortmund. Ten Hag had made attempts to get the winger firing during his debut season, but failed to get the desired results.\n\nThe Class of 2011 were the last Man Utd players to make a European Cup final\n\nThe Dutchman previously commented on how, even before he was appointed as manager, there were issues with Sancho, admitting that his time in Manchester had not been a success.\n\nHe said: \"He's now at Dortmund. So after he was signed, one year before [I was here], and there were issues. We have had issues all the way through, and so you can make out his stay at Manchester United so far is not a success. So now he is going back to Borussia Dortmund, so I wish him the best of luck. I hope, we all hope he is doing well there, he will be successful. Again, we will see what is going to happen.\"\n\nDespite the apparent pessimism Dortmund seem more than content with their loan signing, who they would keep permanently if United were willing sellers at the right price.\n\nErik ten Hag cast Jadon Sancho aside earlier this season\n\nThe Bundesliga club's chief, Sebastian Kehl, has admitted: \" I know that the players feel pretty welcome in Dortmund, they feel at home, especially Jadon. I think it was a quite good decision to take them. But again, this is something for the future, and let's keep our focus on today.\"\n\nThose negotiations could be conducted with Sancho walking back into Carrington as a Champions League winner. Over the past decade United have had a host of European champions - the likes of Angel di Maria, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Casemiro. They were all purchased following those successes.\n\nIn Sancho they already had a player who proved he has the temperament and the ability to help an unfancied side make the biggest game in European club football. People often said Ferguson had an eye for a player, backed youth, didn't always buy the finished article. Penny for Ten Hag's thoughts now.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Now he's looking forward to playing in the biggest club game in world football.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the prospect of having to return to England would fill Sancho with dread, given his broken relationship with Manchester United. But these are not normal circumstances.\n\nREAD MORE: Jadon Sancho 'doesn't want to return' to Man Utd - even if Erik ten Hag is axed\n\nREAD MORE: Man Utd set for summer exodus as Sir Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS era starts to take shape\n\nAnd on June 1, the 24-year-old will find himself in London for the Champions League final with Borussia Dortmund. The England winger will face either Real Madrid or Bayern Munich in the showpiece event at Wembley.\n\nThe saying goes that you should 'never go back'. But Sancho's love affair with Dortmund appears to be a marriage made in heaven, because as loan moves go, the one he made back to the Bundesliga outfit from United in January appears to be one of the best in footballing history.\n\nDo you think Manchester United should try to convince Jadon Sancho to stay at the Red Devils next season? Let us know in the comments section below.\n\nDortmund rode to the rescue of Sancho and reached out to him in his darkest hours of need. And he's repaid them in full, with a string of stunning performances to help the German outfit stun European football with a place in the greatest club game of all at Wembley.\n\nIn the two semi-finals against Paris Saint German, Sancho was so dazzling on the right wing he left the French outfit's hapless left back Nuno Mendes nursing twisted blood.\n\nAlmost in the blink of an eye, Sancho has gone from a nightmare to the sort of fairytale even the greatest football fantasists couldn't dream up. And it has all left United boss Erik ten Hag needed a mechanical digger to scrape all the egg that's been left on his face.\n\nOne looking as red as those shirts his team wear. The blame game following the initial fall-out between Sancho and Ten Hag became a damaging one indeed.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Ten Hag questioned Sancho's attitude in training, while the winger responded by accusing the Dutchman of telling lies to make him a scapegoat for the team's failings.\n\nBut the fact remains that Ten Hag should never have gone public with his concerns about the winger. It was naive - and broke the unwritten rule that exists between managers and players.\n\nBut Ten Hag doubled down to turn the bust-up into a monster. He demanded an apology from Sancho, and when it isn't forthcoming banned him from training with the first team.\n\nHe couldn't even have lunch with his team-mates. When the transfer window came around, Sancho couldn't wait to throw himself out of it.\n\nSo off he went back to Dortmund, hell-bent on reviving his career and showing Ten Hag what he would be missing. And that's what he's now done, leaving Ten Hag to wonder if he could have handled the scenario differently.\n\nThose who laugh last, laugh the loudest, and Ten Hag can hear Sancho chuckling all the way from Dortmund.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_cross@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Jeremy Cross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32761560.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-PICS-Jadon-Sanchos-rehabilitation-leaves-naive-Erik-ten-Hag-with-egg-on-his-face-at-Man-U.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547956", "eventUri": "eng-9547956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 687, "textEnd": 693}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Mats Hummels headed in the only goal as the German side produced a rear-guard action and rode their luck to upset the odds and book a place in the final against Bayern Munich or Real Madrid.\n\nSancho started both legs for Edin Terzic's side and appears to have rediscovered a love of football since re-joining Dortmund on loan from Manchester United in January. The 24-year-old winger left United under a cloud after a very public falling out with Erik ten Hag and Dortmund's run in the Champions League has given him the chance to send a message back to Old Trafford.\n\nSancho enjoyed himself after the win in Paris, with a video posted on social media showing him belting out Adele's ballad 'Someone Like You'. Dortmund's official accounts were also up to some mischief, mocking PSG with a historic tweet, and using Canadian rapper Drake to make a point about Sancho.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS! Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!\n\nThe club's Instagram account shared a picture of Sancho celebrating in Paris with Drake superimposed below. In the clip, Drake can be heard saying: \"To the rest of you, the non-believers, the under-achievers, the tweet and deleters... You guys make me sick to my stomach.\" Replying to the post, Sancho wrote: \"LOL FACTS!\"\n\nHe kept things more simple on his own page. To his 10 million followers, he wrote: \"Champions League Final! Wow wow wow, Unbelievable! @bvb09. WEMBLEY HERE WE COME!\"\n\nSancho has returned just three goals and two assists in 21 games for Dortmund since January, but his performances against PSG showed that statistics can be deceiving. He was a constant threat in the first leg, terrorising left-back Nuno Mendes with his fearless dribbling.\n\nThe United loanee is clearly enjoying himself with Dortmund, but he has remained tight-lipped about his future. United paid Dortmund \u00a373m for his services in the summer of 2021 and he is under contract there until June 2026.\n\n\"Obviously I came here at 17 and they gave me the opportunity to play professional football so I'm just delighted with all the staff and players that welcomed me back,\" he said after the first-leg win. Former goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, then directly asked whether he would remain with the club. Sancho replied: \"Who me? I really don't know. I'm just focused on the present right now.\"\n\nDortmund have two more matches in the Bundesliga before the Champions League final at Wembley on June 1. They will try to move up from fifth place, past RB Leipzig into fourth, when they face Mainz and Darmstadt.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

He hasn't expressed it at his best yet, he's been at some moments really good.\"\n\nThe Athletic report that United boss Erik ten Hag has privately been adamant that he offered Sancho as much support as he could throughout the player's time at Old Trafford.

The Englishman also had a clear message for anyone that doubted him during his time at Manchester United. The German club won both legs of the semi-final 1-0 to book a place in the final at Wembley Stadium against either Bayern Munich or Real Madrid.\n\nJadon Sancho was at the forefront of Borussia Dortmund's celebrations after the German club defeated Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-finals of the Champions League. The winger, who is on loan from Manchester United, also had a clear message for his doubters after helping his temporary club secure a place in a major European final.\n\nThe 24-year-old was electric in the first leg of the tie against the French opposition, causing Nuno Mendes all sorts of headaches with his relentless work rate and direct dribbling. This performance had many people taking notice of the former Manchester City youth product.\n\nHis time at Man United has been underwhelming to date, with a very public fallout with manager Erik ten Hag leading to the loan move he's currently enjoying. While the Red Devils were knocked out of European competition at the group stage, Sancho will now prepare for a return to England for the Champions League final in London.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Borussia Dortmund have reached a Champions League final for the first time since 2013, when they faced Bayern Munich at Wembley Stadium.\n\nEither Bayern Munich or Real Madrid will meet Dortmund in the final, which will be held at Wembley Stadium, England's international ground. The Bundesliga outfit booked their place in the final with back-to-back 1-0 victories against PSG, with Mats Hummels scoring the all-important goal in Paris.\n\nRelated Ranking the 16 Greatest British Players to Ever Play Abroad Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane and Gareth Bale are three British stars who have shone for foreign clubs. Jadon Sancho Heavily Involved in Celebrations The winger also had a message for his critics\n\nSancho looks to be enjoying his football once again, with his improved performances from his time in the Premier League. He is now also just 90 minutes away from potentially ending his loan spell back in Dortmund as a Champions League winner.\n\nHis joy was evident during the post-match celebrations as the Man United loanee led his teammates in a rendition of Adele's 'Someone Like You' by carrying the speaker around the dressing room before even getting up on the table. View the video below:\n\nAmong all the singing and dancing, there was plenty of time for Sancho to send a message to those that doubted him during his time at Old Trafford. He responded to an Instagram reel of Drake saying: \"To the rest of you. The non-believers, the underachievers, the tweet and deleters. You guys make me sick to my stomach.\" The Dortmund wide player added the caption 'LOL FACTS!'. View that post below:\n\nHenry and Carragher Give Their Thoughts on Sancho Pundits questioned whether Man United was the right club for him\n\nCovering the game for CBS Sports, Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry weighed in on the debate surrounding the 24-year-old, with the pair of ex-players suggesting the fit just wasn't right between the player and Manchester United. Carragher said:\n\n\"Man United fans, I'm sure, will be watching this game and thinking 'we want that player, we haven't seen that player for two years.' But that is the player they bought. Sometimes it's the kit, the feeling, the stadium, the confidence you've got and it just doesn't feel the right fit at Manchester United. That's not just for him [Sancho], that's for a lot of players.\"\n\nHenry then weighed in on the conversation, adding: \"It is not easy at times, the shirt can be heavy, the expectation, the price tag, getting used to the Town, getting used to something different. People at times underestimate all those points.\" See what the pair had to say in the below video:\n\nIt remains to be seen where the England international's future lies beyond the summer, but he will now have one huge game to focus on before even considering his options going forward. It would be an incredible redemption arc if Sancho was to lift the Champions League with Dortmund.\n\nRelated 7 Outside Shouts for England's Euro 2024 Squad as Big News Confirmed With Euro 2024

He said: \"He's [Sancho] been really good. As I said to him, it's great to have him back because we know he is a massive solution for us, as a starter, as someone to come and have great qualities to help the team.\n\n\"We all know the capacity that he [Sancho] has. He hasn't expressed it at his best yet, he's been at some moments really good.\"\n\nSancho's return was curtailed in September after a public fallout with manager Erik ten Hag. When quizzed by reporters as to why the winger was not in the squad that lost to Arsenal, the United boss claimed it was due to his training ground performances.\n\nThe 24-year-old took issue with this and claimed he had been made a 'scapegoat' by his manager. While this post was deleted, Sancho refused to apologise and was banished from first-team training.\n\nUnited's winger has since made 18 appearances for Dortmund on loan scoring three goals and grabbing two assists in the process.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_flintham@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Jack Flintham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mats_Hummels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mats Hummels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29130307.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1640391917.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547956", "eventUri": "eng-9547956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

A Dortmund win at Wembley next month will see United due another windfall too.\n\nIn a world dominated by Financial Fair Play and Profit and Sustainability Rules, any boost of any kind, especially one United won't have expected to be coming their way, will be welcome with revolution in the air.\n\nSancho helping Dortmund go this far in the tournament, with his exhilarating display in the semi-final first leg win over Paris Saint-Germain last week really catching the eye, will ensure interest only grows in a player United ideally want to cash in on fully at the end of the season.\n\nIt is understood that Sancho would be willing to give his United career another shot next season, especially if there is a new manager at the helm, given his relationship with Ten Hag is \"irreparable\".\n\nHowever, Ineos is keen to have a firesale of players in the summer to help raise the funds for their squad rebuild and Sancho represents one of the club's most sellable assets, especially after his role in guiding Dortmund to Europe's showpiece event. Another stellar showing at Wembley, before his loan deal is up on 30 June, will increase his value yet further - part of the reason he was sent on loan in the first place.\n\nHis display against PSG in Dortmund, where the 24-year-old completed the most take-ons in a Champions League match this season, reminded United fans what could have been, after the club splurged \u00a370m to bring him to Old Trafford in 2021.\n\nConsistency, however, has remained his problem back on loan at Dortmund, with the England forward only finding the net three times all season. Dortmund remain frontrunners to sign Sancho permanently in the summer nonetheless.\n\n\"Of course they are under contract with their clubs, that means we will at a specific moment get in touch and then we will see if it's possible or not. I know that the players feel pretty welcome in Dortmund, they feel at home, especially Jadon,\" Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl told TNT when asked about the prospect of signing Sancho or fellow loanee Ian Maatsen permanently.\n\n\"I think it was a quite good decision to take them.

The winger accused the latter of lying about him after he was left out of the matchday squad for the 3-1 defeat to Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nSancho was banished from all first-team activities, resulting in him returning to Dortmund for the rest of the campaign. After requiring time to get back up to speed after going several months without playing, he has excelled in recent weeks, playing a key role in helping the German club reach the Champions League final.\n\nREAD MORE: United reveal transfer stance on Jadon Sancho and Mason Greenwood\n\nREAD MORE: Controversial decision looming between two players from United dressing room\n\nDespite his recent eye-catching performances, United are still aiming to sell him in this summer's transfer window. Dortmund have already confirmed they would be interested in retaining him.\n\nSancho, regardless of the reason behind his January exit from Old Trafford, struggled to make the impact he and United had hoped for after being signed in July 2021. He failed to make a significant impact under three different managers, resulting in him scoring just 12 goals in 82 games.\n\nBut for former Aston Villa manager Lambert, who spent a year at Dortmund as a player and won the Champions League - which Sancho is hoping to emulate - the culture at the Bundesliga club suits the winger down to the ground, whereas the one at United could have been a \"nightmare for him\" to adapt to.\n\n\"At Dortmund, Sancho has gone into a really good dressing room, a good culture with good guys and he gets respect,\" Lambert told Betway. \"At United it could have been an absolute nightmare for him.\n\n\"He may have not liked the way it was or it might not have been what he thought it would be. Being back at Dortmund, with some of the players that were there when he left. He's playing with one of the biggest clubs in European football without a shadow of doubt.\n\n\"Why would he want to go back to United? He's in the Champions League semi-final, he could be a Champions League winner.\"\n\nLambert also believes Sancho's relationship with the Dortmund fans has been key to his recent resurrection.\n\n\"He has been excellent, especially against PSG,\" Lambert added. \"Saying he's having a nightmare is all British ignorance. The boy has been playing so well, just watch him.\n\n\"I think you've got to delve deeper to see how well he's playing and how he's adapted to life back at Dortmund. It might just be that the lifestyle suits him more.\n\nDortmund is every bit as big a club as United, you're getting 83,000 fans a week and if you doubled the size of the stadium they would sell that out two. Everyone wants to see that atmosphere.\n\n\"The players and fans have that rapport and I think Jadon Sancho loves that.

Manchester United are reportedly set to earn around \u00a33.4m in add-ons from Jadon Sancho's loan tenure at Borussia Dortmund, triggered by the Bundesliga club's advancement to the Champions League final.\n\nThe England international featured in both legs against Paris Saint-Germain as the German giants emerged victorious with a 2-0 aggregate scoreline, securing their place in the Champions League final for the first time since 2013.\n\nThe 24-year-old arrived at Old Trafford for a fee of \u00a373m back in 2021 but struggled to make an impact before falling out with Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag at the start of this season.\n\nAfter refusing to apologise to Ten Hag, Sancho was dropped from the first team before being loaned back to Dortmund during the January transfer window, accompanied by several financial stipulations.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nMan United set for cash windfall with Sancho reaching CL final\n\nAccording to talkSPORT, Man United included additional payment clauses in Sancho's loan deal to Dortmund, contingent upon certain achievements. Dortmund initially paid \u00a33m upfront and a portion of Sancho's wages as part of the agreement to bring him to Germany in January.\n\nThe report adds that the agreement also includes a clause stating that BVB would pay the Red Devils a further \u00a33.4m in bonus payments based on their Champions League progress and the player's appearances in the competition.\n\nIt is understood that the majority of those add-on payments have now been activated as a result of Sancho helping the side book their spot at Wembley Stadium on June 1.\n\nDortmund are believed to be eager to convert Sancho's loan move into a permanent transfer, but the player's current \u00a3290,000-a-week package could make it difficult to afford him.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nSancho future still undecided\n\nIn addition, United have yet to confirm their asking price for the player, whose current contract at Old Trafford runs until the summer of 2026.\n\nSancho scored just 12 goals and provided six assists in 82 games for United, but since returning to his former club, he has scored three goals and provided two assists in 18 appearances, with 16 of those being starts.\n\nBVB progressed through the last 16 by defeating Eredivisie champions PSV Eindhoven before overcoming La Liga giants Atletico Madrid in the quarter-finals.\n\nDortmund will discover their opponent for the final at Wembley when Bayern

He's gone back to Dortmund after leaving because Dortmund wasn't a big enough club for him to want to be at, he's gone back.\n\n\"At this moment in time, it looks like Dortmund have got something meaningful because they've got to a Champions League final, but this doesn't validate, vindicate or redeem this player because he's played a few decent games.\"\n\nJordan then continued to explain what Sancho would have to do in his eyes to be vindicated.\n\n\"What would have vindicated him would be if he'd have handled himself better. This is a player who has a consistent form of indiscipline throughout his career.\n\n\"I don't think Jadon Sancho performed for two years at Manchester United at a particularly high level.\n\n\"So no I don't think Sancho's been redeemed, I think he's a decent player, I think he was always overhyped, overinflated, we learned things at Manchester United like he doesn't have the pace to go in behind or do what he was being asked to do, but at Dortmund, he obviously feels comfortable there.\n\n\"Obviously feels like a big fish in a small pond, you take a big fish in a small pond and put him into a big pond and we see what happened to him at Manchester United.\"\n\nFor Jordan, Sancho isn't a player that United should be considering taking back, but is he right?\n\nHowever, considering how uncertain the future of the Dutchman is now looking, there could be a chance that Sancho would return to find a new manager at the club.\n\nThis could end up being one who is desperate to have the silky winger as a starter and therefore Sancho will likely return.\n\nBut as of now, there's just no outcome more likely than yet another loan for the 24-year-old potentially with the option to buy for wherever he goes.\n\nHe's rebuilt his value at Dortmund and it would be smart to let him continue doing that elsewhere given his poor career in red so far.", "source": {"uri": "unitedinfocus.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "United In Focus"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonny_maze@unitedinfocus.com", "name": "Jonny Maze", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simon Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesc_F\u00e0bregas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cesc F\u00e0bregas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talksport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talksport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Water_Gardens", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Water Gardens", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn1.unitedinfocus.com/uploads/14/2024/05/jadon-sancho-simon-jordan.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547956", "eventUri": "eng-9547956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 943, "textEnd": 950}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The Red Devils boss told reporters in September that Sancho was dropped from the matchday squad that made its way to the Emirates to face Arsenal due to his poor performances in training.\n\nIn response, the 24-year-old released a statement on social media accusing the manager of lying and making him a scapegoat.\n\nEfforts were made by club bosses to reconcile the pair but needless to say, those attempts were unsuccessful. Sancho was subsequently banished from the first team and made to train away from the senior squad.\n\nHowever, he has received a new lease of life in Germany. So far, Sancho has managed three goals and two assists in the 18 appearances he has made for Dortmund across the Bundesliga and Europe.\n\nHe played a pivotal role for the Signal Iduna Park outfit in both legs of their Champions League semi-final tie against Paris Saint-Germain. Dortmund booked their place in the final, where they will face La Liga giants Real Madrid.\n\nHowever, according to The Daily Star, Sancho has still not done enough to convince Southgate that he deserves to be part of his plans for Euro 2024.\n\nThe newspaper states, \"Gareth Southgate has no intention of handing Jadon Sancho an England lifeline ahead of the Euros.\"\n\n\"It's understood Southgate has no plans to recall Sancho and take him to the finals in Germany this summer. Southgate has a wealth of talent in the wide positions and is not prepared to risk disrupting his long-term planning by handing Sancho a shock recall.\"\n\n\"The only way Southgate will consider recalling Sancho is if he suffers a raft of injuries in that position.\"\n\nSouthgate is poised to name his provisional training squad on May 21 before trimming it down to the final 25 on the weekend of June 8/9.\n\nSancho has not played for England since missing a penalty in the Euro 2020 final against Italy at Wembley. In total, the United star has won 23 international caps and has three goals to his name in that time.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesperson.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peoples Person | MUFC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derick_kinoti@thepeoplesperson.com", "name": "Derick Kinoti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emirates Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.thepeoplesperson.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jadon-sancho-paris-saint-germain-v-borussia-dortmund-semi-final-second-leg-uefa-champions-league-2023-24-min.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547956", "eventUri": "eng-9547956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 2032, "textEnd": 2038}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 2097, "textEnd": 2103}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

However, club chiefs admit that fresh loan deals may still have to be considered.\n\nSancho has helped Borussia Dortmund reach the Champions League final and has rediscovered his form back in the Bundesliga with the club he joined United from for \u00a373million in 2021. Greenwood has scored 10 goals in 31 games for Getafe this season.\n\nBoth players are set to return to United when those temporary moves end but the plan at Old Trafford is for both to be sold in a summer of upheaval, with Ineos leading their first transfer window since taking a minority stake in the club.\n\nALSO READ: How United exile Sancho celebrated as dressing room footage emerges\n\nALSO READ: Ten Hag's argument about United's biggest weakness has been exposed\n\nA deal for Sancho could be easier to do. Dortmund are keen to bring him back to the club permanently and the 24-year-old is ready to end his Old Trafford career and re-sign for the Bundesliga outfit. Formal discussions are likely to take place once the season has ended, which for Dortmund will be at Wembley in the Champions League final on Saturday, June 1.\n\nWith United ready to sell Sancho a return to Dortmund is seen as the most straightforward deal. The two clubs have a good working relationship which was strengthened during the discussions for Sancho's loan move in January. United have now banked the majority of a \u00a36.5million loan fee as a result of their run to the Champions League final, covering the player's wages in full.\n\nBut the key to a permanent switch will be making the finances work for all three parties involved. Both United and Dortmund have FFP considerations to think of and Sancho will have to take a wage cut to make the move permanent. Dortmund's record signing is the \u20ac35million they spent on Ousmane Dembele but bringing Sancho back to the club could eclipse that.\n\nDortmund's financial position has been boosted by their qualification for next season's Champions League. They had a disappointing domestic campaign and only finished fifth in the Bundesliga, but the performances of German clubs in Europe has guaranteed them an extra place in the competition next season, which will go to Edin Terzic's side.\n\nIf Dortmund decide they can't make the finances work then United will be open to offers for Sancho, who performed superbly against Paris St-Germain in the Champions League semi-finals and has reminded the rest of Europe of his talents after a difficult spell at Old Trafford.\n\nWhile the priority is to sell both players, another loan move hasn't been ruled out for either Sancho or Greenwood and there remains a possibility the former returns to his parent club.\n\nHe was banished from the first-team group in September after a fall-out with Erik ten Hag that left the relationship between the two irreconcilable. It is possible Ineos will replace Ten Hag this summer and the new manager might want to assess Sancho, although the winger is still likely to favour a move away from the club.\n\nGetafe would like to keep Greenwood for another season but won't have the financial clout to make a move permanent or fund a higher portion of his wages. The forward has put himself in the shop window with his displays in La Liga and he has recently been linked with Atletico Madrid, Juventus and Lazio.\n\nAs an academy graduate, the 22-year-old would represent pure profit in accounting terms for United and a sale would be a major boost to the club's transfer budget this summer, with their FFP position impacted by the failure to qualify for next season's Champions League.\n\nGreenwood hasn't played for United since January 2022 and there is little chance of him being welcomed back into the fold, so if the right offer isn't received then another loan could be considered. Greenwood is under contract until 2025 but United have an option of extending it by another year if they are unable to sell him this summer.\n\nAny loan would have to be more beneficial than the deal that took him to Getafe at the end of the window last summer. That came after United abandoned plans to reintegrate Greenwood into their squad after an internal investigation into his conduct.\n\nIn February last year the Crown Prosecution Service dropped charges of attempted rape, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and controlling and coercive behaviour after a key witness withdrew and new evidence came to light. After a club investigation, United said they believed Greenwood didn't commit those offences and the player has always denied the allegations.\n\nA report yesterday claimed that two Premier League clubs have made enquiries about signing Greenwood. However, a move abroad is still the most likely option.\n\nShould United keep or sell Sancho and Greenwood?

In the tunnel beforehand, there will no doubt be a handshake and a hug for his old pal Bellingham before they get down to business.\n\nBellingham's \u00a325m move from Birmingham City to Dortmund was a shrewd one but it came at a difficult time with the world still partly locked down amid the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pair greet fellow Englishman Demarai Gray during Dortmund's clash with Bayer Leverkusen in 2021. Gray, who like Bellingham is from Birmingham, now plays in Saudi Arabia\n\nThe pair played together for England at Euro 2020, which was played in 2021 because of Covid\n\nIt was Sancho, established in the Dortmund side, who helped the teenager settle in to a new country and culture as a mentor.\n\n'Jadon is really very important for me,' Bellingham told Kicker magazine in October 2020.\n\nThe two friends go head-to-head in Dortmund training during the one season they spent playing together in Germany\n\n'Not just because he's from the same country as me or because he speaks the same language.\n\n'More importantly, it's how he puts his arm around me, but also the other young guys, how he strengthens our belief in our abilities and puts confidence in us.\n\n'He's a huge role model for English players my age. To get advice from him really means a lot to me. That helps me a lot.'\n\nWith that support, Bellingham wasted little time making himself integral to everything Dortmund did. He was a regular fixture in all three of his seasons there, always growing in influence.\n\nBoth made Gareth Southgate's Euro squad in the summer of 2021 and it was Sancho's chance to return the compliments.\n\n'The sky's the limit for the guy,' he told England's official YouTube channel at a time when Bellingham was being linked with Liverpool.\n\n'He is a great footballer, he is mature for his age, which is very surprising. I think when I was 18, I was not that mature at all!\n\n'Being at a major tournament for England, especially, is a very big thing. As you can see, he's coming on and doing his role for the team.\n\nSancho praised Bellingham on Twitter for his performance playing for Dortmund against Rangers in the 2021-22 Europa League\n\nBellingham returned the compliment a month later when Sancho scored what proved to be a consolation for Manchester United against Manchester City\n\n'He deserves it. As I said before, the sky's the limit for him and if he keeps on doing well then he can reach the top of his ability. I hope that happens.'\n\nOn their own friendship, Sancho added: 'What a guy! I remember when he came to Dortmund, it was funny because he was quite shy and quiet.\n\n'He actually said to me at the start that he thought he wouldn't like me. I don't know why but as he got to know me, he started to like me and now we are really close.\n\n'Every time I see him I always check up on him and see how he's doing.'\n\nBellingham's remarkable maturity was apparent when he was one of the first over to Sancho after his penalty miss against Italy in the Euro final.\n\nNow it was his turn to put an arm around the shoulder.\n\nSancho's Manchester United career turned into something of a nightmare but his return to Borussia Dortmund on loan has been a huge success as he's looked back to his best in yellow\n\nSancho's refusal to apologise to United boss Erik ten Hag led to his temporary Old Trafford exit\n\nShortly before that, the pair had helped Dortmund win the German Cup and celebrated together with the trophy in front of an empty Olympiastadion in Berlin, with fans still excluded because of Covid.\n\nThere has been social media encouragement and no doubt private message in the meantime. 'Jude Bellingham, what a player,' Sancho tweeted while watching Dortmund play Rangers in the Europe League in 2022.\n\n'JS, big game player,' wrote Bellingham on his Twitter account after Sancho scored in the Manchester derby the following month, prior to City winning 4-1.\n\nNow the two mates find themselves - against all odds - on opposite sides in European football's most anticipated match.\n\nTime for the true 'big game player' to step forward.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He moved back to the Bundesliga outfit on loan in January having been frozen out in Manchester after clashing with manager Erik ten Hag.\n\nPrior to that though Sancho had struggled to replicate the form he showed so regularly during his first spell at Dortmund. His exploits had a host of Europe's top clubs chasing him before those at Old Trafford eventually spent more than \u00a370million to land his signature.\n\nSancho has struggled to justify that fee, as have a host of expensive purchases in Manchester over the past decade. Now, back at Dortmund, the England international looks like the player of old and several pundits believe the situation at his parent club doesn't appear to suit him.\n\nCarragher said on CBS: \"He was brilliant wasn't he? Fantastic. He's not Dortmund's player, he's Manchester United's player, so United fans will be watching this game thinking, 'We want that player, where's that player? We haven't seen that player for two years'.\n\n\"But that is the player that they bought. Moving clubs, sometimes it's just the kit, the feeling, the stadium, the confidence that you've got... it doesn't feel the right fit at Manchester United. And that's not just for him, that's for a lot of players. At certain clubs, you just feel more yourself.\"\n\nHenry was on the same page as he added: \"It's not easy sometimes. The shirt can be heavy, the expectation, the price tag, languages... Getting used to the town, getting used to something different. You know people at times underestimate all those points.\"\n\nThe winger has rediscovered his best form back in Germany\n\nTen Hag had commented that, even before his arrival there were issues with Sancho in Manchester. The Dutchman claimed: \"We have had issues all the way through, and so you can make out his stay at Manchester United so far is not a success\".\n\nSancho though equalled 16-year-old Champions League records set by Lionel Messi during the semi-final with the German club keen to keep him if they can. A club chief said: \" I know that the players feel pretty welcome in Dortmund, they feel at home, especially Jadon.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

but this time for his defensive work.\n\nParis Saint-Germain's Champions League semi-final was supposed to be Mbappe's stage to stake his claim as the best player in the world.\n\nSancho, on loan from Manchester United, robbed the French superstar of that chance.\n\nHis skills were constantly clipped up on social media during his first spell with Dortmund and a big part of the reason United forked out \u00a373million to sign him.\n\nBut not many noted his hard work and graft and even from his highlights reel from the first leg - where he was impressive - the reaction to his display focused on his attacking play.\n\nDuring a miserable time at Old Trafford which ended with his public falling out with Erik ten Hag last September, Sancho's character has been questioned.\n\nYet Dortmund star Sancho has thrived in an environment where he is loved and encouraged.\n\nHis performances, on the biggest of stages, are making things all the more awkward and frankly embarrassing for United.\n\nSancho is now delivering on all the promise that was bundled up in his move three years ago - just back in the yellow and black of Dortmund.\n\nIn last week's first leg, Dortmund forward Sancho showed every aspect of his attacking arsenal, mazy runs, intelligent passing and quick feet as the Germans gained a crucial 1-0 lead.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS\n\nThat was still on display in the second leg but the England attacker also stood up and took responsibility by shackling Mbappe in the cauldron of the Parc des Princes.\n\nEveryone knows Sancho has the flicks and the tricks in his back pocket.\n\nBut no Dortmund player won possession more often than Sancho's seven on Tuesday night, even though he was withdrawn after 67 minutes following an almighty shift in Paris.\n\nIn fact, Sancho topped the charts for winning the ball back among the Dortmund squad across both semi-final legs - doing so on 14 occasions.\n\nTrailing to Niclas Fullkrug's winner in Germany, PSG looked for an early route back only for Sancho to get on the ball, drive forward and get his side into the game.\n\nHe successfully took on more players than anyone else on the pitch in the first half, drew fouls and took the pressure off to remarkable effect.\n\nBut, as well as providing an outlet in attack, Sancho's work off the ball was noticed.\n\nHe supported full-back Julian Ryerson efficiently in the effort to stop Parisian wonderboy Mbappe.\n\nThere will of course be encouragement at the player United may get back.\n\nBut settling back into Manchester seems a complicated process, especially if boss Ten Hag stays in post.\n\nDortmund want to offer an easy solution, though there will be complications over the finances.\n\nAnd with this form may nudge the price back up from what could have been a bargain.\n\nFor now, they will just enjoy the talents of a player back at his absolute best -

Following his refusal to apologize, Sancho was sidelined from the first team and subsequently loaned back to Dortmund during the January transfer window, with several financial terms attached.\n\nManchester United reportedly included additional payment clauses in Sancho's loan agreement, tied to specific achievements. Dortmund initially paid \u00a33 million upfront along with a portion of Sancho's wages upon his return to Germany.\n\nIt's reported that the agreement includes a clause stipulating that Dortmund must pay Manchester United an additional \u00a33.4 million in bonus payments based on their progress in the Champions League and Sancho's appearances in the competition.\n\nWith Dortmund securing their spot at Wembley Stadium on June 1, the majority of these add-on payments are believed to have been activated, showcasing Sancho's significant impact.\n\nWhile Dortmund is eager to make Sancho's loan move permanent, his current \u00a3290,000-a-week salary could pose financial challenges for the club. Manchester United has yet to disclose their asking price for the player, whose contract at Old Trafford extends until the summer of 2026.\n\nDespite a modest performance at Manchester United, where he scored 12 goals and provided six assists in 82 games, Sancho has shown improved form upon his return to Dortmund, contributing three goals and two assists in 18 appearances, with 16 of those being starts.\n\nDortmund's journey to the final saw them defeat Eredivisie champions PSV Eindhoven in the last 16 before overcoming La Liga giants Atletico Madrid in the quarter-finals.", "source": {"uri": "businessday.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Businessday NG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_nlebem@businessday.ng", "name": "Anthony Nlebem", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Darts/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Darts/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sancho-borussia-dortmund.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547956", "eventUri": "eng-9547956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1349, "textEnd": 1355}], "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

With speculations surrounding a potential permanent move from Manchester United, Dortmund boss Edin Terzic remains tight-lipped, leaving Sancho's fate to unfold after the pinnacle of European football - the Champions League final.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Away_goals_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Away goals rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_competitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA competitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01e83qyea3y6a2nhmqehmwqem7/jadon-sancho-jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547956", "eventUri": "eng-9547956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.7333333333333334, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Thomas Tuchel is among the rumoured names to be linked with potentially succeeding the Dutchman ahead of his Bayern Munich exit.\n\nThe 50-year-old has recently underlined how much he enjoyed working in England at Chelsea, whom he left in 2022 amid disagreement with owner Todd Boehly. An underwhelming domestic season with Bayern has been partially soothed by the club's Champions League campaign.\n\nALSO READ: How United exile Sancho celebrated as dressing room footage emerges\n\nALSO READ: Ten Hag's argument about United's biggest weakness has been exposed\n\nHe is a manager that would surely pique the interests of Sancho if appointed by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is not totally sold by Ten Hag as his long-term first-team boss. Three things are sure to happen if this does come to pass.\n\nRatcliffe's reckoning\n\nThe first barrier to cross is Ratcliffe's, or perhaps more aptly Dan Ashworth's, verdict on Sancho's future at Old Trafford. The hope is that a solution can be met with Newcastle for their sporting director with United unwilling to pay \u00a320m in compensation.\n\nIf either Ratcliffe or Ashworth deems the summer a chance to get money back on the \u00a373m man, then whatever Tuchel wishes becomes irrelevant. But the reality is that such a decision would be a joint call from all parties.\n\nUnited have other sellable assets that can help with Premier League spending limits, and Sancho is a player that need not be sold unless the situation offers no other outcome, one of those being if the player himself wishes to leave.\n\nBig bids\n\nAn exit for Sancho is possible, even if Ten Hag does leave. Borussia Dortmund clearly offers the right environment for him to thrive and club chief Sebastian Kehl has indicated a summer bid may be lined up.\n\nThe Yellows won't be the only club interested in the 24-year-old with the likes of Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus looking for big-name arrivals. There could be a scenario whereby a bid is tabled that is too good to resist for both player and club, albeit this is less than likely.\n\nSancho still has two years left on his United contract and given his age would still be able to command a decent fee. One place he is unlikely to end up is Saudi Arabia, having turned down an approach mid-season.\n\nTalks with Tuchel\n\nA main factor in Sancho staying will be what game-time assurances he is given - after all, his exclusion from the squad earlier this season was what sparked his rift with Ten Hag in the first place.\n\nTuchel must decide whether he wishes to keep Sancho, which he could do given his performances seen in the Bundesliga. Then, he must convince Sancho that United is still the best place for him, under a new hierarchy and manager.\n\nDespite his historical grievances with the board at Chelsea, PSG and Bayern, Tuchel has been a popular figure with players and there is every chance he could get Sancho on side. But first, if Tuchel wants the United job, he himself must convince Ratcliffe he is the right man to succeed Ten Hag given his past rapports.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isaac_johnson@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Isaac Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Boehly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Todd Boehly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Kehl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sebastian Kehl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29135010.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2151933081.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547956", "eventUri": "eng-9547956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

United were miles off the pace, with the centre-back pairing of Jonny Evans and Casemiro particularly hopeless, while Erik ten Hag stood on the sidelines unable to turn the tide.\n\nThe Dutchman could still end the campaign with silverware if United somehow overcome Manchester City in the FA Cup final on May 25. But Ten Hag's days as manager are numbered, with replacements being lined up and his judgement looking even more questionable after the exiled Jadon Sancho helped Borussia Dortmund reach the Champions League final.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS! Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!\n\nUnited are back in action against Arsenal on Sunday - quite the daunting task, even if Ten Hag can finally welcome back some injured players. It's a pretty bleak picture right now, with United in eighth place and drifting towards the end of the season. Here are the latest headlines.\n\nSancho sends blunt message\n\nWhile United didn't even make it out of their group, Dortmund will play in the Champions League final on June 1 at Wembley. Their side will likely contain Sancho, who has been enjoying himself since re-joining the club on loan from United in January.\n\nHis falling out with Ten Hag was very public and it is hard to see him returning any time soon, given how settled he looks in Germany. He wasn't shy in sharing his thoughts amid the high of the celebrations in Paris on Tuesday night.\n\nDortmund's Instagram account shared a picture of Sancho celebrating with Drake superimposed below. In the clip, Drake can be heard saying: \"To the rest of you, the non-believers, the under-achievers, the tweet and deleters... You guys make me sick to my stomach.\" Replying to the post, Sancho wrote: \"LOL FACTS!\"\n\nJadon Sancho enjoyed Dortmund's celebrations on Tuesday night\n\nUnited's financial reality\n\nUnited won't be playing in the Champions League next season - and if that is not bad enough, the financial consequences of their failure elsewhere are stark.\n\nAs Mirror Football have reported, revenue could take a \u00a3100million hit if they do not qualify for Europe at all next season. Their failure to reach the Champions League has already ensured a deficit of more than \u00a350m.\n\nThe club's quarterly financial results pointed to an expected decrease of \u00a345m in revenue for missing out on the knockout stages of the Champions League this season. Even if they do make the Europa League, the financial returns for the secondary competition are a fraction of the main show: the four semi-finalists this season have made between \u00a313m and \u00a315m.\n\nRace hots up for Greenwood\n\nTwo Premier League clubs have enquired about Mason Greenwood\n\nMason Greenwood is attracting lots of interest ahead of the summer transfer window. The Manchester United striker is on loan at Getafe, where he has 10 goals and six assists in 32 games this season.\n\nBarcelona, Juventus, Atletico Madrid and Lazio have all been credited with interest and now a fresh report says two Premier League sides have joined the queue.

The Premier League greats believe the Englishman, who has helped Borussia Dortmund to the UEFA Champions League final, does not feel settled in Manchester, which has taken a massive toll on his performances.\n\nBorussia Dortmund beat Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) 1-0 in their UEFA Champions League semi-final second leg at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday (May 7). With a 2-0 aggregate scoreline, the Bundesliga outfit booked their ticket to the final at Wembley Stadium, reaching the stage for the first time since the 2012-13 season.\n\nSancho, who joined Dortmund on a season-long loan from Manchester United in January, was quite impressive over two legs against PSG. After the second leg, Carragher and Henry discussed why he could not play with the same vigor in United's colors.\n\nThe Liverpool legend began by saying:\n\n\"He was brilliant wasn't he? Fantastic. He's not Dortmund's player, he's Manchester United's player. So, United fans will be watching this game thinking. 'We want that player, where's that player? We haven't seen that player for two years'.\n\n\"But that is the player that they bought. Moving clubs, sometimes it's just the kit, the feeling, the stadium. The confidence that you've got... it doesn't feel the right fit at Manchester United. And that's not just for him, that's for a lot of players. At certain clubs, you just feel more yourself.\"\n\nHenry chimed in, saying:\n\n\"It's not easy sometimes. The shirt can be heavy, the expectation, the price tag, languages...\n\n\"Getting used to the town, getting used to something different. You know people at times underestimate all those points.\"\n\nSince joining for a \u00a373 million ($91.17 million) fee in the summer of 2021, Sancho has played 82 games for United in all competitions, scoring 12 and providing six assists.\n\nAfter completing a campaign-best 12 dribbles in the Champions League semi-final first leg, Sancho produced another respectable performance in the return leg at the Parc des Princes. The 24-year-old never hesitated to take players on, combined flawlessly with midfielders, tracked back to recover the ball from deep, and held his own in duels.\n\nThroughout the game, Sancho attempted six dribbles, pulling off three. He also played two passes into the final third, completed 17 passes, made an impressive seven recoveries, and won four duels.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sushan_chakraborty@sportslens.com", "name": "Sushan Chakraborty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thierry Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Princes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parc des Princes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://sportslens.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/skysports-jadon-sancho-manchester-united-5696552.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547956", "eventUri": "eng-9547956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 511, "textEnd": 516}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Well, the first thing that derailed it all was the return of Cristiano Ronaldo, just a few weeks after Sancho arrived.\n\nAt first it was to much fanfare as he scored twice in the 4-1 win over Newcastle on an incredible afternoon at Old Trafford back in September 2021.\n\nThen it quickly became apparent CR7 was the square piece Solskjaer had to fit into a round hole and the whole jigsaw began to fall apart.\n\nAs the Norwegian admitted recently: \"The right thing to do was to sign Cristiano but it would have been better for him and for us if he hadn't signed.\"\n\nWhat his arrival did was curtail the progression of the three youngsters, all of whom were switched around to accommodate the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.\n\nThe trio, rather than be inspired by the United legend, ended up retreating into their shells when it soon became clear it was all about him. Then, in January 2022, came that bombshell social media posting making serious allegations against Greenwood.\n\nThe forward was immediately suspended by United.\n\nHe was subsequently charged with attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\n\nIn February last year, all charges were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Services after key witnesses withdrew.\n\nThe club then conducted their own investigation and were ready to bring Greenwood, who was still just 21-years-old, back into Erik ten Hag's squad.\n\nBut the public backlash when the news leaked was so huge that United were forced into a hasty U-turn.\n\nThere is no way back for Greenwood at Old Trafford.\n\nHe joined LaLiga side Getafe on a season-long loan in September and has won rave reviews with ten goals and six assists in all competitions.\n\nUnited hope his form in Spain will have clubs knocking on their door as they prepare to cash in. But potential suitors know the Red Devils' predicament and will not pay anything near what the 22-year-old is actually worth.\n\nThere are so many sad things about this sorry tale, including the fact Greenwood really could have gone on to be as good as Wayne Rooney.\n\nNext up, Sancho, a player who arrived with stats of 50 goals and 64 assists from 137 games for Dortmund.\n\nHe could never replicate that form for United and his questionable attitude -- which has effectively put paid to his England career -- soon led to problems at Old Trafford.\n\nIt was last September when manager Ten Hag dropped him for the 3-1 defeat at Arsenal, publicly citing poor performances in training in the run up to the match.\n\nNo problem with that, it was probably the kick up the backside Sancho needed. But as Solskjaer recently said, there are too many \"snowflakes\" in football nowadays. With some, like 24-year-old Sancho, listening to questionable advice.\n\nAfter being dropped for the Gunners clash, the forward took to X to effectively call Ten Hag a liar.\n\nHe then refused to apologise and is now back at Dortmund on loan.\n\nThey paid United \u00a33m to take Sancho, with the Red Devils possibly banking another \u00a33.4m if the Germans win the Champions League final at Wembley on June 1.\n\nTen Hag says the club have spoken to Sancho and watched him in action with a view to him returning.\n\nIt won't happen.\n\nAs for Rashford...\u2009the man who could do no wrong, seemingly can't do anything right.\n\nRashford's partying has seen him hauled into ETH's office twice now.\n\nThe pair barely speak and after 30 goals last season, the 26-year-old barely scores any more -- and now gets booed by his own fans.\n\nIf only everyone could go back to the future and start again.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors":

Factoring in the unpaid wages of Ten Hag to get him off the books would be added expense which is likely to come out of the transfer budget.\n\nBut this is where Jadon Sancho's success at Borussia Dortmund could come to Ratcliffe's aid if he is hell-bent on sacking Ten Hag. United will be receiving a fee of around \u20ac7.5m (\u00a36.45m) for the Englishman after his loan spell has gone well in Germany.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Sancho helped Dortmund reach the Champions League final and considering how many appearances he has made for the Bundesliga club, it is fair to suggest he has done enough to ensure United earn the top fee from Dortmund for his services.\n\nIt is reported by ESPN that Ten Hag's \u00a39m per year salary will be cut to \u00a36.75m after he missed out on the Champions League next season. The manager will enter the final year of his contract this year meaning United would only need to pay \u00a36.75m theoretically to part ways.\n\nThis money could be nearly fully funded by the loan fee United received for Sancho from Dortmund and would avoid any nasty Financial Fair Play (FFP) deriving from Ten Hag's sacking. With sacking Ten Hag now looking affordable, the question now is whether Ratcliffe wants to give the incumbent one final chance next season or not.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_flintham@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Jack Flintham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_competitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA competitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Financial_Fair_Play_Regulations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29128970.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1247076155.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547956", "eventUri": "eng-9547956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

He has won 23 international caps, scoring three goals along the way, but will reportedly be forced to watch from home when England go in search of continental glory this summer.", "source": {"uri": "express.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "EXPRESS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "archie_griggs@express.co.uk", "name": "Archie Griggs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_UEFA_Champions_League_final", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 UEFA Champions League final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/English_Billiards", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/English Billiards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Wallyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Wallyball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/67/1200x630/5362378.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547956", "eventUri": "eng-9547956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Edin Terzic's side lost only group-stage game despite being paired with Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and Newcastle United and, after progressing past PSV Eindhoven and Atletico Madrid in the knockout stages, were too resolute for PSG to break down in the semi-finals.\n\nThey qualified for the final at Wembley Stadium with the help of a few names known from their stints in the Premier League.\n\nSince joining the club in 2019 as an exciting young prospect, Ian Maatsen hasn't had a fair shake of it at Chelsea.\n\nThe Dutchman, who made his first-team debut for the Blues in 2019, spent time on loan with Charlton Athletic, Coventry City and Burnley during his formative years and even turned down a permanent move to the Clarets after helping them win promotion to the Premier League.\n\nHe was played out of position by current boss Mauricio Pochettino, featuring in attacking midfield and on the wing, but has made Dortmund's left-back spot his own since signing on loan in January.\n\nBVB officials have spoken of their optimism over a permanent deal for the 22-year-old and Chelsea may be tempted into selling him to recoup some cash after years of reckless spending.\n\nMarcel Sabitzer's loan to Manchester United last season was as 'blink and you'll miss it' as transfers get in the modern game.\n\nThe Austria international made the odd contribution here and there - including a brace in the ultimately fatal Europa League tie with Sevilla - but his campaign ended prematurely due to a meniscus injury.\n\nHe got lost among the myriad of stars at Bayern Munich but his talent out of possession was there to be seen in Dortmund's second 1-0 win over PSG in the semi-finals.\n\nSabitzer will need to be at his industrious best when the Champions League final rolls around at the start of June.\n\nMuch was expected of Emre Can when he joined Liverpool in 2014 for a smidge under \u00a310m. He was along for the ride as the Reds reached the Champions League final in 2018 but decided it was time for a new challenge when Juventus came calling.\n\nWhile he won Serie A following that free transfer, the Germany international was soon deemed surplus to requirements and loaned to Dortmund in January 2020 with the obligation to make the deal permanent.\n\nCan has since helped BVB win the DFB-Pokal and succeeded Marco Reus as first-team captain, nailing down a place in central midfield.\n\nPlenty of big-money strikers have tried and failed to make the grade at West Ham United. Sebastien Haller is one of them, netting ten Premier League goals in 48 appearances before enjoying a goal-laden two-season spell with Ajax.\n\nDortmund picked him up in the summer of 2022, marking his second spell in the Bundesliga after spending time with Eintracht Frankfurt, but Haller was diagnosed with testicular cancer and didn't play again until January 2023.\n\nHe was an unused substitute in Dortmund's success in Paris and has only played 51 minutes in total across three Champions League appearances this season, scoring away at Atletico Madrid.\n\nDid you know that Jadon Sancho completed roughly a billion dribbles in Dortmund's first-leg victory over PSG in the semi-finals?\n\nIt's been a remarkable turnaround for the England international, who left Man Utd acrimoniously after falling out with Red Devils boss Erik ten Hag. His stats since returning to Signal Iduna Park aren't mind-blowing, with three goals and one assist in 18 matches, but it's certainly been more productive than being frozen out at Old Trafford.\n\nThere's every chance he'll be back at United in the summer, especially if Ten Hag is given the boot after an awful season, but first Sancho will be hoping to lead his loan side to one of the all-time great Champions League triumphs.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Maatsen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ian Maatsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Sabitzer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcel Sabitzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Kalvin Phillips could benefit from a move to a club overseas as he bids to revive his career following a poor loan at West Ham. Young players like Arsenal's Emile Smith-Rowe could aim to develop into stars like how Sancho did at Borussia Dortmund. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nOver the last few years, there has been an influx of English talent moving abroad to play for teams outside of the Premier League. Some have done this to develop effectively, others have done it to rediscover their previous form. Although not every player to make that switch overseas has found success.\n\nThere have been several high-profile instances where it has worked out, though. Jude Bellingham, Jadon Sancho and Harry Kane are all three big names who moved abroad for a variety of different reasons, but they've all been overwhelming successes. First, the former moved to Borussia Dortmund from Birmingham City in 2020 and eventually switched to Real Madrid in the summer of 2023. He's been incredible in Spain too, emerging as one of the most promising prospects in all of football.\n\nSancho followed a similar path, moving to Dortmund in 2017 as a youth player to develop in Germany, but returned to England in 2021 when he joined Manchester United. After struggling with the club and falling out with Erik ten Hag, he returned to Dortmund on loan this year and has refound his old form, proving influential as they made it to the Champions League final.\n\nRelated Ranking the 16 Greatest British Players to Ever Play Abroad Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane and Gareth Bale are three British stars who have shone for foreign clubs.\n\nKane was a completely different circumstance. The striker had already established himself as one of the best players in Premier League history, but having spent his entire career with Tottenham Hotspur, he hasn't won a single trophy. To try and pick up some silverware, he left Spurs for Bayern Munich in 2023 and, while he still hasn't won any trophies, he has been incredible and has come close to breaking the Bundesliga record for most goals in a season already. In the spirit of those three stars, who all made it to the Champions League semi-finals, here are eight more English players who could use a move abroad.\n\nEnglish players who need a move abroad\n\nPlayer\n\nCurrent team\n\nKalvin Phillips\n\nWest Ham (On loan from Manchester City)\n\nJack Grealish\n\nManchester City\n\nAaron Ramsdale\n\nArsenal\n\nMarcus Rashford\n\nManchester United\n\nEmile Smith Rowe\n\nArsenal\n\nRaheem Sterling\n\nChelsea\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka\n\nManchester United\n\nEddie Nketiah\n\nArsenal\n\nKalvin Phillips West Ham United (On loan from Manchester City)\n\nJust a few short years ago, Kalvin Phillips looked destined to become one of the best defensive midfielders in the world. His work with Leeds United after the Yorkshire club was promoted to the Premier League showed signs of greatness, and he caught the attention of numerous clubs. He eventually moved to Manchester City and his career has fallen apart as a result.\n\nA loan move to West Ham United this season was a chance to get back to his best, but it hasn't worked out for Phillips and with the season coming to an end, his time at the Hammers has been a major disappointment. Having struggled at two established Premier League clubs in a row now, a change of scenery and country might be the best course of action.\n\nThe midfielder is still just 28 years old, so there is still time to turn things around and a move to an elite Serie A side fighting for European football would be a smart move for him. He would be well-suited to the defensively rigid style of play in the league.\n\nJack Grealish Manchester City\n\nPlaying for City can be difficult. You could be one of the best attacking midfielders in the league and still find playing time hard to come by. That's been the case for Jack Grealish over the last couple of years. The former Aston Villa man has been solid for Pep Guardiola's side, but due to the number of players occupying those roles in the side, he hasn't been positioned as a focal point.\n\nHis numbers have taken a hit as a result, and Grealish is now underappreciated and underrated by fans of the sport. His chances with England in future international tournaments have been hurt as well, so if he wants to remind the world of how good he is, the 28-year-old would be wise to consider a move. It's hard to imagine City would let him go and significantly strengthen the front line of one of their Premier League rivals, but a move abroad could be smart. Grealish in Germany playing for someone like Borussia Dortmund or Bayer Leverkusen would be very enticing, and he'd be allowed to flourish and force his way back into the England picture.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: With just 20 Premier League appearances this season, Jack Grealish is on course to play his fewest league games in a campaign since 2015/16 (17).\n\nAaron Ramsdale Arsenal\n\nLast year, Aaron Ramsdale had the world at his feet. With Arsenal, he'd established himself as the number-one goalkeeper at one of the best teams in England, but the arrival of David Raya last summer has thrown his career into a tailspin. He's lost his place in the Gunners' line-up to the Spaniard and rumours of a move away from the Emirates have begun to surface online.\n\nThere's a strong possibility that Ramsdale could move to another Premier League team, he's played for three already, but it might be smarter for him to take a look overseas instead. Some of the biggest clubs in Europe, Inter Milan, Juventus, Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig all have number-one goalkeepers who are well beyond 30 years old, and they'll all need to find a successor soon. Ramsdale could be the man for one of them.\n\nMarcus Rashford Manchester United\n\nAfter several impressive seasons at Manchester United, it might be time for Marcus Rashford to call it a day and consider a move away. The Englishman hasn't had the best of seasons this time around, and it's drawn the ire of a significant amount of supporters. Recently, the forward even took to social media to speak out about the level of abuse he'd received from fans. It's a far cry from the incredible year he had last time out.\n\nThe team have been a mess this season, though, and he's been one of their biggest issues. He's been nowhere near his best and a move abroad might be the best port of call for him going forward. Like Sancho, this struggling United winger could head overseas and rebuild his reputation with one of Europe's elite. Whether it's in Spain, Italy or Germany, who doesn't want to see what Rashford can do away from the Red Devils? At this point, even a large portion of their own fanbase would probably welcome it.\n\nRelated Manchester United's 2023/24 Squad Ranked Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Jadon Sancho all feature as GIVEMESPORT ranks Man United's players into six categories. Emile Smith Rowe Arsenal\n\nAt one time, it looked like Emile Smith Rowe would be an influential attacker for Arsenal for years to come. During the 2021/22 campaign, the 23-year-old played 37 times and scored 11 goals for the Gunners. In the two years since, he's played 32 times and not scored once. It's been a dramatic fall of form and his status with Mikel Arteta's side isn't quite as solid as it once looked.\n\nHe's still just 23 years old, but rather than waste these crucial seasons of development playing a bit part role for Arsenal, with regular minutes hard to come by, Smith Rowe needs to consider his future and moving overseas is the move to make. Heading to the likes of Atalanta or Eintracht Frankfurt would give him the chance to compete towards the top end of a table, but also allow him to play his own game and get back to where he was.\n\nRaheem Sterling Chelsea\n\nDespite having a solid enough season for Chelsea, it doesn't feel as though Raheem Sterling has ever truly connected with the Blues faithful. The winger has scored 17 times since he arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2022, but it's been during a period of turmoil for the team. With the sheer number of young talent that they've spent big money on recently, it stands to reason to assume he won't be expected to play a key role for the side in the future.\n\nAs a result, Sterling should consider heading abroad and playing with freedom as he recovers the sort of form that made him one of England's most important figures in recent international tournaments. It's easy to forget, but the former Manchester City man is still just 29 years old and has several elite seasons still ahead of him if he plays his cards right.\n\nOf course, he could still do a job in the Premier League, but having already played for three of the 'big six', it's hard to imagine where he'd go. With that said, there are numerous clubs in Europe's top five leagues that could do great things with a player of Sterling's talent.\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka Manchester United\n\nWhen he broke through at Crystal Palace, Aaron Wan-Bissaka looked nailed on to become one of the best English right-backs in the game. Early on, there were debates on whether he or Trent Alexander-Arnold was the superior talent. Several years later, and that all looks rather silly now. After earning a huge move to Old Trafford, the full-back hasn't had the best of times.\n\nWan-Bissaka hasn't come close to the level of player that United thought they were getting when they spent \u00a350m on him in 2019, and through a combination of injuries and the coach's choice, he's been limited to just 19 league games this season. He's still just 26 and while rumours of a move away from Old Trafford have been circulating for a while, this feels like the right time for the star to seek a transfer, but it should be abroad.\n\nRelated Man Utd Star Wan-Bissaka has 'Genuine Interest' From Inter Manchester United right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka has attracted admiring glances from Serie A ahead of the transfer window reopening\n\nHis pace down the right flank would cause nightmares for the opposition in a number of different leagues. All he has to do is look at what a move to Spain did for Kieran Trippier, or a move to Italy did for Ashley Young, to see the benefits a spell abroad can have for a talented right-back.\n\nEddie Nketiah Arsenal\n\nThings have just never really happened for Eddie Nketiah. Coming out of the Arsenal academy, it seemed like only a matter of time before he became a top-class forward for the club. It hasn't panned out that way, though, and at 24 years old, he seems no closer to solidifying his spot in the club's starting line-up than he was four years ago.\n\nNketiah is a talented striker, though, there's no doubt about that. He could do a job for several clubs right now, and a potential switch overseas could be huge for his development. There are a number of teams that need a goalscorer, and while he's never been the most prolific, a move abroad could be the perfect recipe for the Gunner to finally realise that part of his game.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Transfermarkt and accurate as of 09.05.2024", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Today's call is being recorded. A replay of the call will be accessible until May 22, 2024 by dialing 1800-9382-488, and entering the replay access code 24995 or by visiting the company's website at www.permianres.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Hays (LON:HAYS) Mabry, Permian Resources, Vice President of Investor Relations for some opening remarks. Please go ahead, Mr. Mabry.\n\nHays Mabry: Thanks, Bo, and thank you all for joining us on the company's first quarter 2024. On the call today are Will Hickey and James Walter, our Chief Executive Officers; and Guy Oliphint, our Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday, May 7, we filed a Form 8-K with an earnings release reporting first quarter results. We also posted an earnings presentation to our website that we will reference during today's call. I would like to note that many of the comments during this earnings call are forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties that could affect our actual results and plans. Many of these risks are beyond our control and are discussed in more detail in the risk factors and the forward-looking statements sections of our filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-K, which is expected to be filed later this afternoon. Although we believe the expectations expressed are based on reasonable assumptions, they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially. We may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures that help facilitate comparisons across periods and with our peers. For any non-GAAP measure, we use a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure that can be found in our earnings release or presentation, which are both available on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Will Hickey, co-CEO.\n\nWilliam Hickey: Thanks, Hays. I truly believe that the first quarter was the most compelling quarter Permian Resources has delivered so far. We were able to deliver production and free cash flow above our expectations. Close out the integration of Earthstone ahead of schedule while increasing our annual synergy target by 50 million and continue to execute on accretive A&D with approximately 270 million of acquisitions announced this year. It takes an incredible team to deliver such strong execution quarter after quarter, and I look forward to sharing some more detail on Q1 today. Moving into quarterly results, I'm pleased to announce Q1 production exceeded expectations. The total production of 320,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and oil production of 152,000 barrels of oil per day. Our strong production was attributable to multiple factors, including accelerated Earthstone D&C efficiencies and higher operational runtimes. Strong production results in CapEx of 520 million in the quarter resulted in adjusted operating cash flow of 844 million or $1.09 per share, an adjusted free cash flow of 324 million or $0.42 per share. We remain highly focused on sustaining a strong balance sheet with leverage of approximately one times an increased liquidity to over 2 billion. As part of our regularly scheduled spring bank redetermination process, we increased aggregate lender commitments under the credit facility from 2 billion to 2.5 billion while maintaining a borrowing base of 4 billion. Turning to return of capital. Our strategy remains consistent. We delivered on our previously announced increased base dividend of $0.06 per share, a 20% increase from previous quarters. For the variable portion of our return of capital, first, we repurchased a total of 2 million shares in the quarter. The remainder of our capital return will we paid out via a variable dividend of $0.14 per share, bringing the all-in quarterly return of capital to $0.24 per share. Now I'd like to spend a little time talking about the efficiencies and synergies that impacted the business in such a positive way this quarter. We rolled out the Earthstone acquisition. We are highly confident that we could reduce drilling days and completion days and improve production operations, driving material synergies to be fully realized by year end 2024. We have already achieved that and more. In just under five months, we've high graded all legacy Earthstone rigs and completion crews. This combined with PR best practices help drive an 18% product reduction in Earthstone drilling days per well and approximately 50% production -- reduction in completion days per well in the first quarter, which we were initially anticipating achieving by midyear 2024. Additionally, we are seeing some efficiency gains in the Midland Basin that were not originally forecasted, which is a testament to our team's ability to unlock value in new assets quickly. In addition, runtimes improved as a result of better compression performance, optimized artificial lift and improved chemical programs. The combination of accelerated activity and better runtimes was the primary driver of the strong production performance in Q1. The impact of the combined PR team's integration execution is that we have already achieved 175 million per year of synergies and are increasing our synergy target to an annual run rate of 225 million. As I mentioned earlier, the main drivers this increase are operational. For DC&F, we increased our per well savings from 1.2 million to 1.5 million. Similarly, we expect to be able to improve margins by approximately $1 per BOE by year end, but we've already implemented strategy in the field to realize the majority of this improvement today. Drivers of the margin improvement include reduced trucking, upgraded electrical infrastructure, rationalizing vendors, and optimizing midstream agreements. Integrations are never easy, but what our team accomplished over the last six months is a testament to a lot of hard work and dedication, and we're proud to say that Earthstone is fully integrated. With that, I'll turn it over to James to talk to A&D and an update on our '24 plan.\n\nJames Walter: Thanks, Will. I would like to quickly reiterate what we led off with today. That PR's results this quarter are the best results we have had as a public company, and that applies to every department and every discipline at Permian Resources. This now marks our seventh consecutive quarter of strong operational execution as a public company and our ninth year as a leading operator of the Delaware Basin. We are highly focused on continuing to increase our track record of consistent results and low-cost operations. Our team is firing on all cylinders, positioning us very well for the remainder of the year, while successfully executing in the field and wrapping up the integration of Earthstone, our business development and land teams continue to source, evaluate, and close attractive deals in and around our enhanced footprint. Our overall objective when it comes to A&D is to target acquisitions that enhance the quality of our business and drive value for shareholders. For us, that means seeking out acquisitions that increase the quality and duration of our current inventory at prices that make sense, in our recent acquisitions achieve all of these goals. Yesterday after market closed, we announced two separate bolt-on transactions directly offset our Legacy Parkway asset in Eddy County. This asset is characterized by low D&C costs and high oil cuts that make it one of the most capital efficient assets in our portfolio. This is why we're so excited to bolster our position here with the addition of high quality, high [Indiscernible] locations that immediately compete for capital. In addition to these bolt-ons remains highly active on the grassroots side of the business, completing approximately 150 smaller transactions ahead of the [Joel bed]. These smaller deals target near term development or amongst the highest rate of return acquisitions that we find. All in these transactions add over 11,000 net leasehold acres and approximately 110 gross operated locations for a purchase price of 270 million of which we expect 245 million to be paid in the second quarter. After accounting for production value, this works out to a little less than 10,000 per net leasehold acre and approximately $1 million per gross location or 1.5 million per net location. Our presence in Midland has been one of the key drivers of our successful acquisition program, and the vast majority of the acres we are acquiring in today's announcement come from Midland based counterparties who we have longstanding relationships with. As well mentioned earlier in the call, our team's successful execution has reduced our drilling and completion times, allowing us to bring barrels forward into Q1 and increase overall production per the year. As such, we are increasing our standalone production guidance to 150,000 barrels of oil per day and 320,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This represents a 2% increase compared to our original guidance ranges with no change to CapEx or other guidance categories. Coming off this acceleration of production in the first quarter, we anticipate a relatively flat production profile in the second quarter with modestly lower standalone production in the second half of the year. The slight decline is driven by normal course fluctuations and working interests that occurred during a large-scale development program. The revised guidance outlined on Slides 10 and 14 reflect Permian Resources standalone projections, and do not include the impact of the acquisitions we're announcing today. We expect those acquisitions to add an average of approximately 3,500 BOE a day during the second half of the year. Given the high-quality inventory of the acquired assets, we do expect to begin development in the second half of the year, which we anticipate result in $50 million of incremental CapEx. In summary, this is a terrific start to the year, and we are proud of what we've accomplished so far in 2024. I'd like to conclude today's prepared remarks in Slide 11, which helps to reemphasize our value proposition for current and future investors. We think that the announcement today really highlights the quality of Permian Resources business and the multi-prong approach we have to driving out outside shareholder value. Since the company was formed in two, in 2022, we have delivered best in class returns for our sector amounting to over three times the annualized return of the s and p 500 during that same time period. Our performance of the last two years has been driven primarily by low cost execution and a transactions, and as a result, PR remains a compelling value within large capital oil and gas, particularly when recognizing the Permian Resources is now the second largest Permian true plan in the sector. Thank you for tuning in today. And now we'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this morning to Neal Dingmann at Truist Securities.\n\nNeal Dingmann: Nice job. My first question, James, maybe on your DNC plan for you or will correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe you're currently running about 11, 12 rigs, three to four spreads, or about the same as PR and Earthstone was separately. And I'm just wondering, given your notable continued efficiencies that you certainly highlighted today, I'm just wondering, and I believe the goal of relatively flat production maybe could you or will talk about potential to drop rigs or spreads or maybe just how you see the maintenance plan on a go forward.\n\nJames Walter: I think you're right. Like if you think about the plan this year, we were originally saying we drill about 250 wells and the kind of, we thought that would take about 12 rigs. With the efficiencies we're seeing today, I think it's very realistic that we could continue to execute on the same plan with less whether that's 11 rigs or kind of somewhere between 11 and 12, I think is, if we can keep these efficiencies, is very much on the table. If you think back to kind of the Colgate -- merger, it's a very similar playbook. If you think originally that was an eight-rig combined business that we were able to get down to six with the same level of efficiency. We've done this before. I do think it's worth calling out is we're not solving for kind of some maintenance plan or production per kind of the last part of your question. It's much more just an input of what's the return environment, what's the macro look like from a supply demand perspective and what does service cost look like so that we can -- what the production does is more of an output. If we continue to see strong service or strong oil prices and reduced service costs, I think it's very, very real that we could decide to kind of keep the 12 rigs or even add rigs from here to go grow production. But what you see in kind of our revised guide is more of that stick to the 250 well, and there's a real chance we could do that with less equipment.\n\nNeal Dingmann: And then secondly, just quick on the bolt-ons, such as the recent two that you all highlight on specifically, you all seem just to have, continue to have better success adding these creative bolt-ons, versus it just seems like I don't see as many of your peers being able to do this. I'm just wondering what are the keys behind this and can you kind of continue at this pace of adding a couple, two, three, it seems like almost every quarter.\n\nJames Walter: Yes. Thank you. I think that's a pretty easy answer. I mean, I think first and foremost, it's something we're focused on that we prioritize and it's something we've done for a long time and have and continued to be really good at. And I think that's driven, it should give by a couple of things. I think first and foremost, we have the lowest cost structure in the Delaware Basin, which allows us to earn higher returns on the same assets. And as a result, kind of naturally over time assets like these do just flow to the low cost operator. I would say second, we're based in Midland, that's the heart of the Permian, the heart of the deal flow, and we've got a great reputation across the market of being good partners that people want to be across the aisle from on the transaction side. And that goes a long way. And finally for today's example, I mean, this is really cool and we're buying in an area where I think we do have a unique edge from activity and therefore the information side of things, we have more rigs running in this area than anybody else, and therefore more proprietary data to pull from better understandings, et cetera. So, I think you take all that together and it does feel like something that is definitely sustainable and edge will continue to have, well we do this every quarter, probably not, but something we expect kind of over the long term to continue to be a big part of the story.\n\nOperator: We go next now to John Freeman at Raymond James.\n\nJohn Freeman: When I'm looking at slide six and seven and just these huge efficiency gain that you all continue to get out, the legacy Earthstone properties, and I'm just trying to get a sense of what maybe that remaining gap is, if any, between kind of legacy Earthstone and PR on whatever metrics you all want to cite cost per foot or whatever. But when I look at all the different, the drilling days, the completion date, the production downtime, just some sense of how that compares to PR. Just trying to see if there's still any gap left.\n\nJames Walter: I think on the D&C side, the gap is very small, if not kind of non-existent at this point. We are -- we have different efficiencies and different assets in different areas, but we kind of view different areas whether, whether it's legacy Earthstone or legacy PR no longer matters, it's more, it's all PR. And I think on the D&C side, that gap is closed. Where I think there's still some room is on the LOE side. We've made tremendous progress in a short amount of time of improving margins through kind of what we've done on the contract side, but also just reducing LOE. But a lot of the other LOE stuff, think like SWD disposal agreements or recycling agreements have some time to them and require more work and more time to get fully incorporated. So as I think about kind of where the last kind of gap remains between legacy Earthstone and PR would be more LOE focused, if that makes sense.\n\nJohn Freeman: That's perfect. Thanks. And then just the follow up for me. Gas takeaway's been pretty topical, with what's going on at Waha. Just any sort of updated thoughts from you all and how you all are thinking about gas takeaway and how to address that longer term?\n\nJames Walter: Yes, I mean I think, I mean, I think it's pretty obvious to either run the call pricing at Waha has been challenged this year and probably will be until we get closer to new pipes coming online in the fourth quarter. And I think that is what it is. We're fortunate that dry gas only makes up about 5% of our revenue in any given year, so the business really isn't affected. But I think kind of worth pointing out a couple other things, only about half of our gas is exposed to Waha pricing this year. Kind of other half is either covered by attractive basis hedges or sales at better regional hubs today. But yes, something we're always trying to kind of focus on and work on. We sell about a quarter of our gas at hubs other than -- today, and are constantly looking to find ways we can get that percentage higher. We actually have a contract probably get signed in the next week or two that should allow us to get more volume sold at Houston pricing kind of next year. So kind of more to come on that front. I'd say that's something we've been working on for a long time and continue to chip away at. But I think the most important thing is, we've got awesome partners on the midstream side. We've got firm capacity and our molecules are going to flow even if we saw regional constraints later this year.\n\nOperator: We go next now to Scott Hanold at RBC.\n\nScott Hanold: I was wondering if we can go back to sort of the outlook through the balance of the year, and just holistically how you guys like to think about the business? Obviously, your cycle times are improving, so you pulled for a little bit more of your activity and production in 1Q. And so like, you kind of said it does taper and you have a soft decline in the back half of this year. But how do you think about like the setup then for '25 with that? Would you guys, or into '25 and over the long term, like to see more kind of flattish growth, do you want to see some more moderate growth? And if you could talk about like any kind of cadence variability through the year is would you like to see keep things constant or do you think there will be some cadence depending on the cycle times?\n\nWilliam Hickey: I mean first and foremost kind of as we think about the trajectory from a production perspective of the company, I've said it many times, I'll say it again, like it really is returns driven input and production is just an output. Obviously, kind of in over the last -- two weeks ago, I'd say the returns environment was extremely good, and we've made some headway on the service cost side kind of over the balance of the year. So it was looking good. I think that today it's still good but not quite as good as it was a few weeks ago. And I don't yet know what the world will look like six months from today as we go into '25. I would say that kind of the really, if you think about what happened over the course of this year so far is it's just been the whole set schedule has shifted forward. We've drilling wells faster, we're completing wells faster and as such kind of just given the natural working interest changed over large scale development, the back half of the year are really kind of dip is just really a little bit less working interest under a few wells that moved in from the next year. And that naturally corrects itself. Said differently if we maintain the same pace, kind of call it 250 to 260 wells per year, like that actually does set up for a really good '25. It's kind of a slight decline back half of the year and then bounces back in '25. I'm not saying that is our plan. We we're going to spend a lot of time over the next six months figuring out exactly what to want to do to '25, and I think it could be anywhere from 11 to 13 rigs based on commodity prices. And we'll kind of see what it makes sense there. But as I think of -- I wouldn't think of this kind of slow tapering back half of the year as an indication of kind of future trajectory of the production profile in outer years.\n\nGuy Oliphint: This plan's great, it sets us up like we always try to do, it's really good optionality because we don't know what the world's going to look like in '25 and it kind of puts us somewhere in the middle of that 0% to 10% growth of the long term that we've talked about and we can make a decision as we get closer to that year.\n\nScott Hanold: In your prepared comments, you also mentioned that you're seeing some better performance or efficiencies in the Midland and that sounds like you weren't necessarily expecting. Could you a little color and context behind exactly what that is and where the benefits were? Was it more well productivity or is it cycle times or just cost reductions on OpEx.\n\nJames Walter: It's really just D&C CapEx, we were -- we have not drilled a lot of wells in the Midland basins, so didn't expect to be able to cut kind of near the amount of cost on the Midland Basin size we have on the Delaware. And we've been surprised to the upside in that regard. I still think we have a ways to go to catch up with where kind of the leading operators in the Midland Basin are on from a CapEx perspective, but we've made big strides that kind of surprised us to the upside.\n\nScott Hanold: And was that more on just the cycle times drilling and completion time of those walls?\n\nJames Walter: I would say it's just cycle times casing design, kind of everything that would lead to a lower CapEx per foot on a Midland basin.\n\nOperator: We're next now to Gabe Daoud at TD Cowen.\n\nGabe Daoud: Understand it's certainly a little bit too early to be thinking about '25, but I guess just piggybacking of Scott's question here, if we just think about all the synergy capture and efficiency gains and maybe this year being a little bit heavier on midstream spend or infrastructure spend, I should say, is it fair to assume maybe '25, assuming similar activity levels CapEx is probably a bit lower than where we are today?\n\nJames Walter: Yes, I think kind of certainly maintenance CapEx would be lower than what we've outlined this year, just kind of given where the business sits, the efficiency we achieve, et cetera. I think, that's definitely a fair assumption.\n\nGabe Daoud: Great. And then maybe as a follow up noted or talked about egress a bit just curious in that Northern New Mexico area in both Eddie and Lee, are you seeing any processing capacity tightness or any other ministry managers that are worth mentioning or recognize there's no rigs over in Eddie County just yet? Is that driven by constraints at all or are you guys just planning on getting after that in the second half of this year?\n\nJames Walter: Yes, I mean, I think the kind of lack of rigs in any area today is just driven by our focus on doing some of these larger developments and making sure when we put rigs on it, we're doing it as quickly, as efficiently as possible and touching kind of all parts of the cube that need to be co-developed. So, but I think macro wise, gas processing constraints, it actually feels really good this year. I think last year we'd mentioned before probably Q2, Q3 timeline there were more challenges on the processing, but even more kind of infield compression and kind of plumbing issues in the middle of last year. But those have all really resolved themselves. I'd say our midstream partners have done a ton of work and spent a ton of money and our gas processing in the New Mexico, Delaware feels like it's a great spot today and frankly thankful not to have any constraints of that nature or really anything else kind of able to do what we want up there.\n\nOperator: We'll go next now to Derrick Whitfield at Stifel.\n\nDerrick Whitfield: Congrats on a strong update. With my first question I wanted to lean in on your D&C efficiencies to better understand the rate of improvement you're seeing. If we were to compare PR to PR on slide six, how do those cycle times in the Northern Delaware compare with your Q4 averages.\n\nJames Walter: PR from Q4 to Q1, we've got into better, but it's going to be kind of single digit percent improvement as compared to the big improvement you see if you compare legacy or send to PR.\n\nDerrick Whitfield: Great. And then maybe shifting over to slide nine, the identified location count of 110 gross locations appears conservative to us on the surface. Can you offer any color on the degree of legacy operator development and your general underwriting assumptions for this part of the basin?\n\nWilliam Hickey: I'd say, it's a good question and very astute. I think answer your second question first. It's pretty undeveloped in acreage position, if there's a handful of wells on it. But it's as undeveloped as any asset we've looked at in a long time, which is great 'cause it allows us to come in, take advantage of clean fairways and kind of do what PR does. Best regards to inventory. I think it probably is conservative, I think we're trying to book locations that we have a very high degree of competence in here and is it more likely to have more zones kind of come into the money here? I think the answer's probably yes, but we feel good about what we've put out is that being a real base case and something that we can stand behind.\n\nOperator: We'll go next now to Leo Mariani at Roth MKM.\n\nLeo Mariani: I wanted to dig in a little bit to your comments around kind of flattish second quarter production and then kind of slightly lower in the second half. If I heard your comments right, it sounded like a lot of this was just based on working interest changes. I was hoping maybe you could kind of quantify some of that. I mean, I think you guys are talking about 75% average work in interest, but maybe it's a little higher in the first half and lower in the second. Just any help on that would be great.\n\nGuy Oliphint: I think it's just kind of normal fluctuations when we're running a multi rig program like this, especially as you're kind of stacking rigs to pursue the full field development strategy that we've been pursuing for a long time. Like one quarter, maybe 70%, one may be 80% to get back to an average of 75% and just kind of how it is. I think you see this especially kind of overtime as you have more concentration of rig counts on particular developments, but it's all normal and, and kind of evens out over time.\n\nLeo Mariani: But it definitely sounds like working interest is a little higher in the first and a little lower in the second half. And then how would that translate into CapEx? Would that basically give you a CapEx a little lower in the second half, standalone versus first half?\n\nOliver Huang: Wanted to start on the A&D side. I can't help but notice you all have been fairly active in this area of Edie County. Kind of looking back at where the Q1 Bolton from the latest two transactions announced last night to sit. Just kind of wondering if you all might be able to speak to, if there's anything specific that you're seeing in the area that's driving an increased focus from an a perspective for you all.\n\nWilliam Hickey: That's a great question and I think kind of post-closing of Earthstone to today, we just saw a real market window where we were able to go buy four extremely attractive bolt-ons and quite a few grassroots deals at prices that were really attractive to us. And I think the reason we were able to do so, which I touched on a little bit with Neal's question at the beginning was because we've been the most active operator in this part of Eddy County for a long time, and therefore had a lot of really exciting proprietary results both on kind of zones, well performance, and I think most importantly the cost side or we're doing this cheaper up here than I think anybody would expect. Kind of just the unique, it's kind of one of those windows that we saw an opportunity and we hit it hard and I think these are some of the best deals we've done. It wasn't -- I didn't think we'd get all of these deals the way we did, but it's a great outcome and it adds some really core inventory and what's our most capital efficient asset.\n\nOliver Huang: And for my follow up, just kind of wondering if you all could provide an update on your royalty position. It seems like an aspect of the business where you all have been able to pick up some decent interest of the past nine months or so, that's kind of going under the radar. So any color there would be helpful.\n\nJames Walter: Yes, I mean, I think we're always trying to buy acreage and inventory that competes for capital. And a big part of that is what is the royalty burden. So we target assets that have advantage in our eyes, lower royalties that really just help our capital efficiency. I think today we've got a royalty business that we're really proud of, kind of 75,000 net royalty acres is not insubstantial. I don't think there's anything strategic that we have planned with that today, but I do think that's a big part of our capital efficiency story. We're getting more fee free cash flow for every dollar of CapEx that we spend as a result. So I think, ultimately it's something that just makes our widget better and helps our value creation increase over time. So it's something that we're proud of, we're focused on, I think probably a little underappreciated by the market and, but it's really ultimately comes down to helping us earn better returns on every dollar that we spend.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We go next now to Geoff Jay at Daniel Energy Partners.\n\nGeoff Jay: I was just looking for you referenced your power infrastructure build outs would kind of love to hear what's happening there, what the scale of that is, how big that's going to be for you guys. It's obviously kind of a pressing issue these days.\n\nJames Walter: Yes, look, line power in in the kind of entire Permian's tough in Texas it's tough and in New Mexico's tough. So, we're trying our best to stay in front of it. I'd say kind of as you think about our power needs, if we can be on line power, that's obviously preference. And after that, if we can kind of leverage natural gas power generators is probably the second-best answer. And that's kind of what you'll see for the majority of our New Mexico infrastructure. But it's a priority for us. I'd say, we are actively looking at ways to improve that position collaborating with others to look at building incremental substations and really anything we can do. But it doesn't come quick and I think it'll be a challenge for the industry for the next few years. I don't think it means we won't be able to produce our wells. It's just a little bit less efficient to be on natural gas power generators than it would be to be all online power.\n\nOperator: We'll go next now to Paul Diamond with Citi.\n\nPaul Diamond: Just a quick one, talking about the kind of acquisition pipeline as you're seeing looking forward to kind of what's next. Are you seeing any kind of movement on the bid asks, based on scale, location, or is it all pretty much pretty cohesive and correlated?\n\nJames Walter: Look, I mean I think our pipeline on the A&D side feels really good. I think there's a lot of -- there tend to be lots of opportunities in the Delaware and I think our position as a kind of preferential party for a lot of sellers and a low cost operate in the basin position as well as assets come for sale, kind of both marketed deals which we participated in successfully, but also, I think just importantly kind of off market assets, which has been a large chunk of our acquisition program historically. But it feels good. I don't think, there's probably not the size of deals that you saw hitting the market in '22 and '23 in the Delaware, which I think we largely stayed on the sidelines from. But I think we're seeing a lot of stuff that fits kind of the grassroots side is maintaining lot momentum and we're still seeing lots of bolt-ons probably coming down the pipe this year where we wind up acquiring all of them definitely not, but are there some that could fit? I'd like to think so, but we're really picky and we want to buy assets, like I said, that make our business better and that earn a high rate of return and drive value for shareholders. If we can continue to do that, that's great, but we've said it before, we don't need to do anything. We think we've got an incredible inventory base and incredible standalone business. If we can find those opportunities, we'll be excited to pursue them, but certainly don't feel any pressure to do so.\n\nPaul Diamond: And just a quick follow-up, so thus far, you guys have been pretty balanced with your shareholder return framework. Is there anything you guys are seeing in the markets that would kind of tip that scale one way or the other?\n\nWilliam Hickey: No, we're going to kind of naturally bias towards the dividend. I think that the variable dividends are our base case and we'll be opportunistic on potentially increasing share buybacks at some point in the future if kind of dislocations and large opportunities exist. But no, I'd say really steady as she goes on the capital return strategy. Do think it's worth mentioning? We did show a 20% increase in our base dividend this year, which should hit for the quarterly dividend payment upcoming and a nice increase in our variable cash dividend as well. It feels like that's working really well and we're excited about it.\n\nOperator: We'll go next now to Kevin MacCurdy at Pickering Energy Partners.\n\nKevin MacCurdy: To follow-up on an earlier question about M&A, your last couple of deals have been concentrated in the Northern Delaware. Just kind of a general question on how you are viewing opportunities in the southern Delaware versus the northern Delaware. Are there, as many opportunities out there and how do you kind of compare the two of them?\n\nWilliam Hickey: I think that's a great question. I think looking back historically, the kind of first consolidation wave in the Delaware was Texas focused. If you think like 2017, 2018, 2019 a lot of Texas businesses and that's where the Delaware got started at least activity was faster to begin. So I think you've seen a natural consolidation wave in the Delaware as of late. I think for us specifically we got a great Texas position today with some really high return to go forward drilling to do. If we could find opportunities in Texas that compete for capital, like what we've seen in New Mexico, we'd be really excited about it. I think those opportunities do still exist. I just think kind of the majority of assets that we've seen that fit what we're trying to do from a making the business better standpoint have been in New Mexico the last couple of years. But I think that could change and we'd be really excited if we could find similar opportunities on the Texas side.\n\nKevin MacCurdy: And changing gears a little bit, you mentioned an additional 3,500 barrels a day equivalent and an additional $50 million of capital once you close the bolt on acquisitions later this quarter. Just to clarify, is the 350, or -- sorry, the 3,500 barrels a day flowing, is that flowing production now? And if so, what will be the production impact of the additional $50 million capital spent?\n\nWilliam Hickey: That production is online now. The majority of that's from an acquisition we haven't closed and don't close to the end of this quarter. It's kind of online now, but it's not ours, if you will. And then $50 million is CapEx that we're going to spend in the back half of this year. That awesome, awesome high return inventory. Really excited to get our hands on. Again, we don't own it today so we can't get --again. All the production you'd see from that's going to show up next year, but really strong returns and something we're excited to get after as soon as we can get our hands on the asset.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, it appears we have no further questions this morning. Mr. Walter, I'd like to turn things back to you, sir, for any closing comments.\n\nJames Walter: I haven't gotten up to a great start in 2024. Our primary goal remains the same as it was when we announced at Colgate Centennial merger in May of 2022. To maximize shareholder value over the long term. And to do that, we plan to continue to build on our track record of delivering consistent results with the lowest cost structure in the Delaware Basin. Thanks to everyone for joining the call today and for following the Permian Resources story.\n\nOperator: Thank you, gentlemen. Again, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's Permian Resources first quarter earnings conference call. Again, thanks so much for joining us today, and we wish you all a great day.

The detailed earnings report can be accessed via the company's 8-K filing.\n\nPermian Resources Corp, an independent oil and natural gas company, is strategically positioned in the core of the Permian Basin. The company focuses on the acquisition, optimization, and development of oil and liquids-rich natural gas assets. With operations concentrated in West Texas and New Mexico, Permian Resources has established itself as a significant player in the industry, leveraging large, contiguous acreage blocks to optimize production and efficiency.\n\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\n\nThe first quarter of 2024 marked Permian Resources' strongest quarter to date, characterized by production outperformance and robust free cash flow. This was largely attributed to accelerated efficiencies from the Earthstone integration and impressive well results. The company reported a remarkable increase in average daily crude oil production to 151,794 barrels per day, an 11% rise from the previous quarter, and total production averaged 319,514 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n\nFinancially, Permian Resources reported net cash provided by operating activities of $648 million and adjusted free cash flow of $324 million, or $0.42 per adjusted basic share. The company's net income for the quarter stood at $229.6 million, with earnings per share of $0.27, comfortably surpassing the analyst estimate of $0.37 per share.\n\nStrategic Acquisitions and Integration Synergies\n\nThe successful integration of Earthstone has been a significant catalyst for Permian Resources, with synergy capture exceeding initial targets. The company increased its annual synergy target by $50 million to $225 million, reflecting the efficient integration and operational enhancements achieved. Additionally, Permian Resources executed approximately $270 million in bolt-on acquisitions, further strengthening its core Delaware Basin position.\n\nRevised 2024 Guidance and Shareholder Returns\n\nEncouraged by its Q1 performance, Permian Resources has revised its 2024 guidance upwards. The company now expects mid-point oil and total production to increase by 2%, targeting 150 MBbls/d and 320 MBoe/d, respectively. Moreover, the Board declared a quarterly base cash dividend of $0.06 per share and a variable dividend of $0.14 per share, underscoring its commitment to delivering shareholder value.\n\nMarket Position and Future Outlook\n\nWith a strong balance sheet and low leverage profile, Permian Resources is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory. The company's strategic acquisitions and enhanced operational efficiencies provide a solid foundation for sustained performance and profitability.

Shares were up 0.7% following the report.\n\nThe company's revenue also exceeded forecasts, reaching $1.24 billion against an anticipated $1.21 billion.\n\nThe robust financial results are attributed to the company's production outperformance and efficient operational execution, which have led to its best quarter to date. With a notable 11% increase in average daily crude oil production compared to the previous quarter, Permian Resources achieved an average of 151,794 barrels per day. Total production for the quarter averaged at 319,514 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n\nPermian Resources' management expressed confidence in their operational momentum and increased the mid-point of their full-year oil and total production guidance by 2% to 150 MBbls/d and 320 MBoe/d respectively. This upward revision reflects the company's strong performance and is not inclusive of potential contributions from recent acquisitions expected in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe company's financial health remains robust with net cash provided by operating activities totaling $648 million and adjusted free cash flow reaching $324 million or $0.42 per adjusted basic share. Additionally, Permian Resources continues to return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases totaling $185 million or $0.24 per share for the quarter.\n\nIn terms of future outlook, Permian Resources has revised its standalone oil and total production targets for 2024 upwards by approximately 2%, now aiming for 148-152 MBbls/d and 310-330 MBoe/d based on guidance mid-points. These targets do not yet account for the expected contributions from recent acquisitions which are projected to add around 3,500 Boe/d (~45% oil) in total production during the latter half of the year.\n\nPermian Resources' Co-CEO Will Hickey commented on the successful integration of Earthstone assets and increased synergy targets which have contributed significantly to operational efficiencies and cost reductions.

Today's call is being recorded. A replay of the call will be accessible until May 22, 2024 by dialing 1-809-382-488 and entering the replay access code 24995 or by visiting the company's website at www.permianres.com.\n\nAt this time, I will turn the call over to Mr. Hays Mabry, Permian Resources's Vice President of Investor Relations, for some opening remarks. Please go ahead, Mr. Mabry.\n\nHays Mabry\n\nThanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us on the company's first quarter 2020. For us on the call today are Will Hickey and James Walter, our Chief Executive Officer; and Guy Oliphint, our Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday, May 7, we filed a Form 8-K with an earnings reporting first quarter results. We also posted an earnings presentation to our website that we will reference during today's call. I would like to note that many of the comments during this earnings call are forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertain. It could affect our actual results and plans. Many of these risks are beyond our control and are discussed in more detail in the risk factors in the forward-looking statement sections of our filings with the SEC, including our Form 10 Q, which is expected to be filed later this afternoon. Although we believe the expectations expressed are based on reasonable assumptions, they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially. We may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. It helps facilitate comparisons across periods and with our peers for any non-GAAP measure, we use a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in our earnings release or presentation, which are both available on our website.\n\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Will Hickey, Co-CEO.\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nThanks, Jason. I truly believe that the first quarter was the most compelling quarter Permian Resources has delivered so far, we were able to deliver production and free cash flow above our expectations, close out the integration of our stone ahead of schedule while increasing our annual synergy target by $50 million and continued to execute on accretive A&D with approximately $270 million of acquisitions announced it takes an incredible team to deliver such strong execution quarter after quarter, and I look forward to sharing some more detail on Q1 today.\n\nMoving into quarterly results, I'm pleased to announce Q1 production exceeded expectations with total production of 320,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and oil production of 152,000 barrels of oil per day. Our strong production was attributable to multiple factors, including accelerated Earthstone D&C efficiencies and higher operational runtime, strong production results and CapEx of $520 million in the quarter resulted in adjusted operating cash flow of $844 million or $1.9 per share, and adjusted free cash flow of $324 million or $0.42 per share. We remain highly focused on sustaining a strong balance sheet with leverage of approximately one times and increased liquidity to over $2 billion as part of our regularly scheduled spring bank redetermination process, we increased aggregate lender commitments under the credit facility from $2 billion to $2.5 billion while maintaining a borrowing base of $4 billion.\n\nTurning to return of capital, our strategy remains consistent. We delivered on our previously announced increased base dividend of $0.06 per share, a 20% increase from previous quarters. For the variable portion of our return of capital. First, we repurchased a total of 2 million shares in the quarter. The remainder of our capital return we paid out via a variable dividend of $0.14 per share, bringing the all-in quarterly return of capital to $0.24 per share.\n\nNow I'd like to spend a little time talking about the efficiencies and synergies that impacted the business in such a positive way. This quarter, we rolled out the Archstone acquisition. We are highly confident that we could reduce drilling days and completion days and improve production operations, driving material synergies to be fully realized by year end 2024.\n\nWe have already achieved that and more and just under five months, we've high-graded all legacy Earthstone rigs and completion crews. This combined with TR best practices, helped drive an 18% production reduction in first on drilling days per well and approximately 50% production reduction in completion days per well in the first quarter, which we were initially anticipating achieving by midyear 2020.\n\nAdditionally, we are seeing some efficiency gains in the Midland Basin that were not originally forecasted, which is a testament to our team's ability to unlock value in new assets quickly. In addition, runtimes improved as a result of better compression performance, optimize artificial lift and improved chemical process, combination of accelerated activity and better run times as the primary driver of the strong production performance in Q1, the impact of the combined PR teams, integration execution is that we have already achieved $175 million per year of synergies and are increasing our synergy target to an annual run rate of $225 million. As I mentioned earlier, the main drivers of this increase are operational.\n\nFor DC. and F. We increased our per well savings from 1.2 to 1.5. Similarly, we expect to be able to improve margins by approximately $1 per BOE by year end, but we've already implemented strategies in the field to realize the majority of this improvement today. Drivers of the margin improvement include reduce trucking, upgraded electrical infrastructure, rationalizing vendors and optimizing midstream. Agri integrations are never easy, but what our team accomplished over the last six months is a testament to a lot of hard work and dedication, and we're proud to say that Earthstone is fully integrated.\n\nWith that, I'll turn it over to James to talk to A. and D. and an update on our 2014.\n\nJames Walter\n\nThanks. Well, I'd like to quickly reiterate where we lead off with today that PRs results this quarter are the best results we have had as a public company and that applies to every department and every discipline at Permian Resources. This now marks our seventh consecutive quarter of strong operational execution as a public company and our 9th year as a leading operator in the Delaware Basin, we are highly focused on continuing to increase our track record of consistent results and low cost operations.\n\nOur team is firing on all cylinders, positioning us very well for the remainder of the year, while successfully executing in the field and wrapping up the integration of Earthstone. Our business development and land teams continue to source, evaluate and close attractive deals in and around our enhanced footprint. Our overall objective, when it comes to A&D, it's target acquisitions that enhance the quality of our business and drive value for shareholders for us. That means seeking out acquisitions and increase the quality and duration of our current inventory at prices that make sense in our recent acquisition to achieve all of these goals.\n\nYesterday, after market close, we announced two separate bolt-on transactions directly offset our legacy Parkway asset in Eddy County. This asset is characterized by low D&C costs and high oil cuts that make it one of the most capital-efficient assets in our portfolio. This is why we're so excited to bolster our position here with the addition of high quality, high NRI locations that immediately compete for capital.\n\nIn addition to these bolt-ons, we remain highly active on the grassroots side of the business completing approximately 150 smaller transactions ahead of the drill bit. A smaller deals target near term development are amongst the highest rate of return acquisitions that we find all in these transactions add over 11,000 net leasehold acres and approximately 110 gross operated locations for a purchase price of $270 million, of which we expect $245 million to be paid in the second quarter after accounting for production value. This works out to a little less than 10,000 per net leasehold acres in approximately $1 million per gross location or $1.5 million per net location.\n\nOur presence in Midland has been one of the key drivers of our successful acquisition program and the vast majority of the acreage we are acquiring. And today's announcement come from Midland based counterparties who we have long-standing relationships with, as Will mentioned earlier in the call, our team's successful execution has reduced our drilling and completion times bias to bring barrels forward into Q1 and increased overall production for the year.\n\nAs such, we are increasing our stand on production guidance to 150,000 barrels of oil per day and 320,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents a 2% increase compared to our original guidance ranges with no change to CapEx or other guidance categories coming on, there's acceleration in production the first quarter. We anticipate a relatively flat production profile in the second quarter with modestly lower stand-alone production in the second half of the year. The slight decline is driven by normal course fluctuations in working interest that occurred during a large-scale development program.\n\nThe revised guidance outlined on slides 10 and 14 reflect Permian Resources standalone projections and do not include the impact of the acquisitions we're announcing today. We expect those acquisitions to add an average of approximately 3,500 BOE a day during the second half of the year. Given the high quality inventory of the acquired assets, we do expect to begin development in the second half of the year, which we anticipate will result in $50 million of incremental CapEx. In summary, this is a terrific start to the year and we are proud of what we've accomplished so far in 2024.\n\nI'd like to conclude today's prepared remarks and slide 11, which helps to re-emphasize our value proposition for current and future investors. We think that the announcement today really highlights the quality of Permian Resources business and the multipronged approach we have to driving outsized shareholder value since the Company responded to in 2022, we have delivered best-in-class returns for our sector, amounting to over three times the annualized return of the S&P 500 during that same time period.\n\nOur performance over the last two years has been driven primarily by low-cost execution and accretive transactions. And as a result, PR remains a compelling value within large cap oil and gas, particularly when recognized in the Permian Resources is now the second largest Permian pure-play in the sector.\n\nThank you for tuning in today. And now, we will turn it back to the operator for Q&A.\n\n(Operator Instructions) Neal Dingmann, Truist Securities.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nExcuse me, a lot of guys and nice job on my first question, James, maybe on your D and C plan for your Well, Tom, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe you're currently running about 1112 rigs, three to four spreads or about the same is PR and or Stone was separately. And I'm just wondering, given your notable continued efficiencies that you certainly highlighted today. I'm just wondering, I believe the goal of relatively flat production. Maybe could you or we'll talk about potential too drop rigs or spreads? Or maybe just how you see the maintenance plan on a go forward?\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nI mean, I think you're right, like if you think about the plan this year, we were originally saying we drill about 250 wells and that kind of we thought that would take about 12 rigs with the efficiencies we're seeing today. I think it's very realistic that we could continue to execute on the same plan with less unit, whether that's 11 rigs or kind of somewhere between 11 and 12, I think is if we can keep these efficiencies is very much on the table. If you think back to kind of the Colgate seat of mergers to very similar playbook.\n\nAnd if you think that originally those that was an eight rig combined business that we're able to get down to six with the same level of efficiency. So we've done this before. I do think it's worth calling out. We're not solving for kind of some maintenance plan or production for kind of the last part of your question, it's much more just an input of what's the return environment or what's the macro look like from a supply demand perspective and what are service costs look like?\n\nSo that we can kind of what the production is more of an output. So we continue to see strong service or strong oil prices and reduced service costs. I think it's very very real that we could decide to kind of keep the 12 rigs or even add rigs from here to go grow production. But what you see in the kind of our revised guide is more of that stick to the 250 wells and we could there's a chance we could do that with less equipped.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nNo, I think that's good to hear well. And then secondly, just quick on the bolt-ons such as the recent two that you all highlighted simply you all seem just to have continue to have better success adding these accretive bolt-ons versus it just seems like I don't see as many of your peers being able to do this. So I'm just wondering what your what are the keys behind this? And can you kind of continue at this pace of adding a couple two three? It seems like almost every quarter.\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nThank you. I think it's a pretty easy answer I I think first and foremost is something we're focused on it. We prioritizing something we've done for a long time and have and continue to be really good at and I think that's driven by a couple of things. I think first and foremost, we have the lowest cost structure in the Delaware Basin, which allows us to earn higher returns on the same assets and as a result, kind of naturally over time, assets like these do just flow to the low cost operator?\n\nI'd say second, we're based in Midland. That's the heart of the Permian, the heart of the deal flow. And we've got a great reputation across the market of being good partners that people want to be across the aisle from on the transaction side. And that goes a long way from the filing for today's example. And this is really going to we're buying. It is an area where I think we do have a unique edge from activity and therefore, the information side of things, if we have more rigs running in this area than anybody else and therefore, more proprietary data to pull from better understandings, et cetera.\n\nSo I think you take all that together and it does feel like something that is definitely sustainable and Edge will continue to have what we do this every quarter, probably not, but something we expect kind of over the long term to continue to be a big part of the story.\n\nGood morning, guys. Great quarter on when I'm looking at Slides 6 and 7 and just these this huge efficiency gain that you're continuing to get out of the legacy Archstone properties, and I'm just trying to get a sense of of what maybe that remaining gap, if any, between kind of legacy Earthstone and PR on whatever metric you know, you all want to cite cost per foot or whatever. But when I look at all the different the drilling days and completion date to production downtime. Just some sense of how that compares to two to PR. I'm just trying to see if there's still any gap.\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nI think on the DSD. and C. side, the gap is very small, if not kind of nonexistent at this point. We are we have different efficiencies and different assets in different areas where we kind of view different areas, whether it's legacy or stone or legacy PR, no longer matters. It's more it's all PR. And I think on the D&C side, that gap is closed, where I think there's still some room is on the LOE side. We've made tremendous progress in a short amount of time of improving margins through kind of what we've done on the contract side.\n\nBut also just reducing LOE, but a lot of the other LOE staffing, I think like SWD disposal agreements or recycling agreements have some time to on a higher more work and more time to get fully incorporated. So as I think about kind of where the last kind of gap remains between legacy Earthstone and PR would be more LOE focused if that makes sense.\n\nJohn Freeman\n\nThat's perfect. Thanks. And then just the follow-up for me on your gas takeaway has been pretty topical. What's going on at Waha? Just any sort of updated thoughts from you all and high only thinking about gas takeaway and how to address that longer term?\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nI mean, I think if anything, it's pretty obvious to you that around the call pricing at Waha has been challenge this year and probably will be until we get closer to new pipes coming online in the fourth quarter. And I think that is what it is we're fortunate that dry gas only makes up about 5% of our revenue in any given year. So the business really isn't affected. But I think kind of worth pointing out a couple of things. Only about half of our gas is exposed to Waha pricing this year and kind of other half is either covered by attractive basis hedges or sales at better regional hubs today.\n\nBut yes, it's something we're always trying to kind of focus on and work on. We sell about a quarter of our gas at hubs other than Waha today and we are constantly looking to find ways we can get that percentage higher. If you have a contract probably get signed in the next week or two, that should allow us to get more volumes sold at Houston pricing kind of next year. So kind of more to come on that front. I'd say that's something we've been working on for a long time and continue to chip away at. But I think the most important thing is we've got awesome partners on the midstream side. We've got firm capacity and our molecules are going to flow and even if we saw regional constraints later this year.\n\nOkay. Thanks, guys. I was wondering if you go back to on sort of the outlook through the balance of the year in just holistically, how you guys like to think about the business. Obviously, your cycle times are improving. So you pulled forward a little bit more of your activity and production in 1Q. And so like, like you kind of said, it does taper you have a soft decline in the back half of this year.\n\nBut how do you think about like the setup then for 25 with that, would you guys or into 25 and over the long term, like to see more kind of flattish growth, you want to see some more moderate growth. And if you could talk about like any kind of cadence variability through the year as you would you like to keep things constant? Or do you think there will be some cadence depending on the cycle times?\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nI think Turning first and foremost, kind of as we think about the trajectory from a production perspective of the company, I've said it many times, I'll say it again, it really is a returns-driven INPUT and production is just an output, obviously kind of. And over the last two weeks ago, I'd say the returns environment was extremely good. And we've had we've made some headway on the service cost side kind of over the balance of the year. So it was looking good.\n\nI think that today it's it's still good, but not quite as good as it was a few weeks ago, and I don't yet know what the world will look like six months from today as we go into 25, I would say that's kind of the really as you think about what happened over the course of this year so far as it's just been, the whole set schedule has shifted forward. We've just we're drilling wells faster. We're completing wells faster. And as such, kind of just given the natural working interest changed over large-scale development, that the back half of the year are really kind of dip is just really a little bit less working interest under few wells that moved in from from the next year and that naturally correct itself.\n\nSo said differently, if we maintain the same pace kind of call it to 50 to 60 wells per year like that actually does set up for a really good 25. It's just not it's kind of a slight decline back half of the year and then bounces back in 25. I'm not saying that is our plan. We're going to spend a lot of time over the next six months figure out exactly what you want to do. 25. I think it could be anywhere from 11 to 13 rigs based on commodity prices, and we'll kind of see what makes sense there. But but as I think I wouldn't think of this kind of slow tapering back half of the year as an indication of kind of future trajectory of the production profile in outer years.\n\nThis plan has great acceptance up, but we also do have really good optionality because we don't know what the world's going look like in 25 and our kind of puts us somewhere in the middle that 0% to 10% growth over the long term that we've talked about it. We can make a decision as we get closer to that year.\n\nScott Hanold\n\nAppreciate that commentary. And Doug, in your prepared comments, you all you also mentioned that you're seeing some better performance or efficiencies in the Midland in it sounds like you weren't necessarily expecting. Could you could you a little color and context behind exactly what that is and where the benefits were? Was it more well productivity or is it cycle times or just cost reductions on OpEx?\n\nJames Walter\n\nIt really is D&C CapEx. We were we have not drilled a lot of wells in the Midland Basin to didn't expect to be able to cut kind of near the amount of costs on the Midland Basin side as we have on the Delaware. And we've been surprised to the upside in that regard, I still think we have a ways to go to catch up with where kind of the leading operators in the Midland Basin are on from a CapEx perspective.\n\nBut we've made big strides that kind of surprised us to the upside and was that more as just the cycle time of drilling and completion time of the of that those various stages cycle times casing design kind of everything that would lead to a lower CapEx per foot on a Midland Basin.\n\nHey, morning, everyone. I appreciate the time, but understand it's certainly a little bit too early to be thinking about 25. But I guess just piggybacking off of Scott's question here. If we just think about all the synergy capture and efficiency gains and maybe this year being a little bit heavier on midstream spend or infrastructure spend, I should say is it fair to assume maybe 25, assuming similar activity levels, the CapEx is probably a bit lower than where we are today?\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nYes, I think kind of certainly maintenance CapEx would be lower than what we've outlined this year, just kind of given where the businesses the efficiency we achieved this. And I think that's that's definitely fair, fair assumption.\n\nGabe Down\n\nOkay. Great. And then maybe as a follow-up, you noted or talked about egress a bit, but just curious in that northern New Mexico area, both Eddy and Lea, are you seeing any processing capacity tightness or any other midstream managers that are worth mentioning? I recognize there's no rigs over in Eddy County just here. Is that driven by constraints at all or are you guys planning on getting after that in the second half of this year?\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nYes. I mean, I think the kind of lack of rigs in any area today is just driven by our focus on doing some of these larger developments and making sure when we put rigs on it, we're doing it as quickly as efficiently as possible and touching kind of all parts of the cube that need to be co-developed. So no. And but I think macro-wise gas processing constraints, it actually feels really good this year.\n\nI think last year we'd mentioned before, probably Q2 Q3 time line, there were more challenges on processing, but even more kind of in field compression and kind of plumbing issues in the middle of last year, but those have all really resolve themselves. That's our midstream partners have done a ton of work and spent a ton of money and our gas processing in the New Mexico Delaware to the great spot today and and frankly, painful not to have any constraints of that nature or really anything else kind of able to do what we want to have there.\n\nGood morning all and congrats on a strong update in queue with my first question I wanted to lean in on your D&C efficiencies to better understand the rate of improvement you're seeing if we were to compare PR to PR on slide 6, how does the cycle times in the Northern Delaware compare with your Q4 averages PR to pick up the PR from Q4 to Q1, we've gotten better, but it's going to be kind of single digit percent improvement as compared to the big improvement you see if you compare legacy or centerpiece.\n\nAnd then maybe shifting over to slide 9. The identified location count of 110 gross locations appears conservative to us on the surface. Can you offer any color on the degree of legacy operator development and your general underwriting assumptions for this part of the business?\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nYes. I mean, I'd say it's actually good. That's a good question and very astute, I think. And to your second question first, it's pretty undeveloped acreage position there's a handful of wells on it, but it's an undeveloped as any asset we've looked at in a long time, which is great because it all has to come in take advantage of clean fairways and I kind of do a PR does best regards to inventory?\n\nYes, there probably is conservative. I think we're trying to book locations that we have a very high degree of confidence in here and, you know, is it more likely to have more zones kind of come into the money here?\n\nI think the answer is probably yes, but we feel good about what we put out as being a real base case and something that we can stand behind.\n\nI wanted to dig in a little bit to your comments around kind of flattish second quarter production and then kind of slightly lower in the second half, if I heard your comments right, it sounded like a lot of this was just based on working interest changes. I was hoping maybe you could kind of quantify some of that. I mean, I think you guys are talking about 75% average working interest, but maybe it's a little higher in the first half and lower in the second, just any help on that would be great.\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nYes. I think it's just kind of normal fluctuations when you're running a multi-rig program like this, especially the kind of stacking rigs to pursue the full-field development strategy that we've been pursuing for a long time, like one quarter, maybe 70%, one, maybe 80 to get back to an average of 75 and just kind of how it is, I think you see this especially kind of overtime as as you have more concentration of rig counts on particular developments. But it's all normal and kind of evens out over time.\n\nLeo Mariani\n\nOkay. But it definitely sounds like working interest is a little higher in the first and a little lower in the second half and then how would that translate into CapEx? Would that basically give you CapEx a little lower in the second half, stand-alone versus first half, but yes, I think that's a good assumption Okay.\n\nI think US.\n\nGood morning all and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start on the A. and D. side I can't help. But notice you've been fairly active in this area of Eddy County, kind of looking back at where the Q1 bolt-on to the latest two transactions now classified to sit. So just kind of wondering if you all might be able to speak to there. Is anything specific that you're seeing in the area that's driving an increased focus from an NAV perspective for you?\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nYou know, that's a great question. And I think kind of post closing of our stone today, we just saw a real market window where we're able to go buy for extremely attractive bolt-ons and quite a few grassroots deals at prices that that were really attractive to us. And I think the reason we're able to do so which I touched on a little bit with Neil's question at the beginning was because we've been the most active operator in this part of Eddy County for a long time. And therefore, had a lot of really exciting proprietary results, both on kind of zones, well performance.\n\nAnd I think most importantly, the cost side, what we're doing this cheaper up here than I think anybody would expect. So tonnage is unique. It's kind of one of those windows that we saw an opportunity and we hit it hard. And I think these are some of the best deals we've done. So yes, I think it wasn't I didn't think we'd get all of these deals the way we did. But it's it's a great outcome and that's it really core inventory with our most capital-efficient assets.\n\nOliver Wang\n\nMakes sense. And for my follow-up, just kind of wondering if you all could provide an update on your royalty position. It seems like an aspect of the business where you've been able to steadily pick up some decent interest of the past nine months or so that's kind of going under the radar. So any color there would be helpful.\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nYes. I mean, I think we're always trying to buy acreage and inventory that competes for capital. And a big part of that is what is the royalty burden. So we target assets that have advantage winterized, lower royalties that really just help our capital efficiency. And I think today we've got our royalty business that we're really proud of kind of 75,000 net royalty acres is not insubstantial.\n\nI don't have anything strategic that we have planned with that today, but I do think that's a big part of our capital efficiency story, we're getting more fee free cash flow for every dollar of CapEx that we spend as a result. So I think ultimately, it's something that just makes our widget better and helps our value creation increase over time. So that's something that we're proud of. We're focused on, I think, probably a little underappreciated by the market and but it's really ultimately comes down to helping us earn better returns on every dollar that we spend.\n\n(Operator Instructions) Jeff Jay, Daniel Energy Partners.\n\nJeff Jay\n\nHey, guys. I was just looking for I know you referenced your power infrastructure build-outs would kind of love to hear what's happening there, what the scale of that is, how big that's going to be for you guys. It's obviously kind of a pressing issue these days?\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nYes, look at wind power in this kind of entire Permian stuff in Texas is tough and in New Mexico's top. So we're trying our best to to stay in front of it. I'd say kind of as you think about our power needs, if we can be online power, that's obviously preference. And after that, if we can kind of leverage you could natural gas power generators is probably the second best answer. And that's kind of what you'll see for the majority of our New Mexico infrastructure. But but it's a priority for us.\n\nAnd I think we are actively looking at ways to improve that position, collaborating with others to look at building incremental substations and really anything we can do. It doesn't come quick, and I think it will be a challenge for the industry for the next few years. I don't think it means we won't be able to produce our well, it is just a little bit less efficient to be on natural gas power generators and it would be to be all online power.\n\nGood morning. Others taking my call. Just a quick one talking about the acquisition pipeline. Are you seeing looking forward to kind of what's next, are you seeing any kind of movement on the bid asks based on scale location?\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nOr is it all pretty much, Chris, you should think of corporate, but I think our pipeline on the A. and D. side feels really good. I think there's a lot of to be lots of opportunities in the Delaware. And I think our position as a kind of preferential party for a lot of sellers in a low cost operating base and position us well as the assets come for sale kind of both marketed deals, which we participated in successfully, but also just importantly, kind of off-market assets, which has been a large chunk of our acquisition program historically.\n\nBut it feels good. I don't think they're probably not the size of deals that you saw hitting the market in 22 and 23 and the dollar, which I think we largely stayed on the sidelines from. But I think we're seeing a lot of stuff that fits kind of the grassroots side is maintaining our momentum, and we're still seeing lots of bolt-ons probably coming down the pipe this year where we wind up acquiring all of them, definitely not, but other some that could fit.\n\nI'd like to think so. But we're really picky and we want to buy assets like I said that make our business better and that earn a high rate of return and drive value for shareholders. So if we can continue to do that, that's great. But we said before, we don't need to do anything. We think we have an incredible inventory base, an incredible standalone business. So if we can find those opportunities, we'll be excited for soon but certainly don't feel any pressure to do so.\n\nPaul Diamond\n\nUnderstood. And just a quick follow-up. So that's why you guys have been pretty balanced shareholder return framework as anything you guys are seeing in the markets that would kind of tip scale one way or the other.\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nNow, I mean, I think we're going to kind of naturally bias towards the dividend. I think that the variable dividends are our base case, and we'll be opportunistic on potentially increasing share buybacks at some point in the future if kind of dislocations and large opportunities exists. But no, I'd say really steady as she goes on the capital return strategy, do you think it's worth mentioning?\n\nWe did show a 20% increase in our base dividend this year. Which should hit for the quarterly dividend payment upcoming and a nice increase in our variable cash dividend as well. So it feels like that's working really well. We're excited about it understood.\n\nHey, good morning, Tom, to follow up on an earlier question, about M&A. Your last couple of deals have been concentrated in the Northern Delaware. Just kind of a general question on how you are viewing opportunities in the Southern Delaware versus the Northern Delaware. Are there as many opportunities out there? And how do you kind of compare that to open?\n\nWilliam Hickey\n\nI mean, I think that's a great question. I mean, looking back historically, the kind of first consolidation wave in the Delaware was Texas focused. If you think like 2017, 2018, 2019, a lot of Texas businesses. And that's where the dollar got it started at least activity was faster to begin. So I think we kind of have you seen a natural consolidation wave in the Delaware as of late.\n\nI think for us specifically, we've got a great Texas position today with some really high return to go for drilling to do it if we can find opportunities in Texas that compete for capital, like what we've seen in New Mexico, we'd be really excited about it. And I think those opportunities do still exist. I just think kind of the majority of assets that we've seen that fit.\n\nWhat we're trying to do from a making the business better standpoint have been in New Mexico the last couple of years. But I think that could change and we'd be really excited if we could find some opportunities on the Texas side.\n\nKevin McCurdy\n\nGreat. And changing gears a little bit. You mentioned an additional 3,500 barrels a day equivalent and an additional $50 million of capital once you close the bolt on acquisitions later this quarter, just to clarify, is the 350 or sorry, the 3,500 barrels a day flowing because that's pulling production now on? And if so, what will be the production impact of the additional $50 million capital spend?\n\nJames Walter\n\nYes, that production is online. Now, the majority of that is from an acquisition. We haven't closed and done close to the to the end of this quarter. So it's kind of online now but it's not ours, if you will. And then that $50 million is CapEx. We're going to spend in the back half of this year that it's awesome.\n\nAwesome. High return inventory really exciting in our hands. I mean, we don't own it today, so we can't kick you out of the oven, I guess all the production you see from that's going to show up next year, but but really strong returns, and we're excited to get after Susan get our hands on the assets.\n\nGentlemen, it appears we have no further questions this morning. Mr. Walter, I'd like to turn things back to you, sir, for any closing comments.\n\nJames Walter\n\nAs I've gotten off to a great start in 2020 form. Our primary goal remains the same as it was when we announced the Covington Tennessee merger in May of 2022 to maximize shareholder value over the long term and to do that, we plan to continue to build on our track record of delivering consistent results with the lowest cost structure in the Delaware Basin.\n\nThanks to everyone for joining the call today and for following the Permian Resources story.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, gentlemen. Again, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's Permian Resources first-quarter earnings conference call. Again, thanks so much for joining us today, and we wish you all a good day.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

In January, the company said it would acquire Delaware leasehold in two bolt-on deals. The two transactions added 11,500 net leasehold acres and 4,000 net royalty acres in Eddy County, New Mexico, for $175 million.\n\nPermian Resources said it continues to strengthen its acreage position in the core of the Delaware through bolt-on acquisitions and additional properties acquired through its ongoing grassroots program.\n\nThe bolt-on deals, from undisclosed third-party sellers, consist of predominantly undeveloped acreage offset by Permian Resources' \"highly capital efficient Parkway asset,\" the company said.\n\nInventory on the acquired acreage comprises two-mile locations with high net revenue interests, which the company said would immediately compete for capital. The company closed one transaction during the first quarter. The second is pending and expected to close late in the second quarter.\n\n\"The acquired acreage is analogous to our high-quality Parkway position. This area represents one of the highest returning assets within our portfolio, with returns driven by reduced D&C costs and strong oil cuts. We are excited to begin development on the acquired acreage later this year,\" said Co-CEO Will Hickey.\n\nPermian Resources also continues to execute on its ground game through smaller grassroots acquisitions and leasehold transactions. During the first quarter, the company completed approximately 150 grassroots leasing and working interest acquisitions. The majority of these acquisitions are slated for near-term development, making them highly accretive, the company said.\n\nThrough the combined efforts, the company said it had added approximately 11,200 net leasehold acres and 4,500 net royalty acres -- slightly less leasehold and more royalty acres than disclosed in January. Permian Resources said the acquisitions were transacted at approximately $9,500 per net leasehold acre and approximately $5,000 per net royalty acre after adjusting for production value.

At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Mr. Philip Riley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nPhilip Riley: Good morning. Welcome to our conference call covering the first quarter 2024 results. I'm Philip Riley, CFO. Joining me today is Bobby Riley, Chairman and CEO. Yesterday, we published a variety of materials, which can be found on our website under the Investors section. These materials in today's conference call contains certain projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. We'll also reference certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations to the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our supplemental disclosure on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Bobby.\n\nBobby Riley: Thank you, Philip, and thank you again to everyone for joining us on today's call. Yesterday, at the close of the market, we announced the results of our first quarter in 2024. I'm pleased to report that Q1 was another outstanding quarter for Riley Permian. And we are on track to deliver our previously disclosed 2024 operating plan, targeting year-over-year oil growth with a reduction in CapEx. Our net oil production saw a 4% increase compared to the previous quarter, reaching an average of 14.2 thousand barrels per day. Looking ahead to our Q2 guidance, we're forecasting a range of 14.4 to 14.8 thousand barrels per day, and we expect the majority of our incremental growth to occur in this period and stabilize for the remaining quarters as we work towards achieving our year-over-year targets. From an operational standpoint, we drilled seven net wells, which represents approximately one-third of our projected total for the year. We released the rig in March and plan to resume drilling operations in June. Our team has achieved significant advancements in drilling efficiency by adopting cutting-edge technologies and streamlined processes. These improvements have allowed us to rely on a single rig for a portion of the year while still delivering double-digit volume growth. We completed four wells and brought six wells online during the period, benefiting from two drilled but uncompleted wells, or DUCs, from late 2023. On Tuesday of this week, we closed our previously announced bolt-on acquisition in Eddy County, New Mexico. This will expand our existing operating footprint in New Mexico by adding 13,900 contiguous net acres. The acreage is largely underdeveloped but is 99% held by production through legacy vertical wells. This acquisition enhances the optionality of our total development inventory by providing high-quality horizontal drilling locations, primarily in the Yeso trend, including the Blinebry, Glorieta and Paddock formations. Furthermore, the acquisition includes valuable infrastructure such as saltwater disposal wells which will optimize operations across our existing New Mexico footprint. We remain focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders and delivering predictable and sustainable growth for years to come. To achieve this, our capital strategy prioritizes discipline to allocate resources to support our growth objectives, while also delivering on our commitment to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends. Looking ahead, we remain excited about the opportunities in front of us, and we are well positioned to execute our 2024 plan and beyond. We will continue to focus on operational excellence, cost control and capital efficiency to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Philip to provide more details on our financial results.\n\nPhilip Riley: Thank you, Bobby. First quarter operating cash flow before working capital increased by 7% quarter-over-quarter despite 2% lower oil prices. The largest driver of quarter-over-quarter improvement was our settled hedges as lower-priced legacy swaps rolled off in December, and despite some generally strong prices during the quarter. In production, volume increases and cost reductions contributed to a combined $5.5 million of cash flow improvement. Oil price ended the quarter about $11 higher than at year-end, which in turn led us to book the non-cash derivatives loss and which drives the lower net income this quarter. As of today, that dynamic has already partially reversed with lower oil prices. The non-cash derivatives values flip flop frequently by quarter and correspond infrequently with ultimate settled amounts is one of the reasons we focus less on net income. Reinvestment rate of operating cash flow into upstream CapEx was 45% on an accrual basis and 60% on a cash CapEx basis. The larger ratio of cash-to-accrual CapEx this quarter was driven by some larger prepayments, including on infrastructure for work that had not yet occurred and that will drive success for the full year development plan. We converted 40% of operating cash flow to free cash flow in the first quarter, representing continued improvement with this metric from prior years. Free cash flow declined quarter-over-quarter, but there is no concern there. First, we use cash CapEx for our free cash flow calculation while many companies use accrual CapEx. If we had used accrual CapEx, then free cash flow would have increased by 11% quarter-over-quarter. In the fourth quarter of '23, we had a especially light cash CapEx, opposite of this quarter's dynamic. Second, we regularly encourage observers to focus on a four-quarter measure of free cash flow over a single quarter. We'll now turn it back to the operator for questions. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you, Philip. We will now take a question from Neal Dingmann from Truist Capital.\n\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Phil or to you Bobby, if you could talk maybe a little bit more about the acquisition, but pretty positive? Maybe in terms of what it added in terms of production? Maybe how we should think about incremental volumes throughout the year on this? And impact on guidance? And maybe even on the oil cut throughout the year? Just wondering how this might impact things.\n\nPhilip Riley: Yes, sure. I can start with that, Neal, this is Philip. The acquisition, it's producing about 400 barrels a day. That closed a couple of days ago, so you really only get the benefit for about two-thirds of the year. So when you divide that by a full year, that adds maybe 260 barrels a day average over the year. So it's some of what we're dealing with is the dynamic of averages over the year. So the guidance range we gave, 14.4 to 14.8, if you use the midpoint there, and if we held it flat, as Bobby was describing, that gets you to 14.5 for the year, right kind of smack in the middle of the previously disclosed guidance range. To reach that high end, we'd have to get to 15.3 on average for the remaining -- for all three quarters here. So we think it's pretty representative of a full year. The existing production is mostly kind of a mix of some few small non-op horizontal contributors there and then some smaller vertical. We do like it for that underdeveloped horizontal inventory, which we don't plan to drill this year. So that's the, I guess, the color on how it affects our production ranges. In general, we're excited about it. We like the idea of maintaining roughly a decade of inventory, and we think that this gets us there. It's also got some valuable infrastructure that we need both for our operations. And then frankly, we can even charge non-op partners neighbors in such the fees as they use our saltwater disposal wells and such. Does that answer the question?\n\nNeal Dingmann: Yes, it did, certainly does. It's good to hear. And then just a follow-up, could you maybe, you or Bobby, just talk a bit on oilfield services? It seems that bulk, maybe just talk about cost and availability. It seems like you're able to let the rig go, bring the rig back when you choose. It seems like you have, number one, just a lot of flexibility on the availability side. So I was wondering just -- is that the case? And then secondly, just on the OFS cost side, what you all see in it?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes, Neal, this is Bobby. I'll take that. So yes, we have a great relationship with the drilling contractor that's in the area that we're able to bring in and drill a batch of wells. And then releasing to some of our offset partners there to drill, but keep them in the same area. As we go to more pad drilling type of applications, it has -- we have lower cost on rig moves and more efficiencies on days from spud to TD, et cetera. So those costs are really falling in where we want them to be. Otherwise, on the pressure pumping side, we're seeing a softer market so that we're getting more competitive bids and pricing. I think we talked about that dynamic as some of these larger mergers and acquisitions have occurred. It's freed up a lot of frac teams and services that they want to maintain their market share. They're more aggressively pricing services for us. So we're taking advantage of that as we can right now in that market.\n\nNeal Dingmann: Yes, I love the flexibility. Thanks guys.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John White from ROTH Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn White: Good morning. And congratulations on closing your New Mexico acquisition.\n\nPhilip Riley: Thank you, John.\n\nJohn White: I wanted to ask about the RPC Power project. In the press release, you said you put in another $5.6 million, in effect, completes the funding for the current project. So that's the funding. How would you describe the work out in the field on the actual infrastructure?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes. I would say we're kind of right on schedule where we thought we'd be. We're installing 20 megawatts of power out there. We've had 10 megawatts over there for some time and we're just now receiving the second package of generators to get us up to our total design. We're currently getting all of that stuff tied into our private use network, which basically allows us to self-distribute power to all of our wells. So I think, operationally, that should be 100% operational probably by end of summer. And so far, I think we're really excited about that opportunity, at least we're producing our base load. And then looking at other opportunities that we might see coming our way with power.\n\nJohn White: Thanks for that. And when it's fully up and running, how much of your electricity or your power needs will this project satisfy?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes. So it's basically almost 100% of our power demand in Yoakum County on what we call our Champions. When we first designed the infrastructure out there, we laid that network in place. And now that's -- we're able to utilize that and we'll be self-providing practically 100%. There might be one or two wells that's still on an isolated meter, but the majority of it will be self-generating.\n\nJohn White: That's great. And does the similar opportunity exists on your New Mexico properties?\n\nBobby Riley: It does. As we're building out and looking at our infrastructure requirements in New Mexico, going forward, we are instead of tying individual meters back into the grid. We are installing, I don't know if it's the term, it's a private use network or our primary point of take from the provider out there so that eventually we can tie our own gen systems into that as well. But that's a little bit long term. We probably won't get there this year, but we're still on the laying out. It has to do with establishing drilling schedules and time to water infrastructure and all of that at the same time. But it's definitely what we do in our operation, and we will be doing that going forward.\n\nJohn White: Okay. Thanks for the additional details. I appreciate it.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Robertson from Water Tower Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Robertson: Thank you. To follow up on the power venture, Bobby or Philip, can you try to quantify the economic impact of supplying your own power to the Champions acreage compared to the alternative, which might have been selling the produced natural gas just into the grid at a relatively low price?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes. So that's what we're trying to do is basically increase the margins on the hydrocarbons that we produce in the area. So as you know, as Waha goes negative, sometimes the residue gas has little or no value to us. And because we're able to take that residue gas in time and power our gensets to offset our baseload production, our baseload operations. So from an individual well lease operating cost, it's probably somewhat neutral. But since we're a JV partner in the -- and the power company roughly will benefit from 50% of the revenues from generating power.\n\nPhilip Riley: 35% ownership right now that we're set to benefit from. And we think it's kind of a high-teen type of return, Jeff, but that's a nice stable return, right? This isn't an oil well that's declining, so it's something that we're excited about.\n\nJeff Robertson: Is it fair that the other part of the return just comes from having a more reliable source of power, which might lead to...\n\nBobby Riley: Absolutely. I mean, that was one of the primary reasons there is because we're kind of at the end of the grid there. And we were experiencing some brownouts or frequent power disruptions that cost an extensive amount of money to bring some of those wells back on. So that's -- again, it's one of the main reasons for doing this is more reliable power.\n\nJeff Robertson: In New Mexico, you talked about the saltwater disposal, the wells you acquired in the most recent acquisition and your SWD assets that serve that area. Do you need to spend much capital to either upgrade or enhance those to be able to handle Riley's activity plus be able to maybe take third-party volumes?\n\nBobby Riley: I think we're going to focus on just tying those wells in with some flow lines to loop them into our system to give us excess capacity. Primarily, we want to make sure that our disposal requirements are met with some spare capacity for emergencies and stuff like that. But as we continue to look at opportunities there, I think there would be some coming in where you could be charging some third party. But for the most part right now, we're 100% focused on our own disposal requirements.\n\nJeff Robertson: Either way you get some. Well, you ultimately get some LOE benefit from -- as you work through that process?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes, we should. I mean basically, the more wells that we have, the less amount of water each well has to take, which needs less energy it takes to push it down hole, et cetera, like that, so that gives us some savings there. And this gives us some redundancy, some fallback spare capacity. And then the ability to bring in some third-party water if we see that we got the excess capacity and moving water is important to us out there, and that's one of our main focuses to make sure we stay on top of that.\n\nJeff Robertson: Thank you.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call.

A: William Hickey, Co-CEO, explained that with the current efficiencies, it's realistic that the company could continue executing its plan with fewer units, potentially reducing from 12 to 11 or somewhere in between. He emphasized that production levels are more of an output of their operational strategy, influenced by market conditions and service costs.\n\nQ: John Freeman inquired about the remaining efficiency gaps between legacy Earthstone and Permian Resources, particularly in drilling, completion, and production operations. A: William Hickey noted that the efficiency gap on the D&C side is minimal or closed, but there is still some room for improvement in lowering lease operating expenses (LOE), particularly in areas like staffing and disposal agreements.\n\nQ: Scott Hanold asked about the outlook for the rest of the year and how Permian Resources views its business trajectory, considering the improved cycle times. A: William Hickey responded that production is an output driven by returns, and the company's plan could vary between maintaining or adjusting rig counts based on commodity prices. He clarified that the slight production decline expected in the second half of the year is due to normal fluctuations in working interest during large-scale development.\n\nQ: Gabe Down questioned if the anticipated CapEx for 2025 might be lower given the synergy capture and efficiency gains achieved this year. A: William Hickey confirmed that the maintenance CapEx for 2025 would likely be lower than the current year, reflecting the efficiencies and improvements realized.\n\nQ: Oliver Wang asked about the focus on Eddy County and the factors driving increased activity there. A: William Hickey highlighted the company's active operations and proprietary data in Eddy County, which provide a competitive edge. He mentioned that the area offers high-return opportunities and that the company's presence and efficiency in Eddy County have allowed it to secure attractive deals.\n\nQ: Kevin McCurdy inquired about the potential differences in opportunities between the Northern and Southern Delaware basins and how the company views these areas. A: William Hickey noted that while there have been more consolidation opportunities historically in Texas, the company is open to opportunities in both the Northern and Southern Delaware basins. He emphasized that the company's strategy is to enhance its business and generate high returns, regardless of the specific location within the Delaware Basin.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Mr. Philip Riley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nPhilip Riley: Good morning. Welcome to our conference call covering the first quarter 2024 results. I'm Philip Riley, CFO. Joining me today is Bobby Riley, Chairman and CEO. Yesterday, we published a variety of materials, which can be found on our website under the Investors section. These materials in today's conference call contains certain projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. We'll also reference certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations to the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our supplemental disclosure on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Bobby.\n\nBobby Riley: Thank you, Philip, and thank you again to everyone for joining us on today's call. Yesterday, at the close of the market, we announced the results of our first quarter in 2024. I'm pleased to report that Q1 was another outstanding quarter for Riley Permian. And we are on track to deliver our previously disclosed 2024 operating plan, targeting year-over-year oil growth with a reduction in CapEx. Our net oil production saw a 4% increase compared to the previous quarter, reaching an average of 14.2 thousand barrels per day. Looking ahead to our Q2 guidance, we're forecasting a range of 14.4 to 14.8 thousand barrels per day, and we expect the majority of our incremental growth to occur in this period and stabilize for the remaining quarters as we work towards achieving our year-over-year targets. From an operational standpoint, we drilled seven net wells, which represents approximately one-third of our projected total for the year. We released the rig in March and plan to resume drilling operations in June. Our team has achieved significant advancements in drilling efficiency by adopting cutting-edge technologies and streamlined processes. These improvements have allowed us to rely on a single rig for a portion of the year while still delivering double-digit volume growth. We completed four wells and brought six wells online during the period, benefiting from two drilled but uncompleted wells, or DUCs, from late 2023. On Tuesday of this week, we closed our previously announced bolt-on acquisition in Eddy County, New Mexico. This will expand our existing operating footprint in New Mexico by adding 13,900 contiguous net acres. The acreage is largely underdeveloped but is 99% held by production through legacy vertical wells. This acquisition enhances the optionality of our total development inventory by providing high-quality horizontal drilling locations, primarily in the Yeso trend, including the Blinebry, Glorieta and Paddock formations. Furthermore, the acquisition includes valuable infrastructure such as saltwater disposal wells which will optimize operations across our existing New Mexico footprint. We remain focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders and delivering predictable and sustainable growth for years to come. To achieve this, our capital strategy prioritizes discipline to allocate resources to support our growth objectives, while also delivering on our commitment to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends. Looking ahead, we remain excited about the opportunities in front of us, and we are well positioned to execute our 2024 plan and beyond. We will continue to focus on operational excellence, cost control and capital efficiency to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Philip to provide more details on our financial results.\n\nPhilip Riley: Thank you, Bobby. First quarter operating cash flow before working capital increased by 7% quarter-over-quarter despite 2% lower oil prices. The largest driver of quarter-over-quarter improvement was our settled hedges as lower-priced legacy swaps rolled off in December, and despite some generally strong prices during the quarter. In production, volume increases and cost reductions contributed to a combined $5.5 million of cash flow improvement. Oil price ended the quarter about $11 higher than at year-end, which in turn led us to book the non-cash derivatives loss and which drives the lower net income this quarter. As of today, that dynamic has already partially reversed with lower oil prices. The non-cash derivatives values flip flop frequently by quarter and correspond infrequently with ultimate settled amounts is one of the reasons we focus less on net income. Reinvestment rate of operating cash flow into upstream CapEx was 45% on an accrual basis and 60% on a cash CapEx basis. The larger ratio of cash-to-accrual CapEx this quarter was driven by some larger prepayments, including on infrastructure for work that had not yet occurred and that will drive success for the full year development plan. We converted 40% of operating cash flow to free cash flow in the first quarter, representing continued improvement with this metric from prior years. Free cash flow declined quarter-over-quarter, but there is no concern there. First, we use cash CapEx for our free cash flow calculation while many companies use accrual CapEx. If we had used accrual CapEx, then free cash flow would have increased by 11% quarter-over-quarter. In the fourth quarter of '23, we had a especially light cash CapEx, opposite of this quarter's dynamic. Second, we regularly encourage observers to focus on a four-quarter measure of free cash flow over a single quarter. We'll now turn it back to the operator for questions. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you, Philip. We will now take a question from Neal Dingmann from Truist Capital.\n\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Phil or to you Bobby, if you could talk maybe a little bit more about the acquisition, but pretty positive? Maybe in terms of what it added in terms of production? Maybe how we should think about incremental volumes throughout the year on this? And impact on guidance? And maybe even on the oil cut throughout the year? Just wondering how this might impact things.\n\nPhilip Riley: Yes, sure. I can start with that, Neal, this is Philip. The acquisition, it's producing about 400 barrels a day. That closed a couple of days ago, so you really only get the benefit for about two-thirds of the year. So when you divide that by a full year, that adds maybe 260 barrels a day average over the year. So it's some of what we're dealing with is the dynamic of averages over the year. So the guidance range we gave, 14.4 to 14.8, if you use the midpoint there, and if we held it flat, as Bobby was describing, that gets you to 14.5 for the year, right kind of smack in the middle of the previously disclosed guidance range. To reach that high end, we'd have to get to 15.3 on average for the remaining -- for all three quarters here. So we think it's pretty representative of a full year. The existing production is mostly kind of a mix of some few small non-op horizontal contributors there and then some smaller vertical. We do like it for that underdeveloped horizontal inventory, which we don't plan to drill this year. So that's the, I guess, the color on how it affects our production ranges. In general, we're excited about it. We like the idea of maintaining roughly a decade of inventory, and we think that this gets us there. It's also got some valuable infrastructure that we need both for our operations. And then frankly, we can even charge non-op partners neighbors in such the fees as they use our saltwater disposal wells and such. Does that answer the question?\n\nNeal Dingmann: Yes, it did, certainly does. It's good to hear. And then just a follow-up, could you maybe, you or Bobby, just talk a bit on oilfield services? It seems that bulk, maybe just talk about cost and availability. It seems like you're able to let the rig go, bring the rig back when you choose. It seems like you have, number one, just a lot of flexibility on the availability side. So I was wondering just -- is that the case? And then secondly, just on the OFS cost side, what you all see in it?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes, Neal, this is Bobby. I'll take that. So yes, we have a great relationship with the drilling contractor that's in the area that we're able to bring in and drill a batch of wells. And then releasing to some of our offset partners there to drill, but keep them in the same area. As we go to more pad drilling type of applications, it has -- we have lower cost on rig moves and more efficiencies on days from spud to TD, et cetera. So those costs are really falling in where we want them to be. Otherwise, on the pressure pumping side, we're seeing a softer market so that we're getting more competitive bids and pricing. I think we talked about that dynamic as some of these larger mergers and acquisitions have occurred. It's freed up a lot of frac teams and services that they want to maintain their market share. They're more aggressively pricing services for us. So we're taking advantage of that as we can right now in that market.\n\nNeal Dingmann: Yes, I love the flexibility. Thanks guys.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John White from ROTH Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn White: Good morning. And congratulations on closing your New Mexico acquisition.\n\nPhilip Riley: Thank you, John.\n\nJohn White: I wanted to ask about the RPC Power project. In the press release, you said you put in another $5.6 million, in effect, completes the funding for the current project. So that's the funding. How would you describe the work out in the field on the actual infrastructure?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes. I would say we're kind of right on schedule where we thought we'd be. We're installing 20 megawatts of power out there. We've had 10 megawatts over there for some time and we're just now receiving the second package of generators to get us up to our total design. We're currently getting all of that stuff tied into our private use network, which basically allows us to self-distribute power to all of our wells. So I think, operationally, that should be 100% operational probably by end of summer. And so far, I think we're really excited about that opportunity, at least we're producing our base load. And then looking at other opportunities that we might see coming our way with power.\n\nJohn White: Thanks for that. And when it's fully up and running, how much of your electricity or your power needs will this project satisfy?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes. So it's basically almost 100% of our power demand in Yoakum County on what we call our Champions. When we first designed the infrastructure out there, we laid that network in place. And now that's -- we're able to utilize that and we'll be self-providing practically 100%. There might be one or two wells that's still on an isolated meter, but the majority of it will be self-generating.\n\nJohn White: That's great. And does the similar opportunity exists on your New Mexico properties?\n\nBobby Riley: It does. As we're building out and looking at our infrastructure requirements in New Mexico, going forward, we are instead of tying individual meters back into the grid. We are installing, I don't know if it's the term, it's a private use network or our primary point of take from the provider out there so that eventually we can tie our own gen systems into that as well. But that's a little bit long term. We probably won't get there this year, but we're still on the laying out. It has to do with establishing drilling schedules and time to water infrastructure and all of that at the same time. But it's definitely what we do in our operation, and we will be doing that going forward.\n\nJohn White: Okay. Thanks for the additional details. I appreciate it.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Robertson from Water Tower Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Robertson: Thank you. To follow up on the power venture, Bobby or Philip, can you try to quantify the economic impact of supplying your own power to the Champions acreage compared to the alternative, which might have been selling the produced natural gas just into the grid at a relatively low price?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes. So that's what we're trying to do is basically increase the margins on the hydrocarbons that we produce in the area. So as you know, as Waha goes negative, sometimes the residue gas has little or no value to us. And because we're able to take that residue gas in time and power our gensets to offset our baseload production, our baseload operations. So from an individual well lease operating cost, it's probably somewhat neutral. But since we're a JV partner in the -- and the power company roughly will benefit from 50% of the revenues from generating power.\n\nPhilip Riley: 35% ownership right now that we're set to benefit from. And we think it's kind of a high-teen type of return, Jeff, but that's a nice stable return, right? This isn't an oil well that's declining, so it's something that we're excited about.\n\nJeff Robertson: Is it fair that the other part of the return just comes from having a more reliable source of power, which might lead to...\n\nBobby Riley: Absolutely. I mean, that was one of the primary reasons there is because we're kind of at the end of the grid there. And we were experiencing some brownouts or frequent power disruptions that cost an extensive amount of money to bring some of those wells back on. So that's -- again, it's one of the main reasons for doing this is more reliable power.\n\nJeff Robertson: In New Mexico, you talked about the saltwater disposal, the wells you acquired in the most recent acquisition and your SWD assets that serve that area. Do you need to spend much capital to either upgrade or enhance those to be able to handle Riley's activity plus be able to maybe take third-party volumes?\n\nBobby Riley: I think we're going to focus on just tying those wells in with some flow lines to loop them into our system to give us excess capacity. Primarily, we want to make sure that our disposal requirements are met with some spare capacity for emergencies and stuff like that. But as we continue to look at opportunities there, I think there would be some coming in where you could be charging some third party. But for the most part right now, we're 100% focused on our own disposal requirements.\n\nJeff Robertson: Either way you get some. Well, you ultimately get some LOE benefit from -- as you work through that process?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes, we should. I mean basically, the more wells that we have, the less amount of water each well has to take, which needs less energy it takes to push it down hole, et cetera, like that, so that gives us some savings there. And this gives us some redundancy, some fallback spare capacity.

At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Mr. Philip Riley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nPhilip Riley: Good morning. Welcome to our conference call covering the first quarter 2024 results. I'm Philip Riley, CFO. Joining me today is Bobby Riley, Chairman and CEO. Yesterday, we published a variety of materials, which can be found on our website under the Investors section. These materials in today's conference call contains certain projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. We'll also reference certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations to the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our supplemental disclosure on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Bobby.\n\nBobby Riley: Thank you, Philip, and thank you again to everyone for joining us on today's call. Yesterday, at the close of the market, we announced the results of our first quarter in 2024. I'm pleased to report that Q1 was another outstanding quarter for Riley Permian. And we are on track to deliver our previously disclosed 2024 operating plan, targeting year-over-year oil growth with a reduction in CapEx. Our net oil production saw a 4% increase compared to the previous quarter, reaching an average of 14.2 thousand barrels per day. Looking ahead to our Q2 guidance, we're forecasting a range of 14.4 to 14.8 thousand barrels per day, and we expect the majority of our incremental growth to occur in this period and stabilize for the remaining quarters as we work towards achieving our year-over-year targets. From an operational standpoint, we drilled seven net wells, which represents approximately one-third of our projected total for the year. We released the rig in March and plan to resume drilling operations in June. Our team has achieved significant advancements in drilling efficiency by adopting cutting-edge technologies and streamlined processes. These improvements have allowed us to rely on a single rig for a portion of the year while still delivering double-digit volume growth. We completed four wells and brought six wells online during the period, benefiting from two drilled but uncompleted wells, or DUCs, from late 2023. On Tuesday of this week, we closed our previously announced bolt-on acquisition in Eddy County, New Mexico. This will expand our existing operating footprint in New Mexico by adding 13,900 contiguous net acres. The acreage is largely underdeveloped but is 99% held by production through legacy vertical wells. This acquisition enhances the optionality of our total development inventory by providing high-quality horizontal drilling locations, primarily in the Yeso trend, including the Blinebry, Glorieta and Paddock formations. Furthermore, the acquisition includes valuable infrastructure such as saltwater disposal wells which will optimize operations across our existing New Mexico footprint. We remain focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders and delivering predictable and sustainable growth for years to come. To achieve this, our capital strategy prioritizes discipline to allocate resources to support our growth objectives, while also delivering on our commitment to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends. Looking ahead, we remain excited about the opportunities in front of us, and we are well positioned to execute our 2024 plan and beyond. We will continue to focus on operational excellence, cost control and capital efficiency to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Philip to provide more details on our financial results.\n\nPhilip Riley: Thank you, Bobby. First quarter operating cash flow before working capital increased by 7% quarter-over-quarter despite 2% lower oil prices. The largest driver of quarter-over-quarter improvement was our settled hedges as lower-priced legacy swaps rolled off in December, and despite some generally strong prices during the quarter. In production, volume increases and cost reductions contributed to a combined $5.5 million of cash flow improvement. Oil price ended the quarter about $11 higher than at year-end, which in turn led us to book the non-cash derivatives loss and which drives the lower net income this quarter. As of today, that dynamic has already partially reversed with lower oil prices. The non-cash derivatives values flip flop frequently by quarter and correspond infrequently with ultimate settled amounts is one of the reasons we focus less on net income. Reinvestment rate of operating cash flow into upstream CapEx was 45% on an accrual basis and 60% on a cash CapEx basis. The larger ratio of cash-to-accrual CapEx this quarter was driven by some larger prepayments, including on infrastructure for work that had not yet occurred and that will drive success for the full year development plan. We converted 40% of operating cash flow to free cash flow in the first quarter, representing continued improvement with this metric from prior years. Free cash flow declined quarter-over-quarter, but there is no concern there. First, we use cash CapEx for our free cash flow calculation while many companies use accrual CapEx. If we had used accrual CapEx, then free cash flow would have increased by 11% quarter-over-quarter. In the fourth quarter of '23, we had a especially light cash CapEx, opposite of this quarter's dynamic. Second, we regularly encourage observers to focus on a four-quarter measure of free cash flow over a single quarter. We'll now turn it back to the operator for questions. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you, Philip. We will now take a question from Neal Dingmann from Truist Capital.\n\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Phil or to you Bobby, if you could talk maybe a little bit more about the acquisition, but pretty positive? Maybe in terms of what it added in terms of production? Maybe how we should think about incremental volumes throughout the year on this? And impact on guidance? And maybe even on the oil cut throughout the year? Just wondering how this might impact things.\n\nPhilip Riley: Yes, sure. I can start with that, Neal, this is Philip. The acquisition, it's producing about 400 barrels a day. That closed a couple of days ago, so you really only get the benefit for about two-thirds of the year. So when you divide that by a full year, that adds maybe 260 barrels a day average over the year. So it's some of what we're dealing with is the dynamic of averages over the year. So the guidance range we gave, 14.4 to 14.8, if you use the midpoint there, and if we held it flat, as Bobby was describing, that gets you to 14.5 for the year, right kind of smack in the middle of the previously disclosed guidance range. To reach that high end, we'd have to get to 15.3 on average for the remaining -- for all three quarters here. So we think it's pretty representative of a full year. The existing production is mostly kind of a mix of some few small non-op horizontal contributors there and then some smaller vertical. We do like it for that underdeveloped horizontal inventory, which we don't plan to drill this year. So that's the, I guess, the color on how it affects our production ranges. In general, we're excited about it. We like the idea of maintaining roughly a decade of inventory, and we think that this gets us there. It's also got some valuable infrastructure that we need both for our operations. And then frankly, we can even charge non-op partners neighbors in such the fees as they use our saltwater disposal wells and such. Does that answer the question?\n\nNeal Dingmann: Yes, it did, certainly does. It's good to hear. And then just a follow-up, could you maybe, you or Bobby, just talk a bit on oilfield services? It seems that bulk, maybe just talk about cost and availability. It seems like you're able to let the rig go, bring the rig back when you choose. It seems like you have, number one, just a lot of flexibility on the availability side. So I was wondering just -- is that the case? And then secondly, just on the OFS cost side, what you all see in it?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes, Neal, this is Bobby. I'll take that. So yes, we have a great relationship with the drilling contractor that's in the area that we're able to bring in and drill a batch of wells. And then releasing to some of our offset partners there to drill, but keep them in the same area. As we go to more pad drilling type of applications, it has -- we have lower cost on rig moves and more efficiencies on days from spud to TD, et cetera. So those costs are really falling in where we want them to be. Otherwise, on the pressure pumping side, we're seeing a softer market so that we're getting more competitive bids and pricing. I think we talked about that dynamic as some of these larger mergers and acquisitions have occurred. It's freed up a lot of frac teams and services that they want to maintain their market share. They're more aggressively pricing services for us. So we're taking advantage of that as we can right now in that market.\n\nNeal Dingmann: Yes, I love the flexibility. Thanks guys.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John White from ROTH Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn White: Good morning. And congratulations on closing your New Mexico acquisition.\n\nPhilip Riley: Thank you, John.\n\nJohn White: I wanted to ask about the RPC Power project. In the press release, you said you put in another $5.6 million, in effect, completes the funding for the current project. So that's the funding. How would you describe the work out in the field on the actual infrastructure?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes. I would say we're kind of right on schedule where we thought we'd be. We're installing 20 megawatts of power out there. We've had 10 megawatts over there for some time and we're just now receiving the second package of generators to get us up to our total design. We're currently getting all of that stuff tied into our private use network, which basically allows us to self-distribute power to all of our wells. So I think, operationally, that should be 100% operational probably by end of summer. And so far, I think we're really excited about that opportunity, at least we're producing our base load. And then looking at other opportunities that we might see coming our way with power.\n\nJohn White: Thanks for that. And when it's fully up and running, how much of your electricity or your power needs will this project satisfy?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes. So it's basically almost 100% of our power demand in Yoakum County on what we call our Champions. When we first designed the infrastructure out there, we laid that network in place. And now that's -- we're able to utilize that and we'll be self-providing practically 100%. There might be one or two wells that's still on an isolated meter, but the majority of it will be self-generating.\n\nJohn White: That's great. And does the similar opportunity exists on your New Mexico properties?\n\nBobby Riley: It does. As we're building out and looking at our infrastructure requirements in New Mexico, going forward, we are instead of tying individual meters back into the grid. We are installing, I don't know if it's the term, it's a private use network or our primary point of take from the provider out there so that eventually we can tie our own gen systems into that as well. But that's a little bit long term. We probably won't get there this year, but we're still on the laying out. It has to do with establishing drilling schedules and time to water infrastructure and all of that at the same time. But it's definitely what we do in our operation, and we will be doing that going forward.\n\nJohn White: Okay. Thanks for the additional details. I appreciate it.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Robertson from Water Tower Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Robertson: Thank you. To follow up on the power venture, Bobby or Philip, can you try to quantify the economic impact of supplying your own power to the Champions acreage compared to the alternative, which might have been selling the produced natural gas just into the grid at a relatively low price?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes. So that's what we're trying to do is basically increase the margins on the hydrocarbons that we produce in the area. So as you know, as Waha goes negative, sometimes the residue gas has little or no value to us. And because we're able to take that residue gas in time and power our gensets to offset our baseload production, our baseload operations. So from an individual well lease operating cost, it's probably somewhat neutral. But since we're a JV partner in the -- and the power company roughly will benefit from 50% of the revenues from generating power.\n\nPhilip Riley: 35% ownership right now that we're set to benefit from. And we think it's kind of a high-teen type of return, Jeff, but that's a nice stable return, right? This isn't an oil well that's declining, so it's something that we're excited about.\n\nJeff Robertson: Is it fair that the other part of the return just comes from having a more reliable source of power, which might lead to...\n\nBobby Riley: Absolutely. I mean, that was one of the primary reasons there is because we're kind of at the end of the grid there. And we were experiencing some brownouts or frequent power disruptions that cost an extensive amount of money to bring some of those wells back on. So that's -- again, it's one of the main reasons for doing this is more reliable power.\n\nJeff Robertson: In New Mexico, you talked about the saltwater disposal, the wells you acquired in the most recent acquisition and your SWD assets that serve that area. Do you need to spend much capital to either upgrade or enhance those to be able to handle Riley's activity plus be able to maybe take third-party volumes?\n\nBobby Riley: I think we're going to focus on just tying those wells in with some flow lines to loop them into our system to give us excess capacity. Primarily, we want to make sure that our disposal requirements are met with some spare capacity for emergencies and stuff like that. But as we continue to look at opportunities there, I think there would be some coming in where you could be charging some third party. But for the most part right now, we're 100% focused on our own disposal requirements.\n\nJeff Robertson: Either way you get some. Well, you ultimately get some LOE benefit from -- as you work through that process?\n\nBobby Riley: Yes, we should. I mean basically, the more wells that we have, the less amount of water each well has to take, which needs less energy it takes to push it down hole, et cetera, like that, so that gives us some savings there. And this gives us some redundancy, some fallback spare capacity. And then the ability to bring in some third-party water if we see that we got the excess capacity and moving water is important to us out there, and that's one of our main focuses to make sure we stay on top of that.\n\nJeff Robertson: Thank you.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call.

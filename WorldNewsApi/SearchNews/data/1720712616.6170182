The former Scotland international, now 69, was admitted to hospital and remains in a serious condition. Hansen spent 14 years at Anfield and was part of the all-conquering team which won eight league titles and three European Cups. In total, the Scotland international lifted 23 trophies during a glittering career at Liverpool, where he remains one of the club\u2019s greatest ever players. Hansen\u2019s brilliant ability on the ball, led many to reason he could have thrived in the modern game. In a statement, Liverpool said: \"The thoughts and support of everyone at Liverpool FC are with our legendary former captain Alan Hansen, who is currently seriously ill in hospital. \"A defender of the utmost elegance, Hansen\u2019s outstanding raft of honours across a 14-year spell with the Reds \u2013 he joined from Partick Thistle in 1977 \u2013 included eight league titles, three European Cups, two FA Cups and three League Cups. \"\u2018Jocky\u2019, as he was known by teammates, is in the top 10 for all-time appearances for the club having played 620 matches, and the Scottish centre-back also served as Liverpool skipper for four seasons. \"The club is currently in contact with Alan\u2019s family to provide our support at this difficult time, and our thoughts, wishes and hopes are with Alan and all of the Hansen family.\" We will provide any further updates as we receive them in due course, and we request that the Hansen family\u2019s privacy is respected at this time. After retiring in 1991, Hansen became one of the most well-known faces in football media, spending 22 years as BBC \u2019s main pundit and was credited with helping to change the way football was analysed. He became a broadcasting legend as part of Match of the Day team, as well as appearing on the station\u2019s coverage of World Cups, European Championships and Olympic games. Hansen delivered one of the most infamous lines in British football history, after declaring Manchester United \u2018wouldn\u2019t win anything with kids\u2019 after Sir Alex Ferguson introduced the \u2018Class of 92\u2019 into his team in 1995. Hansen retired from our screens and moved away from the limelight at the end of the 2013/14 campaign. At the time he said: \"The guys at the BBC know me and I said, \u2018Look, this is categorical. I\u2019m leaving and nothing will make me change my mind\u2019. I am contracted to do the World Cup and I will do that as it will be a good way to go out, but I have had a great run. \"\u2019I've been in football for 41 years and I\u2019m going out right at the top, just as I did at Liverpool,\" he added. Match of the Day host Gary Lineker, subsequently revealed that \u2018crippling nerves\u2019 played a part in the legendary defender ending his punditry career. \u201cHe was incredibly nervous, which is why he quit,\u201d he said last year. \"He got so nervous. He used to shuffle his feet on the floor.\" Lineker added: \"He was probably the first person that went down the more analytic route, a path now followed by so many. He was a brilliant pundit.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

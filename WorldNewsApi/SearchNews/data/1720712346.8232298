Here is more background from the Associated Press on the last NASCAR Cup series competition from Madison, Ill., last Sunday: Austin Cindric emerged as the surprise winner of the NASCAR Cup series race Sunday at World Wide Technology Raceway when teammate Ryan Blaney ran out of gas while leading on the final lap. Blaney, the reigning NASCAR Cup series champion, appeared to be on his way to his first win of the season after fighting off a challenge from Christopher Bell, who had his own car trouble in the closing laps. Cindric, who had pitted just one lap after Blaney, took advantage of the situation and notched his second career victory. The other came in the 2022 Daytona 500. \u201cIt was like my first time all over again,\u201d Cindric said. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long. Even just standing up on the roof of my car, I about fell over in Victory Lane.\u201d Denny Hamlin came in second, recording his sixth straight top-5 finish. Brad Keselowski was third, followed by Tyler Reddick and Joey Logano. Cindric said he didn\u2019t find out until he reached Victory Lane that Blaney had run out of gas \u2014 or that it might have been an issue for him. \u201cProbably the two best cars at the end of that race both had an issue, and the third-place car wins the race. That\u2019s the way I see it,\u201d Cindric said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like I went out there and I took the lead away but we were in position, and this is one of our best-executed races so far this year with probably our best speed.\u201d", "summary": "The NASCAR Cup Series is coming to wine country.

I know the feeling! So we had to wait for a new bus.\n\n\"It cost a quarter of a million! It was pretty hairy stuff.\n\n\"The big wagons were flying past us (as they were stuck on the hard shoulder) and it was 4am by the time I got to bed.\"\n\nAston Villa suffered more trouble on the road after flash new \u00a3250,000 coach broke down\n\nVilla are confident of complying with Financial Fair Play rules this season - and have plans in place to cope with \"slightly bigger issues\" in future.\n\nTheir transfer business has tried to achieve two aims - strengthening the squad to mount a promotion challenge and balancing the books at Villa Park and Bodymoor Heath.\n\nChief executive Keith Wyness insists they have been able to do that, but he admits the club will have less room for manoeuvre next year if they fail to go up.\n\n\"If we'd bought Neymar for 200 million we might have had a problem!\" smiled Wyness, talking to popular fans YouTube channel The Villa View.\n\n\"We're going to be tight this year on FFP but I think we're going to be okay.\n\n\"Next year I think we've got a slightly bigger issues, but again we've got plans in place to handle it.\n\n\"Also, there's a lot of changes going on with FFP, there's a lot of clubs looking to try to get the rules changed in the Championship in particular.\n\n\"So it's watch this space, but I think we're within the rules as we sit now.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to The Villa View here.\n\nNeil Warnock has revealed he has always had a soft spot for Aston Villa because he likes the claret and blue kit.\n\nWarnock will be looking to down Villa when Steve Bruce's team travel to Cardiff City for this weekend's Championship clash.\n\nThe Bluebirds boss was involved in a tunnel row with Jack Grealish at Villa Park last season and is not always the most popular figure with opposition players or fans.\n\nBut his nice comments about Villa might have* got the claret and blue faithful disliking him a little bit less.\n\n*Only might have!\n\nAsked about Aston Villa ahead of Saturday's match, Warnock said: \"They're still one of those teams aren't they? When I was a kid all those years ago, I used to love the colour of the shirts.\n\n\"It was always one of the top teams. There's always been an aura about it, Villa.\"\n\nNeil Warnock reveals the reason he has always liked Aston Villa - and it's a slight surprise\n\nBruce wants to model Aston Villa on Warnock's Cardiff City - sort of!\n\nVilla take on the Bluebirds in south Wales this weekend and Bruce has braced his team for a bruising challenge.\n\nBruce felt his Lions were too fragile last season, particularly away from home, as they fell well short of achieving their promotion aim.\n\nThis time he wants a team that can compete, is mentally and physically strong and can cope with what the Championship throws at it.\n\n\"I'm hoping by the time the window finishes that we'll have an Aston Villa team in the same sort of mould (as Cardiff).\n\n\"The one thing you do know what you're going to get with Neil Warnock's team is that they'll be highly committed, they'll be up and at you with a physical presence in a lot of areas, very good at free-kicks, very direct and that's what the Championship is.\n\n\"We play the complete opposites in the next two away games.\n\n\"One's going to be physical, a typical Neil Warnock team and then we've got Reading who play a totally different way on Tuesday so that's what the Championship is and we've got two big challenges ahead.\"\n\nJonathan Kodjia's comeback will not happen until mid-September - at the earliest.\n\nIt was originally hoped Kodjia would be fit enough to kick off the Championship season with Villa last weekend after missing the end of last term with a broken ankle.\n\nBut the quicker-than-expected recovery that looked to be on the cards has suffered a hitch, with the striker still experiencing pain.\n\nBruce had pencilled Kodjia in for September 9 when Villa play Brentford after the international break, but they are reluctant to put a specific timeframe for his return.\n\n\"I think we were hoping he would be back maybe after the international break,\" said Bruce.\n\n\"He's a bit sore at the minute on his fracture side, so we have to be a bit patient with him.\"\n\nMile Jedinak's return will come sooner. The Australian midfielder has been recovering from a groin operation and could be back before the end of August.\n\nGrealish is on the mend after suffering a freak injury in the final friendly against Watford and having to undergo kidney surgery, but it is still likely to be next year before he plays again.\n\nAndre Green has a groin strain and could miss the Cardiff match.\n\nAmavi has joined Marseille on loan in a deal which will turn into a permanent transfer next summer.\n\nThe left-footed Frenchman has experienced a frustrating time at Villa since arriving two years ago.\n\nHe was stopped in his tracks by a severe knee injury sustained on France under-21 duty and when he returned to fitness he lost his place, first to Aly Cissokho and then to Neil Taylor.\n\nThroughout it all, though, Amavi has remained the consummate professional and his attitude and work ethic was appreciated by Bruce.\n\n\"There's been talk all summer,\" said the Villa boss. \"I want to wish him the best of luck. He's a smashing pro.\n\n\"He had a horrific injury, unfortunately at the wrong time for him. Since I've been at the club he's one of those where he's never been a problem.\n\n\"However the money that we're getting obviously is good business for both parties and we wish him the best of luck.\"\n\nLeandro Bacuna will again be missing for Villa this weekend as he closes in on a move to Championship rivals Reading.\n\nBacuna was left out of the squad for the Carabao Cup win at Colchester United in midweek and he will not travel to Cardiff City for tomorrow's league match.\n\nBruce expects the utility player's transfer to the Royals to be completed soon.\n\nHe said: \"The two clubs are talking. I think it's well known now that Reading's the club. Its out there.\n\n\"He won't be involved for the weekend. I believe we're close but in all of these things negotiations seems to take forever and ever at the moment.\n\n\"I would think there's a deal to be done and for both parties it's the right sort of deal.\"\n\nAston Villa and Leandro Bacuna are right to part company now - and this is why\n\nCallum O'Hare has received a glowing endorsement from his manager after his high intensity debut at Colchester.\n\nBruce said: \"Young Callum ran a million miles on Wednesday.\n\n\"He covered the most ground, he had the highest intensity on the pitch and won every physical stat by a country mile.\n\n\"He's a breath of fresh air.\"\n\nSolihull-born O'Hare has been at Villa since he was a young boy and has progressed through the ranks.\n\nHe's now very much a part of first-team training and is expected to travel with the group down to Wales.\n\n\"He's got a certain resilience about him,\" said Bruce.\n\n\"He's got a heart bigger than himself.

Villa's away form improved with a win at Colchester United this week but the troubles on the road continue.\n\nThe club's brand new \u00a3250k team bus broke down on the A12 on the way home from the Carabao Cup tie in Essex, leaving Steve Bruce and his troops stranded.\n\nIt happened less than 30 minutes into the journey back as torrential rain poured down outside.\n\nAnd it wasn't until 4am before the players got to bed and that alone is hardly ideal preparation for another away day at Cardiff City on Saturday.\n\n\"It was a hell of a journey,\" said Bruce. \"Unfortunately, our brand new bus broke down on the A12.\n\n\"It was hammering it down with rain and the whole thing just packed in. I know the feeling! So we had to wait for a new bus.\n\n\"It cost a quarter of a million! It was pretty hairy stuff.\n\n\"The big wagons were flying past us (as they were stuck on the hard shoulder) and it was 4am by the time I got to bed.\"\n\nFFP update\n\nVilla are confident of complying with Financial Fair Play rules this season - and have plans in place to cope with \"slightly bigger issues\" in future.\n\nTheir transfer business has tried to achieve two aims - strengthening the squad to mount a promotion challenge and balancing the books at Villa Park and Bodymoor Heath.\n\nChief executive Keith Wyness insists they have been able to do that, but he admits the club will have less room for manoeuvre next year if they fail to go up.\n\n\"If we'd bought Neymar for 200 million we might have had a problem!\" smiled Wyness, talking to popular fans YouTube channel The Villa View.\n\n\"We're going to be tight this year on FFP but I think we're going to be okay.\n\n\"Next year I think we've got a slightly bigger issues, but again we've got plans in place to handle it.\n\n\"Also, there's a lot of changes going on with FFP, there's a lot of clubs looking to try to get the rules changed in the Championship in particular.\n\n\"So it's watch this space, but I think we're within the rules as we sit now.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to The Villa View here.\n\nListen to our latest Alliv Notsa podcast There's always been an aura\n\nNeil Warnock has revealed he has always had a soft spot for Aston Villa because he likes the claret and blue kit.\n\nWarnock will be looking to down Villa when Steve Bruce's team travel to Cardiff City for this weekend's Championship clash.\n\nThe Bluebirds boss was involved in a tunnel row with Jack Grealish at Villa Park last season and is not always the most popular figure with opposition players or fans.\n\nBut his nice comments about Villa might have* got the claret and blue faithful disliking him a little bit less.\n\n*Only might have!\n\nAsked about Aston Villa ahead of Saturday's match, Warnock said: \"They're still one of those teams aren't they? When I was a kid all those years ago, I used to love the colour of the shirts.\n\n\"It was always one of the top teams. There's always been an aura about it, Villa.\"\n\nSame sort of mould\n\nBruce wants to model Aston Villa on Warnock's Cardiff City - sort of!\n\nVilla take on the Bluebirds in south Wales this weekend and Bruce has braced his team for a bruising challenge.\n\nBruce felt his Lions were too fragile last season, particularly away from home, as they fell well short of achieving their promotion aim.\n\nThis time he wants a team that can compete, is mentally and physically strong and can cope with what the Championship throws at it.\n\n\"I'm hoping by the time the window finishes that we'll have an Aston Villa team in the same sort of mould (as Cardiff).\n\n\"The one thing you do know what you're going to get with Neil Warnock's team is that they'll be highly committed, they'll be up and at you with a physical presence in a lot of areas, very good at free-kicks, very direct and that's what the Championship is.\n\n\"We play the complete opposites in the next two away games.\n\n\"One's going to be physical, a typical Neil Warnock team and then we've got Reading who play a totally different way on Tuesday so that's what the Championship is and we've got two big challenges ahead.\"\n\nInjury news\n\nJonathan Kodjia's comeback will not happen until mid-September - at the earliest.\n\nIt was originally hoped Kodjia would be fit enough to kick off the Championship season with Villa last weekend after missing the end of last term with a broken ankle.\n\nBut the quicker-than-expected recovery that looked to be on the cards has suffered a hitch, with the striker still experiencing pain.\n\nBruce had pencilled Kodjia in for September 9 when Villa play Brentford after the international break, but they are reluctant to put a specific timeframe for his return.\n\n\"I think we were hoping he would be back maybe after the international break,\" said Bruce.\n\n\"He's a bit sore at the minute on his fracture side, so we have to be a bit patient with him.\"\n\nMile Jedinak's return will come sooner. The Australian midfielder has been recovering from a groin operation and could be back before the end of August.\n\nGrealish is on the mend after suffering a freak injury in the final friendly against Watford and having to undergo kidney surgery, but it is still likely to be next year before he plays again.\n\nAndre Green has a groin strain and could miss the Cardiff match.\n\nAu revoir\n\nBruce has given Jordan Amavi a fond farewell.\n\nAmavi has joined Marseille on loan in a deal which will turn into a permanent transfer next summer.\n\nThe left-footed Frenchman has experienced a frustrating time at Villa since arriving two years ago.\n\nHe was stopped in his tracks by a severe knee injury sustained on France under-21 duty and when he returned to fitness he lost his place, first to Aly Cissokho and then to Neil Taylor.\n\nThroughout it all, though, Amavi has remained the consummate professional and his attitude and work ethic was appreciated by Bruce.\n\n\"There's been talk all summer,\" said the Villa boss. \"I want to wish him the best of luck. He's a smashing pro.\n\n\"He had a horrific injury, unfortunately at the wrong time for him. Since I've been at the club he's one of those where he's never been a problem.\n\n\"However the money that we're getting obviously is good business for both parties and we wish him the best of luck.\"\n\nOn his way\n\nLeandro Bacuna will again be missing for Villa this weekend as he closes in on a move to Championship rivals Reading.\n\nBacuna was left out of the squad for the Carabao Cup win at Colchester United in midweek and he will not travel to Cardiff City for tomorrow's league match.\n\nBruce expects the utility player's transfer to the Royals to be completed soon.\n\nHe said: \"The two clubs are talking. I think it's well known now that Reading's the club. Its out there.\n\n\"He won't be involved for the weekend. I believe we're close but in all of these things negotiations seems to take forever and ever at the moment.\n\n\"I would think there's a deal to be done and for both parties it's the right sort of deal.\"\n\nBreath of fresh air\n\nCallum O'Hare has received a glowing endorsement from his manager after his high intensity debut at Colchester.\n\nBruce said: \"Young Callum ran a million miles on Wednesday.\n\n\"He covered the most ground, he had the highest intensity on the pitch and won every physical stat by a country mile.\n\n\"He's a breath of fresh air.\"\n\nSolihull-born O'Hare has been at Villa since he was a young boy and has progressed through the ranks.\n\nHe's now very much a part of first-team training and is expected to travel with the group down to Wales.\n\n\"He's got a certain resilience about him,\" said Bruce.\n\n\"He's got a heart bigger than himself. He's not the biggest in stature but he isn't half a trier.\"", "timeCrawl": "06:26:00", "sim": 0.8627451062202454, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 4592, "date": "2017-09-09", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 4603}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8752080", "categories": [], "details": {}}

When I was a kid all those years ago, I used to love the colour of the shirts,\" the 68-year-old said ahead of the clash with Steve Bruce's promotion favourites. \"It was always one of the top teams. There's always been an aura about it, Villa.\"\n\nBut there's also an aura about Warnock, one that has helped create a feeling around the side, the club and the city.\n\nA 20,000-plus crowd is expected for the first home game of the Championship season, a campaign that had plenty of optimism and hope - and a little bit of expectation - even before the fuel of a win on the first weekend.\n\nIt's an attendance that is not a complete anomaly, but this isn't one where there's freebies or discount as a well-intended bid to get supporters back connected with their club.\n\nInstead, it's an organic support that have begun to buy into what's being attempted by the Yorkshireman through a side that are ready to give as good as they've got this time around.\n\nWith it should come the noise and the atmosphere that will give home teams a head start, just as it once did down Canton way.\n\n\"From my younger days when I went to Ninian Park, I used to think that I'd love to get hold of this club,\" said Warnock. \"Because these fans are my kind of fans. I've said before, this just feels right with being the type of manager that I am.\n\n\"But I'd like our supporters to bring a a friend and let's get it up to that 25,000 mark. Even if they've not been before to come and see us again. We're gradually getting them back I think. You can tell around the city and other areas that they're coming back to the club.\"\n\nSome remain disconnected after the rebrand, but some have felt a bit of the old Bluebirds - a bit of the old Ninian side of things - edge back with their 'old school' manager at the helm.\n\nThen there are those who have been turned off by uninspiring football. Some have had the idea that the players chosen to wear a shirt seen as sacred by its supporters haven't had enough heart to do it justice.\n\nAsked what those fans who have not seen first-hand what they should expect by this side's attempts to push away from that, Warnock said: \"That they would get value for money.\n\n\"I thrive on fans wanting value for money and triers, and I think that's what they've got now, they've got triers. We have got quite a bit of ability as well but people don't give as much credit for, but I'm not too bothered about that, we can keep that under wraps for now.\n\n\"But if they've got any feelings for the club, now's the time to come on board. We need everybody. \"I think they know now it's not just a one-off and we're just talking a good game, I think they know they're going to get good value for money, whatever the result, and they can be proud of their own club.\n\n\"I think that's what I'm delighted about the most, putting the pride back in the club and getting everybody behind us.\"\n\nNot yet the bookmakers, though. Subtly but very purposely, Warnock made sure he reminded of the strength of Villa and the weight of expectation that comes with the spending and the star names.\n\nIt would be tempting to say Cardiff can't lose, though it would be a reality check for that early optimism if they are blown away by Steve Bruce's men.\n\nBut you doubt that will happen. You sense that Cardiff will be competitive this term whatever the game. While the result will not mean much in the grand scale of a season, showing that they can stand their ground on their own turf will do.\n\nAnd with supporters eager to see that it's worth being excited about enjoying this season, so comes a chance for Warnock and his men to inspire, with the likes of Lee Tomlin and Kenneth Zohore able to show against good level opposition that Cardiff are indeed more than about just trying.\n\n\"Well if we lose to Villa it won't be a shock,\" Warnock insisted. \"If we win it might be but I think we'll be like that against all the big teams, the sides that have come down, your Sheffield Wednesdays, Leeds, and all these clubs we'll be underdogs going into all these.\n\n\"And that's probably the best we can be really, that helps us in that determination. In every walk of life, people want to show what they can do. Our lads are no different. I could see yesterday the lads are all really looking forward to it. It doesn't mean you're guaranteed anything - in this division there will be highs and lows, despondency and euphoria.\n\n\"With the bookies, we're meant to finish in the bottom half. We haven't got to get carried away with high expectations, we've just got to demand that everyone plays to the best of their ability. I think when we do that we think we can give anybody a good game in our league, no matter how much money they've spent. We want to make it a good game tomorrow, to be as close as it can be.\"\n\nWarnock will mull over decisions of system and selection, knowing he has got options to keep teams guessing.\n\nChanges won the game last week, though he was quick to remind that \"They won't always come off; I'll make changes and they'll backfire sometimes, you just have to accept you'll get more right that wrong.\"\n\nWarnock has done plenty right so far and is hopeful of the home backing to illustrate it. Then it's down to the Bluebirds to inspire as they seek an old home aura.\n\npoll loading What will the outcome be this weekend? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR Cardiff City win Draw Aston Villa win", "timeCrawl": "12:28:00", "sim": 0.800000011920929, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8612398", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "id": 14, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "id": 138, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "id": 751, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Words_and_Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Words and Trivia", "id": 1592, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Championship on Saturday afternoon.\n\nChief football writer Chris Wathan looks at the reasons why the Cardiff faithful should be feeling confident ahead of the clash with the Villans...\n\nBecause Warnock's brought the fortress factor back\n\nOne of Neil Warnock's favourite memories is of taking a QPR side to Cardiff City Stadium and grabbing a draw that put his Hoops side on course for promotion.\n\nGranted, the fondness came at Cardiff's expense and there is a smile when he has recalled an entertaining game including a special showing from Adel Taarabt.\n\nYet it has sprung more into Warnock's mind in recent years because of the atmosphere he knows is capable at Cardiff City Stadium and how it's a ground that away teams would be happy to sneak a point with them for their trip back over the Severn.\n\nIt's not been the case often enough in recent years for a number of reasons - rebrand disconnection, dwindling crowds, lack of anything to play for, uninspiring football - and there have been times where the fearsome noise of Ninian Park felt like it belonged to a different club.\n\nBut Warnock's trusted No.2 Kevin Blackwell said not long after their arrival that turning the Bluebirds' home back into a venue where opposition squads would not look forward to was a key priority.\n\nIt was actually the New Year's visit of Villa last season that showed what can be possible, a raucous atmosphere and a committed, disciplined display combining in unison for the first time in a long time to thwart a fancied visitor.\n\nWarnock wants more of the same and knows that, as it was the last time the Bluebirds won promotion, making Cardiff City Stadium a place where confidence is drained from the moments sides step off the bus is key.\n\nHe has the players - suddenly you look around the Cardiff team and there are physically imposing figures prepared to go to the wall for each other - but now what's required is the fans to play their part.\n\nBecause Cardiff can treat it like a cup clash\n\nIt sounds a little daft to say such a thing, especially if Cardiff are to see themselves as someone who can share the same promotion ambitions as Villa.\n\nHowever, Warnock hinted at it last week when he claimed that promotions are won at places like Burton whereas games against Aston Villa and the like take care of themselves.\n\nIt is not say that Warnock won't take the same care and consideration into how to stop - and how to attack - Steve Bruce's side.\n\nBut he'll know that he might be able to play on the big-game feel of a 20,000-plus crowd (including a sizeable away support) and motivate his own side to find that extra fuel in reserve to upset a side with players more used to Premier League or international environments.\n\nVilla may well be used to it being such a giant club in the second tier, but that doesn't mean they have yet learned to cope with it. Certainly, whereas Cardiff have plenty to gain, even at this early stage of the season - and especially after having failed to win their opening fixture against Hull last weekend - they have more to lose.\n\nBecause the Bluebirds have an unknown quantity\n\nBruce will do his homework, long proven as a shrewd operator at this level. Indeed, whatever happens this weekend, it's a safe bet that he will be earning a fourth Premier League promotion with a third different club come May.\n\nBut Cardiff have plenty about them to have their Midlands visitors guessing and hopefully keeping them on the back foot. The options Warnock has worked himself means Bruce can't be sure whether the Bluebirds will start with the three centre-back combination they began at Burton against, or whether it will be the flat back four that finished the game.\n\nJazz Richards could come in as a second attacking full-back, or Lee Peltier could keep his place to offer an extra sturdy hand. Further forward, Danny Ward could partner Kenneth Zohore for two strikers, or there could be wingers involved. It goes on, but can also include individuals.\n\nNathaniel Mendez-Laing has much to prove at this level, but is making a good early go at it, while it will be fair to say they won't know much about Loic Damour. A surprise or two could await.\n\nBecause where there's Zohore, there's a chance\n\nCardiff's hope of victory relies on a performance from all eleven selected from Warnock, as well as those he calls upon from the bench.\n\nBut Zohore showed at Burton he only needs that one bit of space to let his confidence shine and continue the form that caught everyone by surprise last year.\n\nHe should be revelling in the chance of going up against two class centre-backs in Terry and Wales Euro 2016 hero James Chester, knowing he can really lay down a marker by impressing.\n\nZohore has a threat in different areas and he shouldn't be afraid to explore them and, if Cardiff can remain solid and keep themselves in the game, it gives him that opportunity to be the headline-grabber once more.\n\nSean Morrison said last week that knowing they have such an up-and-coming talent up top gives extra incentive to keep out opposition.\n\nBecause Villa are without their star striker\n\nVilla's strengthening has come in the shape of experience and those further down the pitch, with Terry, Chris Samba and Glenn Whelan all at his disposal. But there have been questions of them in attack, with Shane Hogan yet to fire since his move from Brentford.\n\nAll eyes are on the frontman with last season's top scorer, Jonathan Kodjia, still some way off fitness after breaking his ankle at the tail-end of last season.\n\nIt needed veteran Villain Gabby Agbonlahor to get them off the mark against Hull, but Cardiff's centre-backs may well fancy their chances of coming out on top when it comes to the individual battles.\n\npoll loading What will the outcome be this weekend? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR Cardiff City win Draw Aston Villa win", "timeCrawl": "16:04:00", "sim": 0.772549033164978, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8655858", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "id": 143, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

It was a run of 10 goals in 11 games which gave Bluebirds fans great heart. But here he was instrumental as a team player, running the channels and skipping past defenders to open up space for others.\n\nIt was clear in Mendez-Laing's opening goal that Villa's defence were more concerned with Zohore. That let the ex-Rochdale wide man sneak round the back-post to head home and give Cardiff a precious 1-0 first half lead. Warnock will be delighted that Zohore is striking up such a great understanding with his fellow forward.\n\nFreebie Mendez showing his worth\n\nNathaniel Mendez-Laing had earned his place in the starting XI after two convincing statements as a substitute. On this basis, he's not letting go of the shirt any time soon.\n\nWarnock admitted he signed the Rochdale Bosman on a hunch - and the gut instinct is still alive and well in the 68-year-old with the wideman not only looking exactly what Cardiff need, but looking as though he has been playing a better level than the lower leagues all his life.\n\nPace, power, confidence, and an accuracy that Warnock had aimed a cheeky dig at in midweek when he said he keeps hitting the fans at the back of the stands behind the goal. The only thing he was hitting here was the back of the net and, with his urgency, dynamism and refusal to see his opportunity slip, he has what it takes to make sure it continues.\n\nA welcome return to the old Cardiff atmosphere\n\nWarnock had given himself every right to call on true backing for this home opener. Regardless of the numbers through the turnstiles, he was answered with an atmosphere that felt like the old Cardiff.\n\nHelped by a feeling of being an unfancied underdog taking on the big boys - a status the Bluebirds have always thrived on - the atmosphere was so far removed from the pin-dropping apathy that sound-tracked recent seasons.\n\nRegardless of the result , it was the kind of experience that either reminded. why you go to football or why you should go again. But the manner of the Bluebirds' win, the full commitment from the off, ensured that it shouldn't be a one-off.\n\nThe return of Cardiff's leaders\n\nSean Morrison wears the Bluebirds' armband and, once again, the Cardiff skipper showed he is growing and growing in stature under Neil Warnock.\n\nBut it was also refreshing to suddenly see Cardiff as a team with so many leaders not long after it was hard to find one player taking responsibility.\n\nMorrison was at the heart of it but then there was Sol Bamba, going around and telling teammates to calm down and take time as Villa tried to force their way back into things. Aron Gunnarsson was everywhere, happy to talk others through the game and offer influence with a 'follow me' approach to work-rate.\n\nAnd then there was Zohore who, with his confidence and willingness to shoulder a large burden of frontline expectation, looked every inch the talisman ready to shine rather than shrink in a challenge.\n\nVilla floundering\n\nIt said so much about this Cardiff City performance that Aston Villa's Man Of The Match was goalkeeper Sam Johnstone, who produced a string of excellent saves to deny Zohore the goal he deserved. Too often, for Steve Bruce's liking, were Villa's back four pulled apart as Mendez-Laing and company set about their business.\n\nThe burly winger, coupled with Zohore and the speedy Junior Hoilett, raced past John Terry and James Chester for fun. These Villa defenders are players with big reputations don't forget, but they took a big blow at Cardiff City Stadium on this Saturday afternoon. Terry's battle with Zohore was billed a crucial and the Dane emerged as the clear winner.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now", "timeCrawl": "18:06:00", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8826722", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "id": 143, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "id": 448, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Won't enjoy a win as much as that one all season.\"\n\nAfter drawing at home to Hull City and losing at Cardiff, Villa go in search of their first Championship win of the season at Reading on Tuesday evening to hopefully kickstart their promotion push.\n\nIn the latest episode of our podcast, Alliv Notsa, we discuss Gabby Agbonlahor.\n\nThe novelty of new grounds, different locations and increased away allocations has not worn off on Villa fans just yet, writes Gregg Evans.\n\nAlmost 5,000 fans packed into the away end at the Cardiff City Stadium and they made good noise throughout.\n\nThe continued support will help Villa in their pursuit for success this season but they won't stand for performances like that again.\n\nThe majority of fans who were left at the end clapped the team off but at least half of the following had departed early after getting fed up with the display.\n\n\"I think they know what I think of them,\" said Bruce.\n\n\"They're a remarkable bunch, especially away from home where your diehard supporters are. Again, the disappointing thing for me is we haven't given them enough to shout about.\n\nThese brilliant Aston Villa away fans will not stand for much more of that\n\nLeandro Bacuna's time at Aston Villa is almost up.\n\nBacuna was left out of the Villa squad for the Cardiff match and is expected to join Championship rivals Reading in the next few days.\n\nAnd it prompted comments from these fans on social media, who gave their verdicts on the 25-year-old utility man.\n\nLee Lindsay: I actually think this is a loss for AV. He's always had a good work rate, never really let villa down. He is versatile and has a threat it front of goal. Inconsistent at times but a decent player. If he was given his position week in week out I'm sure he would come on leaps and bounds. Good luck to him at Reading.\n\nTodd Bergman: Works hard and finds plenty of the ball but passes to the other team 80% of the time\n\nAshley Evans: He had that one great free kick goal when we beat Man City at home just after he arrived.\n\nThen I remember that cross for the Benteke header when we won at Spurs when Sherwood kept us up. Apart from those two moments what else did he ever do to stay for 4 years and earn a bumper long term contract? Sums up how badly the club has been run in the time Bacuna's been here.\n\nLeandro Bacuna is in Aston Villa's departure lounge - fans have their say\n\nJordan Amavi has revealed Marseille tried to sign him last winter - but he wanted to remain loyal to Aston Villa for helping him through his injury nightmare.\n\nAmavi finally moved to the French club this week, joining on loan ahead of a permanent transfer last summer.\n\nIt marked the end of a frustrating time at Villa for the 22-year-old who had to contend with a severe knee problem, and then losing his place to Aly Cissokho and Neil Taylor.\n\nThe French left-back, said: \"Last winter they wanted to recruit me.\n\n\"It didn't happen because I just got back from my injury and I was in a club that was counting on me and who supported me during my injury.\n\n\"It's true it happened at a bad time.\n\n\"I had just done a full season at OGC Nice, then Aston Villa. It's in your head that you need to stay strong. I started to become more positive.\n\n\"So I made the decision to stay there.

suddenly start being taken seriously this season.\n\n\"I don't know why they are being written off,\" admitted beaten visiting boss Steve Bruce, refreshingly honest when he said that his Aston Villa side had been taken to \"the edge of embarrassment\" by an \"excellent\" Cardiff team who he thinks have every reason to have lofty ambitions this year.\n\nIt's perhaps because, unlike Villa, Cardiff are not a team of well-known names.\n\nYet, in a week where Tottenham defender Danny Rose chastised his own club for 'signing players you have to Google', the Bluebirds were the perfect illustration that low-profile can still mean highly impressive.\n\nLike Nathaniel Mendez-Laing, a freebie from Rochdale who John Terry might not have known about before this clash, but will have his name etched on his mind as the Bosman wideman handed out a reality check about the challenge of the Championship.\n\nVilla's ex-England captain was in the Premier League last season, Mendez-Laing in League One, and yet there was only one who was a class above here. Two goals, one to open the scoring on 21 minutes with a deft header, and one to take Villa to that edge Bruce mentioned as he left Terry planted in the box before curling home the third with 19 minutes still to go.\n\nYou would assume Kenneth Zohore is someone who is making a name for himself, and yet still found himself ignored by the bookmakers for the second-tier's golden boot.\n\nTrue, the Dane did not add to his opening day goal here, but, undoubtedly, he has just added a few more million to his value with the way he tore holes in a Villa defence seen as the most experienced and able in the division.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now\n\nHis attributes have become obvious to Cardiff fans but his confidence is now bringing them to a whole new level and a whole new audience. He provided the cleverly chipped assist for Junior Hoilett's second on the hour mark but time and time again strode clear of claret shirts and brought the best out of visiting keeper Sam Johnstone, a player without whom then this could have been five or six.\n\nFormer QPR and Blackburn man Hoilett is someone who has past pedigree and, in Warnock's words, rolled back the years as he provided the opener for Mendez-Laing and joined in the fun of a front three that Warnock says no rival would want to face right now.\n\nBut it was made possible from the determined discipline below them, fitness and firm understanding keeping Cardiff on very much on top after just 20 minutes. Villa did see one James Chester effort come off the bar from a set-piece, but in truth they hardly threatened following Neil Etheridge's early save.\n\nLoic Damour, a player who was not only unknown but played for virtually unheard of clubs, earned praise from the manager for his effort. But the Frenchman also displayed some delightful touches, while the back-line back in a four stayed stubbornly solid, all as a unit.\n\nUnity was certainly a theme of a day that will be unforgettable for those who have had struggles recalling an afternoon of similar enjoyment on all levels at Cardiff City Stadium.\n\nIt was in the performance in front of a support that all responded in the way Warnock wanted, the right levels of intimidation and encouragement from a crowd where there were finally more smiles on faces than seats without bodies.\n\nAnd then there was Vincent Tan, attending his first home game in two seasons and returning to a club that has a completely different feel about it than on his previous visits.\n\nThe last time Cardiff produced an afternoon that sparked the same smiles as this, it was when they shocked Manchester City in the Premier League. As the celebrations went on, a sign of the trouble and turbulent times awaiting the Bluebirds came in the snubbed handshake between owner and manager.\n\nHere Tan and Warnock embraced in front of fans like old friends, their smiles reflected back by a crowd who are starting to think that not only have corners been turned, but that they can quickly move forward.\n\nThe veteran Yorkshireman was quick to dampen down such talk, mentioning that he is too long in the tooth to get as carried away as others will be.\n\nBut he will now have something of a challenge because, even two games in, you can't perform like that and not expect people to take note. They won't be under the radar for much longer at this rate.\n\nThankfully, amid the beams and dreams of such a convincing display against such a stellar name, Warnock was full of warnings.\n\nSheffield United on Tuesday will provide a different kind of test while the new boys will examine whether complacency creeps in when the cup-feel of this Villa clash is missing. As grand a name and club as Villa are, not all sides will be as weak in their resolve when forced onto the back foot. Thinking that Cardiff are suddenly unbeatable after two wins from two would be plain daft.\n\n\"Two down, 44 to go,\" mentioned Warnock, knowing that the Championship is unforgiving to those who think they've cracked it after 180 minutes.\n\nBut still, after this performance, they won't be under the radar for much longer.\n\nBecause the feeling being created Warnock and his side making a name for themselves is undeniable.", "timeCrawl": "20:30:00", "sim": 0.7490196228027344, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8840847", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "id": 143, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

promotion favourites 3-0 at Cardiff City Stadium.\n\nNathaniel Mendez-Laing stole the headlines with two goals, while Kenneth Zohore and Junior Hoilett were also influential for the Bluebirds.\n\nWith Villa boasting John Terry, James Chester, Neil Taylor and Alan Hutton in an experienced back four, the pundits and national media had a field day in slamming the visitors. But there was also plenty of praise for Cardiff as well.\n\nThis is how the nation viewed Cardiff's memorable victory...\n\nChris Iwelumo, ex Championship striker\n\nSpeaking on Channel 5's Football on Five show, the former Wolves and Burnley striker was effusive with his praise for Warnock's canny transfer business, which included the capture of two-goal hero Mendez-Laing.\n\n\"They got him on a free transfer from Rochdale and Neil Warnock again and again he does it,\" said Iwelumo.\n\n\"His experience and recruitment is second to none.\"\n\nStan Collymore, former Villa star\n\nThe 3-0 scoreline was tough to swallow for former Aston Villa and Liverpool frontman Collymore, but the outspoken pundit grudgingly gave praise to Cardiff and their swash-buckling attacking play. Not before he'd vented his fury at the Villans' performance though...\n\nHe said on Twiter: \"Villa. Absolutely f***ing tripe again.\n\n\"To the 5,000 Villans at Cardiff today, you're by far the best thing at our club. Thanks for the support.\n\n\"Heard good things about the Bluebirds today, good luck to you. Villa should be at least competing though. We didn't.\"\n\nESPN\n\nThe American sports website also reported the game with gushing praise for the Bluebirds.\n\nOn star man Zohore, their report said: \"The powerful Danish striker interested Premier League newcomers Brighton this summer, and the way he danced down the touchline before crossing for Hoilett to tap home showed he has the class to play at a higher level.\n\n\"Zohore gave Villa's experienced centre-half pairing of Terry and Chester a torrid afternoon and when Mendez-Laing slotted home a third after breezing past Alan Hutton, the game was decided as a contest.\"\n\nMirror\n\nIt was again Warnock's ability to unearth a transfer gem that drew praise from the Mirror.\n\nThey wrote: \"Neil Warnock's men were 3-0 winners and sit top of the table, having also won at Burton Albion last week. Warnock has been scouring the bargain bins over the summer and it was one of his new men, Nathaniel Mendez-Laing, signed from Rochdale, who did the business.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now", "timeCrawl": "12:42:00", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8915683", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Championship game of the 2017-18 campaign.\n\nNeil Warnock's men go into the match on the back of consecutive wins against Burton and Portsmouth and will hope to secure a repeat of last season's 1-0 victory against Steve Bruce's side on Saturday.\n\nThe Villans have been widely tipped to go up this season, with many expecting them to clinch one of the two automatic promotion spots come the end of the campaign.\n\nIt has been announced that more than 20,000 tickets have already been sold for the match, and there's no doubt the Bluebirds will need the full backing from the Cardiff faithful if they are to overcome Villa.\n\nHaving splashed the cash following their relegation from England's top flight in 2016, Bruce's side have been far more subdued in the transfer window this year.\n\nBut that's not to say they haven't strengthened.\n\nThe signature of John Terry hit the headlines, and with more than 700 Chelsea appearances to his name, Terry needs no introduction.\n\nBut the Villans have made a few other shrewd signings over the close season.\n\nBruce has added former Stoke man Glenn Whelan and ex-Hull midfielder Ahmed Elmohamady to his ranks as well as securing loan deals to take Josh Onomah and Sam Johnstone to Villa Park from Tottenham and Manchester United respectively.\n\nTheir three permanent signings have an average age of almost 33, and with that comes a wealth of Premier League experience.\n\nWhelan has 81 caps for Republic of Ireland and has secured promotions with Sheffield Wednesday and Stoke during his professional career while Elmohamady has been part of a promotion-winning side on two occasions with Hull.\n\nAnd when you factor in the experience of Wales duo Neil Taylor and James Chester along with frontman Gabby Agbonlahor, it's easy to see why Villa are being tipped for good things this season.\n\nFormer Blackburn man Chris Samba was listed among the substitutes for Villa's 1-1 draw with Hull on the opening day of the new season, and even some of those who did not feature against the Tigers - including Conor Hourihane - have vast experience in the second tier of the English football pyramid.\n\nIt goes to show just how experienced Bruce's side are, even more so when you consider that the key duo of Jack Grealish and Mile Jedinak haven't even featured for the club yet this season.\n\nSo backed by a bumper crowd and buoyed by the Bluebirds' winning start to the season, there's no doubt Warnock's men will be up against it, although he will relish the clash as Cardiff look to send a real statement out to the rest of the division.\n\nLittle more than seven months ago, Joe Ralls' first half strike proved enough to see Cardiff clinch all three points against the Villans in what proved to be a tactical masterclass from Warnock.\n\nAnd if the Bluebirds look at the league table to see a tally of six points next to their name at around 4:50pm on Saturday evening, the already-high optimism in the Welsh capital will continue to rise, and the other Championship sides will have no doubt that Cardiff really do mean business this year.\n\npoll loading What will the outcome be this weekend? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Cardiff

Question marks have also been placed on Anthony Pilkington's future.\n\nWarnock did hint in the week Noone could leave on loan, but said he doesn't expect any updates on any departures until the final days of business.\n\nThe veteran boss - who has no fresh injury concerns for the visit of Villa - said: \"That will all be last-minute won't it? People will be looking around. Some will have lost two or three games and wonder what they can look at, others will be looking for a certain type, then it will be everybody in the hat on the last day, as stupid as it always is.\n\n\"I don't know why it is like that but why I'm delighted to have got most of my business done before we got back to training. It's very unusual for me to do that. I probably had a gamble on a few players this summer, but I felt we had to do that, financially-wise, to get the type of person I wanted at the club and fortunately they've all fitted in very well.\"\n\npoll loading What will the outcome be this weekend? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR Cardiff City win Draw Aston Villa win", "timeCrawl": "10:49:00", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8594784", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "id": 99, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "id": 811, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Disorders", "id": 812, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "id": 913, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

been some turnaround for Nathaniel Mendez-Laing.\n\nEspecially considering the man known simply as 'Mendez' arrived at Cardiff City two months ago with no great fanfare.\n\nHis free transfer this summer, following two half-decent seasons with Rochdale, wasn't celebrated like the subsequent arrivals of Lee Tomlin and Danny Ward.\n\n'Who's this guy?' some fans were asking. No doubt they Googled his modest record -- getting in even before Danny Rose!\n\nBut they know his name now, alright. Mendez has three goals as many Bluebirds appearances and has quickly etched his name in Warnock's promotion plans.\n\nBut how did we get here?\n\nThis is story of Mendez-Laing's rise: the early promise of his Wolverhampton youth, how his career once hung by a thread and how the feted Warnock magic is working yet again.\n\nA raw talent\n\nAsk anyone who saw Mendez-Laing as an academy prospect at Wolves and they will no doubt recall the winger's obvious ability.\n\nHe featured for England at Under-16 and Under-17 level. He'd even made his first team debut under Mick McCarthy in a 2009 League Cup tie, signing a professional contract with the Molineux club.\n\nThe challenge for the coaches was to turn Mendez-Laing's talent into consistent performances.\n\nYet at a club bouncing between Premier League and Championship, Mendez-Laing was deemed unready. He was sent to Peterborough United and Sheffield United on loan.\n\nFormer Wolves striker Chris Iwelumo recalled how the club never quite saw the wide man's best form. But he wasn't surprised to see Mendez now thriving in the Championship.\n\n\"The penny has finally dropped with him,\" said Iwelumo . \"He was a young boy at Wolves when I was there and you could see the quality but it just wasn't consistent.\n\n\"And he's done what a lot of players do, they go down the levels and it sinks in. They know the qualities they've got and he's delivering.\"\n\nLosing his way\n\nMendez-Laing scored nine goals in 30 league starts for Peterborough across two spells, initially on loan and then after a \u00a3100,000 deal that took him away from his West Midlands home.\n\nBut a mixture of injury and ill-discipline led Posh manager Darren Ferguson to jettison Mendez-Laing from his plans. The winger had been caught up in a city centre disturbance that left him in footballing limbo.\n\nFerguson eventually welcomed him back, following a loan spell at Portsmouth, saying:\"I don't bear grudges. Mendez-Laing is back at the club and it's now up to me and the coaching staff to get the best out of him. He clearly has ability, but he must also now knuckle down and do all he can to help this team.\"\n\nHowever, more injury set-backs meant Mendez-Laing failed to break back into the Posh team on a regular basis and he left London Road in August 2015.\n\nHe'd spent much of the 2014/15 campaign out on loan, first with Shrewsbury -- a stint cut short by injury -- and then at Cambridge, where he enjoyed some individual success.\n\nA Rochdale revival (of sorts)\n\nFollowing Mendez-Laing's release from Peterborough, it was a move to League One Rochdale that started to put him back on track.\n\nManager Keith Hill has been a steadying hand with Dale since 2013 and quickly extracted some performances from the talented winger.\n\nHill, who played under Warnock at Plymouth in the 1990s, was then happy to see the Bluebirds' boss state his interest in Mendez-Laing after two years at Spotland yielded 15 goals from 48 league starts -- 10 of those coming last season.\n\n\"He's had an up-and-down career, it fell away a little bit and my old player Keith Hill got him back on line at Rochdale,\" said Warnock.\n\n\"I spoke to Hilly and he said 'I'm glad he's coming with you, gaffer, it's just what he needs'.\"\n\nWarnock an 'ideal' influence\n\nHill's words have proven prophetic.\n\nBecause in the same way Kenneth Zohore emerged from nowhere to lead the Cardiff line last season, the new winger looks like becoming this season's diamond from th rough, polished by Warnock.\n\nLike the Dane, the manager's influence is paramount to Mendez-Laing's progress.\n\nSpeaking after his two-goal performance to sink Villa, Mendez-Laing spoke about Warnock's advice.\n\n\"He's my ideal type of manager,\" he said.\n\n\"He's very talkative, tells me where I'm going wrong and what I can improve on. When I first came here we had a conversation and it's very inspiring what he says to me. So I want to do well for him as well as myself.\n\n\"It's been perfect for me. I maybe didn't go the way I should've gone at a young age but hopefully this is the turning point.\n\n\"The manager at Rochdale was very similar and got me focused. I did well there and thankfully I've got another manager who's similar.\n\n\"To see the players (Warnock) has done that with, the number of times he's gone up, it all rolls into one.\n\n\"I think 'wow' he obviously knows what he's doing and I need to listen and take it on board. We just click.\"\n\nThe two-goal Villa show\n\nNetting two very different goals in Cardiff's 3-0 win over Aston Villa , Mendez-Laing showed the full range of his abilities.\n\nNot only does he possess extraordinary strength and stature, displayed in the first goal as he towered over Taylor at the back post to head home Zohore's cross -- he's also brilliantly quick over the ground.\n\nTime and time again he tore past Chester, leaving Terry leaden-footed in curling home a stunning second. It secured the points for Cardiff and secured Mendez-Laing a first team place that he was by no means guaranteed when he signed for Warnock.\n\nHis early season performances have laid down the gauntlet to Tomlin, Ward and the injured Kadeem Harris. For a player expected to be nothing more than a useful squad player, it's refreshing to see and creates healthy competition in the Bluebirds ranks.\n\nReaping more rewards at Cardiff\n\nThe key for Mendez-Laing now is continuing to hit those levels of consistency, starting when the Bluebirds host Sheffield United on Tuesday night.\n\nClearly emboldened by Warnock and thriving on this red-hot form, the former Wolves prodigy is confident he can.\n\n\"I know what I'm capable of doing when I'm on the football field,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm hungry now and there were times when it was slipping away. But I worked hard, got myself back up on my feet and I haven't looked back.\"\n\n\"He's listened,\" said Warnock when asked if he could explain Mendez-Laing's unexpected rise.\n\n\"I spent quite a lot of time with him and I think he's got something to prove.\n\n\"And I think he's enjoying it. If you can get him enjoying it and working hard, his teammates accept it. We saw a vintage Hoilett on the other side (against Villa) and that brought the best of out him, and with Ken up front it was quite a force.\"\n\nMendez-Laing is quite a force indeed right now. And he's had quite a start to his Cardiff career.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now", "timeCrawl": "16:24:00", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2015-08-", "textStart": 3000, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3011}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8939732", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "id": 448, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

As a trio, they tore Villa's experienced defence to shreds and laid down a marker to teams around the Championship.\n\nThe Bluebirds' promotion hopes had been written off before the season started, but they're now being talked up by pundits thanks to their sparkling forwards.\n\nYet Warnock, who made a telling change to his formation from the opening day win at Burton Albion, insisted his midfield three deserved the plaudits too. Loic Damour was drafted into the middle as Warnock switched to a 4-3-3 and dropped Lee Tomlin to the bench.\n\nAnd the boss said Damour, along with the industrious Aron Gunnarsson and Joe Ralls, merited huge praise.\n\n\"I like the bread and butter players as well,\" he said after being asked about the Cardiff front three.\n\n\"Gunnars and Joe Ralls were fabulous and Loic covered every blade of grass.\n\n\"I was going to sub him (Damour) six times in the second half, but every time he made a run.\n\n\"Everybody played their part, so it was a good day for us, a good crowd with the owner here too. Vincent (Tan) couldn't have wished for a better result against a very very good side.\"\n\nWith Tomlin an unused substitute against Villa and fellow new boy Danny Ward only introduced late on, Warnock -- who may shuffle his pack again for Tuesday night's clash with Sheffield United -- is relishing the Bluebirds' strength in depth.\n\nCardiff still have Kadeem Harris to return from injury and out-of-favour duo Craig Noone and Anthony Pilkington on their books, as well as the promising Matty Kennedy.\n\n\"It's nice to have those ingredients,\" Warnock added.\n\n\"We've got Tomlin as well who didn't even get a look-in today. So it's exciting thinking about what we've got.\"\n\nThe Bluebirds boss admitted he was enjoying working with a squad high on confidence right now.\n\nAfter three wins from their opening three games -- including the midweek Carabao Cup win over Portsmouth (2-1 after extra time) -- the Bluebirds will look to preserve their 100 per cent record as long as possible.\n\nThat starts against Sheffield United, but Warnock again warned against complacency, knowing this golden run won't last forever.\n\nHe added: \"I'm enjoying it, I've got a genuine bunch of players, I've got lads who'll run through a brick wall for me and I've got ability as well.\n\n\"It's very brittle confidence. It's knowing what you're good at and using it.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now", "timeCrawl": "18:04:00", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8950675", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

But otherwise as solid as ever.\n\nSean Morrison (capt.) 7\n\nScott Hogan didn't stand a chance whenever the ball was in the air. On the deck, the former Brentford striker gave Morrison some trouble, but all in all the skipper coped well.\n\nSol Bamba 8\n\nLooked to put his early season (first-half) wobble at Burton Albion to bed with a much more assured display. Perhaps a back four suits the Ivorian best?\n\nJoe Bennett 7\n\nMarginalised slightly against his former club with so much of the play down the middle, but Bennett - albeit restricted in terms of his forward threat - was solid enough until he went off injured.\n\nJoe Ralls 7\n\nGets his fair share of criticism from Bluebirds fans but his energy in midfield was more valuable than ever. Appeared to unsettle his Villa counterparts.\n\nAron Gunnarsson 7\n\nWhat would Cardiff City do without him? Quietly went about his business and was helped out by an extra body in central midfield.\n\nLoic Damour 8\n\nCompletely merited selection in central midfield after impressing so much as a substitute at Burton Albion. Never stopped running and timed a few tackles to upset Glenn Whelan and company.\n\nJunior Hoilett 8\n\nRather quiet, apart from two vital, vital interventions. The first came on 21 minutes when Hoilett stood up a teasing cross that was begging to be headed home by Mendez-Laing. The second came when he converted Zohore's ball.\n\nNathaniel Mendez-Laing 9\n\nHas Neil Warnock unearthed a gem here? Mendez-Laing ran Taylor ragged down the Cardiff right and deservedly got his first goal after 21 minutes. His second was a thing of beauty, toying with the Villa defence. Unstoppable when he reaches top speed.\n\nSTAR MAN - Kenneth Zohore 9\n\nThe Dane had three identical chances at the near post, but each time Sam Johnstone was equal to them. His relentless running troubled Villa though and opened up space for Mendez-Laing and Hoilett. The visitors simply couldn't deal with him.\n\nSubs: Richards (for Bennett, 63)\n\nWard (for Mendez-Laing, 87)\n\nKennedy (for Zohore, 89)\n\nSubs not used: Murphy, Manga, Tomlin, Halford, Kennedy.\n\nAston Villa: Johnstone, Hutton, Terry, Chester, Taylor; Whelan, Lansbury (O'Hare, 58), Elmohamady (Adomah, 30), Onomah (Hourihane, 77), Agbonlahor, Hogan.\n\nSubs not used: Steer, Samba, Bree, Bjanason.\n\nGoals: Mendez-Laing (21), Hoilett (59), Mendez-Laing (71)\n\nYellow cards: Taylor (55),\n\nReferee: T.

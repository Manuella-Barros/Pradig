{"id": 225029816, "title": "Ex-Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis barred from practicing law for several years over Georgia election lies", "text": "Former Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis has had her law license suspended for three years in her home state of Colorado for the lies she spread as part of an effort overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia. The agreement was approved on Tuesday by the Colorado Supreme Court. Ellis could have been disbarred after pleading guilty in October to a felony in Georgia. A prosecutor in the case told the Georgia court that Ellis \u201caided and abetted\u201d two Trump lawyers when they baselessly told Georgia state senators that tens of thousands of votes in the state were illegal. The governing body for lawyers in Colorado had already censured Ellis after she made false statements regarding the election, according to The Denver Post. \u201cWhile disbarment is the presumptive sanction for Respondent\u2019s misconduct, it is significant that her criminal culpability was due to her conduct as an accessory, not as a principal,\u201d the agreement states. Ellis also wrote a letter of remorse, saying that she \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d to the notion that Trump campaign lawyers were pushing falsities in their \u201ccynical \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 campaign.\u201d She also wrote that having accepted her suspension, \u201cI will hopefully encourage others who may still believe that the election was \u2018stolen\u2019 to consider changing their position. Everything that has come out since has not proven that claim.\u201d Her attorney, John Michal Richilano, told The Denver Post that \u201cunlike others in the Trump orbit, she stepped forward and took responsibility and told the truth.\u201d He added: \u201cShe did this at considerable personal cost, having received threatening emails, texts and tweets, also of the obscene variety \u2026 She gratefully accepted suspension of her license understanding her role and realizing, after the fact, that there was a lot of untruths being advanced on behalf of the former president.\u201d The agreement goes on to say that, \u201cThe evidence surrounding her plea reflects that she aided and abetted the false statements at issue through her presence at the Georgia Senate Subcommittee meeting, but did not otherwise contribute to drafting or preparing the false statements.\u201d \u201cShe has also expressed remorse and has recognized the harm caused by her misconduct,\u201d it states.", "summary": "<p>Jenna Ellis avoided disbarment after issuing letter of remorse</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jenna-ellis-donald-trump-lawyer-law-license-b2553218.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/29/13/GettyImages-1742147829.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:23:08", "author": "Gustaf Kilander", "authors": ["Gustaf Kilander"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.656}

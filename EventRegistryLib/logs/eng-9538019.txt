Michael Griesbaum.\n\nMost National Guard professionals performing space missions would retrain or retire rather than join the Space Force, the Air National Guard internal survey shows.\n\nAs the Air Force senior leaders continue to defend a legislative proposal to move all space units within the National Guard to the Space Force, up to 86% of all Guard space personnel say they will stay in the National Guard and retrain instead of switching over to an active service branch.\n\n\"We will begin to see the loss of experienced space operators long before the Space Force will ever be able to make up for the loss of that experience and proficiency. We will see a significant hit to national security because people will act in their own interest and retrain or retire rather than join the Space Force. And the Space Force does not have the capacity to make up for that loss,\" Col. Michael Griesbaum, the commander of the Alaska Air National Guard's 168th Wing, told reporters during a media roundtable Friday.\n\nThe Hawaii Air National Guard, for example, has two electromagnetic warfare squadrons on Oahu and Kauai. About 91 Airmen are assigned to those units and the Guard plans to bring in more professionals to support the mission.\n\nCol. Daniel Wrazien, the staff director for the Hawaii Air National Guard, said most citizen Airmen would most likely remain in the Hawaii National Guard and retrain into other missions.\n\n\"The majority of the 91 Airmen in these units do not want to transfer from the Air National Guard to the United States Space Force. This, in turn, would create new personnel training and facilities costs for both the Air National Guard and the Space Force,\" said Wrazien.\n\nIn March, Air Force officials sent a legislative proposal to Congress to bypass existing law that requires the federal government to obtain governors' consent prior to making any changes to National Guard units and to transfer 14 units with space missions within the Air National Guard into the Space Force.\n\nThe Air Force leaders have since defended the proposal, saying that removing the requirement to obtain a governor's consent prior to making changes to National Guard units will not set a blueprint for the active components to pull resources from the National Guard in the future.\n\n\"It's a unique situation. There is absolutely no intention to make any other changes, moving things out of the Guard,\" Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall Kendall told lawmakers last month.\n\nBut Air National Guard leaders said removing the requirement to obtain governors' consent would set a dangerous precedent for separating other missions from the National Guard.\n\n\"Nothing legislatively ever happens once. If [legislative proposal 480] is successful, it will open the door to a wholesale harvesting of National Guard resources, both from the Air National Guard and the Army National Guard to the regular components. It is a solution looking for a problem,\" Griesbaum said.\n\nAt the same time, the governors of 48 states and five territories sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin calling for the immediate discontinuation of the legislative proposal.\n\n\"Legislation that sidesteps, eliminates or otherwise reduces governors' authority within their states and territories undermines longstanding partnerships, precedence, military readiness and operational efficacy,\" the letter reads.\n\nAs of now, the Space Force doesn't have a model for part-time participation in the service. Air Force officials want to bring citizen Airmen into the Space Force under the Space Force Personnel Management Act. The Act allows Guardians and Air Force reservists to serve part- or full-time, but it doesn't cover Guardsmen.\n\nDuring a budget hearing last month, Secretary Kendall said this potential transfer will not have a significant impact on Air Guardsmen in charge of space missions.\n\n\"There's no intention to move anyone. There are some concerns out there that I think are overblown. People will basically have stability if they transition,\" said Kendall.\n\nAir National Guard leaders said there are too many unknowns about what the transfer of the missions and personnel would look like, but the legislative proposal would give the Air Force the authority to move National Guard personnel to other states.\n\n\"The current secretary the Air Force has said he's not planning on moving them, but the way the [legislative proposal] is written -- the future Secretary to the Air Force absolutely can go in there, provide 120 days notification and then move those units out of the state,\" Brig. Gen. Michael Bruno, director of joint staff for the Colorado National Guard, said.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Federal News Network. All rights reserved.

Members of the Texas National Guard must always stand ready to respond to natural disasters, civil disturbances, and cartel activity that threaten our way of life,\" Abbott continued.\n\nThe Texas governor called on the Department of the Air Force to retract the proposal, calling it an attempted \"power grab.\"\n\nSecretary of Air Force Frank Kendall maintained that the proposal would affect about 14 space units, equal to about 1,000 Air National Guardsmen, Air and Space Forces Magazine reported.\n\nA White House official told The Hill the Biden administration supports the Defense Department's recommendation for a one-time transfer of a certain amount of Guard missions into the Space Force, noting it is consistent with the structure approved by Congress in the annual defense policy bill.\n\nThe official noted the Biden administration has consistently been against the establishment of a Space National Guard.\n\nThe letter came just days after a group of governors from 48 states, territories and commonwealths wrote a letter addressed to Secretary of Defense Llyod Austin in opposition of the proposal.\n\nAbbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) were notably absent from the list of signatories, and DeSantis penned his own letter to the chairs and ranking members of the Senate and House Armed Services committees.\n\nDeSantis argued the move \"would flout more than a century of precedent and undermine federal law protections for state control of their National Guard forces.\" He said his state's National Guard should already be larger than it is and blamed the federal government for making it \"under-resourced.\"\n\nThe proposal comes after the Air Force announced in February it planned to make \"sweeping\" changes to the military branch and Space Force to ensure the U.S. can meet security demands. These changes include the development of a new command center, called the Integrated Capabilities, to oversee specific areas of the military branch.\n\nThe Space Force will also get a new field

Governors must retain full authority over these units \"to protect operational readiness and America's communities,\" the letter states.\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz each signed the letter.\n\n\"Legislation that sidesteps, eliminates or otherwise reduces Governors' authority within their states and territories undermines longstanding partnerships, precedence, military readiness and operational efficacy,\" the letter states. \"This action also negatively affects the important relationships between Governors and DOD at a time when we need to have full trust and confidence between the two to meet the growing threats posed by the era of strategic competition as well as natural disasters.\"\n\nAir Force Secretary Frank Kendall told federal lawmakers earlier in April that the proposal would shift roughly 700 National Guard members to Space Force as part of a one-time transfer. There are currently 14 units, with about 1,000 personnel, working on space-related missions in seven states -- Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, New York and Ohio -- that could be impacted by the move, according to the National Guard Association of the United States.\n\nThe National Guard advocacy group also released a statement opposing the draft legislation. Kendall told reporters in April that he doesn't \"see a reason why a state needs a Space Force militia.\" But Retired Maj. Gen. Frank M. McGinn, the organization's president, said keeping space missions within the National Guard keeps the personnel current serving on space missions in work, as many are not able to move or take on full-time responsibilities. It allows states to retain the same defense and military capabilities as other parts of the country, he said -- comparing the issue to states having artillery and cyber units in the National Guard, separate from the U.S. military.\n\n\"Here is what Secretary Kendall is asking to do: Skirt federal law to transfer nearly empty units to the Space Force, thereby reducing the nation's military space capabilities at a time when our nation is seeing growing competition in space,\" McGinn said. \"I don't see why he wants to take this action. And a growing number in Congress wonder the same.\"\n\nOnly two state governors, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, did not sign on to the letter. Both states have a vested interest in Space Force operations and development, with Patrick Space Force Base in Brevard County, Florida being one of the five current bases of the military branch. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) also has operations in both states.", "source": {"uri": "inforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "INFORUM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Michael Griesbaum, commander of the Alaska Air National Guard's 168th Wing, told reporters Friday. \"In our particular case, that would really represent an existential threat to the national security of the United States because the Space Force does not have the experience to replace my space operators who depart.\"\n\nRead Next: US Troop Levels in Pacific Take Center Stage as Defense Secretary Huddles with Allied Defense Leaders\n\nRebukes from Air National Guard officials join a chorus of criticisms for the proposal, including a letter of opposition signed by the governors of 48 states as well as five U.S. territories earlier this week.\n\n\"Governors must maintain full authority as commanders in chief of these assets to effectively protect operational readiness and America's communities,\" according to the letter, which was promoted by the National Governors Association. \"Legislation that sidesteps, eliminates or otherwise reduces governors' authority within their states and territories undermines long-standing partnerships, precedence, military readiness and operational efficacy.\"\n\nAir Force officials' legislative proposal 480 to Congress would change the status of Air National Guard units conducting space operations \"from a unit of the Air National Guard of the United States to a unit of the United States Space Force; deactivate the unit; or assign the unit a new federal mission\" and would do so \"without the approval of its governor,\" Military.com reported last month.\n\nAir Force Secretary Frank Kendall, in response to Military.com last month, waived off the concerns, saying worries that the proposal would set a precedent undermining state governors' authority were overblown.\n\n\"We've had much, much more political attention over this than it deserves,\" Kendall said. \"We need a way to integrate these space capabilities, which are very valuable to us, into the Space Force. This is a unique situation. I have no indication that either the Air Force or Army Guard, anybody, is contemplating any other changes.\"\n\nBut Air National Guard leaders have expressed concern, saying it would set a clear precedent for other services to potentially take more resources from the National Guard model.\n\n\"Nothing legislatively ever happens once,\" Griesbaum said. \"If LP 480 is successful, it will open the door to a wholesale harvesting of National Guard resources, both from the Air National Guard and the Army National Guard to the regular components.\"\n\nEnlisted Air National Guardsmen in space missions have concerns about losing the ties to their local communities, as well as potentially uprooting their families or civilian careers by being transferred to the active-duty force and the uncertainty that could come with that transition.\n\n\"I love this nation, and I love this state,\" Air Force Staff Sgt. Robert Brown with the Colorado Air National Guard's 233rd Space Group said. \"I wanted to continue my service through the Air National Guard, and I didn't run the risk of getting stationed anywhere far from home. Currently, my wife and I are expecting a daughter in just about a month, so that really enforces our needs.\"\n\nSince 2019, when the Space Force became the newest service branch under the Department of the Air Force, debates and conflicts have sprung up over what to do with the roughly 1,000 part-time Air National Guardsmen across 14 units operating space-related missions in Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, New York and Ohio.\n\nKendall as well as some members of Congress say that the number of those affected would be less than that. But Guard officials are skeptical, saying officials are not counting all the units and all the states supporting those missions, as well as the support personnel.\n\nBrig. Gen. Michael Bruno, director of joint staff for the Colorado National Guard, told reporters Friday that space operators with his state are currently deployed overseas helping with missions, and he worries that if the legislative proposal is approved, it may leave them with an uncertain future.\n\n\"These space professionals may not have a military job to come back to when they return,\" he said. \"They volunteered to serve and sacrifice for their nation, state and communities. I can only imagine how they and their families must feel if we break that trust with them.\"", "source": {"uri": "military.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Military"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Ron DeSantis (R) sent a letter Friday outlining his opposition to the Biden administration's move to incorporate Air National Guard service members into the Space Force.\n\nThe Defense Department submitted a legislative proposal to the Senate Armed Services Committee in late March that would require Congress to override existing law requiring governors to approve changes to National Guard units in order to shift hundreds of service members to the Space Force.\n\nEarlier this week, 48 governors of states, territories and commonwealths wrote a letter addressed to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to oppose the proposal.\n\nNotably, DeSantis was not among the signatories of that letter, sent from the National Governors Association, but said in his own letter to the chairs and ranking members of the Senate and House Armed Services committees on Friday that the proposal would \"flout more than a century of precedent and undermine federal law protections for state control of their National Guard forces.\"\n\nThe Florida governor said the current code is a \"good-sense statutory requirement\" that ensures National Guard members are working for domestic crisis response.\n\n\"As a low-lying, storm-prone state, Florida is uniquely vulnerable to hurricanes and flooding that require significant, operationally ready logistics and disaster support, including from our National Guard units,\" he wrote.\n\nDeSantis argued that Florida's National Guard should be larger than it currently is, but the federal government has \"under-resourced\" the state in comparison to other large states.\n\nAccording to his letter, the state of Florida has established the Florida State Guard to supplement the state's National Guard in times of need.\n\nThe Space Force has major operations in Florida at Patrick Space Force Base. DeSantis said the state is committed to the success and mission of the Space Force, but the country cannot \"effectively protect our nation from foreign enemies when we cannot guarantee the safety and security of our communities here at home.\"\n\n\"This legislative proposal weakens that guarantee and sidesteps the authority of the Governor to ensure Floridians are prepared and protected to address whatever domestic emergencies may arise, especially as we approach another hurricane season,\" he wrote, urging the department to withdraw or reject the proposal.\n\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_irwin@aol.com", "name": "Lauren Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Space Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Austin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lloyd Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Governors_Association", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Governors Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Space_Force_Base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Space Force Base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational Forces", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_hill_articles_315/0c0e2806e4b9d971db1f1f2a02225d17", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538019", "eventUri": "eng-9538019", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The units work in specialized areas, such as missile warning and electromagnetic warfare.\n\nThe governors said in a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin this week the proposal by the DOD to move the units into active duty undercuts governors' authority and disregards federal law.\n\n\"Governors must maintain full authority as Commanders in Chief of these assets to effectively protect operational readiness and America's communities,\" the letter states.\n\nIt follows a letter from Gov. Jared Polis that made the same argument.\n\nDuring Space Symposium in April, Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall seemed to poke fun at the idea states need control of space-focused National Guard units.\n\n\"I don't see a reason why a state needs a Space Force militia,\" he said. He said the changes would effect a small percentage of guardsmen and no other changes to the Air National Guard were planned.\n\nThe guardsmen would have the opportunity to work part-time for the Space Force, although the details of that plan remain unclear.\n\nSpace-focused reservists in the 310th Space Wing in Colorado Springs are expected to transfer into the Space Force and that could lay a foundation for guardsmen.\n\nKendall said he believed the fight over the future of space-focused units was getting far more political attention than it deserves. National attention has only mounted in this week with a largely united opposition from governors. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis were the only governors who did not sign the letter.\n\nDuring a round-table Friday, National Guard leaders highlighted additional problems with moving guardsmen into the active duty Space Force.\n\nGen. Michael Bruno, director of joint staff for the Colorado National Guard, noted that between 70% of 86% of the guardsmen across all seven states would quit if forced to transfer into the active duty.\n\nSign Up for free: Military Brief Your weekly local update on local military news and events, sent straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Active duty service members are constantly moving around the country.\n\nCapt. Bonn Franks, with the 138th Electromagnetic Warfare Squadron based at Peterson Space Force Base, said even 120 days wouldn't be enough time to transfer to a new location with his civilian job.\n\nHe also underscored the importance guardsmen place on serving their local communities in times of crisis. While on active-duty in Colorado Springs, his unit was unable to help during the 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire.\n\n\"We went through all this training and weren't able to do anything for a very devastating fire,\" he said, during Friday's roundtable.\n\nCongress asked the DOD to study the options for the units, including leaving the units where they are, creating a Space National Guard and moving them into the Space Force.\n\nKendall said that report shows moving the units is the best option and the worst option is a new Space National Guard because of the added administration.\n\nThe report was released to Congress yesterday, but was not immediately available to the media.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Ron DeSantis believes that the proposed move is a bridge too far.\n\nDeSantis writes Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and ranking members of the Senate and House Armed Services Committee that the proposal would \"flout more than a century of precedent\" and \"undermine federal law\" giving the states control of National Guard units.\n\nHe also describes Florida as a \"low-lying, flood prone state ... uniquely vulnerable to hurricanes and flooding,\" deviating from previous rhetoric about tropical weather systems, such as his advice to Floridians to \"knock on wood\" during the 2023 storm season. He believes the National Guard is underresourced by Washington, and contends the Electronic Warfare Squadron could somehow help with storm response.\n\nDeSantis reactivated the Florida State Guard recently, and that has been used (along with National Guard troops) for deployments to the Mexican border, a concern that is far removed from hurricane weather. He has also complained about how vaccine mandates affected readiness for the National Guard.\n\n\"The U.S. military has been kicking out great service members over the Biden administration's unacceptable COVID vaccine mandate, and they are even targeting members of the National Guard,\" said DeSantis in 2022. \"The bureaucrats in D.C. who control our National Guard have also refused to increase the number of guardsmen despite our increasing population, leaving Florida with the second worst National Guardsman to resident ratio.\"", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

Survey shows 70% of Guardsmen involved in space missions oppose transfer, highlighting concerns about stability and disruption. Air Force Secretary dismisses opposition, stating transition to Space Force will be seamless and similar to current service arrangements.\n\nThe Air National Guard (ANG) is a federal military reserve force of the Air Force and the state air militia. Some of its guardsmen are involved in space-related work that the Department of the Air Force has decided would be better integrated with the Space Force. According to the Air and Space Forces Magazine, a proposal to transfer Air National Guardsmen to the Space Force has been criticized. The Department of the Air Force is pushing Congress to adopt the plan. However, Air National Guardsmen have called the proposal an \"existential threat\" to the Guard.\n\nGuardsmen rather retire than join the Space Force\n\nSome Guardsmen who are involved in space missions cite their personal lives, such as family needs and connections to their communities, as reasons not to transfer. Others cite lingering uncertainties. Some Guardsmen working on space missions say they have roots in the state and place they are working and would rather quit than leave. Many of the Guardsmen are reported to have stated they would sooner switch jobs within the Air National Guard to avoid being transferred to the Space Force.\n\nPhoto: US Space Force\n\nThe Air and Space Forces Magazine cited a survey of 14 units in seven states (that perform space missions) and found that 70% of the respondents would prefer to retrain or retire rather than go into the Space Force. For years, kings and generals have sought to move their men and units around as though they were pawns on a chessboard, only to discover that they are humans with their own interests. The fact that organizations are made up of people with many emotions and needs and not robots has long dismayed managers and commanders.\n\nStill much uncertainty\n\nIt is possible that the surveys are overplaying the opposition to the transfer. Major proposed changes can be unsettling when the details are not yet fleshed out. For many enjoying a stable life, uncertainty (or the perception of uncertainty) can be one of the biggest causes of concern. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall dismissed these surveys, showing strong opposition to the proposal among Guardsmen.\n\nAs Kendall put it: \"I think when you go to people and say 'Do you want to stay like you are or jump off a cliff?' They're going to stay like they are. We're not asking them to jump off a cliff. We're asking them to go to another arrangement which will be very, very like the one that they're currently serving under. They're not going to see much change frankly, as I see it.\"\n\nRelated To Fly, Fight And Win: What Is The Primary Role Of The United States Air Force? The USAF became a separate branch of the United States military in 1947.\n\nThe Space Force: not quite the final frontier\n\nThe Space Force (USSF) is the newest service branch of the US Armed Forces. It was formed in December 2019 when it was split off from the Air Force (the Air Force split off from the Army in 1947). It is the smallest of the six service branches (the others being the Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard). It is tasked with space warfare (e.g., missile warning, space surveillance, satellite control, etc.).\n\nPhoto: Space Force\n\nThe Space Force has around 8,600 military personnel (it is not clear how many Guardsmen would be transferred). The force operates 77 spacecraft, including the experimental X-37B spaceplane. The official logo of the US Space Force is Space Force Delta (which totally doesn't look anything like the TV series Star Trek emblem patch).", "source": {"uri": "simpleflying.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Simple Flying"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_spray@simpleflying.com", "name": "Aaron Spray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Space Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Space_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Space Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_reserve_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military reserve force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Force_Delta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Force Delta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_domain_awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space domain awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-37", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing X-37"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaceplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_branch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military branch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Trek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational Forces", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Special_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Special Operations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1280x720-10.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538019", "eventUri": "eng-9538019", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 3284, "textEnd": 3297}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

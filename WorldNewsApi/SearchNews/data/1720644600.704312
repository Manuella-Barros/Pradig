The German shot-stopper has been called upon more times this season than any other after first-choice Ederson suffered injury complaints. Ortega's crowing performance came in the crucial victory over Tottenham Hotspur in the penultimate match of the season. He was introduced in the second half after Ederson came off with a fractured eye socket and produced a marvellous performance, capped with a big save to deny Heung-Min Son, as City won 2-0. No surprise then that the Blues were keen to keep hold of him until 2026.

He is such a talented \u2018keeper \u2013 our goalkeeping coach Xabi Mancisidor tells me all the time how good Stefan is. \"He is very skilled and it\u2019s clear that since his arrival here he has contributed significantly to our success. Hopefully he can now enjoy his summer and come back fresh and ready for the 2024/25 season.\" Begiristain's insistence that Ortega is No.2 for City seems to suggest that Ederson will be remaining at the Etihad Stadium to be the No.1 next season. Like all goalkeepers, the 31-year-old has aspirations to be ahead of the Brazilian in the pecking order. But it seems that City still regard him as a solid cup 'keeper who compliments Ederson in the squad. City's No.1 has been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia in recent weeks and the signing of Ortega to a new contract will lead to speculation that Ederson might be on the way out. As solid a 'keeper Ortega is, it appears City are not willing to call time on Ederson's stay just yet and will look to keep hold of their sweeper 'keeper for as long as possible.", "summary": "Manchester City have secured the services of Stefan Ortega for another two years but it is the future of his teammate which is now clearer", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-city-dropped-major-ederson-29317261", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29317333.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2153292972.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:00:00", "author": "Jack Flintham", "authors": ["Jack Flintham"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.028}

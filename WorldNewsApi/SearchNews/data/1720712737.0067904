{"id": 232082986, "title": "Michael Mosley was just yards from resort safety as locals sunbathe nearby", "text": "Michael Mosley\u2019s body was found just 50 yards from safety after he took the \"wrong route\" back to his accommodation, according to reports. The TV doctor, 67, was discovered lifeless, close to a secluded beach resort on the Greek island of Symi. His body was found behind a small wall and chain link fence which circles the picturesque resort of Agia Marina, around a 30-minute walk from the village of Pedi where he was last seen on CCTV. Mosley was walking from St Nikolas beach at 1.30pm local time on Wednesday, and was reported missing after he failed to return home six hours later. He had veered off a rocky path that led to the bar, and it is believed he may have passed out in the 40C heat or fallen on the dangerous terrain. If he had managed to make it another few yards then he would have reached the sea and a gate into the resort, his family revealed. His wife Dr Clare Bailey confirmed that he had sadly been found dead on Sunday. She explained that he had carried out an \"incredible climb\" and said he \"so very nearly made it\" before collapsing near a bar. She described Michael as a \"wonderful, funny, kind and brilliant husband\". Speaking about the tragedy, she said: \"My family and I have been hugely comforted by the outpouring of love from people from around the world. It\u2019s clear that Michael meant a huge amount to so many of you. We\u2019re taking comfort in the fact that he so very nearly made it. He did an incredible climb, took the wrong route, and collapsed where he couldn\u2019t be easily seen by the extensive search team.\" Anotonios, a local cameraman, claims he spotted Dr Mosley near a beach. He told Sky News that he was on a boat with the mayor around 300 metres away when he noticed something unusual. He decided to use his camera to zoom in, which is when he saw what looked like a body. He told the mayor, who is said to then have alerted local bar staff at the beach who reportedly discovered the body. The mayor, Lefteris Papakalodoukas, told the Telegraph: \u201c'We analysed the recorded evidence and it was obvious that it was, unfortunately, Mosley. He was found 10 metres away from the sea, 10-15 metres from his destination, the beach of Agia Marina, between a fence and a path. It is unclear if he had an accident or if he felt unwell.\" Bar manager Ilias Tsavaris said he was told to have a search of the area which is when he saw the \"glint from a watch\" and a body. He said: \"The mayor had been here to give interviews to the media and then left on a boat to return to Pedi. From the sea he saw something unusual and then he called the restaurant and asked them to check it out. I was sent up there and as I turned the fence to go up I saw a glint from a watch and then I saw the body at the same time. You don\u2019t see a dead body every day, it\u2019s not a warzone, it\u2019s summer and you\u2019re supposed to have fun and swim.\u201d The last sighting of the doctor was security camera footage from a house at the end of the bay in Pedi which showed him striding up a hill towards Agia Marina. The walk from St Nicholas beach to where the body was found is around three miles and would have taken a couple of hours. Police are working on the theory he had been dead for \"several days\".", "summary": "TV doctor Michael Mosley was found incredibly close to a beach resort with sunbathing locals, the local authorities have revealed.

Many times, there have been long gaps where he didn't see the kids at all.\"\n\nAs the exes have battled in court over custody and their winery Chateau Miraval, Jolie's lawyer said in a recent statement to PEOPLE: \"All Angelina has ever wanted was separation and health, with positive relationships between all members of their family, including Mr. Pitt.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahara_(South_African_musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zahara (South African musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knox County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Knox County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraternities and sororities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelman_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spelman College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playbill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playbill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Kappa_Alpha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alpha Kappa Alpha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch\u00e2teau_Miraval,_Correns-Var", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, Correns-Var"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essence_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Essence (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_custody", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child custody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Viewers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Viewers", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/PdEBdxbdF2HoSIpOoFtjiWoVNj8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/shiloh-jolie-pitt-dcd9a1e15f664c24a6f6178ba96fab60.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613851", "eventUri": "eng-9613851", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 334, "textEnd": 340}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

The bill only listed the budding star as \"Vivienne Jolie.\" It's unknown if this name is purely cosmetic or if she made the legal change as well.\n\nThe Jolie-Pitt children appear to be feuding with their father. And Vivienne isn't the first to distance herself from the Pitt family name. Daughter Zahara previously identified herself as Zahara Marley Jolie only.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's daughter Vivienne drops his last name amid feud\n\nAnd now Vivienne has beamed with her mother, 48, on the red carpet at The Whitley located in Hollywood. Angelina looked content as she smiled with one arm wrapped around Vivienne ahead of the performance.\n\nAngelina could be seen looking slick in a black suit with a white shirt and a grey tie. While Vivienne wore some wide leg black trousers, a waistcoat and a shirt underneath. The mother and daughter duo posed at the event with Kristen Bell as they all attended the opening night performance of Reefer Madness: The Musical.\n\nThis comes after it was reported on Thursday that Angelina and Brad's 18-year-old daughter Shiloh is requesting her name be legally changed to \"Shiloh Jolie\".\n\nOn Memorial Day in the United States, Shiloh filed paperwork requesting a legal name change to drop \"Pitt\" from her last name to make her new name \"Shiloh Jolie.\" Shiloh, who is Brad's biological daughter, wasted no time as she submitted the request the day she legally became an adult, heading to the courthouse the day she turned 18 years old.\n\nThis comes as sources close to Shiloh claim she wants to distance herself from her parents' celebrity status and pave her own road to success without the help of their powerful last names. The 18-year-old is an aspiring dancer on the road to pursuing her passion in the entertainment industry after already going viral with her impressive skills on social media.\n\nAngelina and Brad split after two years of marriage and 12 years together, with Angelina filing for divorce in 2016. The couple share six children: Maddox, 22; Pax, 20; Zahara, 19; Shiloh, 17; and twins Vivienne and Knox, 15.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mollie_quirk@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Mollie Quirk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsiders_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outsiders (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cosmetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefer_Madness_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reefer Madness (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Bell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristen Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trousers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32930575.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_JS335035851.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613851", "eventUri": "eng-9613851", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Zahara, another of the ex-couple's daughters, doesn't use Pitt in her name anymore, TMZ reports, and their youngest daughter, 15-year-old Vivienne, has reportedly also avoided using \"Pitt\" in her name; \"she was only listed as Vivienne Jolie on a Playbill for an Angelina-produced Broadway musical she was recently working on as a PA,\" TMZ writes. (The play, by the way, is The Outsiders.) Jolie and Pitt's eldest, Maddox, also reportedly doesn't use \"Pitt\" in his surname anymore, \"but it appears as if Shiloh is the only one of the kids who's filed to make it count in court,\" the outlet reports.\n\nIf her request is granted, Shiloh's legal name will be Shiloh Nouvel Jolie. In addition to her siblings Zahara, Vivienne, and Maddox, Shiloh has two other siblings, Pax and Knox, who is Vivienne's twin.\n\nJolie and Pitt began dating in 2005 after starring together in Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and, controversially at the time, not long after Pitt filed for divorce from Jennifer Aniston.

Writing online, he accused his father of being an \"a------.\" In his scathing social media post, the actor's son wrote: \"You time and time and again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person. You have no consideration or empathy toward your four youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence.\n\n\"You will never understand the damage you have done to my family because you are incapable of doing so. You have made the lives of those closest to me a constant hell. You may tell yourself and the world whatever you want, but the truth will come to light someday. So, Happy Father's Day, you f------ awful human being,\" Pax concluded.\n\nA custody battle broke out between Angelina and Brad following their divorce. \"It's been a sad situation for years,\" according to an insider close to Brad. They told People: \"Since Angelina filed for divorce, Brad has been focused on having the best relationship possible with his kids. It's been very difficult for him.

Vivienne worked as her mother's assistant on the Broadway production, and Jolie stepped in as a producer as the musical moved to Broadway from an LA theater. Vivienne will soon turn 16 years old and \"dropping 'Pitt' in a playbill credit\" is not some huge legal issue. That being said, I was surprised by how many old-school Brad Pitt defenders came out of the woodwork to claim that this shows that Angelina Jolie \"alienated\" her children from Brad Pitt. Keep in mind, all six children were witnesses to and victims of Brad Pitt's terror and abuse on the plane in 2016. As Jolie's statements to the FBI indicated, Brad wasn't just assaulting her, he pushed and punched one child and strangled another. None of those kids have wanted anything to do with Brad since then. They're terrified of the man who abused them and hurt their mom. Speaking of, Shiloh just turned 18 years old. She celebrated by petitioning the court to drop \"Pitt\" from her name as well.\n\nBrad Pitt's daughter, Shiloh, apparently wants nothing to do with him -- or at the very least, nothing to do with his last name ... 'cause she's dropping his surname officially.\n\nShiloh Jolie-Pitt -- who just turned 18 a few days ago on May 27 -- filed paperwork requesting a legal name change ... specifically, dropping the \"Pitt\" from her last name and making her new name simply \"Shiloh Jolie.\"\n\nMind you ... this doc was literally filed on Monday, which was on Memorial Day ... and also happens to be her 18th birthday. So, it seems this was one of the first things she wanted to do as an adult.\n\nOf course, it's incredibly telling ... it's no secret Brad has had a strained relationship with some of his kids since he and Angelina filed for divorce in 2016 -- an ugly split that has dragged on in court, even to this day.\n\nShiloh's request for the name change has yet to be granted -- but it's only a matter of time before it becomes official. As you know, Shiloh is one of Brad and Angie's three biological children ... they have 3 other adopted children, including 19-year-old Zahara Jolie ... who also doesn't use Pitt in her name these days.\n\n[From TMZ]\n\nLast year, Zahara joined a sorority (Alpha Kappa Alpha) and she introduced herself as Zahara Marley Jolie. I said at the time that I didn't know if Zahara had legally changed her name. Given this Shiloh story, I think if Zahara dropped \"Pitt\" legally, we would have heard about it, right?? As for Shiloh Jolie... I'm happy for her. All of those kids have been given the space and time to do what they feel is right for themselves. Shiloh, Zahara, Pax and Maddox have all made it abundantly clear that they want nothing to do with Brad. Vivi doesn't want his name either.

Brad's relationship with his six children, including three adopted kids, has been strained for years, especially after finalizing his divorce from his ex-wife Angelina Jolie.\n\nEarlier this month, the co-parent's former bodyguard attributed the kid's resentment towards their dad to their mom consciously trying to poison them against him. Brad appears to share those thoughts too. As his oldest biological daughter Shiloh turned 18 this month, one insider revealed that the actor hoped to fix their broken bond. However, the budding dancer, now an adult, is determined to prove her feelings for him are completely independent of her mom's influence.\n\nThe 18-year-old recently made the shocking move to drop Pitt from her last name. TMZ obtained court documents confirming this move on Thursday. Per the legal records, Brad Pitt's daughter, Shiloh Jolie Pitt filed the paperwork on her 18th birthday on May 27. The teenager demands her legal name officially becomes Shiloh Jolie, axing her dad's surname completely. The court has yet to officially grant this request.\n\nNeither Shiloh Jolie Pitt nor her parents have addressed this big move to alter her surname. However, given she pulled the strings as her first major decision as an adult, Brad Pitt's daughter clearly wanted the message to hit home. And it did.\n\nAside from his oldest biological daughter Shiloh Jolie, Brad Pitt's other kids have made it clear in their own subtle way that they want nothing to do with their dad. Serving as a PA on a Broadway musical this year, his 15-year-old daughter Vivienne simply listed her name as Vivienne Jolie. Adopted daughter, Zahara, 19, has also axed Pitt from her name, even without going the legal route. Sources also claim that the oldest of the bunch, Maddox, 22 also does without the Pitt surname these days.\n\nWhile the actual family dynamics are unclear, Shiloh Jolie Pitt's message to her dad is as scalding as it gets.

Vivienne is not the first of the couple's children to make a similar change, as their eldest daughter Zahara recently introduced herself as \"Zahara Marley Jolie\" at her university sorority event.\n\nThis news comes amidst reports of strain in Pitt's relationship with his children following his divorce from Jolie in 2016. Despite the challenges they have faced, sources close to Pitt have revealed his efforts to improve his relationship with his kids, expressing his hopes for a better future.\n\nThe ongoing custody battle between Jolie and Pitt has also brought to light allegations and claims from both sides, adding another layer of complexity to their already tumultuous relationship. Despite the challenges, Jolie and Pitt continue to navigate co-parenting while focusing on the well-being of their children.\n\nVivienne's involvement in The Outsiders as a producer assistant showcases her passion for the arts and her dedication to supporting her mother in this new venture. Jolie, who is thrilled to be working on her first theatrical producing project, credits Vivienne for inspiring her to take on this exciting opportunity.\n\nAs the public awaits further clarification on Vivienne's name change and the dynamics within the Jolie-Pitt family, one thing remains clear - the power of family and the importance of supporting one another through life's challenges.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playbill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playbill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraternities and sororities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613851", "eventUri": "eng-9613851", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Shiloh is not the first of the former couple's six children to have reportedly dropped their father's last name; PEOPLE reported that their teenage daughter Vivienne's name is listed as Vivenne Jolie in the playbill for the musical production of \"The Outsiders,\" when Vivienne assisted her mother in producing. The outlet added that Pitt and Jolie's eldest daughter, Zahara, introduced herself as Zahara Marley Jolie while joining her sorority at Spellman College, per a video shared by Essence.\n\nThe name amendments follow reports in recent years that allege a strained family dynamic. In 2022, it was reported that Jolie in a 2016 FBI report had accused Pitt of physically abusing her and their children while in flight on a private plane. A new filing made in April of 2024 claimed that \"While Pitt's history of physical abuse of Jolie started well before the family's September 2016 plane trip from France to Los Angeles, this flight marked the first time he turned his physical abuse on the children as well. Jolie then immediately left him.\"\n\nPitt in February of 2022 sued Jolie for violating \"contractural\" rights after she sold her portion of the ex-couple's French winery, Ch\u00e2teau Miraval. Jolie filed a countersuit in response, purporting new details of the plane incident, claiming that Pitt had \"choked one of the children and struck another in the face\" and \"grabbed Jolie by the head and shook her,\" per Variety.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraternities and sororities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playbill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playbill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essence_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Essence (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch\u00e2teau_Miraval,_Correns-Var", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, Correns-Var"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Education", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613851", "eventUri": "eng-9613851", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 173, "textEnd": 179}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-09-", "textStart": 1096, "textEnd": 1110}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The trio smiled for the camera on the carpet before heading in to watch the musical, which Bell, 43, serves as a producer on.\n\nThe night at the theater comes one day after ET reported that Vivienne -- who recently produced the Broadway production of The Outsiders -- dropped the last name of her father, Brad Pitt, from her hyphenated moniker. In the Playbill, she opted to be credited as simply \"Vivienne Jolie\" rather than her previous \"Vivienne Jolie-Pitt.\"\n\nThe change comes five years after her parents finalized their separation, but it's unclear if the decision is stylistic for Vivienne or if she has legally changed her name, too. Pitt, 60, and Jolie -- who were together for 12 years -- also share Maddox, 22, Pax, 20, Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 17, and Vivienne's twin brother, Knox, 15.\n\nJolie and Vivienne's outing is also just another night at the theater for the mother-daughter duo who recently attended the premiere of The Outsiders at the Jacobs Theater in New York. Last month, the actress and her youngest daughter smiled for photos with the cast and crew of the musical they helped bring to Broadway.\n\nIn August, ET shared that Jolie and Vivienne were teaming up to produce the show after seeing a production of the musical at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego in 2023. At the time, a source shared the duo had found a joint love of musical theater and the dramatic arts.\n\nIn a statement to ET, Jolie gave her own reasoning for boarding the production and bringing along Vivienne.\n\n\"Viv reminds me of my mother [Marcheline Bertrand] in that she isn't focused on being the center of attention but in being a support to other creatives,\" Jolie said. \"She's very thoughtful and serious about theatre and working hard to best understand how to contribute.\"\n\nA source shared that for the mother and daughter, it would more likely than not be the first of many collaborations together as Jolie was excited to bring Vivienne into the fold after taking her to the theater \"since she was a little girl.\"\n\nThe musical is an adaptation of The Outsiders book, written by S.E. Hinton and published in 1967. The story explores the conflict between two rival gangs divided by their socioeconomic status: the working-class \"Greasers\" and the upper-class \"Socs.\" The film adaptation famously starred Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe and Tom Cruise and was directed by Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nBack in 2023, the source noted of the project, \"Angelina and Vivienne subsequently met with S.E. Hinton, who was around Vivienne's age when she wrote the novel. As a result of seeing the show and the conversation with S.E. Hinton, Angelina was inspired to take a role as a lead producer for the upcoming launch on Broadway.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nAngelina Jolie, Brad Pitt's Child Vivienne Drops 'Pitt' Last Name\n\nAngelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Daughter Vivienne Appears on 'Today'", "source": {"uri": "9news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KUSA.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Bell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristen Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefer_Madness_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reefer Madness (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playbill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playbill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Jolla_Playhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Jolla Playhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Musical theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcheline_Bertrand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcheline Bertrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._E._Hinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

The teen said she wanted to remove \"Pitt\" from her last name and legally make her moniker \"Shiloh Jolie,\" according to paperwork viewed by TMZ.\n\nWhile Shiloh isn't the first Jolie-Pitt child to drop her father's surname, she is the first of Angelina, 48, and Brad's kids to make the decision legal. In November 2023, the former couple's daughter Zahara revealed she wasn't using the Bullet Train actor's last name when she introduced herself as \"Zahara Marley Jolie\" when she officially joined the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority at Spelman College.\n\nMore recently, Brad, 60, and Angelina's daughter Vivienne was listed as \"Vivienne Jolie\" in a playbill for The Outsiders. Vivienne, 15, worked closely with Angelina - who is a lead producer for the musical - over the past year to bring the show to Broadway. The teen served as her mom's volunteer assistant beginning in summer 2023.\n\nThe decision to remove \"Pitt\" from their names may not surprise fans, as Brad has had complex relationships with his children ever since Angelina was granted full custody in their 2016 divorce. He has been granted more visitation time with the kids over the years, though he wasn't given the opportunity until they were already teenagers and young adults.\n\nIn 2020, their son Pax shared insight into his dynamic with Brad when he allegedly wrote an Instagram post slamming his father. Pax, 20, allegedly called Brad a \"world class a-hole\" and said he was a \"terrible and despicable person\" in the post, which recirculated in 2023.\n\n\"You have no consideration or empathy towards your 4 youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence. You will never understand the damage you've done to my family because you are incapable of doing so,\" he allegedly wrote. \"You have made the lives of those closest to me a constant hell. You may tell yourself and the world whatever you want, but the truth will come to light someday. So, happy Father's Day, you f-king awful human being!!!\"\n\nDespite removing \"Pitt\" from her name, sources previously told Life & Style that Shiloh - who is listed as \"Shi Jolie\" on Instagram - has a good relationship with Brad. The insider explained that she \"is not trying to hurt her dad's feelings\" by maintaining a close relationship with Angelina.\n\n\"She has sympathy that he's estranged from some of her siblings, but she idolizes her mom and is just doing what feels comfortable,\" the source added about her relationships with her parents and siblings.", "source": {"uri": "intouchweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "In Touch Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_schaffstall@intouchweekly.com", "name": "Katherine Schaffstall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraternities and sororities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Kappa_Alpha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alpha Kappa Alpha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Young adult fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelman_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spelman College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playbill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playbill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Father's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/shiloh-jolie-drops-pitt.jpg?crop=0px%2C84px%2C2400px%2C1261px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613851", "eventUri": "eng-9613851", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 63, "textEnd": 69}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

(Although maybe she got some scratch-offs too!) Per TMZ, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's daughter Shiloh filed paperwork to legally change her name to Shiloh Jolie, dropping \"Pitt\" from her last name altogether. It would be a very official way to cement the rift between her and her father.\n\nAnd we can't really blame her. If you've been following along with Jolie and Pitt's messy divorce (that just gets messier by the day), she alleged in 2016 that the Bullet Train actor physically abused her and their kids.\n\nThe document was filed on May 27, which was both Shiloh's birthday and Memorial Day. Though the change is not yet official, things should be moving along. Even before she could legally make the change, Shiloh had unofficially erased \"Pitt\" from her name. When a video of her dancing went viral earlier this month, fans noticed that she is only Shiloh \"J\" on Instagram.\n\nShe is not the only one of Jolie and Pitt's six kids to do something like this. Last week, people saw that her 15-year-old sister Vivienne was listed as \"Vivienne Jolie\" in the playbill for The Outsiders -- the Broadway play that she helped her mother produce. Their 19-year-old sister Zahara also publicly dropped \"Pitt\" from her name.\n\nShiloh's reported name change comes as a pretty big surprise since insiders claimed Shiloh was thinking of moving in with Pitt and his girlfriend Ines de Ramon, but it's clear she too wants to separate herself from her estranged father.\n\nAs for the other kids, Maddox, 22 reportedly testified in court against Pitt and Pax, 20 ripped his dad apart on social media. Vivienne's twin brother Knox is seemingly the only one to not make any public moves against his father, but who knows what's next for the A-list family.\n\nWe hope that with her new name, Shiloh can feel a new sense of peace.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_rakowitz@sheknows.com", "name": "Rebecca Rakowitz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Train_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullet Train (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playbill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playbill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Moving_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Moving Services", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1440236006-1.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613851", "eventUri": "eng-9613851", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 792, "textEnd": 798}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

On May 27, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's daughter filed a legal plea to have her name changed, per TMZ. Since the filing came on the very first day Shiloh could legally make this official request, it certainly sounds like she's been eager to make this big change.\n\nThe alteration of her last name is pretty telling. Shiloh has reportedly filed to drop \"Pitt\" from her hyphenated surname, and instead just go by Shiloh Jolie. The move seems to suggest that Shiloh wants to distance herself from her father after his contentious divorce from her mother in 2016. The split was reportedly caused by an altercation between Brad and his eldest son Maddox, so there have been rumors for years that the couple's six children have been on the outs with Brad.\n\nWhile Shiloh is the first of Brangelina's children to officially file for a name change, it sounds like she's not alone in wanting to shorten the Jolie-Pitt surname. A few years back, reports bubbled up that Maddox wanted to drop \"Pitt\" from his last name. Then, Shiloh's older sister Zahara notably introduced herself as Zahara Marley Jolie (sans Pitt) during her sorority induction ceremony in 2023. And just days before Shiloh's legal plea, her younger sister Vivienne was listed as simply \"Vivienne Jolie\" in the playbill for a musical she produced.\n\nWhen Brad and Angelina first started dating in the mid-2000s, she had recently adopted Maddox from Cambodia in 2002 and Zahara from Ethopia in 2005.

Accompanying her on her new job as a theatre impresario is her youngest daughter, Vivienne, who has been working as her producer assistant (Vivienne is a big theatre geek and the one who convinced her mother to support this musical.) It's been super cute to see them together working on this show. In the Playbill and in the crew credits, she is listed as Vivienne Jolie. No Pitt in sight. This has garnered some headlines, including a piece from OK! (hardly a reliable publication, mind you) lamenting how poor innocent Brad is heartbroken by the news. It's all Angelina's fault, the \"sources\" say, of course.\n\nAround the time that Jolie earned her first Tony nomination, Pitt went on the paparazzi trail with his latest girlfriend, 34-year-old Ines de Ramon, for a series of totally casual beach walk pics that made Bradley Cooper reading Lolita in the park with Suki Waterhouse look like the Zapruder film. The photos were an exclusive for People, with another 'source' saying that the pair 'are going very strong and she is happier than ever.'\n\nPitt's prolonged and questionable legal battle against Jolie has mostly gone in Jolie's favor, particularly regarding the state of the vineyard they used to own together. Jolie sold her control of shares in Miraval to Tenute del Mondo, the wine division of the Stoli group controlled by Russian billionaire Yuri Shefler, for $67 million in 2021. Pitt then sued her for monetary damages and legal fees and for her sale of those shares to be voiced. Last year, he filed additional court documents accusing Jolie of trying to 'inflict harm' on him and Miraval. Earlier this year, a judge dismissed most of Pitt's claims. Jolie's lawyer, Paul Murphy, told Entertainment Tonight that his lawsuit 'lawsuit has never been about a business dispute; instead, it is about his attempts to cover up serious abuse, and we are gratified the judge has thrown out so much of Mr. Pitt's complaint.'\n\nThis isn't Pitt's only legal mess involving Miraval. In France, he lost a lawsuit against the country's tax authorities after it was revealed that he had tried to reduce the value of the vineyard by around \u20ac21 million. Funnily enough, this story didn't get as much American press coverage as his endless legal attacks on Jolie.\n\nIt's been tough to avoid the sense that Pitt's legal fights with his ex-wife are part of his extensive campaign to retain control over his estranged family. Jolie herself said the lawsuits were 'efforts to control and financially drain her.' The Daily Mail reported on this by describing Jolie as 'vengeful' and claiming that Pitt actually made her richer through his child support payments. The overwhelmingly pro-Pitt tone of the press surrounding this divorce has been queasy yet entirely predictable.\n\nSpeaking of the Daily Mail, they recently published a piece on Pitt's 'battle to fix his broken bond' with his daughter Shiloh, who recently turned 18. According to those sources, Pitt is 'confident' that he can repair their relationship now that she can't be 'kept from him' by Jolie. So we see the narrative clear as crystal - the mother is evil, a liar, and a manipulator over the abused children of America's hunk. It's an easy lie to sell. It doesn't take much to make people believe that a woman is lying about being abused, even when they have FBI reports in their corner.\n\nThis story fell apart very quickly, though. Why? Because Shiloh's first act as a legal adult was to file paperwork to have 'Pitt' removed from her surname. TMZ, ever the scumhole with a knack for getting their hands on court documents, reported that she had petitioned a court for the name change.\n\nAs we've seen several times before, the Jolie-Pitt kids are not keen to have the name Pitt associated with them. Zahara refers to herself by Jolie at college. Maddox is reportedly known solely by Jolie. Vivienne has only her mother's name in her Playbill credit. Pax told him where to shove it. But Shiloh seems to be the first one to make it legally clear where she stands.\n\nSo, Pitt wants to keep attacking Jolie through their kids. It's the 'she's turned the weans against me' defence, a favourite among abusive men who put their children through hell and then dare to act as Father of the Year for cameras. I'm sure there are still plenty of woman-hating creeps and giddy publicists eager to spin the narrative to further smear Jolie. They'll just claim she's brainwashed her kids and that they really hate her, even though they're frequently photographed with her, collaborate with her on various projects, and attend one another's important events. Brad got asked about Zahara going to college on a red carpet and it seemed clear to everyone that it was the first time he'd heard the news. But Angie's the issue, right?\n\nRemember, we're dealing with a domestic abuse case. Brad Pitt is accused of physically attacking Jolie and at least one of their children. Rather than seek to mend their relationship privately or let his kids heal, Pitt launched into an aggressive media campaign that sold his ex-wife and family down the river so he could win an Oscar, make some money, and retain his reputation. And most of the entertainment press supported him in his endeavour because they were too scared to lose access to the Babylon junket, or whatever.\n\nJolie, meanwhile, deserves to thrive. She's a Tony nominee. She was recently on the cover of Vogue Japan looking amazing as she supported local craftspeople and the work of Guerlain's bees project. Her fashion hub, Atelier Jolie, made outfits for the Oscars and premiere of The Outsiders. And her next film, Maria, a biopic of Maria Callas, is favored to open at the Venice Film Festival. She has dealt with Pitt's public and private cruelty with grace, walking a fine line between maintaining her privacy and advocating for those like her who have suffered at the hands of their partners. Every time I see a photograph of her with her kids, the love between them is evident. That speaks volumes to me, far more so than some anonymous source spinning sh*t from sh*t.", "source": {"uri": "pajiba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pajiba"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kayleigh_donaldson@pajiba.com", "name": "Kayleigh Donaldson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William Pitt the Younger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineyard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vineyard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Shefler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yuri Shefler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playbill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playbill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lolita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impresario", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Impresario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francis Ford Coppola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musical theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suki_Waterhouse", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suki Waterhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Callas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maria Callas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Babylon"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.pajiba.com/assets_c/2024/05/Angelina%20Jolie%20Shiloh%20Pax%20Getty-thumb-700xauto-262970.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613851", "eventUri": "eng-9613851", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

However, Shiloh is the first to make the legal change.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Pitt's representatives for comment.\n\nReports of strained relations between Pitt, 60, and his children have been swirling in the years since he and Jolie, 48, split in 2016 after two years of marriage and 12 years together.\n\nLast year, the former couple's daughter Zahara, 19, was introduced in her university's sorority as Zahara Marley Jolie, also excluding her father's surname.\n\nJolie is said to have filed for divorce after an incident on a September 2016 private flight from France to Los Angeles.\n\nThe court filings, which were obtained by The New York Times, claimed that Pitt \"choked one of the children and struck another in the face\" and \"grabbed Jolie by the head and shook her\".\n\nThe filing also states that, at one point, \"he poured beer on Jolie; at another, he poured beer and red wine on the children\".\n\nPitt vehemently denied the claims at the time, and he was never charged following an investigation into allegations of abuse on the 2016 flight.\n\nLast November, Jolie and Pitt's son Pax, 20, was alleged to have called Pitt a \"world class a**hole\" and \"f***ing awful human being\" in a scathing Father's Day post on his private Instagram account, three years prior.\n\n\"You time and time and again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person,\" Pax allegedly wrote alongside a picture of Pitt accepting the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 2020, for his performance in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood.\n\n\"You have no consideration or empathy toward your four youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence,\" the teenager continued.\n\nEarlier this year, Jolie's lawyers claimed that \"Pitt's history of physical abuse of Jolie started well before the family's September 2016 plane trip\", but noted that the flight \"marked the first time he turned his physical abuse on the children as well\", causing the Salt star to leave the relationship immediately.\n\nIn 2022, Pitt and Jolie became embroiled in further legal drama when he sued her for \"secretly\" selling her shares of a French winery, Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, which they purchased together when they were a couple.\n\nThe Fight Club actor claimed that he invested a lot of time and money in the winery through the years and that the estranged couple had an understanding that neither of them could sell off their shares without the other person's consent.\n\nEarlier this month, a Los Angeles judge ruled Jolie would have to submit eight years' worth of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) as part of the ongoing legal battle.\n\nIn April, Jolie's legal team filed a motion seeking to release communications that they say would prove Pitt would not let her sell her share of the winery to him unless she agreed to an \"expansive\" NDA.\n\nPitt's lawyers then asked that Judge Lia Martin compel his ex-wife to submit the NDAs she had signed in the past.\n\nThe actor's legal team argued that the NDAs were \"highly relevant\" to Jolie's \"purported justifications for refusing to adhere to her contractual obligations to Pitt\" when she sold her shares of the winery to a Russian oligarch named Yuri Shefler.\n\nJolie's attorney, Paul Murphy, told The Daily Mail that they are \"more than happy\" to turn the NDAs over. \"Common NDAs are simply not comparable to Mr Pitt's last-second demand to try and cover up his personal misconduct,\" Murphy said.\n\nHe added that Jolie's team is \"gratified that the Court acknowledged that the only potential relevance is to the unconscionability of Mr Pitt's conduct, a now confirmed key issue in this case\".\n\nMurphy claimed the ruling \"opens the door to discovery on all issues related to Pitt's abuse\" and \"we welcome that transparency in all parties' discovery responses\".\n\nHe continued: \"Angelina looks forward to the eventual end of this litigation with its false narratives that continue to hurt the family and interfere with their ability to heal.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Which is what happened last night - Angelina and Vivienne came out to support Reefer Madness: The Musical. They posed with Kristen Bell, who produced this stage show.\n\nAngelina's outfit here is so cool - a slim suit with a t-shirt, which has a print of a necktie. I love that she didn't take off her shades too. Vivienne looks cute! I get the feeling that Vivienne is the \"normcore\" kid, Shiloh is a full tomboy and Zahara is the girly-girl. All of those kids ride for their mom so hard. As we discussed, Vivienne has dropped \"Pitt\" from her surname in the playbill for The Outsiders. Just this week, Shiloh filed paperwork to drop \"Pitt\" from her name legally... on her 18th birthday. Zahara seems to have dropped Pitt from her name too, although it's unclear if she's done so legally.\n\nMeanwhile, post-Cannes Film Festival, other festivals are trying to get some hype.

ALISON BOSHOFF reveals what to expect Advertisement\n\n'He would love Shiloh to start making her own decisions and for him to be in the mix for her future, so he just has to see what happens and hope for the best.'\n\nHaving spoken to friends of the film star many times over the eight years since his marriage to Angelina Jolie collapsed, what can be said with certainty is that Brad has tried everything to build bridges with his offspring following that private jet confrontation in 2016 - during which he was said to have been physically abusive - and that nothing has worked.\n\nThere have been long custody battles which temporarily ended in victory for Brad - in 2021 he was granted 50-50 custody - only to have it overturned on appeal.\n\nHe's had a judge intervene to tell Angelina she mustn't listen in on his mobile phone calls with the children and has also been ordered to undergo 'reunification therapy' with their six children - Maddox, 22, Pax, 20, Zahara, 19, Shiloh 18, and Knox and Vivienne, 15.\n\nHe's sent cars and security to ferry the children from her home to his whenever there is an allotted custody visit. Sadly, none of it has brought them any closer.\n\nIn fact, son Pax said in an Instagram post in 2016 that all four of the youngest children - including Shiloh - 'tremble with fear in his presence'. The two elder ones were at that point already declining point blank to see him.\n\nThe situation now is that all six have formed a tight gang with his former wife.\n\nShiloh, seen in Rome with Angelina in 2022, has filed to change her name officially to Shiloh Jolie - on her 18th birthday\n\nLast year Angelina called them: 'The closest people to me in my life. We had to heal. There are things we needed to heal from.'\n\nWhile Shiloh has repeatedly walked red carpets with her famous actress mother, neither she nor her siblings have done the same for their father. Shiloh, who for some years would only answer to the name of John and would dress in boys' clothes, is by all accounts a creative soul.\n\nAngelina once said of her: 'Shiloh dresses like a little dude. She likes to dress like a boy. She wants to be a boy. So we had to cut her hair. She likes to wear boys' everything. She thinks she's one of the brothers.'\n\nNow a dance student, Shiloh was recently praised by her long-term choreographer who insisted that the daughter of the Hollywood couple could not be further from the stereotypical Hollywood 'nepo baby.'\n\n'Shiloh is an exceptionally talented dancer, demonstrating dedication and hard work,' said Keelan Carter, who has trained with Shiloh at an LA dance studio.\n\n'She is a sincere and straightforward person who never uses her celebrity status to her advantage. Shi does not rely on her famous name to achieve her goals. 'Honestly, I didn't even know who she was at first and I don't think this matters, especially in a dance studio.'\n\nA source added that Brad would still 'love her unconditionally,' no matter what Shiloh chose to do\n\nCertainly, Brad has often talked of Shiloh with pride. Speaking at the premiere of his film Bullet Train in 2022, Brad said of her dance accomplishments: 'It brings a tear to the eye, yeah. I'm Mr Two-Left-Feet here.'\n\nBut for all his pride and paternal attempts to engage with her passions - he also once set up a skate park in his home for Shiloh and more recently an art studio to reflect their common interest - there has only been rejection.\n\n'This is the result of textbook parental alienation, and it is a great sadness in his life,' I am told.\n\n'There have been years and years of her [Angelina] telling and retelling the same lies about him and the reality is that she has alienated the kids, and the reality is that it is upsetting to Brad. He cares about all of them. It is devastating.'\n\nOf course, Shiloh is not the first child to ditch the Pitt surname.\n\nAll three of the couple's adopted children - Zahara, a student at Spelman College, Atlanta; Maddox, a graduate of Yonsei University in Seoul, and Pax, who has worked on film sets with his mother - no longer use their father's name.\n\nA very glam Brad and Angelina are photographed on the red carpet for the screening of Inglorious Basterds in 2009\n\nWhile Shiloh has repeatedly walked red carpets with her famous actress mother, neither she nor her siblings have done the same for their father\n\nBrad's second biological daughter Vivienne, 15, who has been working on a musical with Angelina, is credited as simply 'Vivienne Jolie' in the programme for the production of The Outsiders in New York. It's not known if Knox, Brad's only biological son, has also followed suit.\n\nIronically, when the couple first met on the set of the action movie Mr and Mrs Smith - and when Brad was still married to Jennifer Aniston - sources said that Angelina would show up at his trailer and tell him: 'Maddox would like to say 'Hi.'\n\nBrad, then 42, was enchanted - by the boy and his mother.\n\nAngelina Jolie had adopted Maddox from Cambodia in 2002 as her marriage to Billy Bob Thornton was falling apart. In 2005 she adopted Zahara, a baby from Ethiopia - aided by Brad Pitt. The last adoption came in 2007 when Pax, aged three, joined the family. Brad legally adopted all three. Their three biological children followed.\n\nThey settled at one time in New Orleans, and in France, and called a myriad of hotels a temporary home.\n\nBrad and Angelina with their six children Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne at an airport in Tokyo in 2008\n\nShiloh, who for some years would only answer to the name of John and would dress in boys' clothes, is by all accounts a creative soul\n\nBrad was drinking heavily during some of this time and said more than once that he would wake up still drunk from the previous night. His friend Quentin Tarantino has alluded to his pot-smoking habit, which Angelina disapproved of. (He gave up alcohol in the wake of his split.)\n\nAt home there were no rules, except that the children weren't encouraged to make friends outside of the family circle - and they ruled the roost.\n\nOne former nanny, who quit in despair, reportedly said that the children insisted on breakfasting on items like pizza or chocolate, and enjoyed a diet of junk food, particularly the cheesy corn snack Cheetos.\n\nAs the troubled marriage entered its final year, Angelina's brother James moved in with the couple, having been hired as the chief nanny.\n\nThen came that shattering - and disputed - incident on a plane. In legal documents, Angelina said that Brad hit and choked the children as well as attacking her, and punching the roof of the plane when drunk.\n\nKnox, Zahara, Vivienne and Shiloh attend the premiere of Dumbo with their mother\n\nAt one point, it was claimed, he poured beer on his wife, while he also poured beer and red wine on the children.\n\nFive days later, Angelina filed for divorce -- just after the second anniversary of their wedding -- requesting sole physical custody of the six children.\n\nA lawyer for Brad said he had accepted responsibility for some things in his past but that he would not accept responsibility for things he did not do. Another source close to the actor dismissed Angelina's account as 'bulls***' and claimed her story was 'constantly evolving'.\n\nThe source added: 'She continues to rehash, revise and reimagine her description of an event that happened six years ago by adding completely untrue information each time she fails to get what she wants.'\n\nSources in the Brad camp described the release of the information as a 'media stunt to inflict pain.'\n\nThere has certainly been no shortage of that.\n\nLast year, an Instagram post in which Pax called Brad Pitt a 'f***ing awful human being' was made public.\n\nIn it, Pax wrote of his father: 'You time and time again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person. You have no consideration or empathy toward your four youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence.\n\n'You will never understand the damage you have done to my family because you're incapable of doing so.'\n\nOne friend of Brad's called the publication 'sad and frustrating' but added: '[He] would only ever respect the kids' voices. He will never ever speak negatively about any of them and will almost never talk about them in public. There is no question that he would hit back at them.'\n\nNo further activity is expected over custody - Brad's friends explain that it's clear that the children will be all 'aged out' before the current arrangement can be varied. Legal skirmishes now concern the sale of Angelina's share of the Miraval vineyard to the Stoli group.\n\nAngelina has been ordered to hand over Non Disclosure Agreements which she previously had with staff. She is arguing that Brad tried to tie her up in an NDA in exchange for her selling the vineyard to him.\n\nThe war, then, continues. But as Shiloh becomes the latest child to write her father out of her life, the only battle Brad really cared about seems to have been lost already.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

The Oscar winner's kids -- Maddox, 22, Pax, 20, Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 18, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 15 -- have certainly impacted Jolie in many ways. And her style just happens to be one of the elements of her life that's evolved since she became a mother.\n\nOver the course of the last several years, Jolie's style has included muted tones and classic silhouettes incorporated into her wardrobe. It's rare to see the philanthropist and activist wearing clothing with any words or phrases, or even vibrant colors. Instead, Jolie's fashion yields to more subdued and elegant attire.\n\nAhead, see snapshots of Jolie with her children and a look at her motherhood style evolution.\n\nIn the mid-2010s, Jolie began bringing her kids to more red carpet events. The actress attended the premiere of \"The Breadwinner\" in Hollywood in October 2017, wearing a white A-line dress with flowing sleeves and an intricate detail on the bodice. She also brought her kids Shiloh and Zahara to the event.\n\nFor the 2018 Golden Globe Awards, Jolie demonstrated her proclivity for an Old Hollywood style sensibility. The actress fashioned a black gown with a sheer element that revealed Jolie's shoulders and wore her hair back with a few wisps to frame her face. She accessorized with glittering earrings, merging her own approach to style with a classic aesthetic. She also brought son Pax with her to the event.\n\nAt the September 2019 premiere of her film \"Maleficent,\" Jolie proved she could still be playful with her fashion choices. She wore a glittering black gown with gathered fabric to her waist and a silver scorpion brooch binding the fabric together. The look appeared to be method dressing-inspired, and her kids, Pax, Shiloh, Vivienne, Zahara and Knox, seemed to coordinate their looks to their mother's attire.\n\nWhile attending Variety's Power of Women in September 2021, Jolie demonstrated her inclination to muted tones. She wore this mocha-hued maxidress with long flowing sleeves, a cinched waist and high neckline. The dress was a more conservative look from what Jolie had worn prior to her years of motherhood. Zahara fashioned a similar aesthetic in a white jumpsuit with a belted waist.\n\nIn April 2023, Jolie and her son Maddox attended the White House state dinner for South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol. For the occasion, Jolie fashioned a look with ethereal inspiration. She wore a floor-length white gown with a thigh-high slit from Chanel.

As for how she wants to be known going forward, Shiloh requested that she drop her father's last name and simply become \"Shiloh Jolie.\"\n\nThough Shiloh is not the only one of her siblings to drop the \"Pitt\" from her name -- sisters Zahara, 19, and Vivienne, 15, have also taken their father's name off of theirs in various capacities -- she is the first of the six Jolie-Pitt children to request a legal change.

The duo both opted to play with suiting, although, Jolie's is a bit more of a wink and a nod to the traditional look.\n\nJolie wore a white crewneck T-shirt printed with a gray striped trompe l'oeil necktie. But don't let the humorous tee fool you -- the Atelier Jolie founder is extremely serious about fashion. Case in point: her impeccably tailored suit. Over her shirt, she added a double-breasted black blazer with a structured shoulder. On the bottom she wore a pair of sharp, pleated trousers, hemmed to perfection so that they hovered just above the (appropriately colored) green carpet. She topped off the cool, masculine look with a pair of oversized black sunglasses.\n\nThe outfit is quite the shake-up from the last time we saw Angelina Jolie out and about. Last weekend she joined daughter Zahara at The Grove in Los Angeles, wearing her go-to black midi dress, Phoebe Philo-era Celine purse, and nude patent leather Christian Louboutins.\n\nVivienne, for her part, also dabbled in suiting for the Reefer Madness premiere. She wore a grommet-riddled vest over a light blue button-up and black trousers, which she accessorized with a pair of Converse.

He adopted them legally after they got together.\n\nThe couple had their first biological child, Shiloh, in 2006. Next they adopted Pax from Vietnam. Finally, Jolie gave birth to twins, Knox and Vivienne, in 2008.\n\nCourt filings obtained by The New York Times indicated that Jolie accused Pitt of domestic violence following a private flight from France to Los Angeles in 2016. The filing alleged that Pitt \"choked one of the children and struck another in the face\" and \"grabbed Jolie by the head and shook her.\"\n\nIt also said the Academy-Award-winning actor \"poured beer on Jolie\" and \"poured beer and red wine on the children.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nPitt denied any wrongdoing and refuted the allegations.\n\nPax also allegedly called his adoptive father a \"world class a**hole\" and \"f***ing awful human being\" in a Father's Day post on his private Instagram account in 2020, per The Daily Mail.\n\n\"You time and time and again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person,\" the social media account holder wrote over a picture of Pitt accepting the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 2020 for his role in \"Once Upon a Time...

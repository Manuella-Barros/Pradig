{"id": 225017308, "title": "Plane passenger called me rude for refusing to swap seats \u2013 we were already mid-air", "text": "It's an absolute dream when you get onto a flight to find the seat next to you is empty. And this is exactly what happened to one passenger, who was able to stretch out for hours. That's until their bubble was burst, though. In an awkward encounter, a fellow holidaymaker asked to move into the empty seat next to them. But not wanting to be cramped, they refused to welcome her into the row. Recalling the experience on Reddit, they said: \"Nothing eventful happened for the first 4.5 hours of the flight. Randomly, the passenger from the aisle seat across from me comes over with her friend \u2013 who was sitting a few rows back \u2013 and ANNOUNCES that her friend would now be taking the middle seat to get away from a crying baby further back. She did not ask \u2013 she told us this was happening. There were about three hours of flight time remaining.\" Instead of budging over, the passenger called a flight attendant over to help. And in a bid to settle the situation, the cabin crew member said the woman could \"take an available seat\" but was not allowed to \"disrupt anyone's seating arrangements\". This enraged the woman, who was looking forward to moving away from the loud baby. The Redditor added: \"The woman then starts b****ing about how I was assigned the middle but then moved to the aisle before takeoff, so I shouldn't even have that aisle seat. I had been sitting there for almost five hours and we had already distributed our items all over the row.\" While the Reddit user probably expected to get a sympathetic response to the problem, many thought they were in the wrong. One person said: \"They should have asked politely, but you paid for two seats and had the benefit of three for most of the flight, and you were not actually entitled to hog all three seats while somebody else suffered. It would have been fair to decide which of the three seats you would let her have, but refusing her a seat because her friend was rude was a rude move, and the flight attendant shouldn't have let you do that.\" And another agreed: \"I understand it wasn\u2019t convenient and you had already spread yourselves all over the empty seat. However, technically you had only paid for one seat, so if a seat is empty and a passenger wants to move at any point during a flight (especially for a valid reason like a crying baby), they should be able to.\"", "summary": "An explosive row broke out on a plane when a woman tried to move into an empty seat to get away from a crying baby \u2013 as a fellow passenger stopped them doing so", "url": "https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/plane-passenger-called-rude-refusing-29257828", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29257876.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_A-passenger-during-sitting-at-the-economy-class-seat.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:28:36", "author": "Zahna Eklund", "authors": ["Zahna Eklund"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.855}

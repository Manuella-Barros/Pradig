His team is winning despite it. But to knock out the Philadelphia 76ers, who the Knicks lead 2-0 in their first-round NBA playoff series, they could use a Brunson turnaround.\n\nFinally, the All-Star point guard has figured out how to make it happen: Play better.\n\n\"The easy answer is I need to adjust and I need to be more poised, just understand what they're doing and just flat-out be better,\" Brunson said. \"There's no gimmicks to it. It's just, 'Jalen, you need to be better.' And it's that plain and simple.\"\n\nIf he doesn't, the risk is obvious.\n\nThe Knicks may have squeezed out two home victories to begin this series, but both finishes came down to the wire. The 76ers are not dead, especially with the next two games moving to Philadelphia.\n\nThe role players have carried New York thus far. But Josh Hart won't hit four 3s in every game. Miles \"Deuce\" McBride can't always catch fire. The centers may not be able to fend off Joel Embiid each night.\n\nThat's when the Knicks need Brunson. They haven't yet seen the one who lit up the NBA all season.\n\nThe Sixers' game plan angles around making Brunson's life difficult. Now, they are causing fits for the league's fourth-leading scorer.\n\nMatchups begin with who is defending the head of the snake. Zones are based on where he might be heading. Despite two close Philadelphia losses over the weekend, the strategy has worked. Brunson is averaging 23.0 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists so far in the series but is shooting just 16 of 55 (29 percent), which includes an 8 of 29 clunker during New York's miraculous Game 2 win. He has connected on only 2 of 12 3-pointers.\n\nWith Game 3 at 7:30 p.m. (ET) Thursday, the Knicks are counting on a change.\n\n\"I don't think he has to do (anything) different,\" Hart said. \"He's shooting shots that he normally makes. You shoot yourself into a slump and you shoot yourself out of a slump.\"\n\nHart is correct. Brunson could shoot himself out of this funk. But to do so, he has to make shots. For now, that's not so simple.\n\nThe 76ers' blueprint isn't just working because it's clever. The players also have executed it as well as coach Nick Nurse could hope.\n\nKelly Oubre Jr., who has manned Brunson for much of the series, has used his length to disrupt the smaller guard. Kyle Lowry has been a walking pest. Nicolas Batum, another long wing, has stayed down when Brunson leaps for a shot. Tyrese Maxey, normally a more vulnerable defender, has stood his ground when Brunson hopes to square him up.\n\nAll the while, eight other eyes lock into Brunson. It's not just the man defending him who is responsible for stopping him.\n\nThe Sixers have encouraged Hart's defender, often Lowry, to sag closer to the basket. The strategy leaves Hart open on the wing, which has allowed him to get hot. Hart hadn't made four 3-pointers in a game in 14 months coming into this series. Yet, he's nailed four in each of the first two games.\n\nThe playoffs are about trade-offs. The same tactic that has allowed Hart all these open looks is contributing to Brunson's struggles.\n\nHart's defender is often down low, waiting for Brunson once he arrives in the paint. Embiid is somewhere in the vicinity, too. When Brunson swerves around a pick-and-roll, his primary defender, often Oubre, has trailed behind him. This is a not-so-extreme hybrid version of the Utah Jazz's approach to James Harden during the 2019 playoffs. To take away basketball's world's most dangerous stepback 3-pointer, they guarded him on his backside.\n\nIt leaves Brunson without space, without direction.\n\nIf he steps back, Oubre is behind him. If he keeps driving, Lowry or Embiid will meet him. If he tries to step through lofting up one of his patented floaters after 47 pivots, one of the three defenders in his area can contest it.\n\nOn many of those plays, Brunson has attempted to keep his man behind him, hoping to draw a foul on the way up. Too often, he's failed to receive the call.\n\nIt's the playoffs, where ticky-tack fouls are not nearly as common.\n\n\"Whether it's the playoffs or not, it's all about the way the game is being called so you have to adjust,\" Brunson said. \"Certain things are going and certain things are not. ... But for the most part, I just need to lock in on just not trying to not be myself.\"\n\nMaybe going straight up, not worrying about drawing contact, could help Brunson sink a few of these floaters. Maybe that inspires more shot making. Sometimes, all an All-Star scorer needs to catch fire is to see the ball go through the net.\n\nIsaiah Hartenstein, the screener in many of those pick-and-rolls, says it's not just on the shooter, either. Hartenstein believes he can set \"harder screens\" for Brunson, which could give him more space.\n\n\"We all have to do a better job of getting him easier looks. ... But it's Jalen,\" Hartenstein said. \"He'll figure it out.\"\n\nThe Knicks offense has looked its best in this series in the moments it has involved Hartenstein as a screener, either in pick-and-rolls or on dribble handoffs.\n\nWhen New York turned got rolling in Game 2, it was with Hartenstein leading the way. Head coach Tom Thibodeau called a timeout with 4 minutes, 21 seconds remaining in the second quarter. The Knicks had only 34 points at the time. They came out of the stoppage with one of their go-to plays, which began with a Brunson-Hartenstein pick-and-roll and ended three passes later with a wide-open corner 3.\n\nThe Knicks didn't stop there. The next seven half-court possessions all included Hartenstein setting a screen for Brunson, whether that was in a pick-and-roll, a dribble handoff or one to free the point guard off the ball. New York scored 11 points on those possessions.\n\nThe heater spilled into the beginning of the third quarter, as did the theme: Hartenstein set screens everywhere.\n\n\"When you get stagnant, it's really hard to score, especially the way the 76ers and Nick Nurse coaches,\" Hartenstein said. \"I think they do a good job of not letting easy points come, even after screens. If you don't have motion before, they've been doing a good job of just having that rearview contest. So we just try to move the ball a little bit more and try to work off that, just kinda move the defense a little.\"\n\nThere are other possible solutions to Brunson's struggles.\n\nThe Knicks could attack Embiid, who is not fully healthy and is moving as such. Embiid, even when at 100 percent, is at his best guarding the paint. The Knicks could force him to cover more ground.\n\nLate in Game 2, their offense bogged down.\n\nBrunson would run a pick-and-roll with whoever Maxey or Tobias Harris was guarding setting the screen for him. The Sixers would concede a switch. Then Brunson would attack his new defender.\n\nBut both Maxey and Harris, usually more vulnerable defenders, have fought hard while manning Brunson one-on-one over the first two games. If Brunson is not creating space, the Knicks will search for ways to get him some.\n\nThey could run more pick-and-rolls at Embiid and could pull him far out, too, bringing Hartenstein 30 feet from the basket to set ball screens by the logo instead of around the 3-point arc. Doing so would force a hobbled center to cover more ground. So far, many of the Knicks' pick-and-rolls have been from the wings.\n\nThey could run Brunson around more picks off the ball or hope to get him easy buckets in transition. That would mean someone else, such as Hart or Hartenstein or Donte DiVincenzo, making a play for him. It's not like they haven't tried that. Just as he did during the regular season, Brunson is ping-ponging around the court after he gives up the basketball. But his motion hasn't generated nearly as many easy looks.\n\nFifty-three of the 55 shots Brunson has taken in this series have been off the dribble. One corner 3 was off a pass from OG Anunoby -- and Brunson didn't go right up with a shot either, instead attempting to jab his defender away with a shoulder before rising for the jumper. The other time was when Hart fed him for a fast-break layup.\n\nEvery other shot for Brunson, out of 55, has come off the dribble. This is where the Knicks miss Julius Randle, who is out for the season with a shoulder injury. Randle's presence removes the playmaking burden from Brunson. It's no coincidence that the point guard's spot-up looks have plummeted since Randle got hurt in January.\n\nTrends tend to become more extreme come the playoffs. That's occurring here.\n\nBut the Knicks have one more adjustment they could try, too. Brunson could just replicate what he did during their first 82 games.\n\nHe could sink more shots, no matter how difficult: Ones off the dribble, off the catch and everywhere else. This is one of the NBA's best scorers. Through two games, he's not scoring.\n\nThe answer may be apparent: He could just play better.\n\n\"The shots that I've been shooting are the shots that I've been making all year,\" Brunson said. They've got to be better and make the shots.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fred_katz@theathletic.com", "name": "Fred

It's just, 'Jalen, you need to be better.' And it's that plain and simple.\"\n\nBrunson finished 8-for-29 in Game 2 and missed his first five attempts from long distance before his side-step 3-pointer pulled the Knicks within two with 27.1 seconds remaining.\n\nThe first-time All-Star noted that \"for the most part\" he has been taking \"the shots that I've been shooting ... and making\" all season.\n\nThe Sixers have mostly employed 6-foot-7 wing Kelly Oubre Jr. and 6-8 forward Nic Batum as the primary defenders on the 6-2 Brunson in the series, daring others to beat them.\n\nBrunson's teammates largely have picked him up in the two wins, led by Josh Hart, who is averaging 21.5 points, 14 rebounds and 45.0 minutes in the series.\n\n\"Those guys have been phenomenal. At some point, I'll get up to their level,\" Brunson said.\n\nSaid Hart: \"Got to give Philly credit. Oubre and Batum, they guard [Brunson] full-court. I don't think there's anything he has to do different. ... You shoot yourself into a slump and you shoot yourself out of a slump.\n\n\"So, for him, he has to just continue to shoot, continue to be aggressive. That's what we need. Maybe we can play faster, try to get him cleaner looks where he's not battling the holding -- or try to push off, exert physical energy trying to get the ball and try to make something happen. Maybe we can play a little faster, get him some cleaner looks.\"\n\nBrunson shot just 40.3 percent against the Sixers in four regular-season appearances, although the Knicks also fared well in winning three of those matchups.\n\nThe $104 million point guard had a 29-point effort against them on Jan. 5, but he was held to 34.6 percent shooting (18-for-52) in the other three games.\n\nWhen asked about the league's Last Two Minute report finding that Brunson and Hart had fouled Tyrese Maxey twice during their last-minute comeback, Tom Thibodeau shifted his answer to a repeat of his season-long gripes about Brunson not getting enough calls.\n\n\"I'm more concerned with the 46-minute report. And I mean that,\" Thibodeau said. \"I knew they couldn't call a foul there. I'm watching the way Jalen is being guarded.\"\n\nStill, Thibodeau flatly stated he's \"never\" seen Brunson frustrated in these past two victories.\n\n\"I think he's doing what he's supposed to be doing,\" Thibodeau said. \"They overload, just make the play. We're getting a lot of offensive rebounds because of that. Their zone principles are overloaded to the strong side.\n\n\"If you're looking at what they're trying to do with him is make him play in a crowd, so don't force it. Take the shots that are there. The game will tell you what to do.\"\n\nOf course, Brunson starred collegiately and won two NCAA titles at nearby Villanova, having plenty of familiarity with Wells Fargo Center.\n\nHe expects it to be a hostile environment with the home team down 0-2, especially considering the circumstances late in Game 2.\n\n\"It's fun. It's a test to see where you are as a team.

But with about five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Oubre poked the ball away (again) from the Knicks' All-Star point guard, then dished it ahead to Tyrese Maxey for a transition layup.\n\nThat sequence epitomizes the way the Sixers have made life tough on Brunson through two games of this first-round series, which shifts to Philly for Thursday's Game 3 at the Wells Fargo Center. It has arguably been the most significant positive development for a Sixers team down 0-2, by using an array of individual defenders and collective schemes to hold Brunson to 29.1% shooting (16-for-55) from the floor with six turnovers.\n\n\"We're guarding him hard, like we said we were going to,\" Sixers coach Nick Nurse said Wednesday after practice. \"We pressured him. We've put multiple people on him. ... I think all our guys have stepped up and taken the challenge.\"\n\nThis has come following Brunson's offensive tear to end the regular season, when he averaged 37.8 points on nearly 50% shooting from the floor and 8.3 assists during his final 10 games to surely solidify his spot on several MVP ballots. After the Sixers topped the Miami Heat in last week's play-in game, advancing to a first-round series against the Knicks, starting forward Tobias Harris acknowledged that \"our hands are full\" with Brunson, yet immediately added, \"but we'll be able to figure it out.\"\n\nSo far, the Sixers have largely accomplished their most matter-of-fact goal: forcing Brunson into difficult shots. That is far easier said than done against the crafty ballhandler known for setting the pace and slithering around and through a defense.\n\n\" READ MORE: De'Anthony Melton says he's ready to return for the Sixers\n\nThe Sixers have not regularly \"blitzed\" Brunson with multiple defenders at the rate of several regular-season opponents, helping develop Brunson into a dangerous, decisive passer out of such situations. Instead, they have been ready to deploy a zone that organically shifts to its most dangerous scorer.\n\nOubre has started both games with the Brunson assignment, using his lengthy wingspan and athleticism to keep up. Harris, Maxey, Nico Batum, Kyle Lowry, and Buddy Hield have also regularly taken on that responsibility by design, while switching a screen, or when picking up Brunson in transition. From there, those defenders are asked to impose physicality and the trademark aggressiveness of a Nurse defense, which during the regular season ranked fourth in the NBA in turnovers forced (14.6 per game), second in steals (8.5), and tied for second in deflections (16.2).\n\nThe Sixers were particularly successful in Game 1 while swiping and prodding from behind when Brunson got dribble-happy in the lane, leading to blocks and steals for Oubre and Maxey and contributing to Brunson's five turnovers. Those Sixers also have the green light to contest hard -- Batum, like Oubre, can utilize his long, 6-foot-8 frame to blanket and get a hand up against the 6-2 Brunson -- and revel in the fact that intimidating 7-footer Joel Embiid is lurking behind them to protect the rim and clog the paint.\n\n\"[Nurse] was giving me nuggets and tips on how to disrupt him and disrupt his flow,\" Oubre said following Game 1. \"[Brunson is] still going to score and do what he does, and he can shoot the ball anytime he wants, which makes it tough to guard. ...\n\n\"But at the end of the day, we just need to stay solid for 48 minutes against him.\"\n\nSome examples of Brunson shaking free include on a backdoor cut in Game 1, when he fielded a bounce pass from center Isaiah Hartenstein for a finish through contact. Or when he used a shot fake off a catch to get Oubre to overpursue, then sidestepped into a three-pointer before Oubre could recover and challenge the attempt. Or when two screens got Brunson going downhill, before lofting a floater over Embiid. Or when Brunson wove around Hield and Paul Reed for an off-the-glass bucket that gave the Knicks their first lead of Game 2.\n\nThere also have been moments when a purposeful double-team by the Sixers -- or a miscue -- has led to Brunson facilitating for a timely shot. When Oubre slightly drifted from Donte DiVincenzo to help on Brunson in the third quarter of Game 1, for instance, he dished to his teammate for the three-pointer. In the following frame, when Brunson drove away from the screen to his right, that left Oubre and Harris in Brunson's area. Brunson fired a crosscourt pass to OG Anunoby for a deep dagger shot.\n\nHarris clearly got caught in the wrong position during that sequence. But he responded excellently in Game 2, when his standout fourth-quarter defense on Brunson contributed to his 2-of-8 mark from the field during that period. And on one of those makes, Brunson needed a fortuitous bounce off the front of the rim for the three-pointer that ignited the Knicks' wild sequence to snatch a victory.\n\nA cynic could say that the Sixers failed to capitalize on two poor Brunson shooting performances. An optimist would point out that the Sixers could get another perimeter disrupter back for Game 3 in De'Anthony Melton, who has battled a spine injury for much of the season but averaged 1.6 steals and 3.1 deflections in 38 games.\n\n\" READ MORE: The Knicks -- and a trio of Main Line stars -- are bringing their Villanova connection back to Philly\n\nWhile praising his teammates' shot-making so far in the series after Game 2, Brunson acknowledged, \"If only I can get up to that level at some point.\" After Wednesday's practice, teammate Josh Hart wondered aloud to reporters in New York if the Knicks could get Brunson cleaner looks by playing faster, but also trusted the mantra that \"You shoot yourself into a slump, and you shoot yourself out of a slump.\" Brunson also put the onus on himself, saying, \"I need to adjust and I need to be more poised.\"\n\n\"Just understand what they're doing and just flat-out be better,\" he added. \"There's no gimmicks to it. It's just, 'Jalen, you need to be better.' And it's that plain and simple.\"\n\nThe Sixers, meanwhile, will vie to prevent such a turnaround.\n\n\"You've just got to stay after him,\" Nurse said. \"Even when he comes in there and makes those incredible turnaround fadeaways, you've got to, next time down, pick him up and go to work again.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"},

The Knicks need to find ways to revive Brunson's impact by enhancing his advantages and playing faster. Secondary options like Hart have propelled the Knicks, exploiting weaknesses in the Sixers' defensive strategy.\n\nIt's that time of the year, folks! The NBA Playoffs kicked off less than a week ago, and just in case anyone needed a reminder, we have entered a whole different game. As the postseason unfolds, the pace slows down, defenses tighten up and, more importantly, offenses hone in on their bread-and-butter actions.\n\nFor Jalen Brunson and the New York Knicks, that offensive staple was a traditional spread pick-and-roll, typically set up around the three-point line in the middle of the floor. Brunson led the league in pick-and-rolls manipulated this past season, leaving teams puzzled by the slippery guard's maliciousness in such situations.\n\nBut in the first two games of their opening round series against the Philadelphia 76ers, New York's usually robust offensive engine has looked like a shell of himself. He's failed to connect on nearly all his trademark midrange shots, overlooked passing windows he typically exploits, and as even had his shot blocked on several occasions.\n\nThe Sixers might just have figured out how the head of the orange and blue-colored snake operates - and yet, they find themselves trailing two games to none with the series heading to Philadelphia on Thursday.\n\nIt's All About Tendencies Sixers have limited Brunson to 16-for-55 field goals in the first two games\n\nIn the second season of a 4-year, $110 million deal, Jalen Brunson and his stellar level of play were rewarded with the first time All-Star nomination of his career. One mind-boggling, spinning and-one at a time, he solidified his status as the dazzling star New York had long yearned for, willing the injury-riddled to the second seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nWith his dexterity and spectacular lower-body flexibility, Jalen Brunson stands out as one of the sport's most distinctive lead creators. At 6-foot-1, Brunson abuses defenses through head fakes, crafty footwork, and remarkable body control that sets up his left-handed feathery touch.\n\nGiven his stature and limited vertical leap, Brunson doesn't apply much pressure on the rim. Instead, he relies on his striking core strength and bulky stature to abruptly halt his drives, catching defenders and rim protectors off guard with a swift shot release. He attempts nearly double the amount of short mid-range shots as rim attempts - which is altogether pretty wild.\n\nBrunson thrives in the short-midrange area, and when he happens to attack the rim, he predominantly does it with his left hand. As the brilliant defensive mind he is, Nick Nurse has tailored the way his team defends Brunson by giving him a distressing illusion of control. The Sixers are shadowing the former Villanovan's left side, enticing him to drive to the paint where a convergence of defenders awaits.\n\nTheir objective was clear; take away Brunson's left-handed quests, coerce him into challenging Joel Embiid frontally, and induce one-footed finishes - areas where his offensive prowess simply falters. The Sixers are guiding him towards a selection of shots they're willing to give up, instead of letting him carve their defense and pick his spots as he's done all season long.\n\nThey deemed those pull-up midranges, upon which he maintained a 49 percent success rate during the regular season, and one-footed floaters as shots they're willing to live with. Two games in, this strategy has been a limpid success. Brunson is only shooting 4-for-23 from the short mid-range due to the constant pressure disrupting his two-motion shooting mechanics.\n\nThose smothering rear-view contests are precisely where Kelly Oubre Jr. and Nicolas Batum have had their biggest impact. With their length and physicality, they instilled a sense of hesitation within Brunson's usually methodical maneuvers. Just like that, the 27-year-old All-Star went from always thinking one step ahead, to looking back on his trailing defender endlessly lurking on his next move.\n\nTest Fast, Fail Fast, Adjust Fast Brunson and the Knicks could find ways to revive his impact\n\nThe Sixers' willingness to give Brunson a slight edge stems from their belief that it puts them in a better position to limit the subsequent damage. To counter that strategy, the Knicks need to find ways to enhance the advantages Brunson possesses and shift the dynamic currently in the defenders' favor.\n\nNotably, they could try to have Isaiah Hartenstein set his bone-crushing screens higher on the floor to render stunts harder to execute, give Brunson more space to leverage and allow him to attack with more speed.\n\nSince Julius Randle's injury back in January, the Knicks had to reinvent Brunson's impact. Beyond the heliocentric force his usage numbers imply, Brunson has become a wrecking ball without the rock in his bandaged hands. Running around the court, setting screens for teammates before receiving one himself, Brunson's activity elevated New York's spaced-out offense to an elite level.\n\nBrunson has had to self-create 53 of the 55 shots he took in the series. To lighten the burden, Tom Thibodeau and his coaching staff could look to involve him in actions where he starts without the ball, gravitating around his synergic partner in screens Isaiah Hartenstein before catching it on the move with an empty wing to work with.\n\nHart Will Go On Knicks' secondary options have propelled the team\n\nThe Sixers have keenly left Josh Hart wide open, a 31.0 percent shooter from distance on the season, to clog Brunson's powerplays. Nick Nurse and his coaching staff are famously known for empowering subpar shooters, and their gameplan couldn't have been more evident from the series' onset.\n\nOn the play above, the Sixers are \"nexting\" Brunson's pick-and-roll, meaning the closest defender on the perimeter is sliding over to prevent Brunson from penetrating and keep Embiid in the paint - directly leaving Hart wide open.\n\nThe thing is, Hart has nailed those looks at an alarming rate, converting 8 of his 15 attempts from beyond the arc in the first two games. This includes an absurd off-balance pull-up in transition. He hadn't hit more than three threes in a game all season - he's achieved that feat in both games.\n\nHart has been diligently preparing for this moment, fully aware the Sixers would view his shooting limitations as a weak link to exploit and shrink New York's spacing. In the week leading up to Saturday's game one, Hart dedicated time before and after every training session to refine his shooting touch, even enlisting the help of his shooting coach in the Big Apple.\n\n\"That's something I knew I really had to focus on,... I knew it was going to be that way in terms of just open shots, and fortunately, I was able to knock them down.\"\n\nNo matter whether this shooting prowess is sustainable or not, they have allowed the Knicks to secure half the win they need to advance - and their success doesn't solely rely on that.\n\nWhen it wasn't Hart confidently launching threes, it was either McBride slithering to the right elbow for crucial jumpers or Bogdanovic drilling back-to-back threes to extend the lead in the fourth. The Sixers seemed to have remedied their defensive rebounding issues, until the Knicks seized two of them in the final minute of Monday's game, setting the stage for the biggest playoffs moment of the decade in New York.\n\nAdditionally, their suffocating physicality and ball pressure have disrupted Philadelphia's already-stuttering offense, often forcing Embiid to catch the ball 20-feet away from the rim and with significantly less time to operate. The Sixers have clearly had the two best players in the series, yet the Knicks have unequivocally been the better team.\n\nHeading to Philly with a commanding 2-0 lead, the Knicks understand there's no cause for celebration yet.

Philadelphia's defense has stifled New York's one-man offense.\n\nWhen asked about adjusting to the 76ers' coverage ahead of Game 3, Brunson told Ian Begley of SNY that the answer is a simple one.\n\n\"The easy answer is I need to adjust and...be more poised; understand what they're doing & flat-out be better,\" Brunson told SNY on April 23. There's no gimmicks to it. It's just, 'Jalen you need to be better.'

The odds are even higher in the first round, at 93.4%.\n\nThe last team to overcome a 2-0 deficit in a seven-game series was the 2022-2023 Golden State Warriors, who beat the Sacramento Kings in the first round.\n\nThat should give Jalen Brunson and the New York Knicks some confidence as they take this series on the road to the Wells Fargo Center.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "collin_loring@heavy.com", "name": "Collin Loring", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNY", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SNY"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De'Anthony_Melton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De'Anthony Melton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Center_(Philadelphia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2149918017-e1714013728282.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511650", "eventUri": "eng-9511650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 597, "textEnd": 605, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 1366, "textEnd": 1374}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

A man who would play 20 games for New York this season, and who led the Villanova Wildcats to their 2016 NCAA championship -- two years before Brunson would help bring Jay Wright's program back to the top of college basketball.\n\nThe divide between team and family has always been fuzzy for Brunson, who grew up around NBA teams his father, Rick, played and coached for. Leon Rose, who was his father's agent and then became Jalen's agent before becoming the Knicks' president of basketball operations, awarded Jalen a four-year, $104 million contract a year before this summer ceremony inside the Chicago Ritz-Carlton. The family affair in New York has only grown as the Knicks solidified their standing among the Eastern Conference contenders, clawing their way to 50 regular-season wins, the No. 2 seed and now a 2-0 series lead over reigning MVP Joel Embiid and his 76ers.\n\nFour months before Brunson's wedding day, the Knicks traded for his college teammate, Josh Hart. Three weeks before his wedding day, they used free agency to sign the Most Outstanding Player from Villanova's 2018 title sprint: Donte DiVincenzo. All have thrived during career-best seasons. Hart was the Knicks' crunchtime hero in Saturday's Game 1, drilling two 3-pointers in the final two minutes to clinch the victory over Philadelphia. Then it was DiVincenzo on Monday, driving and kicking to Brunson for a side-step long ball, only for DiVincenzo to splash the Game 2-winning triple following a physical steal by Brunson and Hart. And now they'll head to Wells Fargo Center for Games 3 and 4 on Thursday and Sunday, respectively. The very court that once doubled as these former Wildcats' home gym, while Villanova ran roughshod over the Big East and the rest of college basketball.\n\nBrunson, fittingly, was back on campus the afternoon of the 2023 trade deadline when New York acquired Hart. The program was retiring Brunson's jersey, the southpaw donning a navy Villanova letterman jacket, when his jaw fell to the floor. His current agent, Rose's eldest, Sam, lifted a phone before Brunson's face revealing the Knicks had landed his long-lost scrappy wing from the Trail Blazers. \"Oh sh**!\" Brunson howled. Footage of the point guard pacing with glee, raising his arms like a prizefighter, whipped around the internet like a tic-tac-toe Villanova possession. \"I have the video where he found out I was getting traded back to Portland,\" Arcidiacono told Yahoo Sports. \"He's on the highest of highs to then being like, 'Are you f***ing kidding me?'\"\n\nArcidiacono held a Knicks roster spot during each of the past three seasons, carving out some NBA staying power after going undrafted despite Villanova's 2016 title run. He even preceded Brunson's tenure in New York, first signing a series of 10-day contracts with the Knicks, yet became a necessary casualty in the four-team deal that netted Hart. Arcidiacono was still living out of The Nines hotel in Portland, nursing his sick fianc\u00e9e, Clare, in their temporary housing, when Brunson, Hart and the new-look Knicks came to town a bit later. He decided to meet his old friends just for dinner, only Brunson and his then-fianc\u00e9e, Ali, insisted they come upstairs to say hello. The whole thing proved to be a ruse, where the couple gifted Brunson's forever teammate a bottle of wine and asked him to officiate their big day.\n\nClare helped him, formulating the flow of Arcidiacono's speech and presentation -- with a necessary number of jokes at Brunson's expense. This group of Villanova players' incessant ribbing connects them more than any backdoor bounce pass ever could, so quick to comment on the size of Brunson's head that Knicks center Isaiah Hartenstein -- another Game 2 warrior against the Sixers -- has even joined the bit. When Madison Square Garden gave fans Brunson bobble-heads at their regular-season finale, Hartenstein announced to the pregame locker room he felt Brunson's cartoonish cranium still wasn't big enough. \"So I had to give a couple jabs to him,\" Arcidiacono said, \"but also uplift Ali and her moment of her wedding.\"\n\nWith Rose and Tom Thibodeau, New York's head coach, in attendance, Arcidiacano delivered his favorite one-liner about the signing that cemented Brunson in New York, the contract that flipped the trajectory of Knicks basketball toward the moon. \"And one massive overpay later ...\" Arcidiacono quipped. \"I was just giving Leon sh**, too,\" he said. Because back in July, even before another incredible leap this season, before this electrifying start to these playoffs, Brunson had played more than commensurate with the four-year, $156 million extension he becomes eligible to sign a few days shy of his one-year anniversary. Maybe then he'll pay Arcidiacono back the $75 fee for his application to conduct Brunson's ceremony, after Arcidiacano paid forward the ways of Wright's program, and its effects rippling through the Knicks to this very day.\n\nWhen Wright told Arcidiacono he needed the junior guard to host a big-time recruit from Chicago, the upperclassmen, the local kid credited as the first to bite as loud as the Wildcats coaches barked, shrugged off the incoming prospect's credentials. \"All right, how good can this dude be?\" Arcidiacono recalled. He jelled with Brunson off the court the night before, noting the unusual presence from someone three years younger at such a developmental age. By the time Villanova's players convened to play pickup that next morning, Brunson was already in the gym shooting. The tone of his visit shifted before the guys laced their sneakers. \"I felt like I had to get his respect,\" Arcidiacono said, \"for him to be like, 'Oh, I am gonna play here because this dude's gonna get me better. This is the type of culture that fits.'\"\n\nTherein lies the foundation, one of many thriving lineages winding through this era of Villanova basketball like some fraternal family tree. Even with freshmen chomping at the veterans' heels ahead of them, \"Each guy is passing the knowledge down to the guy who's going to fill their own role,\" said George Halcovage, then Villanova's director of basketball operations. Arcidiacono helped raise Brunson, emphasizing grizzled guards take charges as often as they set the table. \"That was huge for Jalen to have the captain and vet who showed us all how to play that style,\" said former Villanova guard Phil Booth. Brunson, in turn, helped raise Collin Gillespie, and now the latter holds a two-way contract with the mighty Denver Nuggets.\n\nThey tested the newbies, too, don't be fooled. Hart went after Mikal Bridges in practice, before he went after DiVincenzo, when he wasn't going after anyone else he deemed fit for a dustup. \"Our leaders were our best players,\" Gillespie said. \"Those were the guys that did all those little things and the younger guys had to follow suit.\" They scuff their knees on the floor and crash the glass with abandon, the type of hustle that fuels the fire Thibodeau breathes in New York, that can produce 12 players who logged NBA minutes this season -- fifth among all NCAA programs -- stretching back to Villanova's wiliest alumnus, Kyle Lowry, who has started for the Sixers in this very series. \"It's not for everybody. It was tough,\" said Bridges, now with New York's crosstown Brooklyn Nets. \"But it just helps you build mental toughness that you can take with you for life.\"\n\n\"The thing we do in our program is we work extremely hard on our craft,\" Lowry told Yahoo Sports. \"We only care about winning basketball. That's what three of the guys are doing in New York right now.\"\n\nLowry helped Randy Foye and Allen Ray reach the Elite Eight in 2006. Scottie Reynolds and Dante Cunningham brought Wright to the Final Four in 2009. The revival of the program, the arrival of a modern dynasty, began when Arcidiacono and Daniel Ochefu joined Villanova as freshmen in 2012.\n\nFor nearly a decade, Wright couldn't steer his team past March's opening weekend. The Wildcats even lost their second game of the 2015 NCAA tournament, falling as the top seed in their region, one year before they were cutting down nets. It was Arcidiacono and Ochefu who embraced Wright's philosophies and approach, spouting musings cheesy enough to add whiz into any sandwich. Wright preached his program would always play 40 minutes of Villanova basketball. He'd meticulously refine his players' pivots and footwork far beyond what their high school coaches taught, clamoring the whole way that no matter everyone's role being different, everyone's status was the same.\n\n\"It's very corny, but we bought in, right away,\" Arcidiacono said. \"We set the standard as to, if you didn't do it, if you didn't fall in line, you were gonna look stupid.\"\n\n\"Arch is just an epitome of what it means to be a leader and what it means to be a Villanova basketball player,\" said DiVincenzo. \"He embodied everything that Coach Wright stood for.\"\n\nPractices began with a series of 50 shots around the basket, flipping layups with each hand off the backboard like George Mikan, pushing floaters from the paint, then adding in free throws. Arcidiacono and Ochefu agreed they would make all 50 attempts, not just go through the motions, and the ritual was never the same again. Players permitted to launch 3-pointers during games went through a gauntlet of 100 triples every day from different spots on the floor, both moving and stationary. \"Just to live like a shooter,\" Halcovage said.\n\nIt all brewed into something special whenever they scrimmaged live, the first team and the second team colliding, two blocks of marble then emerging more refined. Brunson hounded Arcidiacono every day as a freshman throughout that 2015-16 season. Whenever Bridges, the interminable defender, picked Hart's pocket and started for a runaway bucket, there was Hart barreling after him. \"We'd see it coming, and we'd be yelling, 'No, Josh! No!'\" Wright told Yahoo Sports. \"And he would just crush him. Just take him out.\" Before that season even began, when alumni all flocked back to Villanova for the annual Summer Jam golf outing, Lowry led a team of professionals against the burgeoning roster as their August custom always goes. The program's retired greats observe the battle from the stands. \"It's not a celebrity game-type deal,\" said Ed Pinckney, who watched Arcidiacono and Hart spearhead the younger group to three wins in a best-of-five battle. But Lowry protested, and things quickly became a series of seven games instead.\n\n\"That's what made us so competitive,\" Arcidiacono said. \"'No, I'm tougher! I'm better!'\"\n\n\"I beat they ass,\" Lowry told Yahoo Sports. \"I won 4, they won 3. I ain't never lost a Summer Jam.\"\n\nThose struggles have fostered deep connections, reaching back to Villanova's heyday. Pinckney, the leading scorer on the late Rollie Massimino's 1985 NCAA champion Wildcats, flew to Houston for the 2016 final against North Carolina alongside Massimino's grandson, Tommy, both men working for respective NBA teams but pulled by brotherhood to watch their program make history. Lowry and other former players stuffed into seats behind Nova's bench. \"I remember analysts saying that we didn't have pros on our team,\" Brunson told Yahoo Sports. \"I think the fact that anyone kind of doubted us at some point in time, individually, kinda fueled us a little bit.\"\n\nWho was it at the end but Arcidiacono, taking a screen from Ocehfu at midcourt, just before time expired, then handing off to Kris Jenkins for the title-clinching bomb. And there was Brunson and Bridges sprinting from the bench, tackling Arcidiacono to the hardwood floor as confetti fell like snowflakes. \"We both got up and started running onto the court,\" Brunson said, \"because we knew it was good.\"\n\nThey were primed to contend again the following spring. \"Nobody really remembers, obviously, people don't remember us. We didn't win that '17 year,\" said Brunson, flashing Villanova's victory-or-nothing barometer. \"But losing also helped us too.\" Hart had tested the NBA Draft waters and decided to return for a chance at going back-to-back. Wright's staff already agreed Brunson was the most college-ready player to ever enter its program, but his daily approach, coupled with Hart's last hurrah mentality, took the baton from Arcidiacono and Ochefu and ratcheted up the intensity. \"Those two, every day, how they brought it, was everything,\" said Halcovage.\n\nBut Booth, who scored 20 against the Tar Heels, never recovered from a knee injury to contribute anything meaningful. Omari Spellman was supposed to begin his freshman year, yet was ruled ineligible. And once again, in the dreaded second round, Villanova ran into a buzzsaw of an experienced Wisconsin team. The Wildcats' attention to detail waned for one critical moment that still sticks with them. Bridges was defending Nigel Hayes, whom Villanova had scouted as a one-direction driver. \"He was going right,\" Brunson said. \"If he got the ball, he was going right. We all knew he wanted to go right.\" Bridges did the initial job, shutting off Hayes' preferred lane with the game tied and only 14 seconds remaining. Brunson, DiVincenzo and Eric Paschall all showed help. For an instant, they had him surrounded. \"So we're all like we're good, we got him,\" Brunson said. Hayes, though, managed to take one dribble left, then whirled right back over his intended shoulder and down the baseline for an easy bucket. \"We're all just like, we knew it was coming and he still did it,\" said Brunson. \"Coach definitely reminded us about that for a while.\"\n\nHart left for the NBA, drafted No. 17 by the Los Angeles Lakers that June, but an added fervor heated each and every one of Villanova's practices that 2017-18 campaign. Assistants spewed junk to get rises out of certain players. Wright understood when to push particular guys' buttons. \"We knew what we had to do after we lost,\" Brunson said. \"We were all ready to go. We were all fired up.\" Brunson would torment Gillespie in practice. \"Jalen was just like, 'I'm gonna cook you,'\" said Booth. Wright often lifted the bar for his team's success higher than actually possible. \"Even if you might do the right thing, it was still a turnover,\" said Bridges. The coach mixed and matched lineups, with DiVincenzo dubbed as their sixth starter, and Wright would try to pin him against Brunson, tightly bound from sharing a dorm together as freshmen, and therefore coiled to spring as hard as they could directly at their closest ally. \"And they'd want to kill each other,\" Wright said.\n\nOn one loose ball drill, Wright had to stop practice as Brunson and DiVincenzo both sprawled along the floor and wouldn't quit. \"They were basically tackling each other into the wall out of bounds,\" Gillespie said.\n\n\"And if you don't [compete], we were so good that you'd get embarrassed,\" DiVincenzo said. \"Everybody has a line of pride. And it just made practice that much better.\"\n\nThe players found practice harder than their actual games, only dropping four matchups all year -- during conference play -- and besting each of their March Madness foes by 12 points or more. Villanova poured in a record 76 triples during their run through the NCAA tournament. And they would simply go back to their hotel rooms, watch the film, then reconvene in a conference area for the team's 9 p.m. snack. Onto the next game, laser focused, as corny as Wright wanted it to be.\n\nBrunson offered another cliche: \"We took it one day at a time,\" he told Yahoo Sports. \"That was really important for us.\"\n\nIt won't be difficult to find that same approach right where he honed it inside Wells Fargo Center. Brunson, Hart and DiVincenzo are leading a Knicks group that believes it can and will, because they have. Wright tries his best to keep them hungry as much as humble, like when Bridges was starting for Phoenix during the 2021 NBA Finals, like whenever Brunson went off for 40 points during his All-Star campaign. That's when he sends a text reminding them of their roots. \"I'll hit them once they go on a tear,\" Wright said. Even if he thinks they don't want to hear it, hoping they'll at least tap back on iMessage with a heart or a thumbs up.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

Who could forget those legendary teams? Second, what foot does Jalen Brunson have to stand on talking about Temple? You were supposed to go to Temple until your dad used Patrick Ewing's name while he was trying to get a rub and tug.\n\nFor anyone that wants to do some pre-game reading via Mike Kern at the Inky:\n\nTHE DETAILS of the charges against former Temple standout Rick Brunson - who, according to sources, was about to be offered a job as an assistant coach on Fran Dunphy's staff - have been released.\n\nHe was arrested and charged late last month with attempted sexual assault and aggravated battery after an April 2 incident with a massage therapist at a Chicago athletic center.\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times reported there was a confrontation during that appointment, resulting in a series of sex-based criminal charges. Brunson, 42, is accused of touching the masseuse inappropriately, police said.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune first reported yesterday that, according to Vernon Hills, Ill., police records, Brunson used the name of former NBA great Patrick Ewing to book a massage with the alleged victim, a fitness-center employee who had given him 10 to 20 massages over a 3-year period when he was \"always using his own name.\"\n\nAccording to police, the victim said she was \"surprised\" to see Brunson when she walked into the massage room. She said Brunson acknowleged to her that he had booked the massage under a different name, because she had told him in 2013 that she would not massage him anymore. The two had exchanged text messages over the holidays in December, according to the police documents. Still, she \"reluctantly\" agreed to massage him since he was already there. And already undressed.\n\nThe woman complained to her manager several days later, prompting the human resources department to investigate. Brunson's club membership was revoked on April 9.\n\nTemple officials declined to comment. So has Brunson, despite several attempts. While sources said that no official offer had been made, indications were he was about to be hired.\n\nWe were so close to climax. There were rumors Brunson was expected to be the successor to Fran Dunphy. Instead Brunson opens up his recruitment and sticks it to the Owls and signs with Villanova. It's a dirty, dirty world out there:\n\nThe Knicks then took a page out of Temple's playbook. When Jalen was a free agent they hired Rick for a Knicks bench spot AFTER he was forced to resign from the Timberwolves because a media member accused him of misconduct. The Knicks ended up losing a second round pick for tampering.", "source": {"uri": "crossingbroad.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crossing Broad"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_pagan@crossingbroad.com", "name": "Kyle Pagan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temple Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liacouras_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liacouras Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Dunphy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fran Dunphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sun-Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Owls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temple Owls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Massage_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Massage Equipment", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Massage_Therapy_and_Bodywork", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Massage Therapy and Bodywork", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Hip-Hop", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Hip-Hop", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.crossingbroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/nba-rick-brunson-1200x628.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511650", "eventUri": "eng-9511650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-02", "textStart": 999, "textEnd": 1006}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-09", "textStart": 2241, "textEnd": 2248}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

After showcasing an elite level of play in his first year with the team, Brunson managed to elevate his level of play once again this season. In addition to improving on his individual averages, he also led the team to the second-best record in the East despite injuries to key players.\n\nAs Brunson showed, however, even though Mitchell Robinson and Julius Randle were both out for long stretches, he wasn't going to let that stop the Knicks. Although he continued to impress, and earn plenty of praise from fans and analysts around the league, Brunson was never a serious contender in MVP talks.\n\nWhile speaking on a recent episode of 7PM In Brooklyn, Starbury argued Jalen Brunson's case, explaining that his play is right there with the best in the league.\n\n\"You have mentioned that Jalen Brunson deserves he should be in the MVP talk. He's in the space. He got the right mind frame as far as doing what's needed to push my team forward.\n\n\"Not only is he pushing his team forward, but he's pushing them forward with him playing the game the way how he plays it, which is the right way, and they're winning, and he has his teammates gathering around him doing it. Even with Randall out, that is MVP style stuff.\"\n\nLooking at the stats of Jalen Brunson compared to the top MVP contenders\n\nAs previously mentioned, Jalen Brunson impressed this season with his individual play, and managed to elevate his game to the next level. On the heels of Stephan Marbury's comments about why Brunson deserved to be in the MVP race, let's take a look at the stats for Brunson in comparison to the three MVP contenders.\n\nThis season, Jalen Brunson averaged a career-high 28.7 points per game, over 35.4 minutes per game. The number was an impressive jump from the 24.0ppg he averaged last season in 35.0mpg. In addition, this season also saw Brunson improve on his assist numbers, jumping from 6.2apg to 6.7apg.\n\nIn the case of Nikola Jokic, he took saw his numbers jump from last season in key stats, going from 24.5ppg to 26.4ppg. His rebounding numbers also took a jump, going from 11.8rpg to 12.4rpg, as the Nuggets captured the second seed, much like the Knicks.\n\nIn the case of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the OKC Thunder star saw his ppg average drop slightly from 31.4ppg to 30.1ppg. Despite that, his rebounding numbers also saw an increase with a jump from 4.8rpg to 5.5rpg. This was also seen in his assist numbers which climbed from 5.5apg to 6.2apg.\n\nOf course, in the case of SGA, he and the OKC Thunder finished first in the Western Conference, giving further strength to his case. With the MVP award expected to be announced sooner rather than later, it will be interesting to see who winds up being presented with the league's highest honor.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "evan_bell@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Evan Bell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephon_Marbury", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephon Marbury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Hip-Hop", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Hip-Hop", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Extreme_Sports/Base_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Extreme Sports/Base Jumping", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Jumps", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Jumps", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/04/23074786-1714057446.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511650", "eventUri": "eng-9511650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

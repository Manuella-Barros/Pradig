Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx said, \u201cAmericans are not easily fooled by what the president is doing \u2013 they are incredibly smart and discerning.\u201d Five months ahead of his showdown at the ballot box with former President Donald Trump, the 81-year-old Biden on Tuesday issued an executive order with restrictions on migrants seeking asylum at America\u2019s border with Mexico. In the days since, Bill Melugin of Fox News at the border in California has reported that the number of crossings has only increased. His interviews with those crossing indicate that people are coming from different countries, with some even separated from the U.S. by oceans. Foxx, who took office in January 2005 and bids for her 11th term in November, said Biden\u2019s plan would still permit 1.8 million new arrivals per year. That, she said, is \u201c4.5 times the number of illegal aliens that were encountered at our nation\u2019s southern border in fiscal year 2020.\u201d In her weekly letter to constituents, Foxx wrote, \u201cClearly, this is not a \u2018crackdown\u2019 as the administration wants people to believe. As I have shared with you previously, there have been more than 60 instances in which the administration has undermined America\u2019s border security.\u201d She gave examples of halting construction of the border wall; terminating the Remain in Mexico program; and \u201cnixing the expulsions of illegal aliens under Title 42.\u201d North Carolina\u2019s congressional delegation includes a Democrat, Rep. Don Davis, who said the step was overdue. Foxx\u2019s other Republican colleagues roundly criticized Biden\u2019s move as an election strategy. \u201cWe should return to President Trump\u2019s border policies immediately to solve this border catastrophe,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that simple.\u201d Her letter closes with a Ronald Reagan quote, \u201cA nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation.\u201d", "summary": "(The Center Square) \u2013 President Joe Biden gave \u201cproof positive\u201d that he \u201cowns this border catastrophe, and he\u2019s had the authority to secure the border the entire time,\u201d says a 20th-year North Carolina congresswoman.

They offer truer blacks, enhanced colors, and impressive contrast, making them a popular choice for smartphones, smartwatches, TVs, and monitors. However, OLEDs still suffer from burn-in, although it is less common now than it used to be. Thankfully, researchers believe that they have found a breakthrough solution that could make OLED burn-in a thing of the past.\n\nAccording to researchers from the University of Ca"}, "location": null, "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/Brain_Teasers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/Brain Teasers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "articleCounts": {"eng": 5}, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 448848000, "relevance": 1}

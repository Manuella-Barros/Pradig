The youth assembly raised concerns about certain individuals within Tinubu's administration, who might be trying to incite disorder in the State. The letter, dated May 25, 2024, was also sent to the United Nations Office in Abuja, the European Union Embassy, Economic Community of West African State, ECOWAS, in Abuja, the US Embassy in Abuja, the British High Commission in Abuja, the US Congress, and the European Union. Signed by the President and the Secretary General, Dr. Ali Idris and Dr. Garba Abdulhafiz, respectively, the letter expressed worries about the recent changes to Kano State\u2019s emirate law, which some are exploiting to create unrest. They warned that any federal interference could lead to unrest. \u201cAs representatives of the Northern Youth Assembly, with chapters in the Nineteen Northern States and Abuja, we feel compelled to inform you of the developments regarding the Kano Emirate,\u201d the letter stated. They emphasized Nigeria\u2019s federal structure, which grants state assemblies the authority to legislate for their states\u2019 welfare, citing the 2019 amendment to Kano\u2019s Emirate Councils Laws and the recent repeal of the same law by the current assembly. The youths also accused certain officials, including National Security Adviser Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, of plotting to forcibly reinstate the ousted Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, using federal security forces under the guise of a court order. \u201cThis blatant encroachment on constitutional democratic practices undermines sub-national authority and constitutes interference in their constitutional powers,\u201d they said. The youths warned that such actions could damage Tinubu\u2019s reputation as a democrat and provoke unrest among Kano\u2019s 20 million residents, potentially affecting the entire Northern region. \u201cWe urge you to maintain peace and respect democratic institutions, as any attempt to disrupt Kano\u2019s stability could reflect poorly on your administration and invite animosity from the people of Kano and Northern Nigeria,\u201d the letter concluded.", "summary": "<img width=\"1200\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Collage-Maker-23-Jun-2023-06-08-AM-552.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Collage-Maker-23-Jun-2023-06-08-AM-552.jpg 1200w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Collage-Maker-23-Jun-2023-06-08-AM-552-300x175.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Collage-Maker-23-Jun-2023-06-08-AM-552-1024x597.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><p>The Northern Youth Assembly, Majalisar Matasan Arewa, has written to President Bola Tinubu, bringing his attention to the recent tension in Kano State.

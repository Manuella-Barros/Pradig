Here&#8217;s what an expert has to say", "text": "The medical fraternity has been neck deep in research to find ways to alleviate worries for diabetics. While injections and insulin shots can be expensive, altering one's diet is a more affordable alternative. With diet culture gaining traction in the health and wellness industry, we explore the 5:2 fasting method. To understand its potential benefits, indianexpress.com spoke to Dr Aasim Maldar, consultant endocrinologist and diabetologist at PD Hinduja Hospital & MRC, Mahim, Mumbai. \"The 5:2 fasting method involves following a normal diet for five days a week and fasting for the other two days. The fasting days can be any two days, as long as there is at least one non-fasting day between them,\" said Maldar. How can it help regulate diabetes type 2? \"Studies have shown that the 5:2 fasting method can improve fasting plasma glucose levels and overall diabetes control, but it is unclear if these benefits are above those gained from weight loss. A six-month study showed similar weight loss and maintenance with 5:2 fasting and a daily low-calorie diet,\" he said. \"Weight loss, in turn, improves glycemic control. We need more long-term, robust studies to confirm if there are any direct benefits to glycemic control and cardiac health,\" said Maldar. Is this method safe? Maldar mentioned that while the 5:2 fasting method may be an alternative for short-term weight loss, it isn\u2019t recommended for long-term use, especially for people with chronic illnesses. \"It should not be practiced by growing children, adults with comorbidities like kidney, liver, or heart issues, elderly people, and pregnant women. Additionally, Type 2 diabetics on insulin or multiple oral medications should refrain from this diet,\" he said. He suggested that a daily calorie-restricted, balanced diet should be your go-to method. If that is not possible due to work commitments or travel, then you may consider 5:2 fasting. Things to keep in mind \"Usually, a non-fasting day will involve a normal diet with whatever food a person usually eats. Fasting days, however, consist of a very low-calorie diet, around 400 to 500 calories,\" Maldar said. On non-fasting days, one should avoid eating anything and everything; it should still be a balanced diet. According to him, diet advice should always be personalised, as \"one size doesn\u2019t fit all.\" Always consult your doctor, nutritionist, and healthcare team before making any drastic changes to your dietary patterns.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/5-2-fasting-method-control-type-2-diabetes-diet-health-9411446/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/diabetes.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:00:07", "author": "Lifestyle Desk", "authors": ["Lifestyle Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.005}

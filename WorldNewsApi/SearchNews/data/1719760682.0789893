Although the small red animals may look cute, they are known for destruction and can be a real nuisance - especially when looking for food. When it comes to deterring foxes, huge care must be taken to ensure you don't harm the animals. According to the SSPCA, foxes are protected under the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996, so it's an offence to cause them unnecessary harm or suffering. Because of this, natural deterrents are encouraged instead. And Mrs Hinch fans on social media say there's one very common and cheap kitchen ingredient that can do the trick that you probably use regularly during cooking. One woman recently took to the Mrs Hinch Cleaning Tips Facebook page to explain how she'd been struggling to deal with a fox problem in her garden and was keen to know how to keep them away. She posted: \"Hello, I have a tiny back yard/ garden, but constantly visited by foxes, they keep digging up all my bulbs and using it as a toilet. I live in a terrace with a back lane. Any tips on what I can do to stop them coming into the garden. Thank you.\" As always, the post was soon inundated with suggestions from fellow group members on how to tackle the issue. Several people suggested using chilli powder as a natural deterrent, as foxes are not a fan of the smell. One person said: \"I used hot chilli powder.. just sprinkle it round. trust me they won't come back though you will have to renew it every so often.\" Another said: \"Chilli powder definitely works but needs repeatedly done for a little while.\" According to Shield Pest Control, the chilli pepper produces a 'potent' smell that will repel foxes. You can either sprinkle some in the garden or boil up a chilli pepper with some garlic cloves before blending the mixture and spraying it around your plants. If you don't already have chilli powder at home, you can pick some up from Asda for as little as 85p. You can also get a small jar for \u00a31 from Tesco or \u00a31.10 from Sainsburys. The SSPCA also advises removing any access to food sources in your garden if you want to drive foxes away. You can do this by using securely sealed bins and composters that foxes can't get into, keeping everything clean and tidy, and adding in fencing or prickly plants.

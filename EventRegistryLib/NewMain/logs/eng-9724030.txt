Besides the three battleground states, grants also will go to EV facilities in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nThe grants cover a broad range of the automotive supply chain, including parts for electric motorcycles and school buses, hybrid powertrains, heavy-duty commercial truck batteries and electric SUVs, the White House said.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\n\"Building a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers,'' President Joe Biden said in a statement. \"This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia -- by helping auto companies retool, reboot and rehire in the same factories and communities.''\n\nThe grants, paid for by the landmark 2022 climate law, will help deliver on his commitment to ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers, Biden said.\n\n\"Workers that were left behind by my predecessor are now making a comeback with the support of my policies, including the conversion grants my administration is announcing today,'' the Democratic president said.\n\nThe grant announcement comes as Biden rejects calls to step aside after a disastrous debate performance last month. Biden, 81, has acknowledged his poor performance but has brushed it off as a \"bad night,'' even as many congressional Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have declined to give him a full vote of confidence.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has maintained a tight grip on the Republican party, even after becoming the first former president to be convicted of a felony.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,'' said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor. Even as competitors like China invest heavily in electric vehicles, the grants announced Thursday will help \"ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive -- and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,\" Granholm said.\n\nThe new grants complement $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office, Granholm and other officials said.\n\nAwards are subject to negotiations to ensure that commitments to workers and communities are met, officials said. The Energy Department also will complete environmental reviews before money is awarded later this year.\n\nIf awards are completed as planned, the selected projects would create more than 2,900 jobs and help ensure that about 15,000 union workers are retained across all 11 facilities, the White House said. The grants come after successful union organizing drives from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Fort Valley, Georgia, the White House said.\n\n\"The president will not take his foot off the pedal when it comes to supporting the U.S. auto industry,'' said White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard.\n\nTransportation accounts for the single largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution and Biden has made electric vehicles a key part of his climate agenda.\n\n\"Not only are we delivering new sources of clean transit -- that iconic yellow school bus going green -- but we're also delivering to the American people options to save ... thousands of dollars of fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a vehicle'' by going electric, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said.\n\nCompanies slated for awards include Blue Bird Body Co., which will receive nearly $80 million to convert a Georgia site previously used to make diesel-powered motor homes to produce electric school buses. Fiat Chrysler will receive nearly $335 million to convert an idled assembly plant in Illinois to assemble electric vehicles, and $250 million in a separate grant to convert an Indiana transmission plant to make electric drive modules for EVs.\n\nGeneral Motors, meanwhile, will receive $500 million to convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM production lines will further support and benefit from ongoing investments in a U.S. battery supply chain, accelerating the commercialization of advanced, affordable EVs, the White House said.\n\nHarley-Davidson will receive $89 million to expand a facility in York, Pennsylvania to make electric motorcycles, and Volvo Group will receive $208 million to upgrade three manufacturing facilities that supply and build Mack and Volvo-branded heavy-duty trucks. The plants are located in Macungie, Pennsylvania; Dublin, Virginia; and Hagerstown, Maryland.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Besides the three battleground states, grants also will go to EV facilities in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nThe grants cover a broad range of the automotive supply chain, including parts for electric motorcycles and school buses, hybrid powertrains, heavy-duty commercial truck batteries and electric SUVs, the White House said.\n\n\"Building a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers,'' President Joe Biden said in a statement. \"This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia -- by helping auto companies retool, reboot and rehire in the same factories and communities.''\n\nThe grants, paid for by the landmark 2022 climate law, will help deliver on his commitment to ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers, Biden said.\n\n\"Workers that were left behind by my predecessor are now making a comeback with the support of my policies, including the conversion grants my administration is announcing today,'' the Democratic president said.\n\nThe grant announcement comes as Biden rejects calls to step aside after a disastrous debate performance last month.

Even as competitors like China invest heavily in electric vehicles, the grants announced Thursday will help \"ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive -- and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,\" Granholm said.\n\nThe new grants complement $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office, Granholm and other officials said.\n\nAwards are subject to negotiations to ensure that commitments to workers and communities are met, officials said. The Energy Department also will complete environmental reviews before money is awarded later this year.\n\nIf awards are completed as planned, the selected projects would create more than 2,900 jobs and help ensure that about 15,000 union workers are retained across all 11 facilities, the White House said. The grants come after successful union organizing drives from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Fort Valley, Georgia, the White House said.\n\n\"The president will not take his foot off the pedal when it comes to supporting the U.S. auto industry,'' said White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard.\n\nTransportation accounts for the single largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution and Biden has made electric vehicles a key part of his climate agenda.\n\n\"Not only are we delivering new sources of clean transit -- that iconic yellow school bus going green -- but we're also delivering to the American people options to save ... thousands of dollars of fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a vehicle'' by going electric, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said.\n\nCompanies slated for awards include Blue Bird Body Co., which will receive nearly $80 million to convert a Georgia site previously used to make diesel-powered motor homes to produce electric school buses. Fiat Chrysler will receive nearly $335 million to convert an idled assembly plant in Illinois to assemble electric vehicles, and $250 million in a separate grant to convert an Indiana transmission plant to make electric drive modules for EVs.\n\nGeneral Motors, meanwhile, will receive $500 million to convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM production lines will further support and benefit from ongoing investments in a U.S. battery supply chain, accelerating the commercialization of advanced, affordable EVs, the White House said.\n\nHarley-Davidson will receive $89 million to expand a facility in York, Pennsylvania to make electric motorcycles, and Volvo Group will receive $208 million to upgrade three manufacturing facilities that supply and build Mack and Volvo-branded heavy-duty trucks.

The Biden administration is awarding nearly $2 billion in grants to help restart or expand electric vehicle manufacturing and assembly sites in eight states, including the presidential battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia. Grants totaling $1.7 billion will be issued by the Energy Department to create or retain thousands of union jobs and support auto-based communities that have long driven the U.S. economy, the White House said Thursday, July 11, 2024.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration is awarding nearly $2 billion in grants to help restart or expand electric vehicle manufacturing and assembly sites in eight states, including the presidential battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia.\n\nThe Energy Department will issue grants totaling $1.7 billion to create or retain thousands of union jobs and support auto-based communities that have long driven the U.S. economy, the White House said Thursday. Besides the three battleground states, grants also will go to EV facilities in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nThe grants cover a broad range of the automotive supply chain, including parts for electric motorcycles and school buses, hybrid powertrains, heavy-duty commercial truck batteries and electric SUVs, the White House said.\n\n\"Building a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers,'' President Joe Biden said in a statement. \"This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia -- by helping auto companies retool, reboot and rehire in the same factories and communities.''\n\nThe grants, paid for by the landmark 2022 climate law, will help deliver on his commitment to ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers, Biden said.\n\n\"Workers that were left behind by my predecessor are now making a comeback with the support of my policies, including the conversion grants my administration is announcing today,'' the Democratic president said.\n\nThe grant announcement comes as Biden rejects calls to step aside after a disastrous debate performance last month. Biden, 81, has acknowledged his poor performance but has brushed it off as a \"bad night,'' even as many congressional Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have declined to give him a full vote of confidence.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has maintained a tight grip on the Republican party, even after becoming the first former president to be convicted of a felony.\n\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,'' said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor. Even as competitors like China invest heavily in electric vehicles, the grants announced Thursday will help \"ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive -- and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,\" Granholm said.\n\nThe new grants complement $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office, Granholm and other officials said.\n\nAwards are subject to negotiations to ensure that commitments to workers and communities are met, officials said. The Energy Department also will complete environmental reviews before money is awarded later this year.\n\nIf awards are completed as planned, the selected projects would create more than 2,900 jobs and help ensure that about 15,000 union workers are retained across all 11 facilities, the White House said. The grants come after successful union organizing drives from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Fort Valley, Georgia, the White House said.\n\n\"The president will not take his foot off the pedal when it comes to supporting the U.S. auto industry,'' said White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard.\n\nTransportation accounts for the single largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution and Biden has made electric vehicles a key part of his climate agenda.\n\n\"Not only are we delivering new sources of clean transit -- that iconic yellow school bus going green -- but we're also delivering to the American people options to save ... thousands of dollars of fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a vehicle'' by going electric, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said.\n\nCompanies slated for awards include Blue Bird Body Co., which will receive nearly $80 million to convert a Georgia site previously used to make diesel-powered motor homes to produce electric school buses. Fiat Chrysler will receive nearly $335 million to convert an idled assembly plant in Illinois to assemble electric vehicles, and $250 million in a separate grant to convert an Indiana transmission plant to make electric drive modules for EVs.\n\nGeneral Motors, meanwhile, will receive $500 million to convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM production lines will further support and benefit from ongoing investments in a U.S. battery supply chain, accelerating the commercialization of advanced, affordable EVs, the White House said.\n\nHarley-Davidson will receive $89 million to expand a facility in York, Pennsylvania to make electric motorcycles, and Volvo Group will receive $208 million to upgrade three manufacturing facilities that supply and build Mack and Volvo-branded heavy-duty trucks.

Besides the three battleground states, grants also will go to EV facilities in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nThe grants cover a broad range of the automotive supply chain, including parts for electric motorcycles and school buses, hybrid powertrains, heavy-duty commercial truck batteries and electric SUVs, the White House said.\n\n\"Building a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers,'' President Joe Biden said in a statement. \"This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia -- by helping auto companies retool, reboot and rehire in the same factories and communities.''\n\nThe grants, paid for by the landmark 2022 climate law, will help deliver on his commitment to ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers, Biden said.\n\n\"Workers that were left behind by my predecessor are now making a comeback with the support of my policies, including the conversion grants my administration is announcing today,'' the Democratic president said.\n\nThe grant announcement comes as Biden rejects calls to step aside after a disastrous debate performance last month. Biden, 81, has acknowledged his poor performance but has brushed it off as a \"bad night,'' even as many congressional Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have declined to give him a full vote of confidence.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has maintained a tight grip on the Republican party, even after becoming the first former president to be convicted of a felony.\n\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,'' said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor. Even as competitors like China invest heavily in electric vehicles, the grants announced Thursday will help \"ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive -- and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,\" Granholm said.\n\nThe new grants complement $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office, Granholm and other officials said.\n\nAwards are subject to negotiations to ensure that commitments to workers and communities are met, officials said. The Energy Department also will complete environmental reviews before money is awarded later this year.\n\nIf awards are completed as planned, the selected projects would create more than 2,900 jobs and help ensure that about 15,000 union workers are retained across all 11 facilities, the White House said. The grants come after successful union organizing drives from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Fort Valley, Georgia, the White House said.\n\n\"The president will not take his foot off the pedal when it comes to supporting the U.S. auto industry,'' said White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard.\n\nTransportation accounts for the single largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution and Biden has made electric vehicles a key part of his climate agenda.\n\n\"Not only are we delivering new sources of clean transit -- that iconic yellow school bus going green -- but we're also delivering to the American people options to save ... thousands of dollars of fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a vehicle'' by going electric, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said.\n\nCompanies slated for awards include Blue Bird Body Co., which will receive nearly $80 million to convert a Georgia site previously used to make diesel-powered motor homes to produce electric school buses. Fiat Chrysler will receive nearly $335 million to convert an idled assembly plant in Illinois to assemble electric vehicles, and $250 million in a separate grant to convert an Indiana transmission plant to make electric drive modules for EVs.\n\nGeneral Motors, meanwhile, will receive $500 million to convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM production lines will further support and benefit from ongoing investments in a U.S. battery supply chain, accelerating the commercialization of advanced, affordable EVs, the White House said.\n\nHarley-Davidson will receive $89 million to expand a facility in York, Pennsylvania to make electric motorcycles, and Volvo Group will receive $208 million to upgrade three manufacturing facilities that supply and build Mack and Volvo-branded heavy-duty trucks. The plants are located in Macungie, Pennsylvania; Dublin, Virginia; and Hagerstown, Maryland.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Besides the three battleground states, grants also will go to EV facilities in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nThe grants cover a broad range of the automotive supply chain, including parts for electric motorcycles and school buses, hybrid powertrains, heavy-duty commercial truck batteries and electric SUVs, the White House said.\n\n\"Building a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers,'' President Joe Biden said in a statement. \"This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia -- by helping auto companies retool, reboot and rehire in the same factories and communities.''\n\nThe grants, paid for by the landmark 2022 climate law, will help deliver on his commitment to ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers, Biden said.\n\n\"Workers that were left behind by my predecessor are now making a comeback with the support of my policies, including the conversion grants my administration is announcing today,'' the Democratic president said.\n\nRELATED STORY| Two-thirds of all cars sold in US must be electric by 2032\n\nThe grant announcement comes as Biden rejects calls to step aside after a disastrous debate performance last month.

Even as competitors like China invest heavily in electric vehicles, the grants announced Thursday will help \"ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive -- and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,\" Granholm said.\n\nThe new grants complement $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office, Granholm and other officials said.\n\nAwards are subject to negotiations to ensure that commitments to workers and communities are met, officials said. The Energy Department also will complete environmental reviews before money is awarded later this year.\n\nIf awards are completed as planned, the selected projects would create more than 2,900 jobs and help ensure that about 15,000 union workers are retained across all 11 facilities, the White House said. The grants come after successful union organizing drives from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Fort Valley, Georgia, the White House said.\n\n\"The president will not take his foot off the pedal when it comes to supporting the U.S. auto industry,'' said White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard.\n\nRELATED STORY | Here are the top-ranked electric and hybrid vehicles of 2024\n\nTransportation accounts for the single largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution and Biden has made electric vehicles a key part of his climate agenda.\n\n\"Not only are we delivering new sources of clean transit -- that iconic yellow school bus going green -- but we're also delivering to the American people options to save ... thousands of dollars of fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a vehicle'' by going electric, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said.\n\nCompanies slated for awards include Blue Bird Body Co., which will receive nearly $80 million to convert a Georgia site previously used to make diesel-powered motor homes to produce electric school buses. Fiat Chrysler will receive nearly $335 million to convert an idled assembly plant in Illinois to assemble electric vehicles, and $250 million in a separate grant to convert an Indiana transmission plant to make electric drive modules for EVs.\n\nGeneral Motors, meanwhile, will receive $500 million to convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM production lines will further support and benefit from ongoing investments in a U.S. battery supply chain, accelerating the commercialization of advanced, affordable EVs, the White House said.\n\nHarley-Davidson will receive $89 million to expand a facility in York, Pennsylvania to make electric motorcycles, and Volvo Group will receive $208 million to upgrade three manufacturing facilities that supply and build Mack and Volvo-branded heavy-duty trucks.

The grants come after successful union organizing drives from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Fort Valley, Georgia, the White House said.\n\n\"The president will not take his foot off the pedal when it comes to supporting the U.S. auto industry,\" said White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard.\n\nTransportation accounts for the single largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution and Biden has made electric vehicles a key part of his climate agenda.\n\n\"Not only are we delivering new sources of clean transit -- that iconic yellow school bus going green -- but we're also delivering to the American people options to save ... thousands of dollars of fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a vehicle\" by going electric, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said.\n\nCompanies slated for awards include Blue Bird Body Co., which will receive nearly $80 million to convert a Georgia site previously used to make diesel-powered motor homes to produce electric school buses. Fiat Chrysler will receive nearly $335 million to convert an idled assembly plant in Illinois to assemble electric vehicles, and $250 million in a separate grant to convert an Indiana transmission plant to make electric drive modules for EVs.\n\nGeneral Motors, meanwhile, will receive $500 million to convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM production lines will further support and benefit from ongoing investments in a U.S. battery supply chain, accelerating the commercialization of advanced, affordable EVs, the White House said.\n\nHarley-Davidson will receive $89 million to expand a facility in York, Pennsylvania to make electric motorcycles, and Volvo Group will receive $208 million to upgrade three manufacturing facilities that supply and build Mack and Volvo-branded heavy-duty trucks.

Biden, 81, has acknowledged his poor performance but has brushed it off as a \"bad night,'' even as many congressional Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have declined to give him a full vote of confidence.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has maintained a tight grip on the Republican party, even after becoming the first former president to be convicted of a felony.\n\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,'' said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor. Even as competitors like China invest heavily in electric vehicles, the grants announced Thursday will help \"ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive -- and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,\" Granholm said.\n\nThe new grants complement $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office, Granholm and other officials said.\n\nAwards are subject to negotiations to ensure that commitments to workers and communities are met, officials said. The Energy Department also will complete environmental reviews before money is awarded later this year.\n\nIf awards are completed as planned, the selected projects would create more than 2,900 jobs and help ensure that about 15,000 union workers are retained across all 11 facilities, the White House said. The grants come after successful union organizing drives from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Fort Valley, Georgia, the White House said.\n\n\"The president will not take his foot off the pedal when it comes to supporting the U.S. auto industry,'' said White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard.\n\nTransportation accounts for the single largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution and Biden has made electric vehicles a key part of his climate agenda.\n\n\"Not only are we delivering new sources of clean transit -- that iconic yellow school bus going green -- but we're also delivering to the American people options to save ... thousands of dollars of fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a vehicle'' by going electric, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said.\n\nCompanies slated for awards include Blue Bird Body Co., which will receive nearly $80 million to convert a Georgia site previously used to make diesel-powered motor homes to produce electric school buses. Fiat Chrysler will receive nearly $335 million to convert an idled assembly plant in Illinois to assemble electric vehicles, and $250 million in a separate grant to convert an Indiana transmission plant to make electric drive modules for EVs.\n\nGeneral Motors, meanwhile, will receive $500 million to convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM production lines will further support and benefit from ongoing investments in a U.S. battery supply chain, accelerating the commercialization of advanced, affordable EVs, the White House said.",

Besides the three battleground states, grants also will go to EV facilities in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nThe grants cover a broad range of the automotive supply chain, including parts for electric motorcycles and school buses, hybrid powertrains, heavy-duty commercial truck batteries and electric SUVs, the White House said.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Now what? Marketplace dining opening at Hard Rock Bristol\n\n\"Building a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers,'' President Joe Biden said in a statement. \"This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia -- by helping auto companies retool, reboot and rehire in the same factories and communities.''\n\nThe grants, paid for by the landmark 2022 climate law, will help deliver on his commitment to ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers, Biden said.\n\n\"Workers that were left behind by my predecessor are now making a comeback with the support of my policies, including the conversion grants my administration is announcing today,'' the Democratic president said.\n\nThe grant announcement comes as Biden rejects calls to step aside after a disastrous debate performance last month. Biden, 81, has acknowledged his poor performance but has brushed it off as a \"bad night,'' even as many congressional Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have declined to give him a full vote of confidence.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has maintained a tight grip on the Republican party, even after becoming the first former president to be convicted of a felony.\n\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,'' said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor. Even as competitors like China invest heavily in electric vehicles, the grants announced Thursday will help \"ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive -- and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,\" Granholm said.\n\nThe new grants complement $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office, Granholm and other officials said.\n\nAwards are subject to negotiations to ensure that commitments to workers and communities are met, officials said. The Energy Department also will complete environmental reviews before money is awarded later this year.\n\nIf awards are completed as planned, the selected projects would create more than 2,900 jobs and help ensure that about 15,000 union workers are retained across all 11 facilities, the White House said. The grants come after successful union organizing drives from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Fort Valley, Georgia, the White House said.\n\n\"The president will not take his foot off the pedal when it comes to supporting the U.S. auto industry,'' said White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard.\n\nTransportation accounts for the single largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution and Biden has made electric vehicles a key part of his climate agenda.\n\n\"Not only are we delivering new sources of clean transit -- that iconic yellow school bus going green -- but we're also delivering to the American people options to save ... thousands of dollars of fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a vehicle'' by going electric, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said.\n\nCompanies slated for awards include Blue Bird Body Co., which will receive nearly $80 million to convert a Georgia site previously used to make diesel-powered motor homes to produce electric school buses. Fiat Chrysler will receive nearly $335 million to convert an idled assembly plant in Illinois to assemble electric vehicles, and $250 million in a separate grant to convert an Indiana transmission plant to make electric drive modules for EVs.\n\nGeneral Motors, meanwhile, will receive $500 million to convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM production lines will further support and benefit from ongoing investments in a U.S. battery supply chain, accelerating the commercialization of advanced, affordable EVs, the White House said.\n\nHarley-Davidson will receive $89 million to expand a facility in York, Pennsylvania to make electric motorcycles, and Volvo Group will receive $208 million to upgrade three manufacturing facilities that supply and build Mack and Volvo-branded heavy-duty trucks. The plants are located in Macungie, Pennsylvania; Dublin, Virginia; and Hagerstown, Maryland.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Besides the three battleground states, grants also will go to EV facilities in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nThe grants cover a broad range of the automotive supply chain, including parts for electric motorcycles and school buses, hybrid powertrains, heavy-duty commercial truck batteries and electric SUVs, the White House said.\n\n\"Building a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement. \"This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia -- by helping auto companies retool, reboot and rehire in the same factories and communities.\"\n\nGM said Thursday that its $500 million federal grant will help the company convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM has already announced over $12 billion in investments in its North American EV manufacturing and supply chain since 2020. That investment and the federal grant \"underscore our commitment to U.S. leadership in manufacturing and innovation,'' said Camilo Ballesty, GM vice president of North America Manufacturing and Labor Relations.\n\nThe grants, paid for by the landmark 2022 climate law, will help deliver on his commitment to ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers, Biden said.\n\n\"Workers that were left behind by my predecessor are now making a comeback with the support of my policies, including the conversion grants my administration is announcing today,\" the Democratic president said.\n\nThe grant announcement comes as Biden rejects calls to step aside after a disastrous debate performance last month.

Officials declined to identify companies that unsuccessfully applied for grants, but said all projects that were awarded funding currently employ Americans working in union jobs in the U.S.\n\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,\" said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor. Even as competitors like China invest heavily in electric vehicles, the federal grants will help \"ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive -- and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,\" Granholm said.", "source": {"uri": "whyy.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WHYY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here's a list of food trucks in the Quad-Cities to check out\n\n\"Building a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers,'' President Joe Biden said in a statement. \"This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia -- by helping auto companies retool, reboot and rehire in the same factories and communities.''\n\nThe grants, paid for by the landmark 2022 climate law, will help deliver on his commitment to ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers, Biden said.\n\n\"Workers that were left behind by my predecessor are now making a comeback with the support of my policies, including the conversion grants my administration is announcing today,'' the Democratic president said.\n\nThe grant announcement comes as Biden rejects calls to step aside after a disastrous debate performance last month. Biden, 81, has acknowledged his poor performance but has brushed it off as a \"bad night,'' even as many congressional Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have declined to give him a full vote of confidence.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has maintained a tight grip on the Republican party, even after becoming the first former president to be convicted of a felony.\n\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,'' said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor. Even as competitors like China invest heavily in electric vehicles, the grants announced Thursday will help \"ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive -- and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,\" Granholm said.\n\nThe new grants complement $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office, Granholm and other officials said.\n\nAwards are subject to negotiations to ensure that commitments to workers and communities are met, officials said. The Energy Department also will complete environmental reviews before money is awarded later this year.\n\nIf awards are completed as planned, the selected projects would create more than 2,900 jobs and help ensure that about 15,000 union workers are retained across all 11 facilities, the White House said. The grants come after successful union organizing drives from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Fort Valley, Georgia, the White House said.\n\n\"The president will not take his foot off the pedal when it comes to supporting the U.S. auto industry,'' said White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard.\n\nTransportation accounts for the single largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution and Biden has made electric vehicles a key part of his climate agenda.\n\n\"Not only are we delivering new sources of clean transit -- that iconic yellow school bus going green -- but we're also delivering to the American people options to save ... thousands of dollars of fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a vehicle'' by going electric, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said.\n\nCompanies slated for awards include Blue Bird Body Co., which will receive nearly $80 million to convert a Georgia site previously used to make diesel-powered motor homes to produce electric school buses. Fiat Chrysler will receive nearly $335 million to convert an idled assembly plant in Illinois to assemble electric vehicles, and $250 million in a separate grant to convert an Indiana transmission plant to make electric drive modules for EVs.\n\nGeneral Motors, meanwhile, will receive $500 million to convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM production lines will further support and benefit from ongoing investments in a U.S. battery supply chain, accelerating the commercialization of advanced, affordable EVs, the White House said.\n\nHarley-Davidson will receive $89 million to expand a facility in York, Pennsylvania to make electric motorcycles, and Volvo Group will receive $208 million to upgrade three manufacturing facilities that supply and build Mack and Volvo-branded heavy-duty trucks. The plants are located in Macungie, Pennsylvania; Dublin, Virginia; and Hagerstown, Maryland.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The funds come from the 2022 climate and tax law.\n\nThe chosen facilities span across eight states -- Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia -- and belong to automakers like General Motors and Fiat Chrysler and other manufacturers like Harley Davidson Inc., among others.\n\nThe facilities would manufacture a range of energy efficient vehicles, including electric, hydrogen-powered and hybrid vehicles, as well as many parts in the automotive supply chain, such as those for electric buses, hybrid powertrains and heavy-duty commercial truck batteries.\n\nA White House official said negotiations are starting with the auto companies to set construction plans and labor assurances, including plans around retaining and retraining workers.\n\nThe opening of new or revitalized facilities located in the South will likely amount to a major win for unions. Many foreign automakers have opened up electric vehicle manufacturing and assembly facilities across the Southeast, but the United Auto Workers has notoriously struggled to unionize the region.\n\nDuring strikes last year at the three major automakers -- General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler -- former President Donald Trump criticized Biden's EV transition agenda, arguing it would threaten U.S. auto jobs, in a counter to Biden's self-proclaimed status as \"the most pro-union president in history.\"\n\nSince then, Biden has worked to win over union support.\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain in January endorsed Biden in the November election despite EV transition concerns. UAW announced it reached an agreement with Volkswagen in April to unionize a facility in Chattanooga, Tenn., signaling the union is making inroads into the region.\n\nThe 11 facility conversions would create more than 2,900 new jobs and retain over 15,000 highly skilled union workers, a White House fact sheet said.\n\nThe facility in Fort Valley, Ga., owned by Blue Bird Corp., will receive $80 million to convert a facility used to make gasoline-powered vehicles into one producing zero-emission electric school buses. A fact sheet said that the facility is represented by the United Steelworkers.\n\nGeneral Motors will receive the most funding at $500 million to convert its plant in Lansing, Mich., to an electric vehicle site. The plant is unionized with the UAW, and the union will partner with GM to train workers for EV manufacturing.\n\nOther facilities are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the Diesel Workers Union and the Office Committee Union.\n\n\"We will not let our transition to clean energy be a zero-sum game where workers get left behind and where local plants close and move overseas,\" acting Labor Secretary Julie Su said on a call with reporters. \"We recognize that union workers have built the middle class, and those same workers are going to power our clean energy future.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type":

These grants will help ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never stop fighting for the American auto industry and American autoworkers.\"\n\nAs American manufacturing closed down from steel towns to auto towns, the ability for working families to support themselves plummeted. Investing in American manufacturing is another way of investing in JOBS, and also the long term security of the country. The Biden-Harris administration has overseen a record of 15.7 million jobs created in just a 3 and a half year term.\n\nInvestments like these do what Donald Trump promised he would do, but never even came close to accomplishing: They literally do make America great again. And so one might ask, why then would we want to go back to the nightmare of a Trump administration, when investments like this would not be made and federal resources were sometimes used to settle

Those states include Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\n\"We're giving 15,000 American workers the chance to keep their jobs,\" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on a call with reporters previewing the announcement. \"We're giving the communities who built American cars for generations the chance to build the vehicles of the future, and we're giving American manufacturing a chance to get off the sidelines and get a better competition.\"\n\nThe program will additionally lead to 2,900 new jobs, officials said, with most of those filled by labor union members, and could nearly double the annual domestic output of electric vehicles.\n\n\"This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia -- by helping auto companies retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories and communities,\" Biden said in a prepared statement. \"This delivers on my commitment to never give up on the manufacturing communities and workers that were left behind by my predecessor.\"\n\nFrom a political standpoint, the announcement represents a doubling down on Biden's EV push as Trump makes disparaging EVs a central theme of his campaign.\n\n\"If Joe Biden's extremist mandate is allowed to stand, gas-powered cars will be gone, Iowa ethanol will be totally destroyed, and the economy of this state will be decimated,\" Trump said last fall. \"When I'm back in the White House, I will save Iowa ethanol by repealing Joe Biden's absolutely insane, job-killing electric vehicle mandate on day one.\"\n\nTrump also made a speech in Michigan last fall during which he warned, \"The auto industry is being assassinated. ... It's a hit job on Michigan and on Detroit. ... All of these cars will be manufactured in foreign lands that you couldn't care less about.\"\n\nCriticizing electric vehicles has since become a standard portion of his rally speeches.\n\nBut Biden's team evidently thinks promoting electric vehicles is a winning strategy. Officials promised that the new program, which uses funds authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act, would lead to a $3.9 billion economic impact that also met climate change goals.\n\n\"We can and must build a clean energy economy that benefits everyone,\" John Podesta, Biden's senior adviser for international climate policy, said, \"one that brings new industries to life, creates the high-performance, clean vehicles of the future, leaves workers better off than they were before, improves public health, and takes care of our planet.\"\n\nMany details of the program remain unresolved, such as exactly when the projects would begin. The release noted that there would be \"negotiations\" with companies receiving any grants, along with milestones set to unlock future rounds of funding.\n\nProjects would be subject to environmental reviews, companies would be expected to \"partner\" with labor unions, and the release says the Department of Energy \"may cancel negotiations and rescind the selection for any reason.\"\n\nNot all manufacturing facilities under the initiative will make strictly electric vehicles, as some could manufacture hybrid or hydrogen fuel cell autos. In addition to cars and trucks, facilities could also make school buses and motorcycles.\n\nThe list of companies receiving grants includes the Georgia-based Blue Bird bus company, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Harley Davidson, and Volvo Technology of America.\n\nBiden has sought to counter Trump's message that EVs would be made in China by announcing a quadrupled tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum imports.\n\n\"Because Chinese steel companies produce a lot more steel than China needs, it ends up dumping the extra steel into the global markets at unfairly low prices,\" Biden told a group of union workers in Pittsburgh in April.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nBoth major party candidates are intensely focused on the Rust Belt swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, announcing manufacturing and tariff initiatives designed to appeal to blue-collar workers in those states.\n\nTwo of those states, Michigan and Pennsylvania, are among the eight mentioned in the new grant program, along with a third swing state, Georgia, that Biden won in 2020 and is hoping to keep in his camp this fall.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Granholm", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Granholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lansing,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lansing, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lansing, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

It will also boost manufacturing of parts for EVs, including batteries.\n\n\"For so long, we acted as though the best days of American manufacturing were behind us and there was nothing we could do about it,\" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said during a call with reporters Wednesday. \"And under President Biden, we are doing something about it.\"\n\nActing Labor Secretary Julie Su said the announcement shows \"we can achieve our climate goals and our good-job goals at the same time. In fact, we must.\"\n\nThe companies identified for the grants are located across eight states -- Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia. They include American Autoparts, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Harley Davidson and Volvo.\n\nThe Biden administration, however, stressed the grants are still subject to negotiations with the companies. Granholm said a condition of the funding is that companies make strong commitments to protect autoworkers, including by training them to ensure they \"have the skills to remain essential in the next industrial revolution.\"\n\nEvery factory selected is unionized, Granholm added.\n\n\"This delivers on my commitment to never give up on the manufacturing communities and workers that were left behind by my predecessor and are now making a comeback with the support of my policies, including the conversion grants my administration is announcing today,\" Biden said in a statement Thursday morning. \"These grants will help ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers.\"\n\nThe Energy Department also will complete reviews to confirm the funded projects are in line with the administration's environmental goals. The grants will allow companies to install new equipment aimed at making their operations cleaner and more efficient.\n\nA senior administration official said the companies will not receive the funding all at once but rather in tranches that are unlocked when negotiated milestones are reached.\n\nWhite House national climate adviser Ali Zaidi said the program is the latest step toward the U.S. being more competitive globally in EV manufacturing.\n\n\"Folks looked at the United States lagging on private investment in the electric vehicle revolution that's taking place around the world, lagging countries like China,\" he said. \"And now, thanks to the president's leadership, and despite all the skeptics who said it could not be done, the U.S. is leading -- the No. 1 nation destination for clean energy manufacturing capacity, attracting that private capital, becoming a magnet for that investment to come here to the United States.\"", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com",

operations on the verge of closing or already closed temporarily.\n\n\"Building a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers,\" President Joe Biden said in a

retool.\"\n\nAmong those receiving funding were Fiat Chrysler, which will use the money to convert its Illinois Belvidere Assembly Plant, which had previously been idled, and another facility in Indiana to facilities that will produce electric cars.\n\nGeneral Motors will also convert a Lansing, Mich., facility currently making gas-powered vehicles into an EV plant, Volvo will upgrade three facilities to make electric trucks, Harley Davidson will grow its electric motorcycle production and a Hyundai subsidiary will use the finds to produce gas-powered cars and plug-in hybrids while also building a battery system plant.\n\nBiden said the money highlights the administration's commitment to the manufacturing sector.\n\n\"These grants will help ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers,\" Biden said. \"I'll never stop fighting for the American auto industry and the American autoworker.\"\n\nThe White House said the projects will create about 2,900 new jobs and prevent the loss of 15,000 more.\n\n\"This announcement is a hallmark of the Biden administration's industrial strategy, which is a strategy to bring manufacturing jobs back to America after years of offshoring,\" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said.\n\nThe announcement comes after Biden announced in May that he was quadrupling tariffs on electric vehicles from China to dwarf its greatest EV challenger overseas.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "clyde_hughes@yahoo.com", "name": "Clyde Hughes", "type":

Collectively, according to the Biden administration, the projects could result in the creation of 2,900 new jobs and the retention of 15,000 current ones.\n\n\"This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia -- by helping auto companies retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories and communities,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nThe move comes as the president fights for his political life following a shaky debate performance two weeks ago that has many in the Democratic party calling for him to step aside. Michigan, the heart of the U.S. auto industry and a pivotal electoral battleground, features heavily in both respects.\n\nAnd the grants come as the global auto industry is recalibrating the slowing pace of EV adoption: would-be customers are balking at comparatively high prices, voicing concerns with range anxiety, charging availability and public money subsidizing private industry.\n\nMore than half of the new funds are heading to projects in or with ties to the Great Lakes state. General Motors Co. and Stellantis NV are each slated to receive more than $500 million, with another nearly $158 million going to ZF North America Inc., an auto parts supplier with a facility in Marysville. Ford Motor Co. will not receive any funds.\n\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,\" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm, a former Michigan governor. \"Even as our competitors invest heavily in electric vehicles, these grants ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive -- and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations.\"\n\n'Supply Chain Conversion' program\n\nAll of the projects will in some way support a transition to low-emission vehicles -- a top priority for Biden as a way to fight climate change and keep China from dominating the growing electric vehicle sector of the world auto market. That transition has proven challenging for automakers, though recent EV sales data were promising for some automakers like GM.\n\nMore: GM posts slight sales increase, record EV sales in second quarter\n\nThe Biden administration also said that the creation and retention of good-paying, union jobs was a key consideration in picking who would receive grants.\n\n\"We recognize that union workers have built the middle class and those same workers are going to power our clean energy future,\" said Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su. \"We're funding projects where workers have a real voice in the job, where they have training and upper mobility, and where they have access to supportive services like child care and transportation.\"\n\nThe selections announced Thursday are part of the Department of Energy's Domestic Automotive Supply Chain Conversion Grants program, which is funded by the Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022.\n\nThe applicant pool, which the administration said was much larger than they could accommodate with the current round of funding, was restricted to companies that committed to taking on at least 50% of their project.\n\nAlso, the chosen companies will not automatically receive funds, but rather they will next negotiate with the federal government for awards that specifically support the plans they submitted during the application process.\n\n\"The Department of Energy has made clear, and this administration has made clear, that grants are not blank checks to corporations,\" Su said.\n\nMichigan projects\n\nStill, the program could deliver significant government funding to several projects in or near Michigan.\n\nGM will receive up to $500 million to convert its Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant to producing EVs from producing internal combustion engine cars. It will support the retention of more than 650 jobs and create 50 new ones, according to a project description released by the Biden administration.\n\nStellantis, specifically Fiat-Chrysler U.S. Automobiles, will receive up to almost $575 million. About $335 million will go towards a project in Belvidere, Ill. and another $250 million for a project in Kokomo, Indiana.\n\nThe Belvidere project aims to convert an idled assembly plant there to building EVs from assembling such ICE vehicles as the Jeep Cherokee. The project would restore approximately 1,450 unionized jobs. The plant has been idled since February 2023.\n\nThe Kokomo project would convert the automaker's Indiana Transmission Plant to initiate manufacturing of electric drive modules. The administration said it would \"result in the retention and upskilling of 585 employees,\" all of whom would be members of the United Auto Workers union.\n\nZF North America -- which has a facility in Marysville near the St. Clair County border with Canada -- will receive up to $157.7 million to help produce components for electric passenger and heavy-duty vehicles, resulting in the potential retention of 536 jobs, most of which are represented by the UAW.\n\n\"ZF's intention is to provide critical componentry to electrify light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles,\" ZF spokesperson Tony Sapienza said in a statement to The Detroit News. \"Our potential investment in our Marysville, Michigan facility would enhance the domestic EV supply chain, paving the way for a more robust, efficient, and environmentally sustainable automotive industry.\"\n\nSapienza added that ZF is pleased by the news, though he noted that discussions with the Energy Department are ongoing and ZF's participation is \"contingent upon a future customer.\"\n\nAmerican Autoparts Inc. -- a parts supplier with two facilities in Toledo, Ohio -- will receive up to $32.6 million for two projects that will support chassis assembly for a new light plug-in hybrid truck and the construction of a new battery system assembly plant. The projects, respectively, will be at the Stellantis Toledo Assembly Complex and the Toledo Trade Centre Industrial Park.\n\nBiden said that the move Thursday \"delivers on my commitment to never give up on the manufacturing communities and workers that were left behind by my predecessor and are now making a comeback with the support of my policies.\"\n\n\"I'll never stop fighting for the American auto industry and American autoworkers.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)\n\nThe federal government is spending $2 billion to modernize automobile manufacturing facilities, helping the industry to compete with foreign subsidies and create and protect jobs.\n\nAs part of the Automotive Community Benefits Plan, the current administration will extend grants to 11 selected manufacturing plants in eight states, including in Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, that have temporarily shuttered or were at risk of closing.\n\nFederal funding, which will come from the Inflation Reduction Act, will be dedicated to retrofitting factories, installing equipment, launching projections, and bolstering annual production.\n\nGrant capital will also allow these at-risk facilities to convert to the manufacturing of electric vehicles and related components and a broad range of new-generation cars, such as fuel cell vehicles, hybrid cars, and high-growth vehicle drive trains.\n\nRecipients of grant funding include some of the biggest names in the automotive industry, such as Fiat-Chrysler ($584 million), General Motors ($500 million), Harley Davidson ($89 million), and Volvo ($208.2 million).\n\nThese efforts are expected to save 15,000 jobs and create nearly 3,000 new positions, most of which are union jobs, in historic automotive communities.\n\n\"Building a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers,\" said President Joe Biden. \"This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia -- by helping auto companies retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories and communities.\"\n\nAccording to top White House economist Lael Brainard, the $2 billion investment is projected to generate $3.9 billion in total economic value and ensure the United States keeps its climate goals intact.\n\n\"We will not let our transition to clean energy be a zero-sum game where workers get left behind and where local plants close and move overseas,\" Ms. Brainard said.\n\nThe latest announcement is a critical part of the administration's efforts to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States and ensure major automakers and suppliers can compete in today's global marketplace, says Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.\n\n\"We're giving the communities who built American cars for generations the chance to build the vehicles of the future, and we're giving American manufacturing the chance to get off the sidelines and get better competition,\" Ms. Granholm said in a press call.\n\nA senior administration official said recipient companies must commit to a production schedule, milestones, and workforce training.\n\nOver the last year, the White House has announced billions of dollars in funding opportunities, be it grants or loans, to construct electric vehicle charging networks, expand or retool manufacturing facilities, and replace polluting heavy-duty vehicles with zero-emission automobiles.\n\nThe funding will complement the White House's $177 billion investment in EV and battery manufacturing, Ms. Granholm noted.\n\nPresident Biden has been courting auto workers since the weeks-long standoff between the United Auto Workers union and the Big Three automakers -- Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Stellantis -- in September 2023.\n\nIn January, the president received the endorsement from UAW president Shawn Fain, applauding the incumbent for standing and speaking at a picket line in Michigan.\n\n\"He heard the call and he stood up and he showed up,\" Mr. Fain said at an event. \"This November we can stand up and elect someone who stands with us and supports our cause, or we can elect someone who will divide us and fight us every step of the way.

Just earlier this year President Joe Biden quadrupled tariffs on electric vehicles from China.\n\n\"This announcement is a hallmark of the Biden administration's industrial strategy, which is a strategy to bring manufacturing jobs back to America after years of offshoring,\" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters.\n\nThe plants selected by the Department of Energy for the money, which comes from the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, cover eight states, including critical battlegrounds like Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Building a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers. This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia - by helping auto companies retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories and communities,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nThe projects, according to the administration, create an estimated 2,900 new jobs and save 15,000 jobs that would otherwise have been lost. The awardees include major automakers like GM and Volvo as well as suppliers, like American Auto Parts.\n\nThe plants also include facilities from vehicle component manufacturing to full vehicle assembly, according to a senior administration official.\n\nThe move comes as the growth rate of EV sales has slowed even as total EV sales have continued to rise. The industry, according to experts, has entered a phase where automakers are struggling to bridge the gap from early adopters to mass market consumers.\n\nThis has led to some automakers taking an increased interest in the hybrid space, with sales up across the country and GM and Ford both announcing that they plan to make more.\n\nAnd notably, the facilities in Thursday's announcement work on both electric and hybrid vehicles.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Those states include Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\n\"We're giving 15,000 American workers the chance to keep their jobs,\" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on a call with reporters previewing the announcement. \"We're giving the communities who built American cars for generations the chance to build the vehicles of the future, and we're giving American manufacturing a chance to get off the sidelines and get a better competition.\"\n\nThe program will additionally lead to 2,900 new jobs, officials said, with most of those filled by labor union members, and could nearly double the annual domestic output of electric vehicles.\n\n\"This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia -- by helping auto companies retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories and communities,\" Biden said in a prepared statement. \"This delivers on my commitment to never give up on the manufacturing communities and workers that were left behind by my predecessor.\"\n\nFrom a political standpoint, the announcement represents a doubling down on Biden's EV push as Trump makes disparaging EVs a central theme of his campaign.\n\n\"If Joe Biden's extremist mandate is allowed to stand, gas-powered cars will be gone, Iowa ethanol will be totally destroyed, and the economy of this state will be decimated,\" Trump said last fall. \"When I'm back in the White House, I will save Iowa ethanol by repealing Joe Biden's absolutely insane, job-killing electric vehicle mandate on day one.\"\n\nTrump also made a speech in Michigan last fall during which he warned, \"The auto industry is being assassinated. ... It's a hit job on Michigan and on Detroit. ... All of these cars will be manufactured in foreign lands that you couldn't care less about.\"\n\nCriticizing electric vehicles has since become a standard portion of his rally speeches.\n\nBut Biden's team evidently thinks promoting electric vehicles is a winning strategy. Officials promised that the new program, which uses funds authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act, would lead to a $3.9 billion economic impact that also met climate change goals.\n\n\"We can and must build a clean energy economy that benefits everyone,\" John Podesta, Biden's senior adviser for international climate policy, said, \"one that brings new industries to life, creates the high-performance, clean vehicles of the future, leaves workers better off than they were before, improves public health, and takes care of our planet.\"\n\nMany details of the program remain unresolved, such as exactly when the projects would begin.

These include $500 million for GM's Lansing Grand River Assembly plant in Michigan, $334.8 million for Stellantis' Belvidere Assembly facility in Illinois, and $250 million for Stellantis' planned EV drive module plant in Indiana.\n\nAs noted in an Automotive News report, the US federal government would be contributing $1.7 billion to electric vehicle-related initiatives in eight states. The projects are expected to create over 2,900 jobs and retain 15,000 highly skilled union workers, the US Department of Energy (DoE) noted. The facilities that would be supported by the grant are located in Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, and Georgia.\n\nThe US DoE noted that the Domestic Manufacturing Auto Conversion Grants, which are designed to help automakers switch from the production of combustion-powered vehicles to electric cars, are funded through the Inflation Reduction Act. The grants are intended to support the production of electric vehicles, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.\n\nEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm noted that the grants could allow US automakers to compete with foreign competitors.\n\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry.

That's what this choice is about.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said at a May rally in Ohio that the U.S. auto industry will suffer if he loses in November.\n\n\"Now, if I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole. That's gonna be the least of it. It's going to be a bloodbath for the country. That'll be the least of it,\" the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said.\n\nHe pledged a 100 percent tariff on automobiles manufactured outside the United States, promising that the domestic auto manufacturing industry would be protected if he were elected to another term.\n\n\"We're going to put a 100 percent tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you're not going to be able to sell those guys if I get elected,\" the former president said.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation Reduction Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lael_Brainard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lael Brainard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Granholm", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Granholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

These include $500 million for GM's Lansing Grand River Assembly plant in Michigan, $334.8 million for Stellantis' Belvidere Assembly facility in Illinois, and $250 million for Stellantis' planned EV drive module plant in Indiana.\n\nAs noted in an Automotive News report, the US federal government would be contributing $1.7 billion to electric vehicle-related initiatives in eight states. The projects are expected to create over 2,900 jobs and retain 15,000 existing workers in the facilities, the US Department of Energy (DoE) noted. The facilities that would be supported by the grant are located in Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, and Georgia.\n\nThe US DoE noted that the Domestic Manufacturing Auto Conversion Grants, which are designed to help automakers switch from the production of combustion-powered vehicles to electric cars, are funded through the Inflation Reduction Act. The grants are intended to support the production of electric vehicles, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.\n\nEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm noted that the grants could allow US automakers to compete with foreign competitors.\n\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry. Even as our competitors invest heavily in electric vehicles, these grants ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive -- and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,\" Granholm noted.\n\nJohn Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy, welcomed the grant.\n\n\"President Biden set out to build a clean energy economy that benefits everyone.

others like Ohio, Illinois and Indiana.\n\nThe aim is to help them retrofit to make EVs and officials said the investment -- paid for by the Inflation Reduction Act -- will save 15,000 jobs.\n\n\"This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia -- by helping auto companies retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories and communities,\" said Biden in a statement.\n\nThe announcement comes as Biden, 81, battles calls to end his reelection bid after a disastrous debate performance against Republican Donald Trump last month.\n\nIt is also the latest Biden administration effort to support US industries in the face of competition from China.\n\nUS leaders in recent months have warned that excess industrial capacity in the world's second largest economy could bring a flood of low priced goods to the market, potentially hurting budding clean energy industries elsewhere.\n\nWashington also announced sharp tariff hikes on Chinese imports earlier this year, including on EVs.\n\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,\" said Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm.\n\nShe noted that the grants will help to \"ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive,\" saying that the sector needs a federal partner when competing with other countries who subsidize their auto industries.\n\nBeneficiaries include automakers like General Motors, Fiat-Chrysler and Volvo.", "source": {"uri":

The plan calls for retaining more than 650 UAW jobs at the facility and adding 50 new hires.\n\nZF North America Inc. was also awarded a grant of up to about $158 million to retool a portion of its plant in Marysville in St. Clair County to move from making parts for internal combustion engine vehicles to components for EVs. That grant calls for retaining 536 jobs, including 387 UAW employees.\n\nThe announcement was made just ahead of a campaign trip to Detroit by President Joe Biden on Friday as he tries to quell growing concerns that his reelection is at risk, with polls showing him trailing former President Donald Trump in Michigan and other swing states and a debate performance two weeks ago in which he struggled to answer questions coherently.\n\nThe list of grantees also includes $335 million to help reopen and convert Stellantis' idled Fiat Chrysler assembly plant in Belvidere, Illinois, to building EVs, restoring some 1,450 union jobs. Another $250 million will go to convert Stellantis' transmission plant in Kokomo, Indiana, to make electric drive modules, which combine the motor, transmission and other electronics in a single unit in battery-powered EVs, allowing the plant to retain 585 UAW jobs.\n\nThe UAW won a commitment that the Belvidere plant would be reopened as part of its successful strike negotiations last year. During that strike, Biden, a staunch union supporter, came to Michigan and became the first sitting president to walk a picket line with striking workers.\n\nOther plants in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Maryland and Virginia also received grants to help shore up supply chains and assembly of electric cars, trucks and buses. The funding was included in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022 by Congress.\n\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,\" said U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor. \"Even as our competitors invest heavily in electric vehicles, these grants ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive -- and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations.\"\n\nTrump and Republicans, however, have excoriated the Biden administration's push to help automakers produce and sell more electric vehicles, particularly pointing to emissions rules they argue amount to a mandate forcing manufacturers to sell the vehicles the public may not want or can't afford, lest the carmakers face penalties.", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

According to The New York Times and The Washington Post, the money will come from President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which provides subsidies to EV and battery plants, as well as the $7,500 tax credits consumers can get if they buy an electric vehicle.\n\nOne of the 11 recipients is a Jeep factory in Belvidere, Illinois that closed last year. The $334.8 million it will get from the initiative will allow it to reopen to produce electric vehicles and restore 1,450 jobs. GM, which will be awarded $500 million, will convert a plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs instead of gasoline cars. The US subsidiary of Korean auto parts maker Hyundai Mobis will also get $32.6 million to refit a plant in Toledo, Ohio for the production of plug-in vehicle components.\n\nGovernment officials said they chose communities that are disproportionately affected by pollution or lack of investment. In addition, employees in all of the selected companies are represented by unions. The grants aren't set in stone -- the companies still have to negotiate terms with the Department of Energy. They have to commit to retaining their current workers despite the shift to EVs, and they have to meet employment targets. The companies also have to promise to provide their workers with certain benefits, such as child care, pensions and training to further their careers.\n\nAs The Times notes, several factories selected for the initiative are located in \"battleground states\" for the upcoming presidential elections. \"This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia -- by helping auto companies retool, reboot and rehire in the same factories and communities,\" Biden said in a statement. \"This delivers on my commitment to never give up on the manufacturing communities and workers that were left behind by my predecessor.\"\n\nJennifer Granholm, the US Energy secretary, believes the fund will retain 15,000 jobs and create 3,000 new ones. Granholm also said that it will help the US \"compete with other countries who were subsidizing their auto industries.\" While the secretary didn't mention China specifically, the country is known for subsidizing its EV manufacturers. Earlier this year, the US government quadrupled import tariff for Chinese EVs, while the European Union announced that it was going to impose additional tariffs of up to 38 percent on Chinese-made electric vehicles to protect local manufacturers.", "source": {"uri": "engadget.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "engadget"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This announcement reflects President Biden's deep commitment to reinvest and revitalize - and never give up on - the manufacturing communities and the workers who have helped build America's middle class. These investments will create and retain thousands of good-paying union jobs and support the American auto communities that have driven the U.S. economy for generations. They deliver on the President's commitment to ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers, and that the U.S. wins the competition for the 21st century.\n\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,\" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. \"Even as our competitors invest heavily in electric vehicles, these grants ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive -- and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations.\"\n\n\"President Biden set out to build a clean energy economy that benefits everyone,\" said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. \"Today's awards from the Department of Energy help bring that vision to life by investing in the future of the auto industry, creating thousands of good-paying union jobs, and tackling the existential threat of climate change by cutting pollution from the transportation sector.\"\n\n\"Today's announcement from the Department of Energy is a big win for the American people and demonstrates President Biden's bold vision for how we are choosing to take on the climate crisis: with America's workers leading the way,\" said Assistant to the President and National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi. \"This ground-breaking program is central to catalyzing expansion of the industrial capacity to help us meet the President's climate goals and allow tens of thousands of skilled American workers to participate in the great comeback story of American manufacturing.\"\n\nThe Domestic Manufacturing Auto Conversion Grants program helps ensure that the U.S. continues to lead the world in auto manufacturing, led by the communities and workers who know this business best. The selectees will negotiate for awards to enable them to manufacture products covering a broad range of the automotive supply chain, including parts for electric motorcycles and school buses, hybrid powertrains, heavy-duty commercial truck batteries, and electric SUVs. Today's announcement complements the $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing spurred to date by the President's Investing in America agenda. This program also supports the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to strengthen domestic supply chains, support American workers, and bolster America's global leadership in manufacturing.\n\nThe award selections are subject to negotiations to ensure that commitments to workers and communities are met. DOE will also complete environmental reviews to ensure that the awards are consistent with the Administration's commitments to clean, environmentally responsible manufacturing, and include appropriate mitigation as needed. If awarded, the selected projects would collectively create over 2,900 new high-quality jobs and help ensure over 15,000 highly skilled union workers are retained across all eleven facilities.\n\nProject descriptions and a full list of selections can be found here.\n\nThe Domestic Auto Manufacturing Conversion Grants program, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, invests in the domestic production of efficient hybrid, plug-in electric hybrid, plug-in electric drive, and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles. This program aims to expand manufacturing of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty electrified vehicles and components and support commercial facilities including those for vehicle assembly, component assembly, and related vehicle part manufacturing.\n\nThis program also advances President Biden's Justice40 Initiative, which sets the goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments in climate, clean energy, clean transportation, and other areas flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. Projects selected for this funding will create high-quality jobs in the disadvantaged communities that are receiving investments. All selectees plan to support these legacy autoworkers by partnering with local unions. Selected projects will provide support for workers including job and technical training, childcare, retirement benefits, and transportation benefits. The program works with and encourages awardees to engage and collaborate with adjacent disadvantaged communities on education, health, climate, and clean energy.\n\nSelection for award negotiations is not a commitment by DOE to issue an award or provide funding. Before funding is issued, DOE and the applicants will undergo a negotiation process, and DOE may cancel negotiations and rescind the selection for any reason during that time.\n\nThe funding for the Domestic Auto Manufacturing Conversion Grants will be administered by DOE's Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC).

With the money, the company aims to decarbonize their operations, aiming to position itself as a \"leader in electrified technologies.\"\n\nAlong with the grant, Cummins will invest an additional $75 million in cost share to bring the total investment to $150 million. This will help convert the company's Columbus Engine Plant to house manufacturing for zero-emissions components and electric powertrain systems.\n\nOfficials said this will add around 250 new full-time jobs and allow opportunities for the plant's existing workforce to transition to these positions.\n\n\"This project stands as a testament to Cummins' dedication to innovation, community welfare and environmental stewardship,\" the release said, \"making a significant contribution to the local community and the broader goals of sustainable transportation.\"\n\nThe Fiat-Chrysler Automotive facility in Kokomo is expected to receive $249,999,999 in grants to convert its Indiana Transmission Plant to begin production of electric drive modules. The release said this will help increase e-motor capabilities for incorporation into electric vehicles.\n\nThis transition will include the retention, and upskilling of, 585 employees. Officials said the project will transition the plant's manufacturing processes from internal combustion engine technologies to electrified alternatives.\n\n\"The project will support the local Kokomo community by providing new job training for employees and additional employment opportunities for diverse contractors,\" the release said. \"The commitments toward these goals include partnering with local organizations and investing in engagement strategies for the benefit of the local communities and (the company's) employees.\"\n\nOther companies from around the United States who received grants include:\n\nIn a statement from President Joe Biden about the grants, he said:\n\nBuilding a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers. This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more -- from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia - by helping auto companies retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories and communities. This delivers on my commitment to never give up on the manufacturing communities and workers that were left behind by my predecessor and are now making a comeback with the support of my policies, including the conversion grants my administration is announcing today. These grants will help ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers. I'll never stop fighting for the American auto industry and American autoworkers.", "source": {"uri": "fox59.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox 59"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_gay@fox59.com",

FERN\u00c1NDEZ HERN\u00c1NDEZ: Good morning, everyone.\n\nThank you for joining today's press call on new action from the Department of Energy to ensure the future of the auto industry is built here in America.\n\nAs a reminder, the call will begin with on-the-record remarks from Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su, the president's National Economic Adviser -- Adviser Lael Brainard, the president's National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi, and Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy John Podesta.\n\nAfter their remarks, there -- we will have a question-and-answer period, which will be on background and attributable to \"senior administration officials.\"\n\nThe contents of this call and the materials you all will receive over email are embargoed until tomorrow, July 11th at 5:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nWith that, let me turn it over to Secretary Granholm.\n\nSECRETARY GRANHOLM: Thanks so much. Hello, everybody. Thanks for joining us today.\n\nPresident Biden came into office determined that the auto communities in America who built the cars of the 20th century would also build the cars of the 21st century.\n\nAnd that's why I am so thrilled to share with you that tomorrow, the Department of Energy is going to announce nearly $2 billion to modernize historical auto manufacturing facilities as they retrofit to produce electric vehicles and components.\n\nThis investment, which is funded by the president's Inflation Reduction Act, is going to expand or reopen or revive 11 at-risk facilities in eight states. It'll save 15,000 jobs and create nearly 3,000 more. And a majority of these jobs are union jobs.\n\nThis announcement is a hallmark of the Biden administration's industrial strategy, which is a strategy to bring manufacturing and jobs back to America after years of offshoring.\n\nWhen I was governor of Michigan before and during the Great Recession, it became painfully clear to me that the auto industry needed to embrace the future. But in order to do that, they needed a federal partner, especially to compete with other countries who were subsidizing their auto industries. And that's what this massive investment is all about.\n\nThe nine selectees include major automakers like GM, Fiat-Chrysler Automotive, Volvo, as well as suppliers like American Auto Parts.\n\nAnd together, these selectees have a collective 575 years of experience in auto manufacturing, which is why they're ideally positioned to take this industry into the 21st century.\n\nThese companies are receiving federal funding to retrofit and upgrade their facilities, including installing new equipment to make their operations cleaner and more efficient. And these projects will enable production of over 1 million electrified light-duty vehicles and 40,000 electrified trucks and buses per year, nearly doubling our country's annual production of electric vehicles.\n\nAs a condition of receiving funding, the nine selectees have made strong commit- -- commitments to supporting autoworkers.\n\nAnd we competitively selected these projects to protect high-skilled, high-quality auto jobs. Every one of these facilities is unionized. And every selectee has committed to funding training to ensure workers have the skills to remain essential in the next industrial revolution.\n\nFor so long, we acted as though the best days of American manufacturing were behind us and there was nothing we could do about it. Under President Biden, we are doing something about it. We're giving 15,000 American workers the chance to keep their jobs. We're giving the communities who built American cars for generations the chance to build the vehicles of the future. And we're giving American manufacturing a chance to get off the sidelines and get ahead of the competition.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nAnd now I will pass it over to my colleague, Secretary Su.\n\nACTING SECRETARY SU: Thank you, Secretary Granholm, for your extraordinary leadership and your commitment to centering workers in our nation's new industrial strategy.\n\nSo, I am so proud to join you today to make this announcement about these conversion grants. What this announcement shows is that we can achieve our climate goals and our good jobs goals at the same time. In fact, we must.\n\nPresident Biden's Investing in America Agenda is about building our country and investing in industries to make electric vehicles and batteries right here in America, to install electric vehicle charging stations from coast to coast, to weatherize homes. And at the same time, it's about creating good jobs with the power to change lives.\n\nA good job is a job that comes with good pay and benefits, where workers are treated with dignity and respect, where they know they will come home healthy and safe at the end of the workday, and where they can exercise rights.\n\nAs President Biden says all the time, \"It's about being able to look your children in the eye and say, 'Everything is going to be okay' and mean it.\"\n\nThe Department of Labor has been hard at work with our colleagues across the administration to make sure that federal investments are also creating millions of good jobs.\n\nAnd the Department of Energy's work on this has been really key.\n\nIn President Biden's America, we're creating over 2,900 high-quality auto jobs and, as Secretary Granholm just said, saving over 15,000 more jobs through these grants alone.\n\nIn President Biden's America, we're reprioritizing workers who have been left out, left behind, and let down by failed economic policies of the past.\n\nTogether, we're funding projects where workers have a real voice on the job, where they have training and upward mobility, and where they have access to supportive services like childcare and transportation.\n\nWe know that good jobs are not just good for workers, not just good for customers, not just good for families, but also good for employers. Good jobs mean higher retention and lower recruitment costs.\n\nIn total, we estimate these projects will generate $3.9 billion in total economic value.\n\nIn a pro-worker, pro-union administration, we recognize that union workers have built the middle class, and those same workers are going to power our clean energy future. They're the ones building electric vehicles, installing those charging stations, and engineering new climate solutions. And they're the ones who are going to get a fair share of the profits they're creating.\n\nSo, we will not let our transition to clean energy be a -- be a zero-sum game where workers get left behind and where local plants close and move overseas.\n\nThe Department of Energy has made clear, as this administration has made clear, that grants are not blank checks to corporations. They should uplift entire communities and maintain high-wage jobs.\n\nThis is just transition in practice. It's how everyone will share in the promise and prosperity of a clean energy future.\n\nSo, thank you for letting me join you today, and congratulations to all the grantees.\n\nI will now turn it over to the president's economic adviser and director of our National Economic Council, Lael Brainard.\n\nMS. BRAINARD: Well, thank you, Acting Secretary Su. And thanks to everyone for joining us.\n\nThis announcement marks another important chapter for the U.S. auto industry, ensuring that the workers and communities that have powered the iconic American industry for the past century will continue to lead it for the next century.\n\nThis investment delivers on the president's commitment to enable our auto companies to retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories and communities, and enable the manufacturing communities and workers that were left behind under the previous administration to make a comeback.\n\nThe president believes the American auto industry is a vital engine of the U.S. economy, creating pathways to good middle-class jobs and making up the largest share of American manufacturing output.\n\nThis investment is a key element of the president's strategy to position the American auto industry and American autoworkers to win the future.\n\nThe president has delivered a historic recovery for the auto industry, creating 275,000 auto jobs and celebrating 20 new auto facilities, while 90,000 auto jobs were lost and zero new auto plants were announced during the previous administration.\n\nAlready, we've seen nearly $180 billion in announced private-sector investments in electric vehicle and battery supply chains on the strength of the president's auto industry policy.\n\nThe president has combined tax credits and funding to support investments along the entire auto supply chain and rebates to enable consumers to own the car of their choice along with hubs to ensure we have the best auto workforce in the world and protection against unfair and nonsecure practices, including a 100 percent tariff on imported Chinese vehicles and data security oversight of these connected cars.\n\nThe president has been personally engaged to make sure good auto jobs remain here in America, inviting a worker from Blue Bird to the White House to discuss the organizing campaign that has led to a successful first contract, traveling to Michigan to stand with UAW members, and celebrating successful organizing drives from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Fort Valley, Georgia.\n\nThe president will not take his foot off the pedal when it comes to supporting the U.S. auto industry.\n\nAnd, with that, I'm going to turn it over to National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi.\n\nMR. ZAIDI: Thank you, Lael. Thanks, everybody, for joining.\n\nWhen President Biden came into office, he laid out how tackling the climate change meant creating good union jobs and advancing environmental justice in communities so often left out and left behind.\n\nOver the last three and half years, you've seen the president deliver on that vision, translating policy choices on things like vehicle emissions standards and investments in cleaner transit, championing our workers all into wins both for climate and for our economy and our workforce.\n\nAnd at every step of the way, you've seen folks count out this comeback. You've seen folks say that we could not bring back batteries that were invest -- invented in the United States, in our labs, and by our scientists back to the United States to be manufactured here.\n\nAnd yet, thanks to the president's investment agenda, we have 15 gigafactories and counting to build those batteries here in the United States of America.\n\nFolks said we couldn't compete on the upstream of the electric vehicle revolution -- areas like lithium production and processing and recycling.\n\nAnd yet, today, across the country, we are seeing new facilities be opened up -- from the beginning of the supply chain all the way through circular economy to the recycling -- being built, manufactured by workers here in the United States of America.\n\nFolks looked at the United States lagging on private investment in the electric vehicle revolution that's taking place around the world, lagging countries like China. And now, thanks to the President's leadership and despite all the skeptics who said it could not be done, the U.S. is leading -- the number-one nation destination for clean energy manufacturing capacity, attracting that private capital, becoming a magnet for that investment to come here to the United States.\n\nTransportation, as you all know, accounts as -- accounts for the single-largest source of pollution in terms of greenhouse gases in our economy in the United States. But thanks to the president's leadership, we are on track to tackle that source of emissions and do it in a way that creates good-paying jobs across the economy.\n\nIn doing that, not only are we delivering new sources of clean transit -- that iconic yellow school bus going green -but we're also delivering to the American people options to save money on mobility from point A to point B -- thousands of dollars of fuel and maintenance costs saved over the life- -- lifetime of a vehicle.\n\nIt's never been a good bet to bet against American workers, American innovation, American ingenuity. And the U.S. auto industry is proving that: proving that when you have a president who looks at the challenge of climate change and sees jobs, a president who invests in America, we have what it takes to win the future.\n\nWith that, let me turn it over to my colleague, John Podesta.\n\nMR. PODESTA: Thanks. And thank you, everyone, for joining. I'll be brief.\n\nI do want to commend Secretary Granholm and her team at the Department of Energy for their diligent work in getting these important awards out the door.\n\nAnd I want to commend Secretary Su for her leadership in making sure that clean energy jobs are good-paying, union jobs.\n\nAs my colleagues have noted, this is what \"Investing in America\" agenda is all about: investing in communities all across America who've been left out and left behind by targeting facilities from Marysville, Michigan, to Toledo, Ohio; Belvidere, Illinois, that were shuttered or at risk of closing.\n\nAmerican can and will win the competition of the 21st century by retooling those facilities to support clean car production and lead the global auto industry, creating nearly 3,000 good-paying, union jobs and retaining 15,000 more.\n\nPresident Biden sees the climate crisis as an imperative, but also an opportunity. And it's because we can and must build the clean energy economy that benefits everyone -- one that brings new industries to life, creates the high-performance clean vehicles of the future, leaves workers better off than they were before, improves public health, and takes care of our planet.\n\nToday's awards are bringing that vision ever closer to reality.\n\nThank you. And that -- with that, I'll turn it over to Angelo to take your questions.\n\nMR. FERN\u00c1NDEZ HERN\u00c1NDEZ: Thanks, John. And thanks, everyone.\n\nWe will now move on to the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, this will be on background and attributable to \"senior administration officials.\" As some of you are already doing, please use the \"Raise Hand\" function on Zoom. And we will get started in a second.\n\nGreat, we will get started with Maxine. You should be unmuted now.\n\nQ Hey. This is Maxine Joselow with The Washington Post. Thanks so much for doing this call.\n\nI just wanted to request if you could send us all a list of the 11 manufacturing plants that are actually getting this funding. I noticed on the materials that you sent out via email those -- that list wasn't included and was just hoping that you could get that to all of us. Thanks.\n\nMR. FERN\u00c1NDEZ HERN\u00c1NDEZ: Yep, we will have that to you all today.\n\nOkay, our next question will come from Rachel. You should be unmuted now.\n\nQ Hey. Thank you for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could speak a little bit more, I guess, to the need for this. Like, would these facilities have otherwise shut down? And, if not, like, why are they getting these funds? Thanks.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Hi, Rachel.\n\nSo, yes. I'm going to go ahead and shift over to [senior administrator official] to answer this question.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, Rachel. [Senior administrator official] here.\n\nWe are looking for facilities that are at risk of closure in this program. And so, the goal of this program is to support facilities that have an opportunity for conversion, have been long-standing operating facilities in historic automotive communities. And we prioritize the new selection facilities that were -- were either temporarily shuttered or were at risk of shuttering.\n\nAnd so, as you'll see in our -- our jobs numbers, we are both retaining jobs that would have otherwise been lost as well as adding new jobs associated with the production of new vehicle types and new components.\n\nMR. FERN\u00c1NDEZ HERN\u00c1NDEZ: Thank you. We will go to David next. You should be unmuted now.\n\nQ Thanks for having this call, everyone.\n\nFollowing up on Maxine's question about the list. Maybe I could see it on the list later, but I wanted to see if you can give any color or narrative around some of the plants that have been chosen -- since we're not going to have access to you when we see those that list -- about what kind of plants we're going to see and also whether any of these are actually closed now and are going to reopen or whether they're all factories that are currently operating.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm happy to jump in again.\n\nSo, we indeed do have some facilities that -- that are closed and are going to be reopening through this program and re-ramping back up in terms of production.\n\nAnd in terms of the (inaudible) facilities, you're going to see vehicle components manufacturing as well as full-vehicle assembly. And that is across different vehicle types: light-duty passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, and even, you know, (inaudible) in the two-wheeler space. So, you know, a broad range of -- of vehicle types and including some facilities that are going to be coming back online through this program.\n\nQ Great. Thanks for doing this call. Grant Schwab here with the Detroit News. Just wanted to ask: What kind of application process was there for these grants, and how many applicants did you guys get?\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Hi. Yes. So, we -- you know, all of the DOE awards go through a rigorous merit review process. This included a concept paper initial submission, followed by full applications. I will say that the program was heavily oversubscribed. You know, our concept paper phase was more -- more than a four-to-one ratio of what the ultimate funds were -- were ultimately allocated.\n\nWe can't speak to the specific companies that applied, but we had a wide range of applications, which, you know, is also reflected in the ultimate selections that span, as [senior administration official] mentioned, the -- the supply chain and ultimate assembly.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And to underscore -- so, you know, very competitive merit review process as we go through with all of our grants at the Department. This program had a particular focus on labor.\n\nSo, we really dug in and tried to understand how facilities were planning to not only just, you know, convert the design of their manufacturing facilities to produce new products but how they were going to bring that workforce along with them and actually, you know, retrain, reskill, and ensure that, you know, the support was provided to workforce to be able to -- to kind of come in to the site and attain a high-paying job through the course of this ramp-up and ultimately post-conversion.\n\nMR. FERN\u00c1NDEZ HERN\u00c1NDEZ: Thank you. We'll go to Ben next. You should be unmuted now.\n\nQ Hi. Thanks. So, one thing I'm wondering is: Will 100 percent of the output of these facilities -- whether they're automakers or elsewhere in the supply chain, will 100 percent of the output of facilities receiving funding need to be for electric vehicles specifically?\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So, we take electric vehicles as a very broad term. So, EVs -- so, the output from these facilities, some of that is relevant for fuel cell vehicles, hybrid vehicles, as well as fully battery electric vehicles. So, a broad range of new high-growth vehicle (inaudible) will be supported.\n\nMR. FERN\u00c1NDEZ HERN\u00c1NDEZ: And we have about time for two more questions. We will go to Matthew next. You should be unmuted now.\n\nQ In the press release, you mentioned this is not a commitment by DOE to actually award this money. So, what timeframe are we talking about actually getting this money out the door? And if you could just go again a little bit more into your criteria for how these companies were selected, since you have not given us a list of who's -- who's won the money.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So, as we move forward in our standard process, our first step is to make our selections. That means that we are going to move into negotiations with each of the companies, and we are going to work through actually creating budget periods and milestones for each of the companies that will unlock tranches of this funding.\n\nSo, you know, we're not handing out all of the funding at once but actually working with the company to align the funding to their construction plan and, you know, be able to have that clear -- clear milestones that need to be met for the next tranche of funding to be unlocked. And that activity -- negotiation activity usually takes a few months, and we will initiate it tomorrow, right after we make those selection announcements.\n\nAs to the second question on the criteria, our criteria are, you know, as mentioned, the commercial viability and the strength of the plan. First and foremost, the labor and, you know, the strength of the plan that the company had around actually retaining and re- -- for maintaining the staff to work in these facilities and as well as adding new jobs.\n\nAnd then, you know, we also look at the technical merit of the solution that they're going to be producing and pulling forward. That is, of course, in the -- all in the context of having a strong community benefits plan, even, you know, outside of labor and making sure that these projects are structured in a way that gives them a license to operate for the long run and that they continue to be part of our history of American automotive manufacturing.\n\nMR. FERN\u00c1NDEZ HERN\u00c1NDEZ: Thank you. And our final question will come from David. You should be unmuted now.\n\nQ Hey, thanks for this. Thanks. I may have missed this part. But so, are we going to get the full list? When will we get the full list of the projects? Is that tomorrow? Is it a date down the road?\n\nMR. FERN\u00c1NDEZ HERN\u00c1NDEZ: We'll have that list for you a little -- a little later today.\n\nQ Okay, thanks.\n\nAnd can you -- just in terms of what the companies have to commit to -- right? -- as part of getting these awards -- you know, what are the clawback provisions? Do they have to commit to specific job totals, commit to keeping the plants open for a specified period?\n\nAnd even on the case of some of these awards, you know, this is for projects that might not start for a couple of years. Is the government basically holding the money back until those -- those projects begin?\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Go -- go ahead. Sorry.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, absolutely. So, the companies are committing to a production schedule in terms of ramping up manufacturing capacities and new products. For facilities that are shuttered and reopening, that involves, you know, reactivating these facilities. And so, as part of that, we have, you know, our usual milestones around new equipment delivery, groundbreaking and construction that's happening.\n\nThere's also a training and reskilling schedule around workforce, as well as, you know, ultimate targets around number of jobs retained and number of jobs added.\n\nSo, you know, the companies that made commitments over the course of the application process, we are going to layer those commitments into time now in our negotiation window. And as the company meets those milestones -- which extend to production milestones as well as workforce milestones and community benefits milestones -- they will unlock, you know, the next measured amount of capital. We typically -- it depends on each project. Each project is (inaudible).\n\nBut we -- we have a series of budget periods, and we define those with the company upfront before we finalize the award. And then the company will kind of move forward into that process, so there won't be any kind of, you know, holding back that the company is not expecting. Rather, we -- we align on that schedule upfront and then hope to expeditiously move forward.\n\nMR. FERN\u00c1NDEZ HERN\u00c1NDEZ: Thank you so much. And that's all the time we have today.\n\nAs a reminder, the contents of this call and the materials you will receive over email are embargoed until 5:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow.", "source": {"uri":

The Project consists of two phases where American Autoparts will convert its existing ICE complete chassis assembly plant located at the Stellantis Toledo Assembly Complex, into a PHEV and ICE complete chassis assembly plant, retaining 345 UAW union jobs and creating an estimated 38 new union labor jobs supporting the manufacture of a new light PHEV truck, and construct a new battery system assembly plant located at the new 285,000 square-foot spec building Mobis North America facility at the Toledo Trade Centre Industrial Park, the former site of the North Town Square Mall, creating 185 new jobs and manufacturing battery packs for PHEV SUVs, PHEV light trucks and PHEV minivans. The total project cost is $65,235,758, with American Autoparts and Mobis North America matching DOE's $32,617,879 investment. This award follows the announcement of an initial investment of $13.8 Million by Mobis North America in their new North Toledo facility in December 2023.\n\nThis is part of $1.7 Billion in DOE announced funding to support the conversion of 11 auto manufacturing and assembly facilities across eight states -- Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, and Virginia -- to manufacture electric vehicles and build their supply chain. This announcement reflects the commitment to reinvest and revitalize - and never give up on -- the manufacturing communities and the workers who have helped build America's middle class. These investments will create and retain thousands of good-paying union jobs and support the American auto communities that have driven the US economy for generations. They deliver on the commitment to ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers, and that the US wins the competition for the 21st century.\n\n\"Late last year, we saw Mobis invest $13.8 Million toward construction of a new battery plant that will create 185 new jobs in North Toledo -- now we know this was just a down payment on the future of our city, our region, and our people. I am proud today to join Secretary Granholm and the Department of Energy in announcing an additional investment of more than $65 Million, half of which will be Federal, to advance construction of the new battery plant and to convert Mobis' existing chassis assembly plant at the Stellantis Toledo Assembly Complex into a facility that will support the manufacture of the Jeep Gladiator Plug-In Electric Hybrid Vehicle,\" said Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (OH-09). \"This DOE award of over $32 Million is an investment in the green economy and the working people who will keep the automotive heart of our Nation beating strongly in Northwest Ohio. Today we further the creation of hundreds of good-paying jobs, while safeguarding hundreds more, including those of 354 members of the United Auto Workers.\"\n\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,\" said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. \"Even as our competitors invest heavily in electric vehicles, these grants ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive -- and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations.\"\n\n\"President Biden set out to build a clean energy economy that benefits everyone,\" said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. \"Today's awards from the Department of Energy help bring that vision to life by investing in the future of the auto industry, creating thousands of good-paying union jobs, and tackling the existential threat of climate change by cutting pollution from the transportation sector.\"\n\n\"Today's announcement from the Department of Energy is a big win for the American people and demonstrates President Biden's bold vision for how we are choosing to take on the climate crisis: with America's workers leading the way,\" said Assistant to the President and National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi. \"This ground-breaking program is central to catalyzing expansion of the industrial capacity to help us meet the President's climate goals and allow tens of thousands of skilled American workers to participate in the great comeback story of American manufacturing.\"\n\nThe Domestic Manufacturing Auto Conversion Grants program helps ensure that the US continues to lead the world in auto manufacturing, led by the communities and workers who know this business best. The selectees will negotiate for awards to enable them to manufacture products covering a broad range of the automotive supply chain, including parts for electric motorcycles and school buses, hybrid powertrains, heavy-duty commercial truck batteries, and electric SUVs. Today's announcement complements the $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing spurred to date by the President's Investing in America agenda. This program also supports the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to strengthen domestic supply chains, support American workers, and bolster America's global leadership in manufacturing.\n\nThe award selections are subject to negotiations to ensure that commitments to workers and communities are met. DOE will also complete environmental reviews to ensure that the awards are consistent with the Administration's commitments to clean, environmentally responsible manufacturing, and include appropriate mitigation as needed. If awarded, the selected projects would collectively create over 2,900 new high-quality jobs and help ensure over 15,000 highly skilled union workers are retained across all eleven facilities.\n\nThe Domestic Auto Manufacturing Conversion Grants program, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, invests in the domestic production of efficient hybrid, plug-in electric hybrid, plug-in electric drive, and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles. This program aims to expand manufacturing of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty electrified vehicles and components and support commercial facilities including those for vehicle assembly, component assembly, and related vehicle part manufacturing.\n\nSelection for award negotiations is not a commitment by DOE to issue an award or provide funding. Before funding is issued, DOE and the applicants will undergo a negotiation process, and DOE may cancel negotiations and rescind the selection for any reason during that time. The funding for the Domestic Auto Manufacturing Conversion Grants will be administered by DOE's Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC).

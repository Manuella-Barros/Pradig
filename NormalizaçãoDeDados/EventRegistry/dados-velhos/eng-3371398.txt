The new Showtime documentary, Whitney: Can I Be Me, includes footage of her world tour in 1999.\n\nWas she the radiantly beautiful pop princess who earned the love of mainstream America with enduring hits like I Will Always Love You?\n\nWas she the down-to-Earth onetime gospel singer from the 'hood in Newark who couldn't believe when the crowd at the 1989 Soul Train Awards booed her as a sellout to black music?\n\nOr was she the unstable celebrity struggling with drug problems and an enabling husband, let down by those closest to her and isolated by her fame?\n\nThe new documentary film Whitney: Can I Be Me suggests that the struggle to balance all of these issues and more -- an identity crisis of superstar proportions -- helped lead to the death of one of the best singers in pop music.\n\nThe movie opens in theaters today and airs on Showtime next Friday. It channels the voices of friends, backing musicians, former record company staffers and ex-employees to tell an intimate, tragic story.\n\n\"Success doesn't change you; fame does,\" Houston says in a 1996 interview featured in the film. \"You got a whole world of people calling your name and you really don't know them... [Do people think] when we become famous that we have these beautiful perfect lives and nothing is ever on a low? It's a bad conception, because... money doesn't make you happy. It never did.\"\n\nWhitney: Can I Be Me offers a story that references how race and class work in America, presenting Houston as a superstar whose early success locked her into a public image seriously at odds with her real life.\n\nHouston's saxophonist, Kirk Whalum, summed it up in a quote that became the title of the film.\n\n\"Her favorite saying was, 'Can I be me?'\" he says. \"In fact, she would say it so much that we had it sampled: 'C-c-c-c-can I be me?' That was the conundrum. Like, 'Damnit, I have made all this money and made all these people happy. And I still can't be me.'\"\n\nDirected by Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal, the film shows Houston's career starting when the world of pop music was more strictly segregated.\n\nAccording to former Arista records marketing executive Kenneth Reynolds, record company founder Clive Davis crafted Houston's early records by avoiding material which sounded too close to R&B - in other words, \"too black.\"\n\nReynolds explains: \"The company had this image in mind that they were going to create a pop icon. An artist that was accepted by the masses, translating to white America ... Her music was deliberately pop. Anything that was too black-sounding was sent back to the studio.\"\n\nHouston, the daughter of gospel singer Cissy Houston and a cousin of singer Dionne Warwick, had a carefully crafted, girl-next-door image.\n\nBut that fa\u00e7ade was threatened when rumors surfaced about Houston's close ties to longtime friend and assistant Robyn Crawford. The film quotes a friend who says Houston was bisexual; journalist Allison Samuels also speaks about it in the film.\n\n\"It wasn't cool to have a lesbian affair,\" Samuels says. \"If she was an artist today, she'd be fine. Everything would be lovely. She probably would still be here. But back then, there was this tremendous emphasis on being the perfect girl.\"\n\nThere are other stories. An old friend notes she and Houston used drugs together as teenagers. A former bodyguard says he was fired when he tried to alert Houston's managers to rampant drug use by the singer and those around her. Another friend says Houston's husband, bad boy R&B singer Bobby Brown, wasn't faithful and intensified their use of substances.\n\nThere's even an interview with Burt Bacharach, who helped lead the orchestra for the 72nd Academy Awards broadcast in 2000. He says Houston was yanked from the performing lineup of that show when she seemed erratic and unpredictable during rehearsals.\n\n\"It was like a train wreck... kinda startling,\" Bacharach says. \"It was so dangerous. This is live television...[If] she sang the wrong song, nobody would know what to do. Ray Charles wouldn't know how to cover that.\"\n\nThe film suggests that, when Crawford exited the singer's life after one too many arguments with Bobby Brown, Houston's drug use accelerated. She accidentally drowned in a hotel bathtub on Feb. 11, 2012.\n\nThe biggest problem here: Because the film is unauthorized by Houston's estate, Broomfield and Dolezal lack access to the most crucial people in her story.\n\nThere are no original interviews with Clive Davis, Bobby Brown or Houston's mother Cissy Houston; they appear in clips from other media outlets. There is never-before-seen backstage footage from the singer's 1999 world tour and interviews with Crawford recorded then, but no recent footage.\n\nStill, Whitney: Can I Be Me provides a compelling portrait of a supreme talent isolated by fame, dysfunctional relationships and a crushing drug habit, slowly diminished by the same qualities that originally made her a superstar.", "date":

As more than one person says, her voice sounded like it came directly from God.\n\nCo-directed by Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal and playing a qualifying theatrical run before airing on Showtime, \"Whitney's\" story makes for strong and compelling viewing even though it has something of a cobbled together feel to it.\n\nHouston's trajectory has uncanny echoes of the tragedy of Amy Winehouse, but \"Whitney\" is not the seamless piece of work Asif Kapadia's Oscar-winning \"Amy\" was.\n\nAside from stock and home movie footage, this film is divided between on-camera interviews conducted by veteran documentarian Bloomfield (\"Tales of the Grim Sleeper,\" \"Biggie and Tupac\" plus many others) and never before seen footage of Houston's legendary 1999 European tour by music video veteran and co-director Dolezal.\n\nThat footage has some extraordinary performance moments, including Houston's heartbreaking rendition of \"I Will Always Love You\" from the tour's Frankfurt stop that opens the film and lifts you off your feet.\n\nBroomfield, for his part, was hampered by the fact that he was not able to interview key people in Houston's life, including ex-husband Bobby Brown, her closest friend Robyn Crawford, and Clive Davis, the Svengali who began her career. So he shrewdly chose to go another route.\n\nThe director has elicited candid, emotional interviews with those who worked with Houston, including members of her band and her personal retinue. (David Roberts, her longtime personal security and the model for Kevin Costner's character in Houston's breakout film \"The Bodyguard,\" is especially frank.)\n\nThough stories of extensive drug use and sexual tensions can make the film feel exploitative at times, the gap between Houston's enormous talent and her truncated life means that more than anything else the tale related here will simply make you sad. \"Whitney actually died from a broken heart,\" one of her band members says, and that seems like it could actually be true.\n\nBroomfield's take, as his film's plaintive title indicates, is that managing the ever-increasing gap between who the singer was and who the people who made money off her -- including her family -- wanted her to be, became too much for her to handle, a situation drug use did nothing to improve.\n\nThough mainstream America perceived her as a princess, Houston was born in Newark, N.J., and, more than one interviewee says, \"came from the hood.\"\n\nBorn into a musical family (Dionne Warwick was her cousin), Houston was taught to sing by her mother Cissy, a domineering figure who was herself a Grammy-winning gospel singer. Though singing in the church was important to the young girl, her two older brothers admit early drug use and the implication is that she became involved as well.\n\nHouston met Robyn Crawford, who was to become her closest friend, confidant and protector, while they were both in high school. The film inconclusively speculates that they might have been lovers as well, but what everyone agrees on is that the relationship with Crawford was a safe place Houston could count on.\n\nThe singer was signed to an Arista recording contract by Davis when she was but 19, young enough to be moldable by him into a crossover pop artist who was not allowed to \"sound too black,\" according to Arista executives.\n\nFrom a commercial point of view, that ploy was successful, leading to more consecutive No. 1 hits than the Beatles, but there was backlash in the black community, which culminated in Houston being booed at the 1989 Soul Train awards show.\n\n\"That moment was devastating,\" says saxophonist Kirk Whalum. \"I don't think she ever recovered. When the boxes are ticked on why she perished, that was a big one.\"\n\nThat Soul Train evening was also when Houston met Bobby Brown, a singer with a bad-boy image. Their connection to each other was undeniable -- they married and had a daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, who died in 2015 of \"undetermined\" causes -- but the film says he did not help in the substance abuse area.\n\nMore critically, as impromptu footage of them together makes clear, Brown and Crawford were oil and water. Crawford was out of the picture by 2000, and that crucial support was missed as the marriage crumbled and the drug problem went unsolved. As with Amy Winehouse, despite all the money she made for so many people, no one around her was able to step in and make a difference. A familiar story, perhaps, but always a tragic one.\n\n------------\n\n\"Whitney: Can I Be Me?\"\n\nNot rated\n\nRunning time: 1 hour, 28 minutes\n\nPlaying: Laemmle's Music Hall\n\nSee the most-read

Can't I sing the kind of songs I want to? Put out the kind of album I want to? Just be me, here?\n\nBut as the new documentary \"Whitney: Can I Be Me\" insists, it went much deeper than that.\n\nHouston, it claims, was an eyes-wide-open young woman from Newark and East Orange who liked to party hard and clown around, whose first real love had been another woman. That was who she was.\n\nBut little of that fit the perfect, pristine, pop-princess image that had been constructed for her, almost from the beginning. And keeping that real \"me\" out of sight could take a terrible toll.\n\nThe sharp, well-edited film is credited to Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal, but Dolezal - a German filmmaker known primarily for Falco videos -- is really only named here because of the use of his extensive (and very good) footage from Houston's 1999 European tour.\n\nIn fact, this is truly Broomfield's movie - a plus to fans of the British director, and perhaps a worry to fans of Houston. The pushy Broomfield is known for inserting himself into the stories he covers; he also has a weakness for conspiracy theories (as in his hugely watchable, but mostly irresponsible, \"Kurt & Courtney\").\n\nThis movie, though - which has been pared down a bit since its Tribeca Film Festival debut - accepts the circumstances of Houston's death, and keeps Broomfield to an offscreen, only occasionally overheard presence. The focus, instead, is on the late star, her career, her troubles, her legacy. And her mourners.\n\nNot everyone is here, though -- and missing in action are the most prominent of her survivors, many of whom have exclusively committed to a competing, authorized documentary.\n\nSo don't look for ex-husband Bobby Brown, mom Cissy Houston or mentor Clive Davis - none of whom appear, except in old clips. Houston's lifelong friend (and, the film says, sometime lover) Robyn Crawford is quoted, but it's only her words we see onscreen. It all leaves a huge gap.\n\nStill, there's footage of Houston, already eerily good, singing as a 12-year-old in church. Reminiscences from back-up singers and hair stylists of how hard she pushed herself. And while there are no reality-TV horrors from \"Being Bobby Brown\" - thankfully - there are home-movie moments, including Houston and hubby playacting their way through \"What's Love Got to do With It.\"\n\nAnd there's a sense of Houston's own struggle to define and redefine herself, facing cruel charges that she \"wasn't black enough\" (her name once drew boos at a Soul Train awards show), running away from stories about her \"real\" relationship with Crawford (knowing that the gossip would hurt not only her image, but her relationship with her mother).\n\nNow add to that substance abuse (she always used drugs, an insider says, and Brown always drank, and once they married they combined their habits). You can almost hear the clock begin to tick. This is not going to go on forever. And it is not going to end well.\n\nThe movie, and some of Houston's relatives, find it easy to blame Brown for it. Houston met him the same night she'd been booed at the awards show; the relationship, some suggest, gave her street cred. \"I was fly,\" Brown bragged later. \"I knew it. She knew it.\"\n\nHe wasn't a good influence on her. But he certainly wasn't the only bad one.\n\nAnd the saddest thing is, people saw that. Her long-time, real-life bodyguard - the source of perhaps the film's most detailed interviews - witnessed how she was abusing her voice, and herself. At one point, he wrote a brutally detailed letter - reproduced here -- telling everyone at her management company she was in peril.\n\nHis contract was not renewed. She went back to work.\n\nBy the end of the film we've come full-circle to where the film began - back to the 911 calls, back to the hotel room where Houston was found dead in her bathtub, back to an ambulance engulfed with the ever-present paparazzi. Colleagues and family appear on screen and pay their final respects. But the saddest, sweetest last words, appearing on screen, come from the friend who loved her first, and best.\n\n\"She didn't look like anyone I'd ever seen in East Orange,\" Crawford remembers, still in awe. \"She looked like an angel.\"", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri":

His prying questions and incessant voice-overs suggest a cross between a Fleet Street reporter and the Energizer Bunny.\n\nFor better or worse, Mr. Broomfield's sleazy style gives his documentaries personality. Thus, viewers of his conspiracy-minded films about the deaths of other stars (\"Kurt and Courtney,\" \"Biggie and Tupac\") may feel duped by \"Whitney: Can I Be Me,\" a surprisingly conventional, dutifully respectful behind-the-scenes portrait of Whitney Houston's rise and struggles with fame and drugs before her death at 48. (A competing Houston documentary has been announced.)\n\nAs the movie intercuts testimonials from Ms. Houston's friends, family and collaborators with footage from her 1999 tour -- shot by Rudi Dolezal, who shares directing credit -- Mr. Broomfield is heard only occasionally and never shown. We learn about the forces that weighed on the superstar singer, including the criticism she faced for embracing pop instead of rhythm and blues; speculation about her sexuality; and, in the movie's telling, the feud between her husband, Bobby Brown, and Robyn Crawford, her friend and possible lover.\n\nSkillful editing of old interviews makes it difficult to keep track of who agreed to participate (and some songs, such as \"I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me),\" are noticeable by their absence). The most charged assertions come from Ms. Houston's former bodyguard David Roberts, who says his warnings about the singer's need for help went unheeded.

Rumors about Houston's sexuality take on a different hue juxtaposed with a clip of her mother, Cissy Houston, telling Oprah Winfrey after Whitney's death that she \"absolutely\" would have been upset to learn that her daughter was a lesbian.As for Houston's career, the filmmakers detail how her talents were consciously marketed to a white audience -- a lucrative decision that cost her with the African-American community, where many saw her as a sellout. Those sentiments are illustrated when Houston was booed at the Soul Train Awards by those who felt, as a friend told her, that \"the white audience had taken you away from them.\"\"Whitney\" deftly draws from interviews, behind-the-scenes footage and performance video that highlights the way Houston threw her every fiber into concerts, yielding a spare but sobering account.

And the tragic nature of her death in 2012 at age 48 is heightened by a coda regarding her daughter, Bobby Kristina, who was only 22 when she died three years later.Although it's not used in the title, \"Can I Be Me\" frames an unanswered question -- namely, whether Houston's life might have unfolded differently had she been allowed to be herself, instead of being squeezed into certain boxes to meet the expectations and demands of an adoring but judgmental public.Admittedly, there's considerable familiarity in stories of tortured artists, with Broomfield having previously directed \"Kurt & Courtney,\" about Kurt Cobain.In some ways, these films play like a real-life version of \"A Star is Born\" -- a classic melodrama ruminating on the price of stardom. Houston's enormous success -- including a string of hit songs and breakout movie role in \"The Bodyguard\" -- ultimately became a cage that closed in around her.Seen that way, \"Whitney\" itself operates on two levels -- delivering another cautionary tale about the price of fame, but also a tribute to a voice so big and buoyant that it continues to echo long after her death. \"Whitney. Can I Be Me\" will receive limited theatrical release on Aug. 18 in New York and Los Angeles and air Aug. 25 at 9 p.m. on Showtime.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "type": "loc", "id": "198406"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302767", "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304269", "label": {"eng": "Cnn.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304393", "label": {"eng": "African American"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306262", "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307245", "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "307888", "label": {"eng": "Kurt Cobain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Messenger", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "308970", "label": {"eng": "Facebook Messenger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313076", "label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "313764", "label": {"eng": "Oprah Winfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_Houston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314801", "label": {"eng": "Whitney Houston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "327247", "label": {"eng": "Bobby Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodrama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "333916", "label": {"eng": "Melodrama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bodyguard_(1992_film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "471305", "label": {"eng": "The Bodyguard (1992 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Train_Music_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "564974", "label": {"eng": "Soul Train Music Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cissy_Houston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "683723", "label": {"eng": "Cissy Houston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Broomfield", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "687408", "label": {"eng": "Nick Broomfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_&_Courtney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "954402", "label": {"eng": "Kurt & Courtney"}}]}], "totalResults": 8, "pages": 8}}}

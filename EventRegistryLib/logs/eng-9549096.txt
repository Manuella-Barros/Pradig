All three are in the national team.\n\nBukit Aman CID director Comm Datuk Seri Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain said they have noticed that the attacks occurred in two-day intervals.\n\n\"Our investigations also show that the players involved were tailed prior to the attacks. The assailants also worked in pairs in all three cases,\" he told reporters yesterday.\n\nBased on the attacks, he said it seems like there had been some preparations prior to the attacks.\n\nComm

the Bukit Aman CID Special Investigation Unit took over the case, Comm Mohd Shuhaily said this was done so all investigations could be coordinated.\n\n\"The cases occurred in three states: Terengganu, Selangor and Johor.\n\n\"Seeing that the cases all occurred in other states, we decided that Bukit Aman should coordinate the probes,\" he said, adding that they are also looking at the possibility that the cases were connected to the poison pen letter on the Football Association of Malaysia last month.\n\nThe letter contained several allegations, some concerning abuse of power in the association, exorbitant salaries and benefits for staff, issues involving the Harimau Malaya squad and the national training centre project.\n\nThe FAM leadership had come under criticism following the circulation of the poison pen letter and the recent unsatisfactory performance of the national senior and Under-23 squads.\n\nThe Malaysia lost all its matches in the recent Under-23 Asian Cup, while the senior team lost 0-2 to Oman in World Cup/Asian Cup qualifiers on March 22.\n\nOn the suspect now under remand, Comm Mohd Shuhaily said the individual has seven cases on his record.\n\n\"The suspect has been arrested for misuse of network facilities, voluntarily causing hurt using a dangerous weapon, gang robbery, impersonating a civil servant, criminal intimidation and extortion,\" he said, while advising all players to be more cautious of their surroundings.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But investigators have not determined whether the cases were linked.\n\nFaisal Halim, who plays as a winger for the national team and Malaysian club Selangor, was hospitalized with fourth-degree burns following an acid attack by two assailants at a shopping mall on Sunday. He was reported to be in critical but stable condition, with limited movement and speech.\n\nJust three days earlier, another prominent national team player, Akhyar Rashid, was assaulted in a robbery outside his house in eastern Terengganu state after his return from training. He was hit with an iron rod, leaving him head and leg injuries. His attackers fled after taking money from him.\n\nLate Tuesday, former national team captain Safiq Rahim was tailed by two assailants on a motorbike after a training session in southern Johor state. They later threatened him with a hammer and smashed his car's rear window but he was not physically hurt.\n\n\"Our investigations also showed that the players involved were tailed prior to the attacks. The perpetrators also worked in pairs in all the attacks,\" Shuhaily, the investigation chief, was quoted as saying by English-language daily The Star.\n\nTwo people were initially detained over Faisal's attack, but one was later released.\n\nShuhaily said police were studying the possibility that the attacks could be linked to a recent letter sent to the Malaysian soccer federation (FAM) accusing it of mismanagement of funds, bribery and fraud. However, the country's anti-graft agency has found those accusations baseless.\n\nPolice urged professional footballers to be vigilant while the investigation is ongoing, while FAM has suggested that star players consider hiring bodyguards.\n\nThe Selangor club has launched a solidarity campaign for Faisal, while Safiq's Johor team has boosted the security of its players.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal_Halim", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faisal Halim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhyar_Rashid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Akhyar Rashid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selangor", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selangor"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Selangor"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terengganu", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terengganu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Terengganu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safiq_Rahim", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safiq Rahim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football Association of Malaysia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_(Malaysia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Star (Malaysia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johor", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johor"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Johor"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549096", "eventUri": "eng-9549096", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

We will not compromise on matters related to the safety of the team,\" it said while apologising for the inconvenience.\n\nFollowing Selangor FC's withdrawal, the Malaysian Football League has awarded JDT a walkover victory with a 3-0 scoreline, granting them the initial three points in the 2024/2025 M-League.\n\nNeedless to say, all this has fueled wild speculation on social media\n\nAn individual by the name of Muhammad Imran Suresh alleged that he had been called in by the police as he had information but was asked to keep his mouth shut from revealing the motive behind the assaults.\n\nThe individual had posted conspiracy theories on his Instagram Stories. However, SAYS is choosing not to share them as the claims cannot be verified.\n\nBukit Aman Criminal Investigations Department director Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain dismissed the allegations, saying that rumours of a conspiracy are not true.\n\n\"We will brush these (claims) off at this juncture. That's all speculation for the time being,\" he said, adding that the individual's Instagram account was found to be fake.\n\n\"We are monitoring social media with the assistance of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission. We cannot allow any individual to take advantage and disrupt the situation,\" he added.\n\nSo what's going on?\n\nShuhaily said the police are looking into the possibility that the assaults were linked to accusations levelled at the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) late last month when a so-called poison pen letter went viral.\n\nThe letter accused FAM of abuse of power, mismanaging funds, discrepancies in salaries and benefits, as well as issues with the Harimau Malaya squad and the national training centre project.\n\nHowever, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) dismissed the allegations.\n\nShuhaily then told reporters that the police would now probe if there was any dissatisfaction with MACC's findings, which prompted certain parties to take out their frustration on the national players.\n\nBukit Aman Criminal Investigations Department director Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain (centre).\n\nImage via Hazreen Mohamad/New Straits Times\n\nThe Bukit Aman also said that the attacks followed a pattern\n\nWe have identified the modus operandi... with the assailants working in pairs in all three cases. Mohd Shuhaily\n\nHe said it is believed that the suspects had followed the victims before attacking them.\n\n\"Each time there's an attack, it's done in pairs. They stalk the victim before attacking.\n\n\"These three cases happened two days apart starting from the first case involving Terengganu FC footballer Akhyar Rashid, the second case [involving Selangor FC winger Faisal Halim], and the third one involving [JDT midfielder] Safiq Rahim,\" Sinar Daily quoted him as saying during a press conference yesterday, 8 May.\n\nDespite the similar pattern, Shuhaily insisted that the attacks were not linked to each other as the exact motive has not been determined\n\n\"We have made two arrests so far in connection with Faisal's case. One suspect has been released while the other is still under remand,\" he said, adding that the suspect has seven cases on his record.\n\n\"The suspect has been arrested for misuse of network facilities, voluntarily causing hurt using a dangerous weapon, gang robbery, impersonating a civil servant, criminal intimidation, and extortion,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail has denied rumours that the FAM's senior management is under scrutiny\n\n\"No [they are not being targeted]. I just wanted to meet Faisal,\" Saifuddin told reporters.\n\nOn the other hand, FAM president Datuk Hamidin Mohd Amin, while commenting on Shuhaily's remarks about the poison pen letter, urged for wild speculations to cease, reported Scoop.\n\nHamidin stated that he would also not step down.\n\n\"I know what I'm doing, I am sincere in my work without any hidden agenda. If people think otherwise, there really isn't. So, that statement is each person's assumption... I leave it to the authorities.\n\n\"We need to restore the image of national football so that such incidents do not recur, and we need to address this issue together. So I remind all fans not to speculate further and escalate the situation,\" he said.\n\nImage via Sccop\n\nRead more about the attacks here:\n\nDon't miss out on Malaysia's top stories!\n\nWe'll send a list to your inbox, once a day.\n\nSubscribe now!\n\nThank you!\n\nHappy to have you on board!

CHIEF Minister Datuk Seri Panglima Hajiji Noor's 2021 Hala Tuju Sabah Maju Jaya Plan and the Sabah Economic Development and Investment Authority (SEDIA) have laid out a road map to an exciting future for all Sabahans, with a target of increasing Sabah's income levels and GDP per capita from about RM 23,000 to about RM 40,000 by 2030. Read more Early last month, a poison pen letter went viral on social media accusing FAM of fraud, abuse of power, mismanaging funds, discrepancies in salaries and benefits, and issues with the Harimau Malaya squad and the national training centre (NTC) project.\n\nSubsequently, the media quoted MACC sources as saying that they had not found any irregularities or corruption in the case involving the NTC.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShuhaily said Bukit Aman is now taking over the cases from the respective police headquarters for better coordination.\n\nHe added that so far, police had only identified the pattern in the three cases - they were committed at two-day intervals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The perpetrators come in pairs and tailed their victims before carrying out the attacks. There's some sort of preparation involved,\" he said.\n\nFaisal was splashed with acid at a shopping mall in Kota Damansara on Sunday and suffered fourth-degree burns, while Akhyar was attacked by two robbers after returning from training last Thursday.\n\nYesterday, Safiq, a former national team captain, had his car windscreen smashed with a hammer by unknown assailants who came on a motorcycle.\n\nSeparately, Shuhaily said police had not closed their investigation into the murder of autistic boy Zayn Rayyan Abdul Matiin.\n\n\"I understand that the public is not satisfied with the investigation's progress, but we have not closed the case.\n\n\"If I retire without solving the case, I'll take that as my failure.\"\n\nHe also said police owed it to the public to solve the arson attack on the home of Beruas MP Ngeh Koo Ham.\n\nStay up-to-date by following Daily Express's Telegram channel.\n\nDaily Express Malaysia\n\n* Follow us on Instagram and join our Telegram and/or WhatsApp channel(s) for the latest news you don't want to miss.\n\n* Do you have access to the Daily Express e-paper and online exclusive news?

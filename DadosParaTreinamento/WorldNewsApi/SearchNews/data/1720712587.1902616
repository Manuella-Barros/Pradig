{"id": 232051578, "title": "Soccer Aid shock as Brazilian icon pulls out just hours before kick-off at Stamford Bridge", "text": "Soccer Aid has suffered a significant setback after Roberto Carlos withdrew from the event just hours before the kick-off. The star-studded charity game is scheduled for Sunday evening, but the Brazilian and Real Madrid legend was forced to pull out from the line-up just hours before the start. The celebrated former left-back took to social media to announce his absence. He stated: \"Unfortunately, I'm unable to make tonight's Soccer Aid for UNICEF match at Stamford Bridge. Good luck to all the players - and remember to donate.\" Carlos, 51, enjoyed a stellar career, lifting four La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues with Madrid, as well as the World Cup with his national team in South Korea and Japan in 2002. However, the Rest of the World's line-up is still stacked with former icons like Alessandro Del Piero, Patrice Evra and Eden Hazard. Former world champion boxer Tony Bellew is also in the ranks as is Scotland's Line of Duty star Martin Compston and eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt. England's roster for Sunday's encounter is also littered with ex-pros. Former Rangers striker Jermain Defoe joins Jack Wilshere and Jill Scott as well as Hollywood actor Tom Hiddlestone, comedian and TV personality Paddy McGuinness and former cricket star Stuart Broad. Soccer Aid was first held in 2006 and has raised over \u00a390million in aid of UNICEF UK.

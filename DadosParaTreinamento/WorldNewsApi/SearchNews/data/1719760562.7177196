{"id": 225007234, "title": "Waghtha round 2: Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney face off in new court battle", "text": "The infamous \u2018Wagatha Christie\u2019 case is set to go for a second round court battle, this time over the eye-watering legal costs from the first public showdown. Rebekah Vardy lost her high-profile libel case against Coleen Rooney over the viral July 2022 social media post in which Coleen accused Rebekha of leaking stories from her private Instagram account. After several attempts to settle the matter outside of court failed, the pair battled it out in front of the world\u2019s watching media and a judge found Coleen\u2019s claims as \u201csubstantially true\u201d and ordered Vardy to cover 90% of Rooney\u2019s astronomical legal costs. Coleen reportedly racked up more than \u00a32 million in legal costs to fight the libel claim, however \u00a3350,000 was prior to the trial in May, so Rebkah was ordered to pay \u00a3800,000 of the costs. However, Rooney is now saying this figure was not based on the final total bill and their legal teams are not set to return to the High Court in London before a specialist costs judge.", "summary": "Rebekah Vardy lost her high-profile libel case against Coleen Rooney over the viral July 2022 social media post in which Coleen accused Rebekha of leaking stories from her private Instagram account", "url": "https://www.rsvplive.ie/news/celebs/waghtha-round-2-rebekah-vardy-32916546", "image": "https://i2-prod.rsvplive.ie/incoming/article26959475.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1396829919.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:12:52", "author": "Megan Martin", "authors": ["Megan Martin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.419}

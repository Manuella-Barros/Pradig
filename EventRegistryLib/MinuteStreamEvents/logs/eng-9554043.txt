Jared Polis a last-minute, bipartisan property tax relief bill as the state's 2024 legislative session came to a close.\n\nSenate Bill 233, introduced Monday after months of negotiations, was one of the final bills passed before the General Assembly gavels out for the year. The legislature hopes the bill will persuade voters not to back property tax measures on the November ballot that would ravage state and local government budgets.\n\nThe measure, which would likely save the average homeowner several hundred dollars annually, calls for holding residential and commercial property tax rates steady this year, for taxes owed in 2025. The residential property assessment rate would be 6.7%, with a $55,000 value reduction and the commercial rate would be 27.9%, with a $30,000 value reduction.\n\nBecause the rates are supposed to rise under current law, however, that would cost schools roughly $350 million, money that would be reimbursed out of the state's education fund, which is filled with income tax revenue.\n\nAbout $10 million in reimbursements would be made to local governments that would lose money under the plan compared to their 2022 revenues. The vast majority of the hit to local governments won't be reimbursed, however the revenues in most communities are still growing because of the effect of rising property values on tax bills.\n\nThe legislation was amended slightly as it made its way through the Capitol. The changes after introduction would affect tax years 2025 and beyond, when the real shift in the state's property tax code would begin.\n\nProperty taxes fund schools and other local governments, and the state property assessment rate that determines how much people and businesses owe doesn't differ depending on who is collecting the revenue. That would change under Senate Bill 233, with one rate for schools and another for all local governments.\n\nThe school rate for residential properties would be higher to prevent K-12 losses that the state would have to pay for out of its budget. (Schools make up the largest share of Colorado property tax bills.)\n\nIn 2025, the residential property assessment rate for local governments would drop to 6.4%. It would go up to 7.15% for schools. The commercial property tax assessment rate would drop to 27%. Additionally, a 5.5% cap on local government property tax revenue growth would be enacted -- and remain in perpetuity -- that could only be overridden by a local referendum. (The cap wouldn't apply to schools.)\n\nFor the 2026 tax year, the residential assessment rate for local governments would be set at 6.95%. Homeowners would also receive a 10% exemption from taxation on their properties' value, up to $70,000. The commercial rate would decrease to 25% and stay there in perpetuity.\n\nThe residential assessment rate would remain at 7.15% in perpetuity unless local property tax revenue statewide makes up 60% of K-12 funding.\n\nColoradans' property taxes will still be higher than they were in 2022, before rising property values led to increased tax bills, but if Senate Bill 233 is signed into law they won't be as high as they would have been.\n\nThe other major change made to Senate Bill 233 during the legislative process is that it would be repealed if voters in November pass Initiative 50, which would cap the annual statewide increase in property tax revenue at 4%, or or Initiative 108, which would take a chainsaw to the state's property tax assessment rates. The measures are backed by the conservative political nonprofit Advance Colorado and Colorado Concern, a nonprofit that represents the state's CEOs.\n\nOnly Initiative 50 has qualified for the ballot. The proponents of Initiative 108 would have to collect about 125,000 voter signatures by early August to get that question on the ballot, too.\n\nRep. Lisa Frizell, a Castle Rock Republican and one of the main sponsors of Senate Bill 233, said if both the legislation and one or both of the initiatives were to be enacted it would be a financial disaster for the state.\n\nIn fact, Frizell said that would be \"catastrophic.\"\n\nInitiative 108 would have an estimated $3 billion effect in its first year and require the legislature to reimburse schools and local governments for that revenue reduction. That's roughly 8% of the entire state budget.\n\nSenate Bill 233 passed the Senate by a 33-2 vote. It passed the House 57-6. The measure cleared the legislature in three days, the minimum amount of time it takes to pass a bill.", "source": {"uri": "coloradosun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Colorado Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jesse_paul@coloradosun.com", "name": "Jesse Paul", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tax assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Polis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jared Polis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_session", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislative session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Frizell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Frizell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government budget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Rock,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Castle Rock, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Castle Rock, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/housing-luxury-development-castle-rock-douglas-county-os-23-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554043", "eventUri": "eng-9554043", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

School districts will see a $560 million reduction, but will be made mostly whole by state funding from other revenue sources.\n\nCould lawmakers have justified a larger tax cut given the confluence of events that led to 40% increases in property taxes in some jurisdictions? Yes, but compromise is king. Democrats are coming to the table and reducing revenues as governments are hit hard by inflation, rising wages, and construction costs. Republicans are getting behind a more modest cut recognizing the importance of holding our underfunded schools harmless.\n\nThe only caveat to our praise is disappointment that after an extensive public process before the 2024 legislative session to solicit ideas for property tax cuts, lawmakers introduced the bill with only three days remaining in the legislative session. This cannot become the norm. Bills are required by law to have a public vetting and while hammering out details behind closed doors may be effective, it is not transparent.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, Senate Bill 233 is good public policy.\n\nWe appreciate that Sen. Chris Hansen, a Democrat from Denver, and Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Republican from Weld County, crossed partisan lines to get this bill to Gov. Jared Polis' desk. Reps. Chris deGruy Kennedy and Lisa Frizell were the House sponsors and both worked on the interim Commission on Property Tax to help develop the intricate tax policy with Hansen before session even began.\n\nThe compromise bill will mean that the owner of an average Denver home, where property taxes are among the lowest in the state, will save about $300 a year compared to their tax bill if no agreement had been made and property taxes reverted to where they were before temporary relief was passed in the 2023 special session.\n\nBut the real savings will come in the future, as Senate Bill 233 also caps future increases of property tax revenue to 5.5% per year. School districts and home-rule local governments are excluded from the cap.\n\nVoters can override the cap, although we would urge they exercise caution as property values could increase astronomically if the Federal Reserve lowers the interest rates.\n\nDespite Kirkmeyer and Frizell's support, two conservative groups still plan to bring competing property tax cuts to the ballot this fall. One would lower the state-wide assessment rate by at least $2 billion, and another would put a hard cap on the growth of property tax collections at 4%. Both measures would mean bigger tax cuts for Coloradans, but the cost to counties and school districts would be heavy.\n\nColorado will be better off under the legislatively developed property tax cuts and cap -- rushed as it was this week -- than anything we have seen proposed for the ballot box this fall. Colorado has historically kept taxes low and we are glad the General Assembly under Democrat control and Gov. Jared Polis' leadership have continued the tradition.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_district_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special district (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallagher_Amendment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gallagher Amendment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_session", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislative session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Frizell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Frizell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Kirkmeyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbara Kirkmeyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

He has held positions in, and has deep experience with, expense auditing, personal finance, real estate, as well as fact checking & editing.\n\nProperty taxes are a primary source of revenue for many local governments. They're also a significant expense for homeowners, year in and year out. Even after you've paid off your mortgage, you'll still get a property tax bill. The starting point for that bill is your property tax assessment. If you know how it's calculated, you'll have an idea of what your bill is likely to be each year. Then you can budget accordingly, avoid ugly surprises and spot any costly errors on your bill.\n\nYour property tax assessment is determined on a certain date. In many jurisdictions, that assessed value is decided annually. In some jurisdictions, however, it's done every three years, only when the property is transferred, or on another schedule. In some areas, the assessed value is the market value; in other areas, the market value is multiplied by an assessment rate to determine the assessed value.\n\nExemptions might include a decrease in the assessed value of your property if you are an owner-occupant (sometimes called a homestead exemption). The decrease in your property's assessed value says nothing about the actual market value of your property, but it does help lower your tax bill.\n\nThe property tax rate, also called a multiplier, or mill rate is a percentage (expressed in decimal form) by which the assessed value of your property is multiplied to determine your tax bill.\n\nProperty taxes pay for things like public schools, community colleges, libraries, local government employees' salaries, parks and recreation, sanitation, sewer, police and fire protection, roads, and other local needs such as mosquito control. Each of these items can have its own percentage rate that is multiplied by the assessed value of your property to determine a portion of your bill. The taxes you owe for each item are totaled to determine your final property tax bill.\n\nWhat Affects Your Property Tax Bill?\n\nIn addition to the assessed value of your property, your bill is based on what your property is used for (residential, agricultural, apartment, office, commercial, vacant land, and so on). Some uses -- such as land and buildings used for religious or spiritual purposes -- may exempt these properties from taxes. Different uses may be taxed at different rates, but taxation should be at a uniform rate -- that is, the multiplier should be the same for all properties in the same category. Within that category, factors such as your property's size, construction type, age, and location can affect your tax rate.\n\nIf property tax bills are based on current real estate values in your area, you can expect differences in your bill from year to year. Even if your bill is not affected by the market value of your property, it can still be affected by changes in the tax rate for any component of the property tax.\n\nTax authorities can increase your bill by increasing the assessed value of your property and/or by increasing the tax rate. Likewise, they can lower your bill by decreasing the assessed value of your property and/or by decreasing the tax rate.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nRemember, property taxes are one of the most crucial bills to pay. If you don't pay, you could lose your home. If you're late, you'll have to pay interest and penalties. Some areas offer assistance to special groups such as veterans, people who welfare benefits, people with disabilities such as blindness, and aging adults. Also, if your property is severely damaged or destroyed, consult your assessor's office to see if you are eligible for tax relief.\n\nProperty tax laws are set at the local level and can vary significantly depending on where you live, so the information in this article is only meant to give you a general idea of what to expect.

One for school districts, with a higher assessment rate, and one for local governments, with a lower assessment rate.\n\nThen in 2027, the two equations change slightly, with the local governments' equation providing a portion of your home's value tax-free - 10%, but not more than $70,000. Although you get a discount on your home's value, the assessment rate part of the equation increases.\n\nThere is one ballot issue already qualified for the November election that asks voters to limit property tax growth to no more than 4%. Should that get 55% approval and pass, the math equations put together by the state legislature in Senate Bill 24-233, will not take effect.", "source": {"uri": "9news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KUSA.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallagher_Amendment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gallagher Amendment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Calculators", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Calculators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/2e965155-9715-472d-882f-ddc4c86b417b/20240509T015349/2e965155-9715-472d-882f-ddc4c86b417b_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554043", "eventUri": "eng-9554043", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The Colorado Senate approved the same bill by a vote of 33-2 a day earlier.\n\nThe legislation, which was sponsored by Democratic and Republican lawmakers in each chamber, will soon be sent to Governor Jared Polis, who is expected to sign the legislation, given that his office was involved in crafting it.\n\n\"I think both Republicans and Democrats are in full agreement that this is the best path forward,\" said Scott Wasserman with the Bell Policy Center.\n\nThe bill would, among other things, allow homeowners to exempt 10% of the first $700,000 of their home's value. While supporters call it a tax cut, it's really designed to keep sky-high property taxes in check.\n\n\"The entire job was to slow the growth of your property tax bill, even as your property tax bill goes up,\" said Wasserman. \"Property values grow over time. Your property value goes up and your property tax bill goes up.\"\n\nWasserman said the average homeowner would save hundreds of dollars compared to what they would pay if the bill didn't pass. Michael Fields with Advance Colorado said the bill won't provide the relief homeowners are looking for.\n\n\"It allows for growth and growth and growth in property taxes,\" said Fields. \"We've waited four years for a long-term solution. This is definitely not it.\"\n\nHe's proposing a two-part alternative through the initiative process.\n\nInitiative 50 would limit property tax revenue growth and require voter approval for the state to retain any amount over that limit.\n\nAnother proposal, Initiative 108, would cut property tax revenue to local governments. It would reduce property tax revenue to local governments by $3 billion in 2025, according to a fiscal summary prepared by the Legislative Council Staff.\n\n\"Most of the lost property tax revenue, about $2.25 billion, will be reimbursed by the state government. About $800 million in lost school district revenue will be made up through state aid for total program funding for school finance as required under current law, and the measure requires that about $1.45 billion be paid by the state to fully reimburse local governments other than school districts,\" the fiscal summary said. \"The remaining $750 million reduction is estimated to occur in school district revenue streams other than total program revenue and will not be reimbursed.\"\n\n\"Our measures are two pages long,\" said Fields. \"They cut and cap property taxes, very simple.\"\n\nInitiative 50 has qualified for November's ballot. Fields said he was still gathering signatures for Initiative 108.\n\nWasserman said the proposals being pushed by Fields and Concern Colorado, a group of business leaders, would hurt local services.\n\n\"The reality is that these issues are not simple,\" said Wasserman. \"I think it's the difference between pragmatic solutions coming out of the Capitol from people who work on this stuff and are trying to deliver relief, and then ideologues who are just writing bumper stickers on ballot measures and hoping that the voters fall for it.\"\n\nWasserman said the initiatives conservative groups are pushing are similar to a path California took with the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978. Critics of Prop 13 say it created a fiscal nightmare in California by gutting local budgets and harming schools.\n\n\"What happened in California is precisely what we're trying to avoid here in Colorado,\" said Wasserman. \"Initiative 50 and Initiative 108 will most definitely Californicate Colorado.\"\n\nThe Follow Up What do you want Denver7 to follow up on?

Notably, they agreed on legislation that sets up a new Taxpayer's Bill of Rights refund mechanism and provides an income tax rate cut, bringing together Republican lawmakers who have long advocated for income tax rate reductions and their Democratic colleagues who want the governor's support for bills that use the TABOR surplus to pay for workforce and child poverty issues. They also agreed on a proposal that supporters said would address skyrocketing property taxes. The measure reduces property tax assessment rates for homeowners and commercial building owners.\n\nHot-button proposals from Democrats' progressive wing fail Sign up for free: News Alerts Stay in the know on the stories that affect you the most.\n\nSign Up For Free View all of our newsletters.

View all of our newsletters.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats found more success when tackling more practical problems, while the more ideologically-driven and hot-button proposals once more failed. Notably, lawmakers killed a proposal that sought a legislative path toward allowing facilities where people can use illegal drugs under the supervision of medical professionals. And, for the second year in a row, progressive Democrats' efforts to pass a bill banning so-called \"assault weapons\" didn't go anywhere, though this year's version made it further in the process, making it to the state Senate before being postponed by its sponsor.\n\nProperty tax fight is far from over\n\nThe end of the legislative session heralds the beginning of a ballot measure battle over property taxes, as a group insists that the legislative approach adopted by Democrats and Republicans is insufficient. One ballot initiative championed by Advance Colorado seeks to reduce residential and business property tax rates down to roughly 2022 levels and cap future revenue growth to no more than 4% year over year. Initiative advocates said they are not convinced the agreement struck by Gov. Jared Polis, Democrats and Republicans, along with several groups, would offer meaningful relief to businesses and homeowners. Meanwhile, the deal's supporters said it would do exactly that -- while taking into account the fiscal needs of local government and school districts. The points raised by both sides will likely form the backbone of the arguments the public will hear during the general election in November. Indeed, as amended, the lawmakers' property tax bill would not go into effect if voters approved the Advance Colorado initiative -- or the other one the group is working on or both.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luige_del_puerto@gazette.com", "name": "Luige Del Puerto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxpayer_Bill_of_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taxpayer Bill of Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Polis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Polis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assault weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/2f/62f53090-b1b3-5af2-be50-2beeff979539/663cf8ec2bed7.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554043", "eventUri": "eng-9554043", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Instead, she'll call for a special legislative session to pass tax relief, though dates are not yet confirmed.\n\nKelly told KCUR's Up To Date the tax measure sent to her desk was too expensive.\n\n\"There is no way in the world that I'm going to put my signature on a bill that I think will take us back to those days of four-day school weeks, crumbling roads and bridges, a foster care system that was totally broken,\" she said. \"I just, I can't do that.\"\n\nThe bill would have eliminated state's 2% sales tax on groceries on July 1, rather than on Jan. 1, 2025. It would repeal the state income tax on Social Security benefits.\n\nThe bill lower the state's top income tax rate from 5.7% to 5.57%, and cut the lower tax rate from 5.25% to 5.2%. It would also increase property tax exemptions tied to the state's school finance levy.\n\nKelly said the tax reduction measures would have cost more than $500 million annually, and cause budget problems for the state.\n\n\"I have made it very clear from the get-go that I will veto any bill that came to me that would put Kansas in financial jeopardy. The bill the Legislature passed would do exactly that,\" Kelly said. \"There is absolutely no way that I would sign it. I'll call the Legislature back into a special session to pass a good tax cut bill.\"", "source": {"uri": "kcur.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

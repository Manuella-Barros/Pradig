Jo-Ann Petinglay, Western Mindanao Command spokesperson, said the clash that gave the three captives their chance to escape had also wounded a soldier who had been initially taken to a hospital in Jolo, the Sulu capital, and transferred to a hospital in this city.\n\nThe military did not identify the slain and wounded soldiers. Government forces recovered at least six guns from the clash site.\n\nIn an Associated Press report, Sobejana, who is also provincial military commander in Sulu, said soldiers clashed with at least 30 Abu Sayyaf men during a mission to rescue hostages of the crime group that included 15 foreigners.\n\nAccording to Sobejana, the crime group separated the hostages, handing them over to different Abu Sayyaf leaders. It was not clear which captives were being held by which Abu Sayyaf group.\n\nLast month, the military retrieved the decapitated bodies of two Vietnamese crewmen who were kidnapped by Abu Sayyaf last year. -- JULIE S.

Reuters picMANILA, Aug 12 -- Three men kidnapped by Islamist militants in the southern Philippines escaped while their captors prayed, dodging bullets as they ran, police said today after a ruse using fake ransom money failed.\n\nThe fate of a fourth man who ran off in a different direction was unclear.\n\nThe construction workers were taken to the police on Jolo island yesterday, four weeks after being abducted by the Abu Sayyaf group, which is holding more than a dozen other hostages including several foreigners in remote jungles.\n\nThe gunmen had received an undetermined amount of cash for the hostages on Thursday, but refused to release them after realising the money was fake, regional police chief Reuben Sindac told AFP.\n\n\"While the abductors performed their afternoon prayer, the victims took advantage and (ran) but they were chased and fired upon,\" Sindac said, citing an official report.\n\nThe Abu Sayyaf, blamed for the worst terror attacks in the nation's history, is known to behead hostages unless ransom payments are made.\n\nSindac said a village official found three of the hostages near the Jolo town of Talipao early Friday, one with a gunshot wound to the head that was not thought to be life-threatening.\n\nThe official brought them to the police hours later.\n\nThe three told police their fourth colleague had run in another direction and it was unclear if he had escaped or been recaptured by the militants.\n\nSindac said he did not know who paid the fake ransom money.\n\nThe Philippine government as a policy does not pay ransom, and the gunmen are known to negotiate directly with the victims' families or employers.\n\nThe militants beheaded two Canadian hostages last year and a German captive in February after ransom demands were not met.\n\nPolice said the militants also beheaded seven loggers on the southern island of Basilan last month, during which a Vietnamese hostage was also killed in a gunbattle between his captors and the security forces.\n\nA Basilan-based Abu Sayyaf faction has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group and joined up with militants who seized parts of the southern city of Marawi in May.\n\nThe militants have withstood a US-backed military offensive in Marawi that has claimed 725 lives and displaced nearly 400,000 people.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte has imposed martial law across the southern third of the Philippines, including Marawi, Basilan and Jolo, to quell the militant threat. -- AFP", "timeCrawl": "06:10:00", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-02-27",

killed in fresh firefight that erupted Thursday in Kalingalan Caluang, Sulu, security authorities said.\n\nJoint Task Force Sulu commander Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana said another soldier was wounded in the morning firefight in Barangay Pang.\n\nThe names of the soldier-casualties were withheld pending notification of kin.\n\nSobejana said the soldiers were in combat operation to rescue some kidnap victims when more than 30 terrorists encountered them.\n\nThe soldiers recovered seven high-powered firearms left by the terrorists in their escape.\n\n\"JTF Sulu forces [are] determined to continue their relentless and sustained effort in pursuing the Abu Sayyaf and other lawless elements for the safe rescue of the kidnap victims,\" Sobejana said in a statement.\n\nThe latest abduction perpetrated by the ASG was only last month against four laborers , all from Zamboanga City, working at a sports complex in Patikul.\n\nMeanwhile, Western Mindanao Command chief Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr. appealed to local officials in Lanao del Sur to closely monitor and guard their own bodies of waters and land against infiltration of terrorists especially those who want themselves extricated from the battle area in Marawi City as part of their security plan for long-term solutions to Islamic extremism in Mindanao.\n\n\"It would be best if you look after your lakes and your respective areas,\" Galvez told officials during a meeting Wednesday at the provincial capitol.\n\nGalvez made the appeal as Manila Standard reported that IS-anointed leader for South East Asia Abu Sayyaf Group leader Isnilon Hapilon and 28 followers had been dragging with them bags purportedly containing more than a billion of pesos in cash, piecesa of jewelry and gold and were tunneling towards the Lanao lake and Agus river to escape.\n\nThe tunneling was being done under a mosque where the terrorists sought refuge from military assaults and air and ground bombardments.\n\nMore than 500 terrorists, 122 soldiers, and 45 civilians have been killed in the more than two months of fighting.\n\nThe military said up to 70 terrorists holding more or less 100 civilian hostages were still inside the battle area. Many more civilians were trapped inside.\n\nDefense and military top brass said they were now preparing restoration and rehabilitation programs for Marawi.\n\n\"We are nearing the end of this prolonged battle with the penetration of our troops into the main battle area, but we beseech your consideration and assistance. We believe that the top leaders are still in the battle area, but we do not discount the possibility of reinforcement and retreat. This is where the key involvement of local government units comes in,\" Galvez appealed to the officials.\n\nHe said the terrorists were running out of ammunition and food and he also urged local officials to assist government forces in preventing enemy reinforcements.\n\nGalvez said long-term solutions and security arrangements with Lanao del Sur officials from the 29 towns had started to shape up to pre-empt the \"spillover of the conflict\" and the infiltration and recruitment of terrorists in other areas.\n\nHe said an official from Lumba-Bayabao municipality said checkpoints were established by members of the Barangay Peacekeeping Action Team and passage of motorboats along Lake Lanao was also monitored within their coastal barangays.\n\n\"We are preparing our constituents so that we will be able to make ourselves ready. We want our BPATs to be trained so that we can take appropriate actions when needed,\" Galvez said, quoting the official as saing.\n\n\"He also recommended that a system be implemented to validate the identities of local terrorists,\" he added.\n\nHe quoted Balindong Mayor Benjamin Bagul as saying he had been monitoring movements to prevent the entry of possible reinforcements in his area but stressed that fishing industry within their lakeshore barangays had been limited due to security restrictions.\n\n\"We have registered and authorized 126 pump boats; however, we are also affected by the tightening of security as fishing can no longer be done from 3 to 5 a.m., but only at 6 a.m. and beyond,\" the general quoted Bagul as saying.\n\nGalvez said he would bring the issue for resolution, believing it would be best to have fishermen in the lake area from time to time so they too could also serve as watchers who would report suspicious boats to authorities.\n\nHe said Masiu Mayor Nasser Pangandaman also shared his practice of repainting the fishermen's boats and assigning control numbers to each. According to Pangandaman, those who violated regulations were seized by the local government.\n\n\"One official also said that there are some folks from other municipalities in Maguidanao who come to their town in Kapatagan to recruit would-be members of the terror group,\" Galvez said.", "timeCrawl": "16:15:00", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8440477", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "id": 286, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "id": 342, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

battling Islamist militants on the southern island of Jolo where the Abu Sayyaf group is holding more than a dozen hostages including several foreigners\n\nThree men kidnapped by Islamist militants in the southern Philippines escaped while their captors prayed, dodging bullets as they ran, police said Saturday after a ruse using fake ransom money failed.\n\nThe fate of a fourth man who ran off in a different direction was unclear.\n\nThe construction workers were taken to the police on Jolo island on Friday, four weeks after being abducted by the Abu Sayyaf group, which is holding more than a dozen other hostages including several foreigners in remote jungles.\n\nThe gunmen had received an undetermined amount of cash for the hostages on Thursday, but refused to release them after realising the money was fake, regional police chief Reuben Sindac told AFP.\n\n\"While the abductors performed their afternoon prayer, the victims took advantage and (ran) but they were chased and fired upon,\" Sindac said, citing an official report.\n\nThe Abu Sayyaf, blamed for the worst terror attacks in the nation's history, is known to behead hostages unless ransom payments are made.\n\nSindac said a village official found three of the hostages near the Jolo town of Talipao early Friday, one with a gunshot wound to the head that was not thought to be life-threatening.\n\nThe official brought them to the police hours later.\n\nThe three told police their fourth colleague had run in another direction and it was unclear if he had escaped or been recaptured by the militants.\n\nSindac said he did not know who paid the fake ransom money.\n\nThe Philippine government as a policy does not pay ransom, and the gunmen are known to negotiate directly with the victims' families or employers.\n\nThe militants beheaded two Canadian hostages last year and a German captive in February after ransom demands were not met.\n\nPolice said the militants also beheaded seven loggers on the southern island of Basilan last month, during which a Vietnamese hostage was also killed in a gunbattle between his captors and the security forces.\n\nA Basilan-based Abu Sayyaf faction has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group and joined up with militants who seized parts of the southern city of Marawi in May.\n\nThe militants have withstood a US-backed military offensive in Marawi that has claimed 725 lives and displaced nearly 400,000 people.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte has imposed martial law across the southern third of the Philippines, including Marawi, Basilan and Jolo, to quell the militant

{"id": 243398258, "title": "NSC Junior National Singles Badminton Tournament\u2026 - Guyana Chronicle", "text": "THE National Sports Commission\u2019s (NSC) Junior National Singles Badminton Tournament concluded on Thursday night with Mishka Beharry taking the top spot in the U-19 and U-17 Girls\u2019 categories, while Frank Wadell emerged as the winner of the U-19 Boys Singles. The 18-year-old Wadell who hails from East Ruimveldt, beat Xavio Alexander 21-18 in the first set, executing several high- lob shots to Alexander to set up powerful smashes. Waddell\u2019s well-placed drop shots had his opponent scurrying forward in vain as the shuttlecock landed inches over the net. In the second set, Wadell, a Queen\u2019s College student, galloped to 18-11 before Alexander scored four unanswered points as he threatened to take the match into a third set. But Wadell, a crowd favourite, would eventually register three consecutive points to take the set 21-15 to become U-19 Champion to the delight of his raucous fans in the stands. Alexander had beaten Ruel Rambirche 21-15, 18-21, 21-11 in the boy\u2019s U-17 final. Energetic 16-year-old Mishka Beharry defeated her much taller opponent Leshaunte Berkley. The Marian Academy student was clinical in her demolition of Berkley, who despite some lengthy rallies would gift Beharry points by hitting the shuttlecock into the net or out of the court. Watched by a vocal crowd which included her mom, High Court Judge Priya Beharry, Mishka hardly broke a sweat as she captured the Girls U-19 title. Mishka had previously beaten Malia Haley 21-4, 21-13 in the U-17 to capture two titles. Ten-year-old Ethan Bulkan beat Joel Rambirche to capture the U-15 trophy on Thursday night. Ethan, who could be reading this online today in the BVI where he will represent Guyana in the U-13 Junior Casa Squash tournament, eased to a dominant 21-11, 21-8 win. His elder brother Egan, who will also represent Guyana in the Squash tournament in the BVI, placed third in Boys U-15. Meanwhile, Vice-President of the GBA, Ayanna Watson, in her closing remarks thanked the parents, the sponsors, the tournament coordinators and last but not least, the athletes who came out and participated in exciting and competitive matches. Emily Ramdhani, President of the GBA, announced that Mishka Beharry and Xavio Alexander will attend the XXXII Yonex Panam Junior Championships in Aguascalientes, Mexico from July 13-15, 2024. The tournament will be followed by a Badminton Camp organised by the Badminton Pan American Confederation (BPAC). The camp will also be in Mexico and the players will be accompanied by Nkosi Beaton, who will be there for the coaching experience. Beaton is a DCC Cricketer who got involved in Badminton to better his hand/eye reflexes and is also a Badminton coach. Upcoming for the GBA will be the CAREBACO Junior Tournament in Aruba from August 22-25, 2024 with training to commence soon. There will also be an NSC Doubles Tournament which will start in the schools and culminate in a tournament at the National Gymnasium in October 2024. This tournament forms part of the Badminton Academy and the three phases in the Sport Ministry\u2019s vision and plan (Nursery, tournaments and Elite). The GBA thanked the Director of Sport Steve Ninvalle and the NSC for sponsoring the tournament and for making the facility available.

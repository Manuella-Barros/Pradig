Rachel Kearns pushed a child off a desk, dragged them across a room, withheld lunch from pupils and even told another \u201cit\u2019s no wonder your mother didn\u2019t have any other children\u201d, a panel ruled. The 44-year-old was working at the Worcestershire town's Rigby Hall Special School, in Rigby Lane, Aston Fields, when complaints came to light. Due to her lack of remorse and the incidents deemed so serious, Kearns was not only banned from teaching but will never be allowed to return to the classroom. A Teaching Regulation Agency professional conduct panel found five of eight allegations proved against Kearns for allegations dating back to between October 2021 and May 2022, when she was suspended and West Mercia Police notified. The panel ruled her actions spanning child cruelty and/or neglect, controlling or coercive behaviour and intolerance for disability \u201c and amounted to misconduct of a serious nature\u201d and could bring the profession into disrepute.

She also withheld food and snacks from children and threw a pupil's lunch in the bin as he refused to sit at the table or eat it at lunchtime. Witnesses told the hearing that lunchtimes in Kearns\u2019 classroom were \u201coften the most stressful times of the day as Mrs Kearns would get increasingly frustrated with the children\u2019s behaviour\". Many children were unable to sit and eat lunch at a table or did not want to eat a \u2018normal\u2019 lunch at a \u2018normal\u2019 lunchtime\u201d, they added. On another occasion, the hearing was told the teacher said to a boy \u201cit\u2019s no wonder your mother didn\u2019t have any other children or words to that effect\". A witness said Kearns would often get frustrated with this child as he was one of the louder children in the class, often shouting at him rather than speaking. It wasn't clear if the pupil understood Kearns' comment as he is not able to speak. David Oatley of the Teaching Regulation Agency, who made the decision to ban Kearns from teaching, said in his report: \u201cMrs Kearns\u2019 conduct placed extremely vulnerable pupils, a number of whom were non-verbal and could not therefore communicate their needs, at significant risk. \u201cIn light of the panel\u2019s findings against Mrs Kearns, which involved pushing Pupil A; dragging and/or pulling Pupil B by their wrist or wrists; withholding food from pupils; throwing Pupil B\u2019s lunch in the bin and saying to Pupil B \u201cit\u2019s no wonder why your mother didn\u2019t have any other children\u201d, or words to that effect, there was a strong public interest consideration in the safeguarding and wellbeing of pupils and the protection of other members of the public. \u201cIn my judgement, the lack of evidence of insight and remorse means that there is some risk of the repetition of this behaviour and this puts at risk the future wellbeing of pupils. I have therefore given this element considerable weight in reaching my decision.

The decision was made despite the teacher having valuable specialist skills for schools of British Sign Language, Makaton and a degree in Deaf Studies and Linguistics, as well as training in Gastronomy and Naso-Gastric tube feeding. Kearns, who denied all the conduct charges, did not attend the hearing on April 25 and wasn\u2019t represented. She submitted evidence that throughout her career she had an exemplary record, adding that she was considered an \u2018outstanding\u2019 teacher at the schools she has worked in. POLL: Do you intend to get your child vaccinated against measles? The panel acknowledged that the ratio of 1:9 in Kearns\u2019 class was \u201cat the high end when considering the age of the children and the degree of special needs they typically have\u201d. They added that particularly at lunchtimes, the staffing levels were \u201cnot reasonable\u201d. Incidents were at lunchtime and the panel heard there were no clear school policies about pupils eating at school, which they said \"inappropriately led to staff to interpret the school\u2019s expectations around food in their own ways\". The school, which has more than 200 pupils, was inspected by Ofsted in February 2023 and was rated 'requires improvement'.", "summary": "Teacher Rachel Kearns from Rigby Hall Special School put a child's lunch in bin and dragged pupil across room", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/bromsgrove-teacher-banned-cruelty-neglect-29257860", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29258177.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_TRMRMMGLPICT000020348860.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:26:08", "author": "Alison Brinkworth", "authors": ["Alison Brinkworth"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.18}

{"id": 232111844, "title": "In one of the most dangerous workplaces in West Virginia, a poultry giant has profited from immigrant labor for decades", "text": "By Allen Siegler MOOREFIELD \u2014 On a rainy afternoon in 2020, Pilgrim\u2019s Pride\u2019s West Virginia chicken factory was dirty. The slaughterhouse has sharp metal hooks, deboning knives and conveyor belts. The machinery butchers over a million live birds every week and is constantly covered with animal grime. That day, dozens of sanitation workers, many of them Hispanic and many of them immigrants, were washing the machines in the plant owned by Hardy County\u2019s largest employer. A Puerto Rican man was kneeling to clean a conveyor belt when it unexpectedly turned on. The machine latched on to his work jacket, and pulled. The man cried out in agony. \u201cIt was really bad, something ugly,\u201d said Marco, a man from Mexico also cleaning the slaughterhouse that day. As he walked past an office away from the line, Marco got a clear look at what remained underneath bloody towels. \u201cThe arm was left hanging by the skin,\u201d he said. As gruesome as the scene was, Marco had seen plenty of similar injuries take place inside Pilgrim\u2019s Moorefield factory, built along a fork of the Potomac River\u2019s South Branch. He knew what could happen inside the plant. Over the past 30 years, he and thousands of others who\u2019ve left their homelands have come to Moorefield to work at West Virginia\u2019s only industrial poultry plant. Often fleeing poverty or violence, many have immigrated from other countries, and others have come from U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico. Seeking safety and a better life, they\u2019ve often faced unsafe working conditions. Throughout the last decade, Pilgrim\u2019s Moorefield plant has been one of the most dangerous non-coal industrial workplaces in West Virginia. From 2015 to late 2023, 12 factory employees had workplace injuries that led to amputations or overnight hospitalizations, according to data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. During that period, the only West Virginia workplace with more severe injuries was a tin mill in Weirton, which closed indefinitely in April. Sign up for our weekly newsletter.

Just months before the man\u2019s arm was nearly yanked off, a different plant employee\u2019s hand crossed the path of an active circular saw. The injury \u2014 one that federal inspectors determined was caused by plant managers not providing employees with necessary protective equipment around heavy machinery \u2014 cost Pilgrim\u2019s about $52,000 in fines and the employee parts of an index finger and a thumb. Poultry production is known for a high rate of worker injuries. But Debbie Berkowitz, a former OSHA chief of staff, said the number of severe injuries at Pilgrim\u2019s Moorefield plant was notable. \u201cThis is a red flag on safety conditions in the plant,\u201d Berkowitz said, adding that these types of serious accidents are often indicative of larger health and safety problems within a workplace. The federal data doesn\u2019t include plenty of other hospital trips needed for workers at the plant. In 2022 and 2023, local paramedics responded to calls to the Moorefield factory 138 times \u2014 about once every five days \u2014 according to the Hardy County Emergency Ambulance Authority. Those records reveal additional worker injuries that aren\u2019t included in the OSHA list, including someone who was struck in the face with a metal bar, someone whose leg got caught and crushed between two machines and someone who was thrown off a floor jack onto his head. David Workman, the Hardy County Commission president, said the injury data illustrate a concerning situation for people who already face struggles in the U.S. and West Virginia. \u201cThey\u2019re working around knives and big equipment, automated equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe some of the language barrier is a contributor to that.\u201d \u201cOnce in a while, you will see people passing out or cutting themselves,\u201d said Mar\u00eda, a woman from Peru who worked at Pilgrim\u2019s for a decade and retired after injuring her leg. Mar\u00eda requested to be identified only by her first name. \u201cThey would come with wheelchairs and take them to the health clinic.\u201d And in a state in which 91% of residents are white, a disproportionate amount of the danger is shouldered by the plant\u2019s large immigrant workforce, a Mountain State Spotlight investigation found. Outside the plant, some Moorefield residents have tried to welcome newcomers. But inside, most of the current and former immigrant workers Mountain State Spotlight spoke with said they worried about their safety or had experienced a work-related injury or illness. The names of undocumented workers in this story, like Marco, have been changed because of deportation fears. Through interpreters, some immigrant workers said they enjoyed their jobs at the plant and the high pay relative to other Hardy County jobs. But many others said supervisors often failed to teach them how to safely navigate the plant, ignored them when they pointed out health threats and placed them in jobs where injuries are common. Because Moorefield doesn\u2019t have many other jobs for people who don\u2019t speak English, newcomers said some managers have leveraged the lack of opportunities or employees\u2019 immigration status to keep them working. Mountain State Spotlight found people who\u2019ve had these concerns since Pilgrim\u2019s Pride took over the plant in the early 2000s \u2014 regardless of where they\u2019re from and whether they\u2019ve worked for the company directly or for a contractor. It\u2019s one of the reasons why different ethnic groups have cycled in and out of Moorefield over the past 30 years. Both local and corporate officials for Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, an arm of the largest poultry producer in the world, did not answer calls and voicemails asking for interviews. They didn\u2019t answer a letter with over a dozen questions related to this story. A recent lawsuit against major American poultry corporations, including Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, alleged the companies recruited vulnerable immigrant workers to staff some of the most dangerous jobs in the U.S. In response, Pilgrim\u2019s denied these allegations and said the workers\u2019 lawyers were selectively pulling unflattering quotes from various reports and people. When Marco came to the U.S. as a teenager, he thought Moorefield would be a safe place where he and his loved ones could exist in peace. That\u2019s something he never had in Mexico. But when he was inside Pilgrim\u2019s plant, he remembers constantly trying to protect himself and his coworkers from leaving the factory in an ambulance, like when supervisors asked his team to climb up 20-foot ladders to clean tall machines. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna fall. You\u2019re gonna die,\u201d Marco recalled telling other workers. \u201cThey are going to replace you, but your family is not going to replace you.\u201d Welcome to Moorefield The town of Moorefield, a 2,800-person bit of flatland between two stretches of the Allegheny Mountains, is surrounded in every direction by chicken houses that can stretch as long as two football fields. Drivers who come from Petersburg are greeted by tall concrete grain silos holding chicken feed \u2014 where Pilgrim\u2019s stores food for its future food \u2014 and might pass a freight hauler with a Kroger logo leaving the town packed with poultry. Chicken processing has been at the heart of Moorefield\u2019s identity for 80 years. In 1944, the Virginia-based Rockingham Poultry Marketing Collective opened the town\u2019s poultry slaughterhouse, now known as the fresh plant. On its first day, the plant\u2019s 79 employees processed 3,000 chickens, according to the Moorefield Examiner. About a decade later, Pierce Pre-Cooked Foods opened another plant right next door \u2014 known by locals as the cook plant. There, workers turned raw chicken parts into foods like frozen chicken nuggets and Wing Dings, a breaded chicken wing developed in Moorefield. As other industries have done throughout U.S. history, poultry processors eventually turned to immigrants for workers \u2014 like the coal industry did in its early days in West Virginia. In the 1990s, plants across the country began recruiting Hispanic workers to staff their production lines. Labor rights advocates say the industry took this step to maintain low wages and prevent union organizing. Moorefield\u2019s slaughterhouse followed the industry trend. By 1990, its new owner, WLR Foods, wanted to expand the factory by 800 jobs. But the company struggled to find workers, according to a Moorefield Examiner article from that year. To solve that problem, WLR looked outside of West Virginia. William Ours, a former plant supervisor, said it was around 1992 \u2014 as the expansion moved forward \u2014 when he remembers Hispanic immigrants first working alongside longtime Moorefield residents. \u201cProduction could be increased, and more departments could grow to meet orders,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you needed more people.\u201d By 2003, Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, a company that produces nearly one in six U.S. chickens, had acquired both operations. From then on, it\u2019s owned, from egg to plastic package, most of Moorefield\u2019s chicken. That same year, Marco\u2019s sister, Naomi, was told by a cousin that there were jobs in Moorefield. As a teenager, she left Mexico and came to Hardy County as an undocumented immigrant. Within a week of arriving in town, Pilgrim\u2019s Pride hired her to work on one of the slaughterhouse\u2019s production lines. The job was difficult. When Naomi told her line managers that she needed to use the bathroom, she said they would respond by saying \u201cone moment\u201d over and over for hours. If Naomi ignored them and left the line, she said a manager would sometimes bang on the stall, grab her arm once she came out and yank her back to her work station. Once, Naomi was working on a production line when someone spilled a large container of ammonia \u2014 a chemical that high exposure to can cause severe lung damage. When the smell became overwhelming, Naomi said her supervisors evacuated white workers first and kept her and two other Hispanic women working by the tanks for another 20 minutes. \u201cThey said they had to move those who had been at the company the longest,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was evident that it was dangerous for everyone, not just the Americans.\u201d Hector, also an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, worked at the plant during this era as well. Pilgrim\u2019s had Hector slice chicken meat off bones, a job in which infections, cuts and carpal tunnel syndrome are common. Most of his supervisors only spoke English; as a recent immigrant, Hector often didn\u2019t know what they were asking of him. He did, however, understand some of the scoldings he and others received. \u201cThey said \u2018why don\u2019t you understand\u2019 and \u2018what are you doing here if you don\u2019t speak English,\u2019\u201d Hector said. In the early to mid-2000s, Naomi remembers hundreds of Hispanic immigrants, many of them undocumented, working at the plant. That changed in April 2008, when the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided the plant and arrested employees, including Hector. The federal government said just over 100 Moorefield workers were detained. ICE separated him from his then-girlfriend, who he later married. \u201cI felt awful,\u201d Hector said. \u201cShe was here, so I left her here.\u201d New employment pathways The couple reunited in Mexico and returned to Moorefield within a year. Once they were back, Hector was soon working back in the plant. He was no longer employed directly by Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, as he had been prior to 2008. He and other former workers said the company started hiring refugees from countries like Eritrea, Ethiopia and Myanmar who were resettled elsewhere in the country \u2014 people who were legally authorized to work in the U.S. This time, Hector said he and others who lacked this legal authorization were pushed toward two independent companies that contracted with the plant: Quality, Service, Integrity and Packers Sanitation Services Incorporated, often referred to by their acronyms QSI and PSSI. Both employ factory sanitation workers across the U.S. Federal OSHA data shows that both companies staffed workers in Pilgrim\u2019s Moorefield factory in the 2010s. Some of those workers during this time were undocumented, according to paystubs reviewed by Mountain State Spotlight. Pilgrim\u2019s corporate office says it\u2019s accountable for the well-being of contract company employees. In its corporate sustainability strategy, the company wrote that \u201cwe take our responsibility for their health and safety seriously.\u201d The sanitation companies have publicly said one of their purposes is to protect companies from being associated with some of the plant\u2019s most dangerous jobs. PSSI once said its partnership with food processing factories could \u201ctake the liability and risk off your facility\u2019s record,\u201d and QSI\u2019s website says it helps the companies create consistent sanitation processes to protect their brands. Berkowitz, the former OSHA top official, studies the relationship between chicken producers, including Pilgrim\u2019s, and their independent contractors. She said it\u2019s common for poultry companies to outsource some of the most dangerous jobs in the plant to groups like PSSI and QSI. \u201cPilgrim\u2019s is telling them exactly what to do,\u201d she said. In emailed statements, spokespeople for PSSI and QSI said they are committed to only hiring people who are authorized to work in the U.S. \u201cQSI protects the American dream by providing career opportunities to those who are often overlooked, who need second chances, or who just need an opportunity to show their value,\u201d wrote Gene Boulware, the company\u2019s director for corporate and community relations. Hector worked stints with both companies. While people came and went frequently, he said the majority of his coworkers were immigrants. And the work remained dangerous. One day, shortly after putting on gloves to start a shift, Hector felt an itch on the top of his left hand. At first, he ignored it. But after about 30 minutes, the sensation became overwhelming. \u201cAs I was taking my white one off, I saw my skin was sticking to it,\u201d Hector said as he pointed to a scar just between his fingers and wrist. \u201cEverything was red.\u201d His managers had him put his hand in cold water and rushed him to the hospital. Later, Hector learned the white glove PSSI provided him was contaminated with one of dozens of dangerous chemicals used to wash poultry processing machines. In its statement, PSSI said employees spend their first three weeks in training about potential hazards, safety protocols and how to handle chemicals. \u201cWe have made significant safety investments in this area and have reduced our OSHA recordable injury rate by half over the last six years,\u201d the company wrote. It was while working for QSI when Marco witnessed the Puerto Rican man\u2019s arm nearly get chopped off and was asked to climb up tall machines. Despite the near amputation being documented in federal safety records, Boulware wrote that the company had no direct knowledge of the incident and did not clarify when provided with the OSHA record. He said QSI wasn\u2019t familiar with any job tasks that would require climbing and noted that the company has training videos in six different languages. Marco recalled another shift when a piece of machinery crushed a worker\u2019s hand. After doctors had surgically attached a metal implant to the man\u2019s finger bone, Marco said his supervisors asked him to drive the man to his physical therapy appointments. Then there were all the chemicals he handled. While working with the dry ones, Marco said it was nearly impossible not to breathe them in, which sometimes resulted in chest pain. He worked with liquid ones as well, despite feeling like he wasn\u2019t properly trained on how to use them. One of the liquid solutions, a cleaner he and his coworkers had nicknamed \u201cdevil\u2019s blood\u201d stuck out to him years later. \u201cIf it touches your skin, it starts to like eat it up.\u201d Marco said, recounting times drops of the black liquid fell on his hands. Angela Stuesse, a University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill anthropology professor who has studied the relationship between poultry plants and their workers for decades, said this type of labor control is seen in chicken factories across the country. While the poultry companies aren\u2019t trying to create an environment where people get sick and injured frequently, she said their main focus is on generating money for their shareholders. And one of the most effective ways of keeping costs low is to employ people with few other options. \u201cIt\u2019s about ensuring that the most profitable, exploitable workforce is made available,\u201d Stuesse said. Take what happened in 2020, when COVID-19 spread through the Moorefield plant\u2019s workforce and the meat and poultry industries more broadly. Pilgrim\u2019s Pride was desperate for workers. The plant turned to Quintanilla Poultry, a South Carolina-based company that hired dozens of Hardy County undocumented workers to keep the production process running. Moorefield immigrants who worked for Quintanilla said they were tasked with similar responsibilities to people directly employed by Pilgrim\u2019s Pride. Unlike other production workers, its former employees said they were never offered health insurance. But the new infectious disease health risks added to the dangers immigrants already faced. Naomi, Marco\u2019s sister who came to Moorefield in 2003, said she was one of the immigrants Quintanilla hired in 2020. She said supervisors instructed employees to come in to work even if they had COVID-19 symptoms. When Naomi tested positive for the virus, she said a company manager told her to hide the test results from any Pilgrim\u2019s officials. Juan Quintanilla, the owner of Quintanilla Poultry, said in March that he was in the process of shutting down his company and declined to answer further questions. A tenuous future Today, dozens of semi-trucks carrying crates full of live chickens drive daily down Main Street lined with Moorefield\u2019s historic homes and glass-paneled public high school. Depending on the time and day, the factory emits a smell that resembles deep-fried chicken wings, burning rubber or breaded manure. When the trucks reach the center of town, they turn into one of the private roads that criss-cross the Pilgrim\u2019s Pride\u2019s complex, passing by the buildings where chicken pieces are churned out 24 hours a day. Pilgrim\u2019s Pride\u2019s Moorefield immigrant workforce and relationship to contract companies has been changing once again. In 2022 and 2023, the plant fired many undocumented immigrant workers \u2014 including Hector, Marco and Naomi. It happened around the same time the chicken giant\u2019s COVID-19-related labor shortages were improving in its U.S. factories, according to a corporate earnings report. Boulware, the QSI spokesperson, said his company stopped contracting in Moorefield in 2023. When that happened, PSSI took over sanitation responsibilities for both the slaughterhouse and the prepared foods plant, according to the company\u2019s local hiring coordinator Kayla Stump. Additionally, many of the people from Southeast Asia and East Africa who worked at the plant in the 2010s have left West Virginia. Than Htay Maung and his family left Myanmar for the U.S. after the government prevented his wife, a journalist, from reporting freely. Shortly after his divorce, a family friend told him about a job opportunity in Moorefield. Now, a decade into working at Pilgrim\u2019s Pride slaughterhouse, Htay Maung has watched the Burmese community in Hardy County decline from hundreds of people in the early 2010s to just a handful today. \u201cSome of them got married,\u201d Htay Muong said in Burmese. \u201cSome of them moved to a different place to work. Some of them just found a better job elsewhere.\u201d The poultry work pays better than other jobs in West Virginia for non-English speakers, he said. And it hasn\u2019t interfered with his biggest passion, painting \u2014 at least not yet. After years of pulling and snipping chickens apart, he\u2019s experiencing intense pain from his forearms to his fingers. When Htay Muong tells his supervisors about his arms, he says they\u2019ve given him Biofreeze cream to rub on his hands. For the most part, he said he keeps his pain to himself. Htay Muong worries that he may soon not be able to hold a paint brush. \u201cIf I can\u2019t use my hands, I\u2019ll use my feet and my tongue,\u201d he said. Now, Pilgrim\u2019s is staffing the Moorefield plant with many from Caribbean countries who are seeking or have received asylum status. In February, John Tenerus, a Haitian immigrant, estimated that between 300 and 400 people from his home country now work at the factory. He said his experience as a Pilgrim\u2019s prepared foods employee, a job he\u2019s had for about a year, had been largely uneventful so far. \u201cI think it\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cNot dangerous.\u201d In over two decades in Moorefield, Naomi has seen many groups of immigrants come to the plant with high hopes and leave with scars and disappointment. While she no longer works there, she fears the new group of Haitian workers, many of whom are Black, could eventually experience similar problems to the ones she faced. \u201cIn my opinion, if we were discriminated against, then people from Haiti are even more,\u201d Naomi said. Regardless of where workers come from, Marco expects the plant to continue employing people far from their homelands, like himself, to feed the rest of the country. And so does Pilgrim\u2019s. In recent reports to shareholders, the chicken giant says that its profits could be harmed by new immigration legislation or enforcement that could disrupt production or bring fines. \u201cNo assurances can be given that enforcement efforts by governmental authorities will not disrupt a portion of our workforce or operations at one or more facilities, thereby negatively impacting our business,\u201d the company wrote in an annual report earlier this year. Marco just hopes he and his wife can afford to keep their children in school and out of the plant. He wants them to be able to work somewhere far away from any deboners or \u201cdevil\u2019s blood.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I tell my children,\u201d he said. \u201cTo study as much as possible. And that\u2019s why we keep looking for jobs.\u201d This article was produced as a project for the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism\u2019s 2023 Impact Fund for Reporting on Health Equity and Health Systems.

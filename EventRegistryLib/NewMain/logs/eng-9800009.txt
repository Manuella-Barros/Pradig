(AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris has declared herself and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz \"joyful warriors\" as they spent their first full day as running mates rallying Democrats across the Midwest. But they got an idea of just how hotly contested the region would be when they overlapped on a Wisconsin tarmac with Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign said it had raised $36 million in the first 24 hours after the vice presidential announcement. Wednesday's trip aimed to shore up support among the younger, diverse, labor-friendly voters who were instrumental in helping President Joe Biden win the 2020 election. That coalition has shown signs of fraying over Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nVance and other Trump allies amplify a false claim about Harris' racial identity\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, is defending a false claim the former president made about Vice President Kamala Harris' racial identity. Trump suggested wrongly that Harris had downplayed her Black heritage in trying to suggest she's inauthentic. Vance says, \"What I took it as was an attack on Kamala Harris being a chameleon.\" Harris is the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants. The Harris campaign has declined to comment specifically on Trump's false claim. The vice president, speaking to a Black sorority last week, accused Trump of \"the same old show: the divisiveness and the disrespect.\"\n\nOrganizers cancel Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna over fears of an attack\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Organizers of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna this week called them off on Wednesday after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the Vienna area such as the concerts as part of her Eras Tour. Swift was scheduled to play at the Austrian capital's Ernst Happel Stadium on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Event organizer Barracuda Music said in a post on its Instagram channel late Wednesday that \"we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.\"\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end in July. That's according to the European climate agency Copernicus. The agency said July 2024's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago. Both the agency and outside experts warned that the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change. It's driving extreme weather events that can be seen regularly, ranging from torrential rains and flooding in South Africa to the earliest Category 4 hurricane ever seen, Beryl, which hammered parts of central America and the southern U.S.\n\nHunter Biden was hired by Romanian businessman trying to 'influence' US agencies, prosecutors say\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutors say Hunter Biden was hired by a Romanian businessman who was trying to \"influence U.S. government agencies\" during Joe Biden's term as vice president. The allegation is in court papers filed Wednesday in the tax case against the president's son. Special counsel David Weiss says Hunter Biden's business associate will testify at the upcoming federal tax trial of the president's son about the arrangement with the Romanian executive, Gabriel Popoviciu. An attorney for Hunter Biden didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The allegations are likely to bring a fresh wave of criticism of Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, which have been the center of Republicans' investigations into the president's family.\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division at the Paris Olympics. She beat Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 for her third consecutive victory in the tournament while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender. Both Lin and Imane Khelif have responded to the scrutiny generated by the International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify them from last year's world championships by going on two of the best runs of their careers in Paris. Lin again used her superior height and technique to beat the more physical Kahraman. Lin will fight for gold on Saturday, taking on Julia Szeremeta of Poland.\n\nTropical Storm Debby doles out repeat deluges for weather-weary residents\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is still pushing bad weather up the East Coast, but floodwaters are starting to recede in South Carolina. Residents there began the near-ritualistic task of assessing the damage Wednesday. Some people whose homes were flooded say they were prepared after enduring so many previous storms. Gene Taylor lives north of Charleston along French Quarter Creek in the community of Huger. He estimates that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years. Meanwhile, residents as far away as the Great Lakes and New Jersey have also experienced heavy rains connected to the slow-moving tropical storm.\n\nNASA says chances are growing that astronauts may switch from Boeing to a SpaceX ride back to Earth\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA says chances are growing that two test pilots who flew a new Boeing capsule to the International Space Station in June may have to switch to SpaceX for a ride home. Officials said Wednesday it's still possible astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams can return aboard Boeing's Starliner next month. But if the spacecraft's leaks and thruster problems are not better understood, the two could find themselves up there until February, returning on a SpaceX capsule. Inside NASA, there's dissent over which way to go. NASA is bringing in extra experts to figure out the best path forward.\n\n9/11 hearings at Guantanamo Bay in upheaval after surprise order by US defense chief\n\nFORT MEADE, Md. (AP) -- Military-run hearings for accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are in upheaval following Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's decision to throw out a plea agreement. Defense attorneys contend the plea deal still stands and suspended participation in the pre-trial hearings while legal challenges to Austin's action play out. The judge overseeing the case acknowledged concerns over outside pressure on the case. The events of the past week are the latest significant disruption of the U.S. military prosecution of defendants accused in the 2001 killings of nearly 3,000 people, in an al-Qaida plot.\n\nUS abortion numbers have risen slightly since Roe was overturned, study finds\n\nA new report shows the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. went up slightly in the first three months of 2024 compared with before the Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade. The #WeCount report says a major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states have laws to protect prescribers who use telemedicine to see patients in places with abortion bans. The latest edition of the survey counted an average of just under 99,000 abortions per month, compared with 84,000 in the two months before Dobbs. January was the first time since the survey began that it has counted more than 100,000 abortions across the country in a single month.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news",

(AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris has declared herself and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz \"joyful warriors\" as they spent their first full day as running mates rallying Democrats across the Midwest. But they got an idea of just how hotly contested the region would be when they overlapped on a Wisconsin tarmac with Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign said it had raised $36 million in the first 24 hours after the vice presidential announcement.

JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, is defending a false claim the former president made about Vice President Kamala Harris' racial identity. Trump suggested wrongly that Harris had downplayed her Black heritage in trying to suggest she's inauthentic. Vance says, \"What I took it as was an attack on Kamala Harris being a chameleon.\" Harris is the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants. The Harris campaign has declined to comment specifically on Trump's false claim.

The allegation is in court papers filed Wednesday in the tax case against the president's son. Special counsel David Weiss says Hunter Biden's business associate will testify at the upcoming federal tax trial of the president's son about the arrangement with the Romanian executive, Gabriel Popoviciu. An attorney for Hunter Biden didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The allegations are likely to bring a fresh wave of criticism of Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, which have been the center of Republicans' investigations into the president's family.\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division at the Paris Olympics.

Both Lin and Imane Khelif have responded to the scrutiny generated by the International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify them from last year's world championships by going on two of the best runs of their careers in Paris.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is still pushing bad weather up the East Coast, but floodwaters are starting to recede in South Carolina. Residents there began the near-ritualistic task of assessing the damage Wednesday. Some people whose homes were flooded say they were prepared after enduring so many previous storms. Gene Taylor lives north of Charleston along French Quarter Creek in the community of Huger. He estimates that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years. Meanwhile, residents as far away as the Great Lakes and New Jersey have also experienced heavy rains connected to the slow-moving tropical storm.\n\nNASA says chances are growing that astronauts may switch from Boeing to a SpaceX ride back to Earth\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA says chances are growing that two test pilots who flew a new Boeing capsule to the International Space Station in June may have to switch to SpaceX for a ride home. Officials said Wednesday it's still possible astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams can return aboard Boeing's Starliner next month. But if the spacecraft's leaks and thruster problems are not better understood, the two could find themselves up there until February, returning on a SpaceX capsule. Inside NASA, there's dissent over which way to go. NASA is bringing in extra experts to figure out the best path forward.\n\n9/11 hearings at Guantanamo Bay in upheaval after surprise order by US defense chief\n\nFORT MEADE, Md. (AP) -- Military-run hearings for accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are in upheaval following Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's decision to throw out a plea agreement. Defense attorneys contend the plea deal still stands and suspended participation in the pre-trial hearings while legal challenges to Austin's action play out. The judge overseeing the case acknowledged concerns over outside pressure on the case. The events of the past week are the latest significant disruption of the U.S. military prosecution of defendants accused in the 2001 killings of nearly 3,000 people, in an al-Qaida plot.\n\nUS abortion numbers have risen slightly since Roe was overturned, study finds\n\nA new report shows the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. went up slightly in the first three months of 2024 compared with before the Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade. The #WeCount report says a major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states have laws to protect prescribers who use telemedicine to see patients in places with abortion bans. The latest edition of the survey counted an average of just under 99,000 abortions per month, compared with 84,000 in the two months before Dobbs. January was the first time since the survey began that it has counted more than 100,000 abortions across the country in a single month.\n\nHamas has a new leader. How will that affect the war in Gaza and cease-fire efforts?\n\nYahya Sinwar's appointment as the top leader of Hamas formalizes a role he assumed in the early hours of Oct. 7, when the surprise attack into Israel that he helped mastermind ushered in the bloodiest chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He's seen as a hard-liner with closer ties to Hamas' armed wing than his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in a Tehran explosion last week that was widely blamed on Israel. Sinwar was already seen as having the final word on any cease-fire agreement for Gaza and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. He's hiding deep inside Gaza. That raises questions as to how he'll manage Hamas, with cadres across the Mideast.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors":

(AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris has declared herself and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz \"joyful warriors\" as they spent their first full day as running mates rallying Democrats across the Midwest. But they got an idea of just how hotly contested the region would be when they overlapped on a Wisconsin tarmac with Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign said it had raised $36 million in the first 24 hours after the vice presidential announcement. Wednesday's trip aimed to shore up support among the younger, diverse, labor-friendly voters who were instrumental in helping President Joe Biden win the 2020 election. That coalition has shown signs of fraying over Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nVance and other Trump allies amplify a false claim about Harris' racial identity\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, is defending a false claim the former president made about Vice President Kamala Harris' racial identity. Trump suggested wrongly that Harris had downplayed her Black heritage in trying to suggest she's inauthentic. Vance says, \"What I took it as was an attack on Kamala Harris being a chameleon.\" Harris is the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants. The Harris campaign has declined to comment specifically on Trump's false claim. The vice president, speaking to a Black sorority last week, accused Trump of \"the same old show: the divisiveness and the disrespect.\"\n\nOrganizers cancel Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna over fears of an attack\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Organizers of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna this week called them off on Wednesday after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the Vienna area such as the concerts as part of her Eras Tour. Swift was scheduled to play at the Austrian capital's Ernst Happel Stadium on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Event organizer Barracuda Music said in a post on its Instagram channel late Wednesday that \"we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.\"\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end in July. That's according to the European climate agency Copernicus. The agency said July 2024's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago. Both the agency and outside experts warned that the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change. It's driving extreme weather events that can be seen regularly, ranging from torrential rains and flooding in South Africa to the earliest Category 4 hurricane ever seen, Beryl, which hammered parts of central America and the southern U.S.\n\nHunter Biden was hired by Romanian businessman trying to 'influence' US agencies, prosecutors say\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutors say Hunter Biden was hired by a Romanian businessman who was trying to \"influence U.S. government agencies\" during Joe Biden's term as vice president. The allegation is in court papers filed Wednesday in the tax case against the president's son. Special counsel David Weiss' team says Hunter Biden's business associate will testify at the upcoming federal tax trial of the president's son about the arrangement with the Romanian executive, Gabriel Popoviciu. An attorney for Hunter Biden didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The allegations are likely to bring a fresh wave of criticism of Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, which have been the center of Republicans' investigations into the president's family.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Aiken resident's search for Amelia Earhart featured in Discovery Channel documentary Wonder what's going to happen with Hotel Aiken?

She beat Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 for her third consecutive victory in the tournament while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender. Both Lin and Imane Khelif have responded to the scrutiny generated by the International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify them from last year's world championships by going on two of the best runs of their careers in Paris. Lin again used her superior height and technique to beat the more physical Kahraman. Lin will fight for gold on Saturday, taking on Julia Szeremeta of Poland.\n\nTropical Storm Debby doles out repeat deluges for weather-weary residents\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is still pushing bad weather up the East Coast, but floodwaters are starting to recede in South Carolina. Residents there began the near-ritualistic task of assessing the damage Wednesday. Some people whose homes were flooded say they were prepared after enduring so many previous storms. Gene Taylor lives north of Charleston along French Quarter Creek in the community of Huger. He estimates that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years. Meanwhile, residents as far away as the Great Lakes and New Jersey have also experienced heavy rains connected to the slow-moving tropical storm.\n\nNASA says chances are growing that astronauts may switch from Boeing to a SpaceX ride back to Earth\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA says chances are growing that two test pilots who flew a new Boeing capsule to the International Space Station in June may have to switch to SpaceX for a ride home. Officials said Wednesday it's still possible astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams can return aboard Boeing's Starliner next month. But if the spacecraft's leaks and thruster problems are not better understood, the two could find themselves up there until February, returning on a SpaceX capsule. Inside NASA, there's dissent over which way to go. NASA is bringing in extra experts to figure out the best path forward.\n\n9/11 hearings at Guantanamo Bay in upheaval after surprise order by US defense chief\n\nFORT MEADE, Md. (AP) -- Military-run hearings for accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are in upheaval following Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's decision to throw out a plea agreement. Defense attorneys contend the plea deal still stands and suspended participation in the pre-trial hearings while legal challenges to Austin's action play out. The judge overseeing the case acknowledged concerns over outside pressure on the case. The events of the past week are the latest significant disruption of the U.S. military prosecution of defendants accused in the 2001 killings of nearly 3,000 people, in an al-Qaida plot.\n\nUS abortion numbers have risen slightly since Roe was overturned, study finds\n\nA new report shows the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. went up slightly in the first three months of 2024 compared with before the Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade. The #WeCount report says a major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states have laws to protect prescribers who use telemedicine to see patients in places with abortion bans. The latest edition of the survey counted an average of just under 99,000 abortions per month, compared with 84,000 in the two months before Dobbs. January was the first time since the survey began that it has counted more than 100,000 abortions across the country in a single month.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news",

(AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris has declared herself and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz \"joyful warriors\" as they spent their first full day as running mates rallying Democrats across the Midwest. But they got an idea of just how hotly contested the region will be when they overlapped on a Wisconsin tarmac with Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign said Wednesday that it had raised $36 million in the first 24 hours after the vice presidential announcement. Wednesday's trip was aimed at shoring up support among the younger, diverse, labor-friendly voters who were instrumental in helping President Joe Biden win the 2020 election. That coalition has shown signs of fraying over Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nVance and other Trump allies amplify a false claim about Harris' racial identity\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, is defending a false claim the former president made about Vice President Kamala Harris' racial identity. Trump suggested wrongly that Harris had downplayed her Black heritage in trying to suggest she's inauthentic. Vance says, \"What I took it as was an attack on Kamala Harris being a chameleon.\" Harris is the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants. The Harris campaign has declined to comment specifically on Trump's false claim. The vice president, speaking to a Black sorority last week, accused Trump of \"the same old show: the divisiveness and the disrespect.\"\n\nOrganizers cancel Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna over fears of an attack\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Organizers of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna this week called them off on Wednesday after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the Vienna area such as the concerts as part of her Eras Tour. Swift was scheduled to play at the Austrian capital's Ernst Happel Stadium on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Event organizer Barracuda Music said in a post on its Instagram channel late Wednesday that \"we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.\"\n\n9/11 hearings at Guantanamo Bay in upheaval after surprise order by US defense chief\n\nFORT MEADE, Md. (AP) -- Military-run hearings for accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are in upheaval following Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's decision to throw out a plea agreement. Defense attorneys contend the plea deal still stands and suspended participation in the pre-trial hearings while legal challenges to Austin's action play out. The judge overseeing the case acknowledged concerns over outside pressure on the case. The events of the past week are the latest significant disruption of the U.S. military prosecution of defendants accused in the 2001 killings of nearly 3,000 people, in an al-Qaida plot.\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division at the Paris Olympics. She beat Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 for her third consecutive victory in the tournament while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender. Both Lin and Imane Khelif have responded to the scrutiny generated by the International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify them from last year's world championships by going on two of the best runs of their careers in Paris. Lin again used her superior height and technique to beat the more physical Kahraman. Lin will fight for gold on Saturday, taking on Julia Szeremeta of Poland.\n\nTropical Storm Debby doles out repeat deluges for weather-weary residents\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is still pushing bad weather up the East Coast, but floodwaters were starting to recede in South Carolina. Residents there began the near-ritualistic task of assessing the damage Wednesday. Some people whose homes were flooded said they were prepared after enduring so many previous storms. Gene Taylor lives north of Charleston along French Quarter Creek in the community of Huger. He estimates this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years. Meanwhile, residents as far away as the Great Lakes and New Jersey experienced heavy rains that are connected to the slow-moving tropical storm.\n\nNASA says chances are growing that astronauts may switch from Boeing to a SpaceX ride back to Earth\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA says chances are growing that two test pilots who flew a new Boeing capsule to the International Space Station in June may have to switch to SpaceX for a ride home. Officials said Wednesday it's still possible astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams can return aboard Boeing's Starliner next month. But if the spacecraft's leaks and thruster problems are not better understood, the two could find themselves up there until February, returning on a SpaceX capsule. Inside NASA, there's dissent over which way to go. NASA is bringing in extra experts to figure out the best path forward.\n\nUS abortion numbers have risen slightly since Roe was overturned, study finds\n\nA new report shows the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. went up slightly in the first three months of 2024 compared with before the Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade. The #WeCount report says a major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states have laws to protect prescribers who use telemedicine to see patients in places with abortion bans. The latest edition of the survey counted an average of just under 99,000 abortions per month, compared with 84,000 in the two months before Dobbs. January was the first time since the survey began that it has counted more than 100,000 abortions across the country in a single month.\n\nHamas has a new leader. How will that affect the war in Gaza and cease-fire efforts?\n\nYahya Sinwar's appointment as the top leader of Hamas formalizes a role he assumed in the early hours of Oct. 7, when the surprise attack into Israel that he helped mastermind ushered in the bloodiest chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He's seen as a hard-liner with closer ties to Hamas' armed wing than his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in a Tehran explosion last week that was widely blamed on Israel. Sinwar was already seen as having the final word on any cease-fire agreement for Gaza and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. He's hiding deep inside Gaza. That raises questions as to how he'll manage Hamas, with cadres across the Mideast.\n\nGreat Barrier Reef waters were hottest in 400 years over the past decade, study finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Ocean temperatures in the Great Barrier Reef reached the highest they've been in 400 years over the past decade, research published Wednesday in the journal Nature found. Researchers from Melbourne University in Australia were able to compare recent ocean temperatures to historical ones by using coral skeleton samples from the Coral Sea to reconstruct sea surface temperature data from 1618 to 1995. They found mostly stable temperatures before 1900, and steady warming from 1960 to 2024. Temperatures were significantly higher over the past decade, when mass bleaching took place. The scientists warned that the reef likely won't survive if planetary warming isn't stopped.\n\nMore from this section\n\nPromoting the Magic of Hollywood with a Summer Cleanup\n\nReformed Gangster

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nThe Walz record: Abortion rights, free lunches for schoolkids, and disputes over a riot response\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Tim Walz and his fellow Democrats have enacted big changes in the two years that they've had full control of the Minnesota Legislature, from expansions of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights to initiatives aimed at making life easier for families. His record is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate. But it draws condemnation from Republicans, who say he squandered a huge budget surplus that should have been used for tax cuts, failed to prevent massive fraud, and acted too slowly to quell the violence that followed the murder of George Floyd.\n\nCarles Puigdemont, ex-Catalan leader, returns to Spain after nearly 7 years as a fugitive\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Former Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont returns to Spain despite an arrest warrant after nearly seven years as a fugitive. He had fled Spain after organizing an illegal independence referendum in the wealthy Spanish region in 2017. Puigdemont defiantly appeared in Barcelona on Thursday after traveling from Belgium and faces charges of embezzlement for his part in the attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain. Puigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nIslamic State group material found at 2nd suspect's home in foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Authorities found Islamic State group and al-Qaida material at the home of the second and final suspect in a foiled plot to attack now-canceled Taylor Swift shows in Austria. No other suspects are being sought after the two were arrested, Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said Thursday in Vienna. He said a tragedy was prevented. A 17-year-old Austrian citizen was arrested by special police forces near the stadium where the concerts were supposed to take place this week. A 19-year-old Austrian has also been arrested. The 17-year-old was employed a few days ago by a company providing services at the venue for the concerts. Austrian security officials allege the two wanted to commit an attack outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using knives or self-made explosives.\n\nIsrael court hears bid to close prison where soldiers are accused of sexually assaulting Palestinian\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court has convened again to consider a petition to shut down a military prison where soldiers have been accused of abusing Palestinian detainees. The court met Wednesday as new information surfaced about an alleged sexual assault of a prisoner, including a video purporting to show the attack. Five soldiers are accused of acts of sodomy against the detainee. Their arrests prompted angry protests by right-wing hardliners. The lawyer for the soldiers says they deny the accusations.\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end in July. That's according to the European climate agency Copernicus. The agency said July 2024's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago. Both the agency and outside experts warned that the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change. It's driving extreme weather events that can be seen regularly, ranging from torrential rains and flooding in South Africa to the earliest Category 4 hurricane ever seen, Beryl, which hammered parts of central America and the southern U.S.\n\nTropical Storm Debby makes 2nd landfall in South Carolina, heavy rain expected up the East Coast\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nNobel laureate Yunus arrives in Bangladesh to take over as interim leader\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus has arrived home from an overseas trip. He will take office on Thursday as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year and increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus landed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country's military chief. Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman was flanked by two navy and air force heads. Some student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him.

Edni L\u00f3pez is one of more than 2,000 people arrested since President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory in the July 28 vote despite strong evidence he lost by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The unprecedented spree of detentions is being urged on by Maduro himself and puts Venezuela on pace to easily exceed those jailed during three previous crackdowns.\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division at the Paris Olympics.

Both Lin and Imane Khelif have responded to the scrutiny generated by the International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify them from last year's world championships by going on two of the best runs of their careers in Paris.

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nThe Walz record: Abortion rights, free lunches for schoolkids, and disputes over a riot response\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Tim Walz and his fellow Democrats have enacted big changes in the two years that they've had full control of the Minnesota Legislature, from expansions of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights to initiatives aimed at making life easier for families. His record is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate. But it draws condemnation from Republicans, who say he squandered a huge budget surplus that should have been used for tax cuts, failed to prevent massive fraud, and acted too slowly to quell the violence that followed the murder of George Floyd.\n\nCarles Puigdemont, ex-Catalan leader, returns to Spain after nearly 7 years as a fugitive\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Former Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont returns to Spain despite an arrest warrant after nearly seven years as a fugitive. He had fled Spain after organizing an illegal independence referendum in the wealthy Spanish region in 2017. Puigdemont defiantly appeared in Barcelona on Thursday after traveling from Belgium and faces charges of embezzlement for his part in the attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain. Puigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nTragedy prevented by foiling apparent plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Austria, official says\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Following the cancellation of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna over an apparent attack plot, Austria's Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said Thursday in Vienna that \"the situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented.\" The cancellations of three sold-out concerts this week devastated Swifties across the globe, many of whom had dropped thousands of euros on travel and lodging in Austria's expensive capital city for the sold-out Eras Tour shows on Thursday, Friday and Saturday at the Ernst Happel Stadium, which sat empty Thursday morning aside from media filming outside.\n\nIsrael court hears bid to close prison where soldiers are accused of sexually assaulting Palestinian\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court has convened again to consider a petition to shut down a military prison where soldiers have been accused of abusing Palestinian detainees. The court met Wednesday as new information surfaced about an alleged sexual assault of a prisoner, including a video purporting to show the attack. Five soldiers are accused of acts of sodomy against the detainee. Their arrests prompted angry protests by right-wing hardliners. The lawyer for the soldiers says they deny the accusations.\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end in July. That's according to the European climate agency Copernicus. The agency said July 2024's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago. Both the agency and outside experts warned that the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change. It's driving extreme weather events that can be seen regularly, ranging from torrential rains and flooding in South Africa to the earliest Category 4 hurricane ever seen, Beryl, which hammered parts of central America and the southern U.S.\n\nTropical Storm Debby makes 2nd landfall in South Carolina, heavy rain expected up the East Coast\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nNobel laureate Yunus arrives in Bangladesh to take over as interim leader\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus has arrived home from an overseas trip. He will take office on Thursday as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year and increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus landed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country's military chief. Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman was flanked by two navy and air force heads. Some student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. They had earlier proposed Yunus to the country's figurehead president who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.\n\nAn aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A Venezuelan aid worker's arrest while catching an international flight has cast a spotlight on the climate of fear and repression engulfing the South American nation in the wake of its disputed presidential election.

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nThe Walz record: Abortion rights, free lunches for schoolkids, and disputes over a riot response\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Tim Walz and his fellow Democrats have enacted big changes in the two years that they've had full control of the Minnesota Legislature, from expansions of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights to initiatives aimed at making life easier for families. His record is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate. But it draws condemnation from Republicans, who say he squandered a huge budget surplus that should have been used for tax cuts, failed to prevent massive fraud, and acted too slowly to quell the violence that followed the murder of George Floyd.\n\nCarles Puigdemont, ex-Catalan leader, returns to Spain after nearly 7 years as a fugitive\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Former Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont returns to Spain despite an arrest warrant after nearly seven years as a fugitive. He had fled Spain after organizing an illegal independence referendum in the wealthy Spanish region in 2017. Puigdemont defiantly appeared in Barcelona on Thursday after traveling from Belgium and faces charges of embezzlement for his part in the attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain. Puigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nIslamic State group material found at 2nd suspect's home in foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Authorities found Islamic State group and al-Qaida material at the home of the second and final suspect in a foiled plot to attack now-canceled Taylor Swift shows in Austria. No other suspects are being sought after the two were arrested, Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said Thursday in Vienna. He said a tragedy was prevented. A 17-year-old Austrian citizen was arrested by special police forces near the stadium where the concerts were supposed to take place this week. A 19-year-old Austrian has also been arrested. The 17-year-old was employed a few days ago by a company providing services at the venue for the concerts. Austrian security officials allege the two wanted to commit an attack outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using knives or self-made explosives.\n\nIsrael court hears bid to close prison where soldiers are accused of sexually assaulting Palestinian\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court has convened again to consider a petition to shut down a military prison where soldiers have been accused of abusing Palestinian detainees. The court met Wednesday as new information surfaced about an alleged sexual assault of a prisoner, including a video purporting to show the attack. Five soldiers are accused of acts of sodomy against the detainee. Their arrests prompted angry protests by right-wing hardliners. The lawyer for the soldiers says they deny the accusations.\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end in July. That's according to the European climate agency Copernicus. The agency said July 2024's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago. Both the agency and outside experts warned that the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change. It's driving extreme weather events that can be seen regularly, ranging from torrential rains and flooding in South Africa to the earliest Category 4 hurricane ever seen, Beryl, which hammered parts of central America and the southern U.S.\n\nTropical Storm Debby makes 2nd landfall in South Carolina, heavy rain expected up the East Coast\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nNobel laureate Yunus arrives in Bangladesh to take over as interim leader\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus has arrived home from an overseas trip. He will take office on Thursday as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year and increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus landed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country's military chief. Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman was flanked by two navy and air force heads. Some student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. They had earlier proposed Yunus to the country's figurehead president who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.\n\nAn aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A Venezuelan aid worker's arrest while catching an international flight has cast a spotlight on the climate of fear and repression engulfing the South American nation in the wake of its disputed presidential election. Edni L\u00f3pez is one of more than 2,000 people arrested since President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory in the July 28 vote despite strong evidence he lost by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The unprecedented spree of detentions is being urged on by Maduro himself and puts Venezuela on pace to easily exceed those jailed during three previous crackdowns.\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division at the Paris Olympics. She beat Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 for her third consecutive victory in the tournament while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender. Both Lin and Imane Khelif have responded to the scrutiny generated by the International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify them from last year's world championships by going on two of the best runs of their careers in Paris. Lin again used her superior height and technique to beat the more physical Kahraman.

(AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris declared herself and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, \"joyful warriors\" against Donald Trump on Wednesday as they spent their first full day campaigning together across the Midwest. They got an unusual glimpse of how hotly contested the region would be when they overlapped on a Wisconsin tarmac with Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance.\n\nThe Democrats visited Wisconsin and Michigan, hoping to shore up support among the younger, diverse, labor-friendly voters who were instrumental in helping President Joe Biden win the 2020 election.\n\nHarris told the day's first rally in Eau Claire, \"As Tim Walz likes to point out, we are joyful warriors.\" Contributing to that feeling, the Harris campaign said it had raised $36 million in the first 24 hours after she announced Walz as her running mate.\n\nThe vice president said the pair looks at the future with optimism, unlike Trump, the former president and Republican White House nominee, whom she accused of being stuck in the past and preferring a confrontational style of politics -- even as she criticized her opponent herself.\n\n\"Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have the chance to sit behind the seal of the United States,\" Harris said, her voice rising.\n\nVance and other Trump allies amplify a false claim about Harris' racial identity\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, defended on Wednesday a false claim the former president made about Vice President Kamala Harris ' racial identity, suggesting wrongly that Harris had downplayed her Black heritage in trying to suggest she's inauthentic.\n\n\"What I took it as was an attack on Kamala Harris being a chameleon,\" he told reporters when asked in Michigan about the former president's suggestion that Harris, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, had only recently identified as Black.\n\n\"I think he was observing the basic foundational reality that Kamala Harris pretends to be something different depending on what audience she's speaking to,\" Vance said. \"She fakes who she is depending on the audience she's in front of, and that's who she is and that's who she's always been.\"\n\nVance's was the most recent of the Republican criticisms of how Harris portrays herself, in the wake of Trump's comments last week to the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago. Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, a high-profile Trump surrogate who is a Black man, echoed the claim on Sunday as a guest on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nThe proliferation of Trump's falsehood by other Republicans is part of their effort to stay in his favor, said former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele.\n\nOrganizers cancel Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna over fears of an attack\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Organizers of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna this week called them off on Wednesday after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the Vienna area such as the concerts.\n\nSwift was scheduled to play at the Austrian capital's Ernst Happel Stadium on Thursday, Friday and Saturday as part of her Eras Tour.\n\nEvent organizer Barracuda Music said in a post on its Instagram channel late Wednesday that \"we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.\" It cited government officials' \"confirmation\" of a planned attack at the stadium.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, authorities said they had arrested two suspected extremists, one of whom appeared to be planning an attack on an event in the Vienna area such as the upcoming concerts.\n\nThe 19-year-old main suspect was arrested in Ternitz, south of Vienna, and the second person in the Austrian capital.\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end this past July as the natural El Nino climate pattern ebbed, the European climate agency Copernicus announced Wednesday.\n\nBut July 2024 's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago, and scientists said the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change.\n\n\"The overall context hasn't changed,\" Copernicus deputy director Samantha Burgess said in a statement. \"Our climate continues to warm.\"\n\nHuman-caused climate change drives extreme weather events that are wreaking havoc around the globe, with several examples just in recent weeks. In Cape Town, South Africa, thousands were displaced by torrential rain, gale-force winds, flooding and more. A fatal landslide hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island. Beryl left a massive path of destruction as it set the record for the earliest Category 4 hurricane. And Japanese authorities said more than 120 people died in record heat in Tokyo.\n\nThose hot temperatures have been especially merciless.\n\nHunter Biden was hired by Romanian businessman trying to 'influence' US agencies, prosecutors say\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hunter Biden was hired by a Romanian businessman accused of corruption who was trying to \"influence U.S. government policy\" during Joe Biden's term as vice president, prosecutors said in court papers Wednesday.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss' team said Hunter Biden's business associate will testify at the upcoming federal tax trial of the president's son about the arrangement with the executive, Gabriel Popoviciu, who was facing criminal investigation at the time in Romania.\n\nThe allegations are likely to bring a fresh wave of criticism of Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, which have been the center of Republicans' investigations into the president's family. Hunter Biden has blasted Republican inquiries into his family's business affairs as politically motivated, and has insisted he never involved his father in his business.\n\nAn attorney for Hunter Biden didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nProsecutors plan to introduce evidence that Hunter Biden and his business associate \"received compensation from a foreign principal who was attempting to influence U.S. policy and public opinion,\" according to the filing. Popoviciu wanted U.S. government agencies to probe the Romanian bribery investigation he was facing in the hopes that would end his legal trouble, according to prosecutors.\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division, winning her third consecutive bout while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender at the Paris Olympics.\n\nOne day after welterweight Imane Khelif of Algeria reached the women's welterweight final with a third straight victory in Paris, Lin defeated Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 on Wednesday night for her third win.\n\nLin will fight for gold on Saturday, taking on Julia Szeremeta of Poland.\n\n\"I will use everything I've learned in my life to do my best in the next match,\" Lin said through an interpreter.\n\nLin and Khelif both have won every round in all three of their Olympic bouts despite the massive distractions created by the fallout from the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association's decision last year to disqualify both fighters from the world championships for allegedly failing an eligibility test.\n\nTropical Storm Debby doles out repeat deluges for weather-weary residents\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Days of rain forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Tropical Storm Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\nNASA says chances are growing that astronauts may switch from Boeing to a SpaceX ride back to Earth\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- What should have been a quick trip to the International Space Station may turn into an eight-month stay for two NASA astronauts if they have to switch from Boeing to SpaceX for a ride home.\n\nThere's lingering uncertainty over the safety of Boeing's new Starliner capsule, NASA officials said Wednesday, and the space agency is split over the risk. As a result, chances are increasing that test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams may have to watch from the space station as their Starliner is cut loose to return to Earth empty.\n\nIf that happens, NASA would leave behind two of four astronauts from the next SpaceX taxi flight in late September, with the vacant seats set aside for Wilmore and Williams on the return trip next February. The pair expected to be gone just a week or two when they launched June 5 as Starliner's first crew.\n\nNASA is bringing in additional experts to analyze the thruster failures experienced by Starliner before it docked. At the same time, NASA is looking more closely at SpaceX as a backup,\n\nAt this point, \"we could take either path,\" said Ken Bowersox, NASA's space operations mission chief.\n\n9/11 hearings at Guantanamo Bay in upheaval after surprise order by US defense chief\n\nFORT MEADE, Md. (AP) -- Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's surprise decision to throw out a plea deal with accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two of his co-defendants has left their case at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in disarray, with the defense, prosecution and judge all uncertain about when and how it would move forward.\n\nA court session on Wednesday was the first since the Pentagon released notice of Austin's decision late Friday. The plea agreement, which would have spared the defendants the risk of the death penalty, generated strong feelings among both opponents and supporters of the deal, including the families of Sept. 11 victims. It drew intense criticism of the Biden administration from senior Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe disruption caused by the unexpected override of the plea deal was just the latest to hit the special U.S. military-run commissions and their more than decadelong effort to bring the men accused of killing nearly 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001, to trial.\n\nThe unusual location and nature of the offshore commissions, and legal challenges, including those stemming from the torture the men underwent in CIA custody in the first years after their capture, all have contributed to the delays, keeping the case still in pre-trial hearings.\n\nDefense attorneys on Wednesday said they would challenge the legality of Austin's order and suspended their participation in hearings until those challenges were resolved. They contended that the plea deal still stood.\n\nUS abortion numbers have risen slightly since Roe was overturned, study finds\n\nThe number of women getting abortions in the U.S. actually went up in the first three months of 2024 compared with before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, a report released Wednesday found, reflecting the lengths that Democratic-controlled states went to expand access.\n\nA major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states enacted laws to protect doctors who use telemedicine to see patients in places that have abortion bans, according to the quarterly #WeCount report for the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access.\n\nThe data comes ahead of November elections in which abortion-rights supporters hope the issue will drive voters to the polls. In some places, voters will have a chance to enshrine or reject state-level abortion protections.\n\nFallout from the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has remade the way abortion works across the country. The #WeCount data, which has been collected in a monthly survey since April 2022, shows how those providing and seeking abortion have adapted to changing laws.\n\nThe survey found that the number of abortions fell to nearly zero in states that ban abortion in all stages of pregnancy and declined by about half in places that ban it after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. Fourteen states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four others bar it after about six weeks of pregnancy.", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com",

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nThe Walz record: Abortion rights, free lunches for schoolkids, and disputes over a riot response\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Tim Walz and his fellow Democrats have enacted big changes in the two years that they've had full control of the Minnesota Legislature, from expansions of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights to initiatives aimed at making life easier for families. His record is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate. But it draws condemnation from Republicans, who say he squandered a huge budget surplus that should have been used for tax cuts, failed to prevent massive fraud, and acted too slowly to quell the violence that followed the murder of George Floyd.\n\nCarles Puigdemont, ex-Catalan leader, returns to Spain after nearly 7 years as a fugitive\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Former Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont returns to Spain despite an arrest warrant after nearly seven years as a fugitive. He had fled Spain after organizing an illegal independence referendum in the wealthy Spanish region in 2017. Puigdemont defiantly appeared in Barcelona on Thursday after traveling from Belgium and faces charges of embezzlement for his part in the attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain. Puigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nOrganizers cancel Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna over fears of an attack\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Organizers of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna this week called them off on Wednesday after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the Vienna area such as the concerts as part of her Eras Tour. Swift was scheduled to play at the Austrian capital's Ernst Happel Stadium on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Event organizer Barracuda Music said in a post on its Instagram channel late Wednesday that \"we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.\"\n\nIsrael court hears bid to close prison where soldiers are accused of sexually assaulting Palestinian\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court has convened again to consider a petition to shut down a military prison where soldiers have been accused of abusing Palestinian detainees. The court met Wednesday as new information surfaced about an alleged sexual assault of a prisoner, including a video purporting to show the attack. Five soldiers are accused of acts of sodomy against the detainee. Their arrests prompted angry protests by right-wing hardliners. The lawyer for the soldiers says they deny the accusations.\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end in July. That's according to the European climate agency Copernicus. The agency said July 2024's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago. Both the agency and outside experts warned that the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change. It's driving extreme weather events that can be seen regularly, ranging from torrential rains and flooding in South Africa to the earliest Category 4 hurricane ever seen, Beryl, which hammered parts of central America and the southern U.S.\n\nTropical Storm Debby makes 2nd landfall in South Carolina, heavy rain expected up the East Coast\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nMuhammad Yunus is heading to Bangladesh to take office as its interim leader Thursday\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus was heading home to take office later Thursday after imploring people to stay calm and be ready to rebuild the country after an uprising that ended the 15-year, increasingly autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina. Yunus is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who was jailed under Hasina's rule on corruption allegations his supporters contended were political. He was in Paris for the Olympics when he was named interim leader following talks among military officials and student activists who led the uprising against Hasina. Bangladesh's military chief said an interim government headed by Yunus would be sworn in Thursday night. It will remain in office until an election that hasn't been scheduled.\n\nAn aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A Venezuelan aid worker's arrest while catching an international flight has cast a spotlight on the climate of fear and repression engulfing the South American nation in the wake of its disputed presidential election. Edni L\u00f3pez is one of more than 2,000 people arrested since President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory in the July 28 vote despite strong evidence he lost by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The unprecedented spree of detentions is being urged on by Maduro himself and puts Venezuela on pace to easily exceed those jailed during three previous crackdowns.\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division at the Paris Olympics. She beat Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 for her third consecutive victory in the tournament while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender. Both Lin and Imane Khelif have responded to the scrutiny generated by the International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify them from last year's world championships by going on two of the best runs of their careers in Paris. Lin again used her superior height and technique to beat the more physical Kahraman. Lin will fight for gold on Saturday, taking on Julia Szeremeta of Poland.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They got an unusual glimpse of how hotly contested the region would be when they overlapped on a Wisconsin tarmac with Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance.\n\nThe Democrats visited Wisconsin and Michigan, hoping to shore up support among the younger, diverse, labor-friendly voters who were instrumental in helping President Joe Biden win the 2020 election.\n\nHarris told the day's first rally in Eau Claire, \"As Tim Walz likes to point out, we are joyful warriors.\" Contributing to that feeling, the Harris campaign said it had raised $36 million in the first 24 hours after she announced Walz as her running mate.\n\nThe vice president said the pair looks at the future with optimism, unlike Trump, the former president and Republican White House nominee, whom she accused of being stuck in the past and preferring a confrontational style of politics -- even as she criticized her opponent herself.\n\n\"Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have the chance to sit behind the seal of the United States,\" Harris said, her voice rising.\n\nVance and other Trump allies amplify a false claim about Harris' racial identity\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, defended on Wednesday a false claim the former president made about Vice President Kamala Harris ' racial identity, suggesting wrongly that Harris had downplayed her Black heritage in trying to suggest she's inauthentic.\n\n\"What I took it as was an attack on Kamala Harris being a chameleon,\" he told reporters when asked in Michigan about the former president's suggestion that Harris, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, had only recently identified as Black.\n\n\"I think he was observing the basic foundational reality that Kamala Harris pretends to be something different depending on what audience she's speaking to,\" Vance said. \"She fakes who she is depending on the audience she's in front of, and that's who she is and that's who she's always been.\"\n\nVance's was the most recent of the Republican criticisms of how Harris portrays herself, in the wake of Trump's comments last week to the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago. Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, a high-profile Trump surrogate who is a Black man, echoed the claim on Sunday as a guest on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nThe proliferation of Trump's falsehood by other Republicans is part of their effort to stay in his favor, said former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele.\n\nOrganizers cancel Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna over fears of an attack\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Organizers of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna this week called them off on Wednesday after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the Vienna area such as the concerts.\n\nSwift was scheduled to play at the Austrian capital's Ernst Happel Stadium on Thursday, Friday and Saturday as part of her Eras Tour.\n\nEvent organizer Barracuda Music said in a post on its Instagram channel late Wednesday that \"we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.\" It cited government officials' \"confirmation\" of a planned attack at the stadium.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, authorities said they had arrested two suspected extremists, one of whom appeared to be planning an attack on an event in the Vienna area such as the upcoming concerts.\n\nThe 19-year-old main suspect was arrested in Ternitz, south of Vienna, and the second person in the Austrian capital.\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end this past July as the natural El Nino climate pattern ebbed, the European climate agency Copernicus announced Wednesday.\n\nBut July 2024 's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago, and scientists said the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change.\n\n\"The overall context hasn't changed,\" Copernicus deputy director Samantha Burgess said in a statement. \"Our climate continues to warm.\"\n\nHuman-caused climate change drives extreme weather events that are wreaking havoc around the globe, with several examples just in recent weeks. In Cape Town, South Africa, thousands were displaced by torrential rain, gale-force winds, flooding and more. A fatal landslide hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island. Beryl left a massive path of destruction as it set the record for the earliest Category 4 hurricane. And Japanese authorities said more than 120 people died in record heat in Tokyo.\n\nThose hot temperatures have been especially merciless.\n\nHamas has a new leader. How will that affect the war in Gaza and cease-fire efforts?\n\nYahya Sinwar's appointment as the top leader of Hamas formalizes a role he assumed in the early hours of Oct. 7, when the surprise attack into Israel that he helped mastermind ushered in the bloodiest chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nHe is seen as a hard-liner with closer ties to Hamas' armed wing than his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in an explosion in Iran's capital last month that was widely blamed on Israel and could spark an all-out regional war.\n\nSinwar was already seen as having the final word on any cease-fire agreement for Gaza and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas.\n\nBut he is deep in hiding inside Gaza, and mediators say it takes several days to exchange messages with him. That raises questions about how he would manage a sprawling organization with cadres across the Middle East.\n\nHamas has survived the killing of several top leaders across more than three decades, while maintaining a high degree of internal cohesion -- and tapping Sinwar, who tops Israel's most-wanted list, was a show of defiance.\n\nTropical Storm Debby doles out repeat deluges for weather-weary residents\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Days of rain forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Tropical Storm Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\nHunter Biden was hired by Romanian businessman trying to 'influence' US agencies, prosecutors say\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hunter Biden was hired by a Romanian businessman accused of corruption who was trying to \"influence U.S. government policy\" during Joe Biden's term as vice president, prosecutors said in court papers Wednesday.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss' team said Hunter Biden's business associate will testify at the upcoming federal tax trial of the president's son about the arrangement with the executive, Gabriel Popoviciu, who was facing criminal investigation at the time in Romania.\n\nThe allegations are likely to bring a fresh wave of criticism of Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, which have been the center of Republicans' investigations into the president's family. Hunter Biden has blasted Republican inquiries into his family's business affairs as politically motivated, and has insisted he never involved his father in his business.\n\nAn attorney for Hunter Biden didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nProsecutors plan to introduce evidence that Hunter Biden and his business associate \"received compensation from a foreign principal who was attempting to influence U.S. policy and public opinion,\" according to the filing. Popoviciu wanted U.S. government agencies to probe the Romanian bribery investigation he was facing in the hopes that would end his legal trouble, according to prosecutors.\n\nNASA says chances are growing that astronauts may switch from Boeing to a SpaceX ride back to Earth\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- What should have been a quick trip to the International Space Station may turn into an eight-month stay for two NASA astronauts if they have to switch from Boeing to SpaceX for a ride home.\n\nThere's lingering uncertainty over the safety of Boeing's new Starliner capsule, NASA officials said Wednesday, and the space agency is split over the risk. As a result, chances are increasing that test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams may have to watch from the space station as their Starliner is cut loose to return to Earth empty.\n\nIf that happens, NASA would leave behind two of four astronauts from the next SpaceX taxi flight in late September, with the vacant seats set aside for Wilmore and Williams on the return trip next February. The pair expected to be gone just a week or two when they launched June 5 as Starliner's first crew.\n\nNASA is bringing in additional experts to analyze the thruster failures experienced by Starliner before it docked. At the same time, NASA is looking more closely at SpaceX as a backup,\n\nAt this point, \"we could take either path,\" said Ken Bowersox, NASA's space operations mission chief.\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division, winning her third consecutive bout while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender at the Paris Olympics.\n\nOne day after welterweight Imane Khelif of Algeria reached the women's welterweight final with a third straight victory in Paris, Lin defeated Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 on Wednesday night for her third win.\n\nLin will fight for gold on Saturday, taking on Julia Szeremeta of Poland.\n\n\"I will use everything I've learned in my life to do my best in the next match,\" Lin said through an interpreter.\n\nLin and Khelif both have won every round in all three of their Olympic bouts despite the massive distractions created by the fallout from the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association's decision last year to disqualify both fighters from the world championships for allegedly failing an eligibility test.\n\nA good day, mate: Kennedy wins pole vault at Paris Games for Australia's record 18th Olympic gold\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Nina Kennedy bounced off the pole vault mats and punched the air once, twice, three times. She ran over to the Olympic crowd and took another three swings at the air.\n\nAussies in the stands flew the flag, shook green-and-gold banners and held up yellow inflatable kangaroos.\n\nKennedy didn't know at that stage she would deliver Australia an 18th gold medal at the Paris Games -- a national record for the Olympics. That was just the celebration for clearing the height to take the lead.\n\nKennedy clinched the victory a bit later Wednesday when Tokyo Olympic gold medalist Katie Moon failed to clear 4.95 meters after a three-hour final.\n\nThen the emotions took over. Kennedy raced back to her supporters in the crowd and the tears flowed as she hugged friends, family and discus throw bronze medalist Matthew Denny, who just happened to be walking back after his final to join the group. Then Kennedy sprang back across the track, hopping with delight.", "source": {"uri": "maryvilleforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Maryville Forum"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nThe Walz record: Abortion rights, free lunches for schoolkids, and disputes over a riot response\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Tim Walz and his fellow Democrats have enacted big changes in the two years that they've had full control of the Minnesota Legislature, from expansions of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights to initiatives aimed at making life easier for families. His record is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate. But it draws condemnation from Republicans, who say he squandered a huge budget surplus that should have been used for tax cuts, failed to prevent massive fraud, and acted too slowly to quell the violence that followed the murder of George Floyd.\n\nSuspects hoped to 'kill as many people as possible' in foiled plot at Taylor Swift shows in Vienna\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Austrian security officials say two young men have been arrested in a foiled plot to attack now-canceled Taylor Swift shows in Vienna. They say the 19-year-old main suspect has fully confessed to his plans to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\" Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said Thursday in Vienna that no other suspects are being sought after the two were arrested. He said a tragedy was prevented. A 17-year-old Austrian citizen was arrested by special police forces near the stadium where the concerts were supposed to take place this week. The 17-year-old was employed a few days ago by a company providing services at the venue for the concerts.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war latest: Rights group says Israeli forces killed 7 sheltering in a Gaza City home\n\nA Human Rights Watch report says Israeli soldiers killed at least seven people and severely wounded two, including a 5-year-old, when they attacked a home in Gaza City where a Palestinian family was sheltering from the Israel-Hamas war in December. Gaza faces a severe humanitarian crisis with Israeli restrictions on aid and ongoing fighting limiting access to crucial medical, food and other supplies. The Health Ministry says the death toll in the territory is nearing 40,000. Regional tensions have soared since Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed July 31 in Iran by a presumed Israeli strike. France's president called Iran's, asking him to do everything in his power to avoid a new military escalation.\n\nNobel laureate Yunus arrives in Bangladesh to take over as interim leader\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus has arrived home from an overseas trip. He will take office on Thursday as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year and increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus landed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country's military chief. Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman was flanked by two navy and air force heads. Some student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. They had earlier proposed Yunus to the country's figurehead president who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.\n\nEx-Catalan leader gives police the slip on his return to Spain after nearly 7 years as a fugitive\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Police have launched a manhunt in Barcelona for ex-Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont. The celebrated Catalan separatist returned to Spain on Thursday seven years after fleeing the country. He faces an outstanding arrest warrant. Puigdemont secretly traveled from his residence in Belgium to northeastern Spain and made a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the noses of police officers. They made no attempt to detain him. Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent after his speech. He then hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away.\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end in July. That's according to the European climate agency Copernicus. The agency said July 2024's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago. Both the agency and outside experts warned that the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change. It's driving extreme weather events that can be seen regularly, ranging from torrential rains and flooding in South Africa to the earliest Category 4 hurricane ever seen, Beryl, which hammered parts of central America and the southern U.S.\n\nTropical Storm Debby makes 2nd landfall in South Carolina, heavy rain expected up the East Coast\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Considerable flooding is expected across parts of North and South Carolina through Friday, as well as in portions of Virginia. The storm spawned an apparent tornado early Thursday that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County, North Carolina. east of Raleigh.\n\nAn aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A Venezuelan aid worker's arrest while catching an international flight has cast a spotlight on the climate of fear and repression engulfing the South American nation in the wake of its disputed presidential election. Edni L\u00f3pez is one of more than 2,000 people arrested since President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory in the July 28 vote despite strong evidence he lost by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The unprecedented spree of detentions is being urged on by Maduro himself and puts Venezuela on pace to easily exceed those jailed during three previous crackdowns.\n\nThose Samsung smartphones given to Olympic athletes? They may violate sanctions on North Korea\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean officials have flagged that the sleek Samsung smartphones provided to North Korean athletes at the Olympics would violate U.N. Security Council sanctions against the country over its nuclear ambitions. The South Korean technology giant is a major Olympic partner, and its newest Galaxy Z Flip 6 smartphones are being given to all athletes competing at the Paris Games. The International Olympic Committee confirmed the phones went to the Olympic village bound for the North Korean athletes, but it was unclear what happened to them after that. South Korea's Foreign Ministry said smartphones are among the items banned under a 2017 resolution prohibiting the supply, sale or transfer to North Korea of \"all industrial machinery.\"\n\nMore from

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nThe Walz record: Abortion rights, free lunches for schoolkids, and disputes over a riot response\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Tim Walz and his fellow Democrats have enacted big changes in the two years that they've had full control of the Minnesota Legislature, from expansions of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights to initiatives aimed at making life easier for families. His record is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate. But it draws condemnation from Republicans, who say he squandered a huge budget surplus that should have been used for tax cuts, failed to prevent massive fraud, and acted too slowly to quell the violence that followed the murder of George Floyd.\n\nCarles Puigdemont, ex-Catalan leader, returns to Spain after nearly 7 years as a fugitive\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Former Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont returns to Spain despite an arrest warrant after nearly seven years as a fugitive. He had fled Spain after organizing an illegal independence referendum in the wealthy Spanish region in 2017. Puigdemont defiantly appeared in Barcelona on Thursday after traveling from Belgium and faces charges of embezzlement for his part in the attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain. Puigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nChemical substances found at home of Austrian suspected of planning attack on Taylor Swift concerts\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Austria's intelligence chief says chemical substances were found at the house of a 19-year-old Austrian suspected of planning an attack on upcoming Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna. The public security director at Austria's Interior Ministry says investigators found chemical substances and and technical devices at the 19-year-old suspect's house. Just a few weeks ago, the suspect had uploaded an oath of allegiance to the current leader of the Islamic State group militia to an internet account. The concerts' cancellations devastated Swifties across the globe, many of whom had dropped thousands of euros on travel and lodging for the sold-out Eras Tour shows on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\n\nIsrael court hears bid to close prison where soldiers are accused of sexually assaulting Palestinian\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court has convened again to consider a petition to shut down a military prison where soldiers have been accused of abusing Palestinian detainees. The court met Wednesday as new information surfaced about an alleged sexual assault of a prisoner, including a video purporting to show the attack. Five soldiers are accused of acts of sodomy against the detainee. Their arrests prompted angry protests by right-wing hardliners. The lawyer for the soldiers says they deny the accusations.\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end in July. That's according to the European climate agency Copernicus. The agency said July 2024's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago. Both the agency and outside experts warned that the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change. It's driving extreme weather events that can be seen regularly, ranging from torrential rains and flooding in South Africa to the earliest Category 4 hurricane ever seen, Beryl, which hammered parts of central America and the southern U.S.\n\nTropical Storm Debby makes 2nd landfall in South Carolina, heavy rain expected up the East Coast\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nNobel laureate Yunus arrives in Bangladesh to take over as interim leader\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus has arrived home from an overseas trip. He will take office on Thursday as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year and increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus landed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country's military chief. Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman was flanked by two navy and air force heads. Some student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. They had earlier proposed Yunus to the country's figurehead president who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.\n\nAn aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A Venezuelan aid worker's arrest while catching an international flight has cast a spotlight on the climate of fear and repression engulfing the South American nation in the wake of its disputed presidential election.

She beat Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 for her third consecutive victory in the tournament while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender. Both Lin and Imane Khelif have responded to the scrutiny generated by the International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify them from last year's world championships by going on two of the best runs of their careers in Paris. Lin again used her superior height and technique to beat the more physical Kahraman.

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nThe Walz record: Abortion rights, free lunches for schoolkids, and disputes over a riot response\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Tim Walz and his fellow Democrats have enacted big changes in the two years that they've had full control of the Minnesota Legislature, from expansions of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights to initiatives aimed at making life easier for families. His record is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate. But it draws condemnation from Republicans, who say he squandered a huge budget surplus that should have been used for tax cuts, failed to prevent massive fraud, and acted too slowly to quell the violence that followed the murder of George Floyd.\n\nCarles Puigdemont, ex-Catalan leader, returns to Spain after nearly 7 years as a fugitive\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Former Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont returns to Spain despite an arrest warrant after nearly seven years as a fugitive. He had fled Spain after organizing an illegal independence referendum in the wealthy Spanish region in 2017. Puigdemont defiantly appeared in Barcelona on Thursday after traveling from Belgium and faces charges of embezzlement for his part in the attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain. Puigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\n3 Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna are canceled over fears of an attack, leaving fans devastated\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna this week are canceled following arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack in the area, potentially at the stadium itself. At least one of the suspects has been linked to the Islamic State group. The superstar's Eras Tour was scheduled for the Ernst Happel Stadium in sold-out shows Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The cancellations left tens of thousands of fans devastated. Many had planned to travel from across the globe to the Austrian capital. Others had already arrived by the time the news broke late Wednesday. The event organizer says it had no choice but to cancel.\n\nIsrael court hears bid to close prison where soldiers are accused of sexually assaulting Palestinian\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court has convened again to consider a petition to shut down a military prison where soldiers have been accused of abusing Palestinian detainees. The court met Wednesday as new information surfaced about an alleged sexual assault of a prisoner, including a video purporting to show the attack. Five soldiers are accused of acts of sodomy against the detainee. Their arrests prompted angry protests by right-wing hardliners. The lawyer for the soldiers says they deny the accusations.\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end in July. That's according to the European climate agency Copernicus. The agency said July 2024's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago. Both the agency and outside experts warned that the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change. It's driving extreme weather events that can be seen regularly, ranging from torrential rains and flooding in South Africa to the earliest Category 4 hurricane ever seen, Beryl, which hammered parts of central America and the southern U.S.\n\nTropical Storm Debby makes 2nd landfall in South Carolina, heavy rain expected up the East Coast\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nYunus arrives in Bangladesh from an overseas trip to take over as the country's interim leader\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus arrived home Thursday from an overseas trip and will take office later in the day, as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year, increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus landed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country's military chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman, who was flanked by two navy and air force heads. Some student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. Earlier, they had proposed Yunus to the country's figurehead president, who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.\n\nAn aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A Venezuelan aid worker's arrest while catching an international flight has cast a spotlight on the climate of fear and repression engulfing the South American nation in the wake of its disputed presidential election. Edni L\u00f3pez is one of more than 2,000 people arrested since President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory in the July 28 vote despite strong evidence he lost by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The unprecedented spree of detentions is being urged on by Maduro himself and puts Venezuela on pace to easily exceed those jailed during three previous crackdowns.\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division at the Paris Olympics. She beat Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 for her third consecutive victory in the tournament while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender. Both Lin and Imane Khelif have responded to the scrutiny generated by the International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify them from last year's world championships by going on two of the best runs of their careers in Paris. Lin again used her superior height and technique to beat the more physical Kahraman. Lin will fight for gold on Saturday, taking on Julia Szeremeta of Poland.\n\nMore from this section\n\nEnergyCAP Appoints Shawn Lankton as Chief Executive Officer\n\nLutheran Home's 'Best Friend's

Yunus is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who was jailed under Hasina's rule on corruption allegations his supporters contended were political. He was in Paris for the Olympics when he was named interim leader following talks among military officials and student activists who led the uprising against Hasina. Bangladesh's military chief said an interim government headed by Yunus would be sworn in Thursday night. It will remain in office until an election that hasn't been scheduled.\n\nAn aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A Venezuelan aid worker's arrest while catching an international flight has cast a spotlight on the climate of fear and repression engulfing the South American nation in the wake of its disputed presidential election. Edni L\u00f3pez is one of more than 2,000 people arrested since President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory in the July 28 vote despite strong evidence he lost by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The unprecedented spree of detentions is being urged on by Maduro himself and puts Venezuela on pace to easily exceed those jailed during three previous crackdowns.\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division at the Paris Olympics. She beat Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 for her third consecutive victory in the tournament while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender. Both Lin and Imane Khelif have responded to the scrutiny generated by the International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify them from last year's world championships by going on two of the best runs of their careers in Paris. Lin again used her superior height and technique to beat the more physical Kahraman. Lin will fight for gold on Saturday, taking on Julia Szeremeta of Poland.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nThe Walz record: Abortion rights, free lunches for schoolkids, and disputes over a riot response\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Tim Walz and his fellow Democrats have enacted big changes in the two years that they've had full control of the Minnesota Legislature, from expansions of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights to initiatives aimed at making life easier for families. His record is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate. But it draws condemnation from Republicans, who say he squandered a huge budget surplus that should have been used for tax cuts, failed to prevent massive fraud, and acted too slowly to quell the violence that followed the murder of George Floyd.\n\nOfficials say suspects in foiled plot at Taylor Swift shows hoped to kill as many people as possible\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Austrian authorities say both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. They said Thursday that investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\" Three sold-out concerts were canceled a day earlier because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe, many of whom had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging to attend the Eras Tour shows. Concert organizers said they stood behind their decision to cancel all three events, saying they expected up to 65,000 fans inside the venue at each concert and as many as 30,000 onlookers outside.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war latest: The Israeli military orders another mass evacuation in southern Gaza\n\nThe Israeli military has ordered another mass evacuation in large areas around Khan Younis in southern Gaza, saying its forces will soon operate there in response to Palestinian rocket fire.

But then he vanishes again\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Police have launched a manhunt in Barcelona for ex-Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont. The celebrated Catalan separatist returned to Spain on Thursday seven years after fleeing the country. He faces an outstanding arrest warrant.

Here's how to see the 'fireballs' of summer's brightest meteor shower\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Perseid meteor shower reaches its peak early Monday. Astronomers say it's one of the brightest and most easily visible showers of the year. This year's peak activity coincides with a moon that is 44% full.

They may violate sanctions on North Korea\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean officials say providing Samsung smartphones to North Korean athletes at the Paris Olympics would violate U.N. Security Council sanctions against the country over its nuclear ambitions.

Tim Walz, are showing their support for organized labor by appearing at a Detroit-area union hall. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Walz are set to speak Thursday to several dozen United Auto Workers members. Harris and Walz are making joint campaign appearances this week in some of the most closely contested states that will decide the November election against Republican Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance. Michigan is one of those states and organized labor is a crucial base of support for Democrats.\n\nMajority of US adults say democracy is on the ballot but they differ on the threat: AP-NORC poll\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A poll shows that most Americans believe this year's presidential race will be crucial for the future of the country's democracy. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nSuspects in foiled attack on Taylor Swift shows were inspired by Islamic State group, officials say\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Austrian authorities say both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. They said Thursday that investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\" Three sold-out concerts were canceled a day earlier because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe, many of whom had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging to attend the Eras Tour shows. Concert organizers said they stood behind their decision to cancel all three events, saying they expected up to 65,000 fans inside the venue at each concert and as many as 30,000 onlookers outside.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war latest: The Israeli military orders another mass evacuation in southern Gaza\n\nThe Israeli military has ordered another mass evacuation in large areas around Khan Younis in southern Gaza, saying its forces will soon operate there in response to Palestinian rocket fire. The city suffered widespread destruction during air and ground operations earlier this year. Gaza faces a severe humanitarian crisis with Israeli restrictions on aid and ongoing fighting limiting access to crucial medical, food and other supplies. The Health Ministry says the death toll in the territory is nearing 40,000. Regional tensions have soared since Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed July 31 in Iran by a presumed Israeli strike. France's president called Iran's, asking him to do everything in his power to avoid a new military escalation.\n\nNobel laureate Yunus arrives in Bangladesh to take over as interim leader\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus has arrived home from an overseas trip. He will take office on Thursday as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year and increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus landed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country's military chief. Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman was flanked by two navy and air force heads. Some student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. They had earlier proposed Yunus to the country's figurehead president who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.\n\nEx-Catalan leader Puigdemont, a fugitive since 2017, returns to Spain. But then he vanishes again\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Police have launched a manhunt in Barcelona for ex-Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont. The celebrated Catalan separatist returned to Spain on Thursday seven years after fleeing the country. He faces an outstanding arrest warrant. Puigdemont secretly traveled from his residence in Belgium to northeastern Spain and made a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the noses of police officers. They made no attempt to detain him. Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent after his speech. He then hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away. Catalan police arrested one of their own officers on charges of aiding Puigdemont's getaway.\n\nTropical Storm Debby makes 2nd landfall in South Carolina, heavy rain expected up the East Coast\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is still spreading heavy rain and more flooding is expected as it moves inland through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. Troopers closed part of Interstate 95 in North Carolina after water covered the freeway. One of the tornadoes spawned by the storm damaged at least four houses, a church and a school east of Raleigh.\n\nAn aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A Venezuelan aid worker's arrest while catching an international flight has cast a spotlight on the climate of fear and repression engulfing the South American nation in the wake of its disputed presidential election. Edni L\u00f3pez is one of more than 2,000 people arrested since President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory in the July 28 vote despite strong evidence he lost by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The unprecedented spree of detentions is being urged on by Maduro himself and puts Venezuela on pace to easily exceed those jailed during three previous crackdowns.\n\nThe Perseids are here. Here's how to see the 'fireballs' of summer's brightest meteor shower\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Perseid meteor shower reaches its peak early Monday. Astronomers say it's one of the brightest and most easily visible showers of the year. This year's peak activity coincides with a moon that is 44% full. More than 50 meteors should be visible per hour in rural areas away from city lights. Experts say the meteors will look like \"fireballs\" in the night sky. The Northern Hemisphere will have the best view. The Perseids last through Sept. 1. Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you don't need special equipment to see them.\n\nThose Samsung smartphones given to Olympic athletes? They may violate sanctions on North Korea\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean officials say providing Samsung smartphones to North Korean athletes at the Paris Olympics would violate U.N. Security Council sanctions against the country over its nuclear ambitions. The South Korean technology giant is a major Olympic partner, and its newest Galaxy Z Flip 6 smartphones are being given to all athletes competing at the Games. The International Olympic Committee confirmed the phones were sent to the Olympic village, then later said the North Korean athletes hadn't received them. It's unclear where the phones might have went. South Korea's Foreign Ministry said smartphones are among the items banned under a 2017 resolution prohibiting the supply, sale or transfer to North Korea of \"all industrial machinery.\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nHarris introduces new running mate Minnesota Gov.

His record is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate.

Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

His record is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate.

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nThe Walz record: Abortion rights, free lunches for schoolkids, and disputes over a riot response\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Tim Walz and his fellow Democrats have enacted big changes in the two years that they've had full control of the Minnesota Legislature, from expansions of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights to initiatives aimed at making life easier for families. His record is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate. But it draws condemnation from Republicans, who say he squandered a huge budget surplus that should have been used for tax cuts, failed to prevent massive fraud, and acted too slowly to quell the violence that followed the murder of George Floyd.\n\nIslamic State group material found at 2nd suspect's home in foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Authorities found Islamic State group and al-Qaida material at the home of the second and final suspect in a foiled plot to attack now-canceled Taylor Swift shows in Austria. No other suspects are being sought after the two were arrested, Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said Thursday in Vienna. He said a tragedy was prevented. A 17-year-old Austrian citizen was arrested by special police forces near the stadium where the concerts were supposed to take place this week. A 19-year-old Austrian has also been arrested. The 17-year-old was employed a few days ago by a company providing services at the venue for the concerts. Austrian security officials allege the two wanted to commit an attack outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using knives or self-made explosives.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war latest: Rights group says Israeli forces killed 7 sheltering in a Gaza City home\n\nA Human Rights Watch report says Israeli soldiers killed at least seven people and severely wounded two, including a 5-year-old, when they attacked a home in Gaza City where a Palestinian family was sheltering from the Israel-Hamas war in December. Gaza faces a severe humanitarian crisis with Israeli restrictions on aid and ongoing fighting limiting access to crucial medical, food and other supplies. The Health Ministry says the death toll in the territory is nearing 40,000. Regional tensions have soared since Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed July 31 in Iran by a presumed Israeli strike. France's president called Iran's, asking him to do everything in his power to avoid a new military escalation.\n\nNobel laureate Yunus arrives in Bangladesh to take over as interim leader\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus has arrived home from an overseas trip. He will take office on Thursday as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year and increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus landed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country's military chief. Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman was flanked by two navy and air force heads. Some student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. They had earlier proposed Yunus to the country's figurehead president who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.\n\nEx-Catalan leader gives police the slip on his return to Spain after nearly 7 years as a fugitive\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Police have launched a manhunt in Barcelona for ex-Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont. The celebrated Catalan separatist returned to Spain on Thursday seven years after fleeing the country. He faces an outstanding arrest warrant. Puigdemont secretly traveled from his residence in Belgium to northeastern Spain and made a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the noses of police officers. They made no attempt to detain him. Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent after his speech. He then hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away.\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end in July. That's according to the European climate agency Copernicus. The agency said July 2024's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago. Both the agency and outside experts warned that the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change. It's driving extreme weather events that can be seen regularly, ranging from torrential rains and flooding in South Africa to the earliest Category 4 hurricane ever seen, Beryl, which hammered parts of central America and the southern U.S.\n\nTropical Storm Debby makes 2nd landfall in South Carolina, heavy rain expected up the East Coast\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Considerable flooding is expected across parts of North and South Carolina through Friday, as well as in portions of Virginia. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAn aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A Venezuelan aid worker's arrest while catching an international flight has cast a spotlight on the climate of fear and repression engulfing the South American nation in the wake of its disputed presidential election. Edni L\u00f3pez is one of more than 2,000 people arrested since President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory in the July 28 vote despite strong evidence he lost by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The unprecedented spree of detentions is being urged on by Maduro himself and puts Venezuela on pace to easily exceed those jailed during three previous crackdowns.\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division at the Paris Olympics. She beat Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 for her third consecutive victory in the tournament while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender. Both Lin and Imane Khelif have responded to the scrutiny generated by the International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify them from last year's world championships by going on two of the best runs of their careers in Paris. Lin again used her superior height and technique to beat the more physical Kahraman. Lin will fight for gold on Saturday, taking on Julia Szeremeta of Poland.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nThe Walz record: Abortion rights, free lunches for schoolkids, and disputes over a riot response\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Tim Walz and his fellow Democrats have enacted big changes in the two years that they've had full control of the Minnesota Legislature, from expansions of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights to initiatives aimed at making life easier for families. His record is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate. But it draws condemnation from Republicans, who say he squandered a huge budget surplus that should have been used for tax cuts, failed to prevent massive fraud, and acted too slowly to quell the violence that followed the murder of George Floyd.\n\nTrump praised Minnesota Gov. Walz in 2020 for response to unrest over Floyd's murder, audio shows\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance have been hammering Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over his response to the violence that erupted in the aftermath of the 2020 murder of George Floyd. But Trump described the governor as calm and said, at the time, he fully agreed with how Walz handled it, including his deployment of the Minnesota National Guard. Trump made the statement in a call with Walz and other governors and officials on June 1, 2020. Trump has been falsely claiming lately that he sent in the National Guard. But it was Walz who gave the order.\n\nOrganizers cancel Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna over fears of an attack\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Organizers of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna this week called them off on Wednesday after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the Vienna area such as the concerts as part of her Eras Tour. Swift was scheduled to play at the Austrian capital's Ernst Happel Stadium on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Event organizer Barracuda Music said in a post on its Instagram channel late Wednesday that \"we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.\"\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end in July. That's according to the European climate agency Copernicus. The agency said July 2024's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago. Both the agency and outside experts warned that the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change. It's driving extreme weather events that can be seen regularly, ranging from torrential rains and flooding in South Africa to the earliest Category 4 hurricane ever seen, Beryl, which hammered parts of central America and the southern U.S.\n\nTropical Storm Debby makes 2nd landfall in South Carolina, heavy rain expected up the East Coast\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nHamas has a new leader. How will that affect the war in Gaza and cease-fire efforts?\n\nYahya Sinwar's appointment as the top leader of Hamas formalizes a role he assumed in the early hours of Oct. 7, when the surprise attack into Israel that he helped mastermind ushered in the bloodiest chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He's seen as a hard-liner with closer ties to Hamas' armed wing than his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in a Tehran explosion last week that was widely blamed on Israel. Sinwar was already seen as having the final word on any cease-fire agreement for Gaza and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. He's hiding deep inside Gaza. That raises questions as to how he'll manage Hamas, with cadres across the Mideast.\n\nMuhammad Yunus is heading to Bangladesh to take office as its interim leader Thursday\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus was heading home to take office later Thursday after imploring people to stay calm and be ready to rebuild the country after an uprising that ended the 16-year, increasingly autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina. Yunus is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who was jailed under Hasina's rule on corruption allegations his supporters contended were political. He was in Paris for the Olympics when he was named interim leader following talks among military officials and student activists who led the uprising against Hasina. Bangladesh's military chief said an interim government headed by Yunus would be sworn in Thursday night. It will remain in office until an election that hasn't been scheduled.\n\nAn aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A Venezuelan aid worker's arrest while catching an international flight has cast a spotlight on the climate of fear and repression engulfing the South American nation in the wake of its disputed presidential election. Edni L\u00f3pez is one of more than 2,000 people arrested since President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory in the July 28 vote despite strong evidence he lost by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The unprecedented spree of detentions is being urged on by Maduro himself and puts Venezuela on pace to easily exceed those jailed during three previous crackdowns.\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division at the Paris Olympics. She beat Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 for her third consecutive victory in the tournament while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender. Both Lin and Imane Khelif have responded to the scrutiny generated by the International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify them from last year's world championships by going on two of the best runs of their careers in Paris. Lin again used her superior height and technique to beat the more physical Kahraman. Lin will fight for gold on Saturday, taking on Julia Szeremeta of Poland.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Searchers found a body in a home destroyed by a tornado in Lucama, North Carolina, authorities said. That raises Tropical Storm Debby's death toll to 7. The storm is still drenching the Carolinas after making landfall again early Thursday on its way up the East Coast. Residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. One of the tornadoes spawned by the storm damaged at least four houses, a church and a school east of Raleigh.\n\nHarris and Walz are showing their support for organized labor with appearance at Detroit union hall\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are showing their support for organized labor by appearing at a Detroit-area union hall. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Walz are set to speak Thursday to several dozen United Auto Workers members. Harris and Walz are making joint campaign appearances this week in some of the most closely contested states that will decide the November election against Republican Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance. Michigan is one of those states and organized labor is a crucial base of support for Democrats.\n\nMajority of US adults say democracy is on the ballot but they differ on the threat: AP-NORC poll\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A poll shows that most Americans believe this year's presidential race will be crucial for the future of the country's democracy. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nOn Long Island, Republicans defend an unlikely stronghold as races could tip control of Congress\n\nIt's a 2024 election battleground where millions of dollars are being spent and some of the biggest names in American politics are sure to pop up. But it's not in the Rust Belt. And it isn't Georgia or Nevada. It's Long Island, a suburban span east of New York City, home to some 3 million people who might have an outsized and unexpected role in choosing which party controls Congress. The island, just a train ride from Manhattan, has emerged as an improbable stage for some of the most contested House races this year -- and as an unlikely center of Republican power in deep blue New York.\n\nNobel laureate Yunus arrives in Bangladesh to take over as interim leader\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus has arrived home from an overseas trip. He will take office on Thursday as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year and increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus landed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country's military chief. Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman was flanked by two navy and air force heads. Some student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. They had earlier proposed Yunus to the country's figurehead president who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.\n\nEx-Catalan leader Puigdemont, a fugitive since 2017, returns to Spain. But then he vanishes again\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Police have launched a manhunt in Barcelona for ex-Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont. The celebrated Catalan separatist returned to Spain on Thursday seven years after fleeing the country. He faces an outstanding arrest warrant. Puigdemont secretly traveled from his residence in Belgium to northeastern Spain and made a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the noses of police officers. They made no attempt to detain him. Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent after his speech. He then hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away. Catalan police arrested one of their own officers on charges of aiding Puigdemont's getaway.\n\nSuspects in foiled attack on Taylor Swift shows were inspired by Islamic State group, officials say\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Austrian authorities say both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. They said Thursday that investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\" Three sold-out concerts were canceled a day earlier because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe, many of whom had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging to attend the Eras Tour shows.\n\nThe Perseids are here. Here's how to see the 'fireballs' of summer's brightest meteor shower\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Perseid meteor shower reaches its peak early Monday. Astronomers say it's one of the brightest and most easily visible showers of the year. This year's peak activity coincides with a moon that is 44% full. More than 50 meteors should be visible per hour in rural areas away from city lights. Experts say the meteors will look like \"fireballs\" in the night sky. The Northern Hemisphere will have the best view. The Perseids last through Sept. 1. Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you don't need special equipment to see them.\n\nFor Haiti, the Paris Olympics is about more than just winning gold\n\nPARIS (AP) -- For the seven athletes competing for Haiti, participating in the Paris Games has always been about more than just winning gold. For athletes like swimmer Alexandre Grand'Pierre, it's about sending a message of hope to a nation reeling from gang violence and political turmoil. The symbol of pride for many in Haiti, the athletes hope to change the narrative around the Caribbean country, long portrayed as a victim. It's also in part about reclaiming their history from France, the former colonizer that bankrupted Haiti for more than a century. But the path to France hasn't been easy.\n\nWhite Sox fire manager Pedro Grifol after end of 21-game losing streak that tied AL record\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox have fired manager Pedro Grifol, two days after the team ended a 21-game losing streak that tied the American League record. The White Sox began Thursday 28-89. They ended the losing streak with a 5-1 victory at Oakland on Tuesday night, then wasted a two-run lead in a 3-2 loss on Wednesday. White Sox general manager Chris Getz said the team's \"performance this season has been disappointing on many levels,\" but the club appreciates Grifol's \"effort and professionalism.\"\n\nMore from

(AP) -- Searchers found a body in a home destroyed by a tornado in Lucama, North Carolina, authorities said. That raises Tropical Storm Debby's death toll to 7. The storm is still drenching the Carolinas after making landfall again early Thursday on its way up the East Coast. Residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. One of the tornadoes spawned by the storm damaged at least four houses, a church and a school east of Raleigh.\n\nHarris and Walz are showing their support for organized labor with appearance at Detroit union hall\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are showing their support for organized labor by appearing at a Detroit-area union hall. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Walz are set to speak Thursday to several dozen United Auto Workers members. Harris and Walz are making joint campaign appearances this week in some of the most closely contested states that will decide the November election against Republican Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance. Michigan is one of those states and organized labor is a crucial base of support for Democrats.\n\nMajority of US adults say democracy is on the ballot but they differ on the threat: AP-NORC poll\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A poll shows that most Americans believe this year's presidential race will be crucial for the future of the country's democracy. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war latest: The Israeli military orders another mass evacuation in southern Gaza\n\nThe Israeli military has ordered another mass evacuation in large areas around Khan Younis in southern Gaza, saying its forces will soon operate there in response to Palestinian rocket fire. The city suffered widespread destruction during air and ground operations earlier this year. Gaza faces a severe humanitarian crisis with Israeli restrictions on aid and ongoing fighting limiting access to crucial medical, food and other supplies. The Health Ministry says the death toll in the territory is nearing 40,000. Regional tensions have soared since Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed last week in Iran by a presumed Israeli strike. France's president called his Iranian counterpart, urging him to avoid a new military escalation.\n\nNobel laureate Yunus arrives in Bangladesh to take over as interim leader\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus has arrived home from an overseas trip. He will take office on Thursday as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year and increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus landed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country's military chief. Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman was flanked by two navy and air force heads. Some student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. They had earlier proposed Yunus to the country's figurehead president who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.\n\nEx-Catalan leader Puigdemont, a fugitive since 2017, returns to Spain. But then he vanishes again\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Police have launched a manhunt in Barcelona for ex-Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont. The celebrated Catalan separatist returned to Spain on Thursday seven years after fleeing the country. He faces an outstanding arrest warrant. Puigdemont secretly traveled from his residence in Belgium to northeastern Spain and made a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the noses of police officers. They made no attempt to detain him. Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent after his speech. He then hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away. Catalan police arrested one of their own officers on charges of aiding Puigdemont's getaway.\n\nLondon moving ahead with Taylor Swift concerts despite cancellation in Austria\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer is defending music organizers' decision to cancel three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna this week. He told a news conference Thursday that the cancellations were justified because the arrests of two suspects occurred too close to the shows, which were scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe Perseids are here. Here's how to see the 'fireballs' of summer's brightest meteor shower\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Perseid meteor shower reaches its peak early Monday. Astronomers say it's one of the brightest and most easily visible showers of the year. This year's peak activity coincides with a moon that is 44% full. More than 50 meteors should be visible per hour in rural areas away from city lights. Experts say the meteors will look like \"fireballs\" in the night sky. The Northern Hemisphere will have the best view. The Perseids last through Sept. 1. Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you don't need special equipment to see them.\n\nFor Haiti, the Paris Olympics is about more than just winning gold\n\nPARIS (AP) -- For the seven athletes competing for Haiti, participating in the Paris Games has always been about more than just winning gold. For athletes like swimmer Alexandre Grand'Pierre, it's about sending a message of hope to a nation reeling from gang violence and political turmoil. The symbol of pride for many in Haiti, the athletes hope to change the narrative around the Caribbean country, long portrayed as a victim. It's also in part about reclaiming their history from France, the former colonizer that bankrupted Haiti for more than a century. But the path to France hasn't been easy.\n\nWhite Sox fire manager Pedro Grifol after end of 21-game losing streak that tied AL record\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox have fired manager Pedro Grifol, two days after the team ended a 21-game losing streak that tied the American League record. The White Sox began Thursday 28-89. They ended the losing streak with a 5-1 victory at Oakland on Tuesday night, then wasted a two-run lead in a 3-2 loss on Wednesday. White Sox general manager Chris Getz said the team's \"performance this season has been disappointing on many levels,\" but the club appreciates Grifol's \"effort and professionalism.\"", "source":

(AP) -- Searchers found a body in a home destroyed by a tornado in Lucama, North Carolina, authorities said. That raises Tropical Storm Debby's death toll to 7. The storm is still drenching the Carolinas after making landfall again early Thursday on its way up the East Coast. Residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. One of the tornadoes spawned by the storm damaged at least four houses, a church and a school east of Raleigh.\n\nHarris and Walz are showing their support for organized labor with appearance at Detroit union hall\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are showing their support for organized labor by appearing at a Detroit-area union hall. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Walz are set to speak Thursday to several dozen United Auto Workers members. Harris and Walz are making joint campaign appearances this week in some of the most closely contested states that will decide the November election against Republican Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance. Michigan is one of those states and organized labor is a crucial base of support for Democrats.\n\nMajority of US adults say democracy is on the ballot but they differ on the threat: AP-NORC poll\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A poll shows that most Americans believe this year's presidential race will be crucial for the future of the country's democracy. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war latest: The Israeli military orders another mass evacuation in southern Gaza\n\nThe Israeli military has ordered another mass evacuation in large areas around Khan Younis in southern Gaza, saying its forces will soon operate there in response to Palestinian rocket fire. The city suffered widespread destruction during air and ground operations earlier this year. Gaza faces a severe humanitarian crisis with Israeli restrictions on aid and ongoing fighting limiting access to crucial medical, food and other supplies. The Health Ministry says the death toll in the territory is nearing 40,000. Regional tensions have soared since Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed last week in Iran by a presumed Israeli strike. France's president called his Iranian counterpart, urging him to avoid a new military escalation.\n\nNobel laureate Yunus arrives in Bangladesh to take over as interim leader\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus has arrived home from an overseas trip. He will take office on Thursday as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year and increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus landed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country's military chief. Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman was flanked by two navy and air force heads. Some student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. They had earlier proposed Yunus to the country's figurehead president who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.\n\nEx-Catalan leader Puigdemont, a fugitive since 2017, returns to Spain. But then he vanishes again\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Police have launched a manhunt in Barcelona for ex-Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont. The celebrated Catalan separatist returned to Spain on Thursday seven years after fleeing the country. He faces an outstanding arrest warrant. Puigdemont secretly traveled from his residence in Belgium to northeastern Spain and made a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the noses of police officers. They made no attempt to detain him. Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent after his speech. He then hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away. Catalan police arrested one of their own officers on charges of aiding Puigdemont's getaway.\n\nSuspects in foiled attack on Taylor Swift shows were inspired by Islamic State group, officials say\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Austrian authorities say both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. They said Thursday that investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\" Three sold-out concerts were canceled a day earlier because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe, many of whom had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging to attend the Eras Tour shows.\n\nThe Perseids are here. Here's how to see the 'fireballs' of summer's brightest meteor shower\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Perseid meteor shower reaches its peak early Monday. Astronomers say it's one of the brightest and most easily visible showers of the year. This year's peak activity coincides with a moon that is 44% full. More than 50 meteors should be visible per hour in rural areas away from city lights. Experts say the meteors will look like \"fireballs\" in the night sky. The Northern Hemisphere will have the best view. The Perseids last through Sept. 1. Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you don't need special equipment to see them.\n\nFor Haiti, the Paris Olympics is about more than just winning gold\n\nPARIS (AP) -- For the seven athletes competing for Haiti, participating in the Paris Games has always been about more than just winning gold. For athletes like swimmer Alexandre Grand'Pierre, it's about sending a message of hope to a nation reeling from gang violence and political turmoil. The symbol of pride for many in Haiti, the athletes hope to change the narrative around the Caribbean country, long portrayed as a victim. It's also in part about reclaiming their history from France, the former colonizer that bankrupted Haiti for more than a century. But the path to France hasn't been easy.\n\nWhite Sox fire manager Pedro Grifol after end of 21-game losing streak that tied AL record\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox have fired manager Pedro Grifol, two days after the team ended a 21-game losing streak that tied the American League record. The White Sox began Thursday 28-89. They ended the losing streak with a 5-1 victory at Oakland on Tuesday night, then wasted a two-run lead in a 3-2 loss on Wednesday. White Sox general manager Chris Getz said the team's \"performance this season has been disappointing on many levels,\" but the club appreciates Grifol's \"effort and professionalism.\"", "source":

It's Long Island, a suburban span east of New York City, home to some 3 million people who might have an outsized and unexpected role in choosing which party controls Congress.

One more victory puts them in Sunday's gold medal game. First up is a birthday party for Stewart's daughter Ruby, who turns 3 on Friday.

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nThe Walz record: Abortion rights, free lunches for schoolkids, and disputes over a riot response\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Tim Walz and his fellow Democrats have enacted big changes in the two years that they've had full control of the Minnesota Legislature, from expansions of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights to initiatives aimed at making life easier for families. His record is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate. But it draws condemnation from Republicans, who say he squandered a huge budget surplus that should have been used for tax cuts, failed to prevent massive fraud, and acted too slowly to quell the violence that followed the murder of George Floyd.\n\nTrump praised Minnesota Gov. Walz in 2020 for response to unrest over Floyd's murder, audio shows\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance have been hammering Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over his response to the violence that erupted in the aftermath of the 2020 murder of George Floyd. But Trump described the governor as calm and said, at the time, he fully agreed with how Walz handled it, including his deployment of the Minnesota National Guard. Trump made the statement in a call with Walz and other governors and officials on June 1, 2020. Trump has been falsely claiming lately that he sent in the National Guard. But it was Walz who gave the order.\n\nOrganizers cancel Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna over fears of an attack\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Organizers of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna this week called them off on Wednesday after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the Vienna area such as the concerts as part of her Eras Tour. Swift was scheduled to play at the Austrian capital's Ernst Happel Stadium on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Event organizer Barracuda Music said in a post on its Instagram channel late Wednesday that \"we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.\"\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end in July. That's according to the European climate agency Copernicus. The agency said July 2024's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago. Both the agency and outside experts warned that the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change. It's driving extreme weather events that can be seen regularly, ranging from torrential rains and flooding in South Africa to the earliest Category 4 hurricane ever seen, Beryl, which hammered parts of central America and the southern U.S.\n\nTropical Storm Debby to move over soggy South Carolina coast, drop more rain before heading north\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is expected to return to land over an already soggy South Carolina coast before picking up speed and moving north. The National Hurricane Center says the center of the storm will move across the South Carolina coast early Thursday, bringing another more rain and flooding to parts of the Carolinas. Heavy rainfall is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Saturday morning. Meanwhile, residents as far away as the Great Lakes and New Jersey have also experienced heavy rains connected to the slow-moving tropical storm.\n\nHamas has a new leader. How will that affect the war in Gaza and cease-fire efforts?\n\nYahya Sinwar's appointment as the top leader of Hamas formalizes a role he assumed in the early hours of Oct. 7, when the surprise attack into Israel that he helped mastermind ushered in the bloodiest chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He's seen as a hard-liner with closer ties to Hamas' armed wing than his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in a Tehran explosion last week that was widely blamed on Israel. Sinwar was already seen as having the final word on any cease-fire agreement for Gaza and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. He's hiding deep inside Gaza. That raises questions as to how he'll manage Hamas, with cadres across the Mideast.\n\nMuhammad Yunus is heading to Bangladesh to take office as its interim leader Thursday\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus was heading home to take office later Thursday after imploring people to stay calm and be ready to rebuild the country after an uprising that ended the 16-year, increasingly autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina. Yunus is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who was jailed under Hasina's rule on corruption allegations his supporters contended were political. He was in Paris for the Olympics when he was named interim leader following talks among military officials and student activists who led the uprising against Hasina. Bangladesh's military chief said an interim government headed by Yunus would be sworn in Thursday night. It will remain in office until an election that hasn't been scheduled.\n\nAn aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A Venezuelan aid worker's arrest while catching an international flight has cast a spotlight on the climate of fear and repression engulfing the South American nation in the wake of its disputed presidential election. Edni L\u00f3pez is one of more than 2,000 people arrested since President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory in the July 28 vote despite strong evidence he lost by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The unprecedented spree of detentions is being urged on by Maduro himself and puts Venezuela on pace to easily exceed those jailed during three previous crackdowns.\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division at the Paris Olympics. She beat Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 for her third consecutive victory in the tournament while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender. Both Lin and Imane Khelif have responded to the scrutiny generated by the International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify them from last year's world championships by going on two of the best runs of their careers in Paris. Lin again used her superior height and technique to beat the more physical Kahraman. Lin will fight for gold on Saturday, taking on Julia Szeremeta of Poland.\n\nMore from this section\n\nAttorney Jenna Sutter Joins All Injuries Law Firm\n\nSecured Signing Notary Community platform

More than half of Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans.\n\nDemocrat Pamela Hanson, 67, of Amery, Wisconsin, said she has grave concerns for the future of democracy in the country if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gets elected.\n\n\"His statements tend towards him being a king or a dictator, a person in charge by himself,\" Hanson said. \"I mean, the man is unhinged in my opinion.\"\n\nBut Republican Ernie Wagner from Liberty, New York, said it's President Joe Biden's administration -- of which Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is a part -- that has abused the power of the executive branch.\n\nThe Walz record: Abortion rights, free lunches for schoolkids, and disputes over a riot response\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Tim Walz and his fellow Democrats have enacted big changes in the two years that they've had full control of the Minnesota Legislature, from expansions of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights to tax credits and other initiatives aimed at making life easier for families.\n\nHis record has delighted liberals and progressives and is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate. He doesn't try to claim all the credit -- strong Democratic legislative leaders also played major roles. But his record continues to draw condemnation from Republicans, who say he squandered a huge budget surplus that should have been used for tax cuts, failed to prevent hundreds of millions of dollars in fraud, and acted too slowly to quell the violence that followed the murder of George Floyd.\n\nHere's some of what Walz has done as governor and how it might connect to the campaign now that he's on the Democratic Party ticket:\n\nWalz signed legislation codifying abortion rights, repealing essentially all the state's restrictions and adding protections for patients who travel from states where abortion is restricted. The governor joined Harris during her visit in March to a St. Paul Planned Parenthood clinic, where she paid tribute to Minnesota's leadership in what her office said was the first time a president or vice president had toured a facility that performs abortions. Among the restrictions eliminated were a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent requirements.\n\nWalz and his fellow Democrats also enacted new protections for the rights of LGBTQ+ people from Minnesota and other states to receive gender-affirming health care, specifically including families coming from elsewhere for treatment for trans children. The state also banned so-called conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children and vulnerable adults.\n\nCarles Puigdemont, ex-Catalan leader, returns to Spain after nearly 7 years as a fugitive\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Former Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont, who fled Spain after organizing an independence referendum in the wealthy Spanish region nearly seven years ago that was declared illegal, returned to the country on Thursday despite a pending arrest warrant.\n\nPuigdemont defiantly appeared in Barcelona after traveling from Belgium and made a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters. He faces charges of embezzlement for his part in the attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017.\n\nPuigdemont appeared in a central Barcelona park where several thousand separatist supporters who had gathered in expectation of his arrival waved Catalan flags. He punched the air to cheers on a bright, sunny day.\n\nAddressing the crowd, Puigdemont accused Spanish authorities of \"a crackdown\" on the Catalan separatist movement.\n\n\"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" Puigdemont said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\n\nTragedy prevented by foiling apparent plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Austria, official says\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Following the cancellation of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna over an apparent attack plot, Austria's Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said Thursday in Vienna that \"the situation was serious, the situation is serious. But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented.\"\n\nThe cancellations of three sold-out concerts this week devastated Swifties across the globe, many of whom had dropped thousands of euros on travel and lodging in Austria's expensive capital city for the sold-out Eras Tour shows on Thursday, Friday and Saturday at the Ernst Happel Stadium, which sat empty Thursday morning aside from media filming outside.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Three Taylor Swift concerts this week in Vienna have been canceled following arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack in the area, potentially at the stadium itself, and at least one of the suspects has been linked to the Islamic State group.\n\nChemical substances and technical devices were found at the house of that suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian, according to Franz Ruf, the public security director at Austria's Interior Ministry.\n\nIsrael court hears bid to close prison where soldiers are accused of sexually assaulting Palestinian\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli Supreme Court considered a petition Wednesday to shutter a desert military prison where soldiers have been accused of abusing Palestinians, as a new video emerged purporting to show the sexual assault of a Palestinian detainee.\n\nRights groups have been engaged in a legal battle since June to shut down the detention facility, known as Sde Teiman, where Israel has held many Palestinians detained in Gaza during the 10-month war with Hamas. The groups claim that conditions at the facility are grave and that abuse by Israeli soldiers is common, basing their claims on testimony from released detainees and Israeli whistleblowers.\n\nCalls for the prison's closure ramped up in late July, when Israeli military police arrested 10 soldiers from Sde Teiman on suspicion of their involvement in the alleged sexual assault of a Palestinian detainee at the facility. Five of the soldiers are no longer under investigation. A physician who identified himself as the person who reported the attack said last week that the detainee appeared to have been seriously sexually abused.\n\nThe soldiers' detention triggered angry protests by supporters, and at least two government ministers demanded their release. The response underscored tensions between the military command and hard-line nationalists in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government who advocate even harsher treatment of Palestinians detained from Gaza.\n\nDefense lawyer Nati Rom told The Associated Press that the soldiers were arrested about a month after the alleged attack and are accused of performing acts of sodomy on the detainee. He said the soldiers used force to defend themselves against a detainee who attacked them during a search, but did not sexually abuse him.\n\nJuly ends 13-month streak of global heat records as El Nino ebbs, but experts warn against relief\n\nEarth's string of 13 straight months with a new average heat record came to an end this past July as the natural El Nino climate pattern ebbed, the European climate agency Copernicus announced Wednesday.\n\nBut July 2024 's average heat just missed surpassing the July of a year ago, and scientists said the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change.\n\n\"The overall context hasn't changed,\" Copernicus deputy director Samantha Burgess said in a statement. \"Our climate continues to warm.\"\n\nHuman-caused climate change drives extreme weather events that are wreaking havoc around the globe, with several examples just in recent weeks. In Cape Town, South Africa, thousands were displaced by torrential rain, gale-force winds, flooding and more. A fatal landslide hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island. Beryl left a massive path of destruction as it set the record for the earliest Category 4 hurricane. And Japanese authorities said more than 120 people died in record heat in Tokyo.\n\nThose hot temperatures have been especially merciless.\n\nTropical Storm Debby makes 2nd landfall in South Carolina, heavy rain expected up the East Coast\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend.\n\nDebby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It is now a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain forecast, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nDays of rain have forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday. The National Weather Service's office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nNobel laureate Yunus arrives in Bangladesh to take over as interim leader\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's next leader Muhammad Yunus arrived home Thursday from an overseas trip and will take office later in the day, as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year, increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nYunus landed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the country's military chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman, who was flanked by navy and air force heads.\n\nSome of the student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. They had earlier proposed Yunus as interim leader to the country's figurehead president, who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.\n\nIn his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order.\n\n\"Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,\" Yunus said, flanked by the student leaders. \"It has immense possibility.\"\n\nAn aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The last time anyone heard from Edni L\u00f3pez was Sunday. The 33-year-old political science professor and award-winning poet was preparing to board a flight to Argentina to visit a friend when she texted from the airport that something was wrong with her passport.\n\n\"Migration took my passport because it's showing up as expired,\" she wrote her boyfriend in the message shared with The Associated Press. \"I pray to God I don't get screwed because of a system error.\"\n\nWhat happened next remains a mystery -- one contributing to the climate of fear and repression that has engulfed Venezuela following its disputed presidential election, the most serious wave of human rights abuses since Latin America's military dictatorships in the 1970s.\n\nWhen L\u00f3pez's mother, Ninoska Barrios, and her friends learned she didn't board the flight, they started frantically combing detention centers. Finally, on Tuesday -- more than 48 hours later -- they learned she was being held, incommunicado, by Venezuela's feared military intelligence police on unknown criminal charges, unable to see an attorney or speak with her family.\n\n\"Please, give back my daughter,\" a sobbing Barrios pleaded Tuesday outside Venezuela's top human rights office in a video that went viral on social media. \"It's not right that a Venezuelan mother has to go through all this.\"\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin

her gender at the Paris Olympics.\n\nOne day after welterweight Imane Khelif of Algeria reached the women's welterweight final with a third straight victory in Paris, Lin defeated Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 on Wednesday night for her third win.\n\nLin will fight for gold on Saturday, taking on Julia Szeremeta of Poland.\n\n\"I will use everything I've learned in my life to do my best in the next match,\" Lin said through an interpreter.\n\nLin and Khelif both have won every round in all three of their Olympic bouts despite the massive distractions created by the fallout from the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association's decision last year to disqualify both fighters from the world championships for allegedly failing an eligibility test.", "source": {"uri":

Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

His record is a major reason why Vice President Kamala Harris chose him to be her running mate. But it draws condemnation from Republicans, who say he squandered a huge budget surplus that should have been used for tax cuts, failed to prevent massive fraud, and acted too slowly to quell the violence that followed the murder of George Floyd.\n\nTrump praised Minnesota Gov.

But Trump described the governor as calm and said, at the time, he fully agreed with how Walz handled it, including his deployment of the Minnesota National Guard. Trump made the statement in a call with Walz and other governors and officials on June 1, 2020. Trump has been falsely claiming lately that he sent in the National Guard. But it was Walz who gave the order.\n\nOrganizers cancel Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna over fears of an attack\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Organizers of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna this week called them off on Wednesday after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the Vienna area such as the concerts as part of her Eras Tour.

Both the agency and outside experts warned that the end of the record-breaking streak changes nothing about the threat posed by climate change. It's driving extreme weather events that can be seen regularly, ranging from torrential rains and flooding in South Africa to the earliest Category 4 hurricane ever seen, Beryl, which hammered parts of central America and the southern U.S.\n\nTropical Storm Debby to move over soggy South Carolina coast, drop more rain before heading north\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is expected to return to land over an already soggy South Carolina coast before picking up speed and moving north. The National Hurricane Center says the center of the storm will move across the South Carolina coast early Thursday, bringing another more rain and flooding to parts of the Carolinas. Heavy rainfall is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Saturday morning. Meanwhile, residents as far away as the Great Lakes and New Jersey have also experienced heavy rains connected to the slow-moving tropical storm.\n\nHamas has a new leader. How will that affect the war in Gaza and cease-fire efforts?\n\nYahya Sinwar's appointment as the top leader of Hamas formalizes a role he assumed in the early hours of Oct. 7, when the surprise attack into Israel that he helped mastermind ushered in the bloodiest chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He's seen as a hard-liner with closer ties to Hamas' armed wing than his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in a Tehran explosion last week that was widely blamed on Israel. Sinwar was already seen as having the final word on any cease-fire agreement for Gaza and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. He's hiding deep inside Gaza. That raises questions as to how he'll manage Hamas, with cadres across the Mideast.\n\nAn aid worker's airport disappearance stirs fear of repression following disputed Venezuela election\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A Venezuelan aid worker's arrest while catching an international flight has cast a spotlight on the climate of fear and repression engulfing the South American nation in the wake of its disputed presidential election. Edni L\u00f3pez is one of more than 2,000 people arrested since President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory in the July 28 vote despite strong evidence he lost by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The unprecedented spree of detentions is being urged on by Maduro himself and puts Venezuela on pace to easily exceed those jailed during three previous crackdowns.\n\nNASA says chances are growing that astronauts may switch from Boeing to a SpaceX ride back to Earth\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA says chances are growing that two test pilots who flew a new Boeing capsule to the International Space Station in June may have to switch to SpaceX for a ride home. Officials said Wednesday it's still possible astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams can return aboard Boeing's Starliner next month. But if the spacecraft's leaks and thruster problems are not better understood, the two could find themselves up there until February, returning on a SpaceX capsule. Inside NASA, there's dissent over which way to go. NASA is bringing in extra experts to figure out the best path forward.\n\nLin Yu-ting advances to gold-medal Olympic bout, excelling amid misconceptions about her gender\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division at the Paris Olympics. She beat Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey 5:0 for her third consecutive victory in the tournament while dealing with widespread scrutiny regarding misconceptions about her gender. Both Lin and Imane Khelif have responded to the scrutiny generated by the International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify them from last year's world championships by going on two of the best runs of their careers in Paris. Lin again used her superior height and technique to beat the more physical Kahraman. Lin will fight for gold on Saturday, taking on Julia Szeremeta of Poland.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nIn other news:\n\nNASA says chances are growing that astronauts may switch from Boeing to a SpaceX ride back to Earth.RFK Jr. closer to getting on New Jersey ballot; in court over NY ballot.US auto safety agency seeks information from Tesla on fatal Cybertruck crash and fire in Texas.Tropical Storm Debby churns up the East Coast, and affects weather as far away as the Great Lakes.Drones warned New York City residents about storm flooding.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend.

The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs survey finds that they see the threat differently based on their political leanings. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans. Many Democrats continue to view former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the results also suggest that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that President Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy.\n\nIn other news:\n\nNASA says chances are growing that astronauts may switch from Boeing to a SpaceX ride back to Earth.RFK Jr. closer to getting on New Jersey ballot; in court over NY ballot.US auto safety agency seeks information from Tesla on fatal Cybertruck crash and fire in Texas.Tropical Storm Debby churns up the East Coast, and affects weather as far away as the Great Lakes.Drones warned New York City residents about storm flooding.

{"id": 243314952, "title": "Scottish training academy \u2018upskilling\u2019 300 engineers on game-changing green tech", "text": "A Midlothian training academy is expecting to upskill as many as 300 engineers in heat pump installation work as part of a key partnership with a fast-growing renewables business. Cohorts of gas engineers from Octopus Energy Group are travelling to the Energy Training Academy (ETA) in Dalkeith from south of the Border every month for the ten-day course as they learn how to install heat pumps - seen as a key aspect of the drive to reduce carbon emissions. In a major boost for the academy, it was identified by Octopus as one of the only facilities in the UK which could deliver the necessary volume with the required quality. The move will see the centre play a pivotal role in helping deliver on the UK government\u2019s target of installing 600,000 heat pumps per year by 2028. ETA director and co-founder Andrew Lamond said: \u201cThere\u2019s nobody more progressive in what they are trying to do than Octopus. It elevates the Energy Training Academy and is a prime example of exactly why we set it up. It\u2019s credit to the team for showing they\u2019re capable of delivering it and a strong endorsement of what the training academy is all about.\u201d All those who successfully complete the training programme will be accredited and qualified to install heat pumps. Ian Edgeworth, technical director at ETA, said: \u201cOur partnership with Octopus Energy is all about innovation and collaboration. Working closely with their training management team, we've crafted a unique curriculum and unparalleled training experience that sets new standards for delivery excellence. \u201cOur mission has always been to mentor and empower engineers for success in the renewable heating sector. This includes a collaborative effort to provide in-house product training on the specific equipment these engineers will encounter in their day-to-day operations and this can only enhance their ability to be \u2018job ready\u2019 for the journey and challenges ahead.\u201d Mark Glasgow, ETA co-founder, added: \u201cThis deal with Octopus has really put the academy project on its feet and will help us put more back into the schools and community, which was one of the main reasons we set it up.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cThis deal with Octopus has really put the academy project on its feet\u201d \u2013 Mark Glasgow, ETA co-founder", "url": "https://www.scotsman.com/business/scottish-training-academy-upskilling-300-engineers-on-game-changing-green-tech-4683268", "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjU5ZDcwY2E1LTUxOTEtNGUyZC1iMTBiLWQ0MGE2NzQxZGI0MDpjYzdlYWI0NS1kNzA2LTQ4NmEtODI0MS01ZDZhOTZmM2QyMTg=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:56:00", "author": "Scott Reid", "authors": ["Scott Reid"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.227}

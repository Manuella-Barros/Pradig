The defender had been closing in on a loan move to the club from Leicester City during the Michael Beale era but the deal failed to materialise - leaving the Australia international to fight for a place in the Foxes' starting line-up under Maresca last term. However, he would manage just four appearances last term as the centre-back watched from the sidelines as his side secured a return to the English Premier League by winning the Championship. It was expected that the Socceroo would leave the King Power Stadium after a nightmare campaign - with Australia boss Graham Arnold declaring he had to ramp up his game to keep his place in the national side. And Souttar set the rumour mill alight when he was snapped on holiday wearing a retro Rangers top on his holiday alongside Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Conor Coady, Harry Winks and Marc Albrighton. But Souttar insists things may not be as straightforward as some thing. Maresca has taken the reins at Chelsea - leaving a new boss to make a big call on Souttar's future. Speaking to ESPN, Souttar said: \"It'd be very clear if [Enzo Maresca] was still there, my situation; to try and leave the club and get more minutes because I've lost out on a lot of football. To still be selected for the national team I know I need to be playing football. \"I just have to wait to see what the club does and who comes in and then to try to impress the new manager that comes in. When I get back for pre-season, we'll probably have a sit down after a few weeks and have a chat and see where we're at. \"I think that's the best thing to do. Obviously, we don't have a manager yet. So I don't know and I can't comment or speculate on who it's going to be. But I've just got to give myself the best shot of trying to impress him and the staff that will come in as well. We'll just go from there.\"", "summary": "The centre-back sent the rumour mill into over drive with a social media clue earlier this summer.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-transfer-news/harry-souttar-transfer-address-rangers-32992716", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32992746.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Australia-Socceroos-Training-Session.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:29:33", "author": "Mark Pirie", "authors": ["Mark Pirie"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.317}

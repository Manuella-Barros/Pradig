{"id": 243591386, "title": "The shocking case of Natasha O\u2019Brien shows that Ireland is still a cold country for women", "text": "Ireland loves its strong women, as long as they\u2019re dead or they never lived at all. It\u2019s the walking, talking, breathing ones who are bothersome. There is hardly an Irish person who hasn\u2019t heard of the sexually insatiable Queen Medb, famed for stealing her neighbour\u2019s prized bull, or of Grace O\u2019Malley, a real-life sea pirate, or of the darling of them all, Caitl\u00edn N\u00ed hUallach\u00e1in, the mythical personification of Ireland. Until a week ago, most people had never heard of Natasha O\u2019Brien. The country had been going about its business contentedly thinking itself modern and progressive, unaware that a 22-year-old soldier had previously pleaded guilty in the circuit court to violently assaulting her. The 24-year-old had been walking home from her job in a Limerick pub when she happened upon Cathal Crotty yelling \u201cfaggot\u201d at passersby on the city\u2019s main street. When she asked him to stop, he punched her to the ground and punched her twice more until she blacked out. Then he ran away and gloated on Snapchat: \u201cTwo to put her down, two to put her out.\u201d What happened next has thrust O\u2019Brien into the annals of Unforgettable Irish Women. At Crotty\u2019s sentencing hearing last week, judge Tom O\u2019Donnell described the crime as \u201cutterly appalling\u201d and then fully suspended his three-year jail sentence on the grounds that the convicted man had pleaded guilty and that a custodial sentence could harm his career in the army. The matter would have ended there, except that Crotty had picked on the wrong woman. O\u2019Brien left the courtroom and, with exceptional eloquence, declared that the system had abandoned her. Last weekend, thousands of men and women marched in protest in Ireland\u2019s main cities to demand justice for victims of gender-based violence. The Irish Times reported on Monday that a naval officer, David O\u2019Gorman, has remained in the service almost a year after he pleaded guilty to such a violent assault on a woman he left one of her eyes permanently displaced. Organisers of Dublin\u2019s Pride parade withdrew the defence forces\u2019 invitation to participate and, when O\u2019Donnell retired on his 70th birthday on Wednesday, the traditional ritual of lawyers paying tribute to the departing judge had to be cancelled for fear of protests. When O\u2019Brien was invited to visit D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (the Irish parliament), she received a minute-long standing ovation from TDs (members of parliament). The next day, the defence forces sent a dossier to Miche\u00e1l Martin, the tan\u00e1iste (deputy prime minister), chronicling 68 further cases of service members who have either been convicted of crimes or are currently before the courts. For most of its existence, the Irish state has been a cold country for its women. The chief founding father, \u00c9amon de Valera, set the mood with his supposed vision of an Ireland with \u201cmaidens dancing at the crossroads\u201d. Over the ensuing decades, when Roman Catholic bishops ruled with a slap of the mitre, women and girls were consigned to live in draconian mother and baby homes or work in Magdalene laundries for the offence of pregnancy outside marriage \u2013 including by rape \u2013 while their babies were sold for adoption abroad or used without consent in vaccine trials for pharmaceutical companies. Ireland reverberated with echoes of the Salem witch trials. In the 1980s, a young woman called Joanne Hayes was hauled before an all-male state tribunal where garda\u00ed (police) tried to justify targeting her as the suspect in an infanticide investigation on the basis that she must have given birth to twins conceived by two different fathers and delivered in two different locations 50 miles apart. In a midlands village, a 15-year-old schoolgirl named Ann Lovett and her secret newborn baby were found dead at a Virgin Mary grotto. In the south-east, the schoolteacher Eileen Flynn was sacked for living with a married man, a decision upheld by the high court. Formidable women who had fought for Ireland\u2019s independence in the early 20th century were written out of the history books. The level of female representation in parliament was one of the lowest in the world, a likely factor underpinning the referendum in 1983 that led to a constitutional ban on abortion. Its implementation was so severe that British magazines sold in Ireland had blank pages where advertisements for abortion clinics appeared in the main editions, and yet more than 4,000 women furtively left the island each year to have their pregnancies terminated abroad. Seedlings of change had started to appear in the 1970s with the indomitable Irish Women\u2019s Liberation Movement, who took a train to Belfast one day and returned flaunting buntings of condoms to the republic, where contraceptives were outlawed. Along came Mary Robinson, elected a Labour party senator whose day job was a lawyer contesting human rights issues on access to the pill and gender-fair taxation in the courts. When she became the first female president of Ireland in 1990, many women thought we\u2019d died and gone to heaven. The momentum for change gathered force as women started telling their individual stories. When Annie Murphy, an American woman, revealed that she had had a love affair with the bishop of Galway and conceived a child he wanted her to have adopted, the church\u2019s grip on Irish society began to loosen. It was accelerated by subsequent narratives about priests sexually abusing children and how they were sheltered by bishops. It took almost a century but by the time Ireland became the first country in the world to recognise same-sex marriage by referendum in 2015 and, three years later, repealed the abortion ban in another referendum, there was a sense that the country had finally become tolerant and inclusive. Natasha O\u2019Brien\u2019s experience has shown how misguided we were. The judiciary and the defence forces, both state bastions charged with protecting the people, have sent a message that a woman\u2019s safety is secondary to a man\u2019s job. There had been omens of a threatened regression to the old T\u00edr na Fir (Land of the Men), with anti-immigrant protesters claiming to be safeguarding their womenfolk against \u201cunvetted single males\u201d. Last March, Ireland held another referendum. This one was designed to repeal an antediluvian article in the 1937 constitution that enshrines women\u2019s work in the home. It failed spectacularly. While the government botched the wording put to the people, there was an unmissable sexist undercurrent in the campaign that maintained mothers should stay at home and mind their children. When the result was announced, some male anti-referendum campaigners hailed it as a \u201cvictory for mothers\u201d. That referendum and what happened to O\u2019Brien are stark reminders that, for women, Ireland has more prejudices to confront before it can legitimately see itself as the fair-minded and inclusive country it imagines itself to be.

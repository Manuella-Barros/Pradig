The IDF will act forcefully and immediately against them,\" Adraee said in the message sent by text and social media to Palestinian residents.\n\n\"For your own safety, evacuate immediately to the known shelters in the center of Gaza City,\" the army spokesman said.\n\nIn a nearby Gaza City neighborhood, Al-Tuffah, an Israeli airstrike on a house killed three Palestinians, medics said.\n\nLater on Wednesday, 10 Palestinians were killed in two separate Israeli strikes in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Medics said one strike killed three people on a motorcycle west of Khan Younis, while seven others were killed in tank shelling that hit a tent encampment in Abassan town, east of the city.\n\nMultiple fronts\n\nFighting has continued in the Gaza Strip even as Israel braces for an expected assault in its north from Iran and its close Lebanese ally Hezbollah after the July 31 assassination in the Iranian capital Tehran of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has killed dozens of Gaza militants in recent days and on Wednesday said troops had hit weapons-making facilities in the teeming district of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the fighting have taken shelter.\n\nIn other central areas, Israeli tanks shelled Nuseirat and Bureij, two of Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps. Israel says Hamas militants use civilian infrastructure for cover and to conceal operations posts and arms caches; Hamas denies this.\n\nMilitants say they continue to carry out ambush attacks on Israeli troops and armored vehicles with explosive devices, and are still able to launch limited rocket salvoes into Israel.\n\nOn Tuesday, Islamic Jihad, a close Hamas ally, said it fired rockets into Israel in response to what it called Israeli \"massacres of civilians.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said that over the past week Hamas had fired rockets from launchers embedded near two international humanitarian aid and distribution warehouses, including the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israeli forces struck those sites, it added.\n\nHamas-led militants set off the Gaza war on Oct. 7 with a cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIn response, Israel has pursued a relentless assault on Gaza that has reduced much of the heavily populated coastal strip to ruins, killed more than 39,600 Palestinians and wounded over 91,500, according to Gaza health ministry figures.\n\nThe Hamas-led ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death lists. --

Humanitarian aid routes remain disrupted after an attack injured five Israeli soldiers.\n\nIsrael called on Palestinians in Beit Hanoun to evacuate on Wednesday morning following rocket attacks on Sderot and Ashkelon, originating from the northern Gaza town. Colonel Avichay Adraee, the Israel Defence Force's Arabic-language spokesman, released a list of evacuation zones, urging residents to seek shelter in Gaza City. According to the army, fewer than 200,000 Palestinian civilians are currently in northern Gaza.\n\nAdraee tweeted, 'Hamas and terrorist organizations are firing rockets from your area towards the State of Israel. The IDF will act forcefully and immediately against them.' On Tuesday, Palestinian Islamic Jihad fired three rockets from northern Gaza at Ashkelon and Sderot, resulting in one being intercepted and the other two landing in open areas without causing casualties or damage.\n\nOn Tuesday, the IDF temporarily closed a vital road used for delivering humanitarian aid after five soldiers were injured by Hamas fire. This route runs from the Kerem Shalom border crossing northward to Gaza City. The conflict has claimed at least 1,200 lives, with 252 Israelis and foreigners taken hostage during Hamas's attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 115 remaining hostages, 39 have been declared dead. Hamas has held two Israeli civilians captive since 2014 and 2015, and also retains the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkelon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ashkelon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashkelon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sderot", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sderot"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sderot"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beit_Hanoun", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beit Hanoun"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beit Hanoun"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerem_Shalom_border_crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom border crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/07_08_2024_14_51_36_6799949.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797692", "eventUri": "eng-9797692", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1491, "textEnd": 1500}], "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

The IDF will act forcefully and immediately against them,\" Adraee said in the message sent by text and social media to Palestinian residents.\n\n\"For your own safety, evacuate immediately to the known shelters in the center of Gaza City,\" the army spokesman said.\n\nIn a nearby Gaza City neighbourhood, Al-Tuffah, an Israeli airstrike on a house killed three Palestinians, medics said.\n\nLater on Wednesday, 10 Palestinians were killed in two separate Israeli strikes in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Medics said one strike killed three people on a motorcycle west of Khan Younis, while seven others were killed in tank shelling that hit a tent encampment in Abassan town, east of the city.\n\nMULTIPLE FRONTS\n\nFighting has continued in the Gaza Strip even as Israel braces for an expected assault in its north from Iran and its close Lebanese ally Hezbollah after the July 31 assassination in the Iranian capital Tehran of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has killed dozens of Gaza militants in recent days and on Wednesday said troops had hit weapons-making facilities in the teeming district of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the fighting have taken shelter.\n\nIn other central areas, Israeli tanks shelled Nuseirat and Bureij, two of Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps. Israel says Hamas militants use civilian infrastructure for cover and to conceal operations posts and arms caches; Hamas denies this.\n\nMilitants say they continue to carry out ambush attacks on Israeli troops and armoured vehicles with explosive devices, and are still able to launch limited rocket salvoes into Israel.\n\nOn Tuesday, Islamic Jihad, a close Hamas ally, said it fired rockets into Israel in response to what it called Israeli \"massacres of civilians\".\n\nThe Israeli military said that over the past week Hamas had fired rockets from launchers embedded near two international humanitarian aid and distribution warehouses, including the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israeli forces struck those sites, it added.\n\nHamas-led militants set off the Gaza war on Oct. 7 with a cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIn response, Israel has pursued a relentless assault on Gaza that has reduced much of the heavily populated coastal strip to ruins, killed more than 39,600 Palestinians and wounded over 91,500, according to Gaza health ministry figures.\n\nThe Hamas-led ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death

This surge in violence is part of an ongoing conflict.Israeli forces stepped up airstrikes across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, killing at least 40 people, Palestinian medics said, in further battle with Hamas-led militants as Israel braced for potential wider war in the region.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes hit a cluster of houses in central Gaza's Al-Bureij camp, killing at least 15 people, and the nearby Al-Nuseirat camp, killed four, medics said. Nuseirat and Bureij are among the densely populated enclave's eight historic camps and seen by Israel as strongholds of armed militants.\n\nIsraeli aircraft also bombed a house in the heart of Gaza City in the north, killing five Palestinians, while another airstrike in the southern city of Khan Younis killed one person and wounded others, according to medics.\n\nLater on Thursday, 15 Palestinians were killed and 30 injured in Israeli bombings of two schools east of Gaza City, the territory's Civil Emergency Service said in a statement.\n\nThe Israeli military said it struck Hamas command and control centres embedded in the Abdel-Fattah Hamouda and Al-Zahra schools in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, where Hamas militants were operating.\n\nIt accused Hamas of exploiting civilians and civilian properties for military purposes, an allegation Hamas denies.\n\nFootage circulated on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed casualties being brought to a hospital on donkey carts.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they were firing anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs at Israeli forces operating across Gaza, causing deaths and injuries among them.\n\nIsrael's military said it had struck dozens of military targets across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including rocket launching pads.\n\nHamas-led militants set off the Gaza war on Oct. 7 last year with a shock, cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nSince then, at least 39,699 Palestinians have been killed, including 22 within the past 24 hours, and 91,722 injured in Israel's devastating air and ground war in Gaza, the Gaza health ministry said in an update on Thursday.\n\nThe ministry in the Hamas-run territory does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death lists.\n\nAs Gaza's war churns on, Israel has been battening down for another attack expected in the coming days following vows from Iran and its Lebanon proxy Hezbollah to retaliate for the assassinations last week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.\n\nA relatively contained conflict between Israel and Hezbollah along its northern border, a spillover from the Gaza fighting, now threatens to spiral into an all-out regional war.\n\nMORE BURIALS IN GAZA\n\nOn Thursday dozens of Palestinians rushed into Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis to bid farewell to slain relatives before carrying them away for burials.\n\nReuters footage showed relatives moving out the bodies of their loved ones in plastic bags with names written on them, and holding special prayers before the funerals.\n\nThe Israeli military renewed evacuation orders to Palestinian residents in several districts in eastern Khan Younis, saying it would act forcefully against militants who had unleashed rockets from those areas.\n\nThe army posted the evacuation order on X, and residents said they had received text and audio messages.\n\nResidents said dozens of families had begun to leave their homes and head west towards Al-Mawasi, a humanitarian-designated area but one that is overcrowded by displaced families from around the enclave.\n\nOn Thursday, the World Central Kitchen (WCK), a U.S.-based, non-governmental humanitarian agency, said that a Palestinian staff member, Nadi Sallout, had been killed while apparently off duty on Wednesday near Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza. The WCK said it was seeking further details.\n\nThe Israeli military said it did not know of any such incident, adding that it had been in contact with WCK.\n\nIn April, seven WCK employees were killed in an Israeli airstrike, spurring it to suspend operations for nearly a month.\n\nIsrael said then its inquiries had found serious errors and breaches of procedure by its military, and that two senior officers had been dismissed and senior commanders reprimanded.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Israeli airstrikes hit a cluster of houses in central Gaza's Al-Bureij camp, killing at least 15 people, and the nearby Al-Nuseirat camp, killed four, medics said. Nuseirat and Bureij are among the densely populated enclave's eight historic camps and seen by Israel as strongholds of armed fighters. Israeli aircraft also bombed a house in the heart of Gaza City in the north, killing five Palestinians, while another airstrike in the southern city of Khan Younis killed one person and wounded others, according to medics. Later on Thursday, 15 Palestinians were killed and 30 injured in Israeli bombings of two schools east of Gaza City, the territory's Civil Emergency Service said in a statement. The Israeli military said it struck Hamas command and control centres embedded in the Abdel-Fattah Hamouda and Al-Zahra schools in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, where Hamas fighters were operating.\n\nIt accused Hamas of exploiting civilians and civilian properties for military purposes, an allegation Hamas denies. Footage circulated on social media showed casualties being brought to a hospital on donkey carts.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they were firing anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs at Israeli forces operating across Gaza, causing deaths and injuries among them. Israel's military said it had struck dozens of military targets across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including rocket launching pads.\n\nHamas-led fighters set off the Gaza war on Oct. 7 last year with a shock, cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nSince then, at least 39,699 Palestinians have been killed, including 22 within the past 24 hours, and 91,722 injured in Israel's devastating air and ground war in Gaza, the Gaza health ministry said in an update on Thursday.\n\nThe ministry in the Hamas-run territory does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death lists.\n\nAs Gaza's war churns on, Israel has been battening down for another attack expected in the coming days following vows from Iran and its Lebanon proxy Hezbollah to retaliate for the assassinations last week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.\n\nA relatively contained conflict between Israel and Hezbollah along its northern border, a spillover from the Gaza fighting, now threatens to spiral into an all-out regional war.\n\nOn Thursday dozens of Palestinians rushed into Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis to bid farewell to slain relatives before carrying them away for burials. Footage showed relatives moving out the bodies of their loved ones in plastic bags with names written on them, and holding special prayers before the funerals.\n\nThe Israeli military renewed evacuation orders to Palestinian residents in several districts in eastern Khan Younis, saying it would act forcefully against fighters who had unleashed rockets from those areas.\n\nThe army posted the evacuation order on X, and residents said they had received text and audio messages.\n\nResidents said dozens of families had begun to leave their homes and head west towards Al-Mawasi, a humanitarian-designated area but one that is overcrowded by displaced families from around the enclave.\n\nOn Thursday, the World Central Kitchen (WCK), a U.S.-based, non-governmental humanitarian agency, said that a Palestinian staff member, Nadi Sallout, had been killed while apparently off duty on Wednesday near Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza. The WCK said it was seeking further details.\n\nThe Israeli military said it did not know of any such incident, adding that it had been in contact with WCK.\n\nIn April, seven WCK employees were killed in an Israeli airstrike, spurring it to suspend operations for nearly a month.\n\nIsrael said then its inquiries had found serious errors and breaches of procedure by its military, and that two senior officers had been dismissed and senior commanders reprimanded.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Nuseirat and Bureij are among the densely populated enclave's eight historic camps and seen by Israel as strongholds of armed militants.\n\nIsraeli aircraft also bombed a house in the heart of Gaza City in the north, killing five Palestinians, while another airstrike in the southern city of Khan Younis killed one person and wounded others, according to medics.\n\nLater on Thursday, 15 Palestinians were killed and 30 injured in Israeli bombings of two schools east of Gaza City, the territory's Civil Emergency Service said in a statement.\n\nThe Israeli military said it struck Hamas command and control centers embedded in the Abdel-Fattah Hamouda and Al-Zahra schools in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, where Hamas militants were operating.\n\nIt accused Hamas of exploiting civilians and civilian properties for military purposes, an allegation Hamas denies.\n\nFootage circulated on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed casualties being brought to a hospital on donkey carts.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they were firing anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs at Israeli forces operating across Gaza, causing deaths and injuries among them.\n\nIsrael's military said it had struck dozens of military targets across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including rocket launching pads.\n\nHamas-led militants set off the Gaza war on October 7 last year with a shock, cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nSince then, at least 39,699 Palestinians have been killed, including 22 within the past 24 hours, and 91,722 injured in Israel's devastating air and ground war in Gaza, the Gaza health ministry said in an update on Thursday.\n\nThe ministry in the Hamas-run territory does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death lists.\n\nAs Gaza's war churns on, Israel has been battening down for another attack expected in the coming days following vows from Iran and its Lebanon proxy Hezbollah to retaliate for the assassinations last week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.\n\nA relatively contained conflict between Israel and Hezbollah along its northern border, a spillover from the Gaza fighting, now threatens to spiral into an all-out regional war.\n\nOn Thursday, dozens of Palestinians rushed into Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis to bid farewell to slain relatives before carrying them away for burials.\n\nReuters footage showed relatives moving out the bodies of their loved ones in plastic bags with names written on them, and holding special prayers before the funerals.\n\nThe Israeli military renewed evacuation orders to Palestinian residents in several districts in eastern Khan Younis, saying it would act forcefully against militants who had unleashed rockets from those areas.\n\nThe army posted the evacuation order on X, and residents said they had received text and audio messages.\n\nResidents said dozens of families had begun to leave their homes and head west towards Al-Mawasi, a humanitarian-designated area but one that is overcrowded by displaced families from around the enclave.\n\nOn Thursday, the World Central Kitchen (WCK), a US-based, non-governmental humanitarian agency, said that a Palestinian staff member, Nadi Sallout, had been killed while apparently off duty on Wednesday, August 7, near Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza. The WCK said it was seeking further details.\n\nThe Israeli military said it did not know of any such incident, adding that it had been in contact with WCK.\n\nIn April, seven WCK employees were killed in an Israeli airstrike, spurring it to suspend operations for nearly a month.\n\nIsrael said then its inquiries had found serious errors and breaches of procedure by its military, and that two senior officers had been dismissed and senior commanders reprimanded. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Israeli forces had struck those sites, it added.\n\nHamas-led fighters set off the Gaza war on October 7 with a cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and detaining some 250 captives. In response, Israel has pursued a relentless assault on Gaza that has reduced much of the heavily populated coastal strip to ruins, killed at least 39,600 Palestinians and wounded over 91,500,

Israel says Hamas militants use civilian infrastructure for cover and to conceal operations posts and arms caches; Hamas denies this.\n\nMilitants say they continue to carry out ambush attacks on Israeli troops and armoured vehicles with explosive devices, and are still able to launch limited rocket salvoes into Israel.\n\nOn Tuesday, Islamic Jihad, a close Hamas ally, said it fired rockets into Israel in response to what it called Israeli \"massacres of civilians\".\n\nThe Israeli military said that over the past week Hamas had fired rockets from launchers embedded near two international humanitarian aid and distribution warehouses, including the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israeli forces had struck those sites, it added.\n\nHamas-led militants set off the Gaza war on Oct. 7 with a cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIn response, Israel has pursued a relentless assault on Gaza that has reduced much of the heavily populated coastal strip to ruins, killed at least 39,600 Palestinians and wounded over 91,500, according to Gaza health ministry figures.\n\nThe Hamas-led ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death lists.\n\n(Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo; additional reporting by Ari Rabinovitch; editing by Mark Heinrich)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com",

Nuseirat and Bureij are among the densely populated enclave's eight historic camps and seen by Israel as strongholds of armed militants.\n\nIsraeli aircraft also bombed a house in the heart of Gaza City in the north, killing five Palestinians, while another air strike in the southern city of Khan Younis killed one person and wounded others, according to medics.\n\nLater on Thursday, 15 Palestinians were killed and 30 injured in Israeli bombings of two schools east of Gaza City, the territory's Civil Emergency Service said in a statement.\n\nThe Israeli military said it struck Hamas command and control centres embedded in the Abdel-Fattah Hamouda and Al-Zahra schools in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, where Hamas militants were operating.\n\nIt accused Hamas of exploiting civilians and civilian properties for military purposes, an allegation Hamas denies.\n\nFootage circulated on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed casualties being brought to a hospital on donkey carts.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they were firing anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs at Israeli forces operating across Gaza, causing deaths and injuries among them.\n\nIsrael's military said it had struck dozens of military targets across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including rocket launching pads.\n\nHamas-led militants set off the Gaza war on October 7 last year with a shock, cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nSince then, at least 39,699 Palestinians have been killed, including 22 within the past 24 hours, and 91,722 injured in Israel's devastating air and ground war in Gaza, the Gaza health ministry said in an update on Thursday.\n\nThe ministry in the Hamas-run territory does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death lists.\n\nAs Gaza's war churns on, Israel has been battening down for another attack expected in the coming days following vows from Iran and its Lebanon proxy Hezbollah to retaliate for the assassinations last week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.\n\nA relatively contained conflict between Israel and Hezbollah along its northern border, a spillover from the Gaza fighting, now threatens to spiral into an all-out regional war.\n\nOn Thursday, dozens of Palestinians rushed into Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis to bid farewell to slain relatives before carrying them away for burials.\n\nReuters footage showed relatives moving out the bodies of their loved ones in plastic bags with names written on them, and holding special prayers before the funerals.\n\nThe Israeli military renewed evacuation orders to Palestinian residents in several districts in eastern Khan Younis, saying it would act forcefully against militants who had unleashed rockets from those areas.\n\nThe army posted the evacuation order on X, and residents said they had received text and audio messages.\n\nResidents said dozens of families had begun to leave their homes and head west towards Al-Mawasi, a humanitarian-designated area but one that is overcrowded by displaced families from around the enclave.\n\nOn Thursday, the World Central Kitchen (WCK), a US-based, non-governmental humanitarian agency, said that a Palestinian staff member, Nadi Sallout, had been killed while apparently off duty on Wednesday near Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza. The WCK said it was seeking further details.\n\nThe Israeli military said it did not know of any such incident, adding that it had been in contact with WCK.\n\nIn April, seven WCK employees were killed in an Israeli air strike, spurring it to suspend operations for nearly a month.\n\nIsrael said then its inquiries had found serious errors and breaches of procedure by its military, and that two senior officers had been dismissed and senior commanders reprimanded.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If Hezbollah continues its aggression, Israel will fight it, with all its might,\" Mr Gallant said in a message addressed to the people of Lebanon, according to a statement from his office.\n\nHezbollah has traded near-daily fire with Israeli forces in support of ally Hamas since the Palestinian militant group's 7 October attack on Israel triggered war in Gaza.\n\nFears of all-out war have mounted after Israel killed Hezbollah's top military commander Fuad Shukr in an air strike in a Beirut suburb last week.\n\nReminding the people of Lebanon of the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, Mr Gallant warned Lebanon to \"learn the lesson of the past so as not to fall into a dangerous scenario in August 2024\".\n\nThe devastating 34-day war in July-August 2006 killed more than 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and some 160 Israelis, mostly soldiers.\n\nEarlier, Israeli forces stepped up airstrikes across Gaza, killing at least 40 people, Palestinian medics said, in further battle with Hamas-led militants as Israel braced for potential wider war in the region.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes hit a cluster of houses in central Gaza's Al-Bureij camp, killing at least 15 people, and the nearby Al-Nuseirat camp, killing four, medics said.\n\nAl-Nuseirat and Al-Bureij are among Gaza's eight historic camps and are seen by Israel as strongholds of armed militants.\n\nIsraeli aircraft also bombed a house in the heart of Gaza City in the north, killing five Palestinians, while another airstrike in the southern city of Khan Younis killed one person and wounded others, according to medics.\n\nLater, 15 Palestinians were killed and 30 injured in Israeli bombings of two schools east of Gaza City, the territory's Civil Emergency Service said in a statement.\n\nThe Israeli military said it struck Hamas command and control centres embedded in the Abdel-Fattah Hamouda and Al-Zahra schools in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, where Hamas militants were operating.\n\nIt accused Hamas of exploiting civilians and civilian properties for military purposes, an allegation Hamas denies.\n\n\"Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, surveillance, and additional intelligence,\" the military said.\n\n\"The school compounds were used by Hamas terrorists and commanders as command-and-control centres, from which they planned and carried out attacks against Israel Defence Forces troops and the state of Israel,\" it said.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they were firing anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs at Israeli forces operating across Gaza, causing deaths and injuries among them.\n\nIsrael's military said it had struck dozens of military targets across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including rocket launching pads.\n\nSince the war in Gaza broke out on 7 October, the humanitarian situation in the besieged Palestinian territory remains dire, with almost all of its 2.4 million population displaced and suffering from food shortages.\n\nThe conflict began after Hamas militants attacked Israel on 7 October, resulting in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nMilitants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,677 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths.\n\nIsrael seeks to 'expand tension, war' - Iran\n\nIran accused Israel of wanting to spread war in the Middle East, as diplomatic efforts sought a regional de-escalation following the killings of Tehran-allied militant leaders.\n\nAli Bagheri, Iran's acting foreign minister, said Israel had committed \"a strategic mistake\" by killing Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week - hours after the assassination in Beirut of Hezbollah's military chief.\n\nAlthough Israel has not admitted to killing Haniyeh, Iran and its allies have vowed to retaliate, setting the region on edge as the Gaza war raged on into its 11th month.\n\nIsrael seeks \"to expand tension, war and conflict to other countries\", but has neither \"the capacity nor the strength\" to fight Iran, Mr Bagheri said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking at a military base yesterday, said Israel was \"prepared both defensively and offensively\" and \"determined\" to defend itself.\n\nHouthis vow to coordinate response to Israeli attacks\n\nMeanwhile, the leader of Yemen's Houthis Abdul Malik al-Houthi said the group will coordinate with other members of the 'Axis of Resistance' in any joint operation against Israel.\n\nHe said any decision to respond to Israeli attacks would be made by the axis as a whole.\n\nThis comes as US military forces struck targets in Houthi-controlled Yemen in the past 24 hours.\n\nUS Central Command said it destroyed two drones, a Houthi ground control station, and three anti-ship cruise missiles.\n\nHouthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said earlier that the Houthi air force had launched drones against the US destroyer Cole and fired a number of ballistic missiles at the US destroyer Laboon yesterday.\n\nThe Houthi militants have carried out repeated drone and missile strikes on ships in the crucial shipping channels of the Red Sea, the Bab al-Mandab Strait and the Gulf of Aden since November to show their support for Palestinians in the Gaza war.\n\nElsewhere, Norway said it had summoned an Israeli embassy official to protest Israel's decision to revoke the diplomatic status of Norwegian envoys to the Palestinian Authority.\n\nCyprus on standby to evacuate foreign nationals\n\nCyprus is on standby to assist in the evacuation of Europeans and third-country nationals if conflict in the Middle East deepens, officials said.\n\n\"We are ready, we have activated a specific plan, ESTIA, which has been tried and tested,\" Cyprus' deputy government spokesperson Yiannis Antoniou said.\n\n\"In the event we are asked to assist other countries who may be moving their nationals from the crisis area home, we are in a position to host them for a few days until they are repatriated,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

airstrikes amid fears of wider war", "body": "Later on Thursday, 15 Palestinians were killed and 30 injured in Israeli bombings of two schools east of Gaza City, the territory's Civil Emergency Service said in a statement.\n\nThe Israeli military said it struck Hamas command and control centres embedded in the Abdel-Fattah Hamouda and Al-Zahra schools in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, where Hamas militants were operating.\n\nIt accused Hamas of exploiting civilians and civilian properties for military purposes, an allegation Hamas denies.\n\nFootage circulated on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed casualties being brought to a hospital on donkey carts.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they were firing anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs at Israeli forces operating across Gaza, causing deaths and injuries among them.\n\nIsrael's military said it had struck dozens of military targets across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including rocket launching pads.\n\nHamas-led militants set off the Gaza war on Oct. 7 last year with a shock, cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nSince then, at least 39,699 Palestinians have been killed, including 22 within the past 24 hours, and 91,722 injured in Israel's devastating air and ground war in Gaza, the Gaza health ministry said in an update on Thursday.\n\nThe ministry in the Hamas-run territory does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death lists.\n\nAs Gaza's war churns on, Israel has been battening down for another attack expected in the coming days following vows from Iran and its Lebanon proxy Hezbollah to retaliate for the assassinations last week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.\n\nA relatively contained conflict between Israel and Hezbollah along its

Nuseirat and Bureij are among the densely populated enclave's eight historic camps and seen by Israel as strongholds of armed militants.\n\nIsraeli aircraft also bombed a house in the heart of Gaza City in the north, killing five Palestinians, while another airstrike in the southern city of Khan Younis killed one person and wounded others, according to medics.\n\nLater on Thursday, 15 Palestinians were killed and 30 injured in Israeli bombings of two schools east of Gaza City, the territory's Civil Emergency Service said in a statement.\n\nThe Israeli military said it struck Hamas command and control centres embedded in the Abdel-Fattah Hamouda and Al-Zahra schools in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, where Hamas militants were operating.\n\nIt accused Hamas of exploiting civilians and civilian properties for military purposes, an allegation Hamas denies.\n\nFootage circulated on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed casualties being brought to a hospital on donkey carts.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they were firing anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs at Israeli forces operating across Gaza, causing deaths and injuries among them.\n\nIsrael's military said it had struck dozens of military targets across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including rocket launching pads.\n\nHamas-led militants set off the Gaza war on Oct. 7 last year with a shock, cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nSince then, at least 39,699 Palestinians have been killed, including 22 within the past 24 hours, and 91,722 injured in Israel's devastating air and ground war in Gaza, the Gaza health ministry said in an update on Thursday.\n\nThe ministry in the Hamas-run territory does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death lists.\n\nAs Gaza's war churns on, Israel has been battening down for another attack expected in the coming days following vows from Iran and its Lebanon proxy Hezbollah to retaliate for the assassinations last week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.\n\nA relatively contained conflict between Israel and Hezbollah along its northern border, a spillover from the Gaza fighting, now threatens to spiral into an all-out regional war.\n\nMORE BURIALS IN GAZA\n\nOn Thursday dozens of Palestinians rushed into Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis to bid farewell to slain relatives before carrying them away for burials.\n\nReuters footage showed relatives moving out the bodies of their loved ones in plastic bags with names written on them, and holding special prayers before the funerals.\n\nThe Israeli military renewed evacuation orders to Palestinian residents in several districts in eastern Khan Younis, saying it would act forcefully against militants who had unleashed rockets from those areas.\n\nThe army posted the evacuation order on X, and residents said they had received text and audio messages.\n\nResidents said dozens of families had begun to leave their homes and head west towards Al-Mawasi, a humanitarian-designated area but one that is overcrowded by displaced families from around the enclave.\n\nOn Thursday, the World Central Kitchen (WCK), a U.S.-based, non-governmental humanitarian agency, said that a Palestinian staff member, Nadi Sallout, had been killed while apparently off duty on Wednesday near Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza. The WCK said it was seeking further details.\n\nThe Israeli military said it did not know of any such incident, adding that it had been in contact with WCK.\n\nIn April, seven WCK employees were killed in an Israeli airstrike, spurring it to suspend operations for nearly a month.\n\nIsrael said then its inquiries had found serious errors and breaches of procedure by its military, and that two senior officers had been dismissed and senior commanders reprimanded.\n\n(Reporting and writing by Nidal al-Mughrabi; additional reporting by Ali Sawafta in Ramallah; editing by Mark Heinrich)",

Spokesperson Avichay Adraee announced the orders as rocket attacks continued. The conflict has led to significant destruction and casualties, including the deaths of civilians and militants on both sides.\n\nIsraeli forces on Wednesday issued new evacuation orders to Palestinians in areas of north Gaza that were among the first to be hit at the start of the war with Hamas in October, after militants fired a fresh volley of rockets into Israel.\n\nArmy spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted the evacuation orders for several districts in Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, two now largely demolished towns into which Israeli tanks swept at the outset of Israel's ground invasion. 'Hamas and terrorist organisations are firing rockets from your area towards the State of Israel. The IDF will act forcefully and immediately against them,' Adraee said in the message sent by text or social media to Palestinian residents.\n\n'For your own safety, evacuate immediately to the known shelters in the center of Gaza City,' the army spokesman said. In a nearby Gaza City neighbourhood, Al-Tuffah, an Israeli airstrike on a house killed three Palestinians, medics said.\n\nMULTIPLE FRONTS: Fighting has continued in the Gaza Strip even as Israel braces for an expected assault in its north from Iran and its close Lebanese ally Hezbollah after the July 31 assassination in the Iranian capital Tehran of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has killed dozens of Gaza militants in recent days and on Wednesday said troops had hit weapons-making facilities in the teeming district of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the fighting have taken shelter. In other central areas, Israeli tanks shelled Nuseirat and Bureij, two of Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps. Israel says Hamas militants use civilian infrastructure for cover and to conceal operations posts and arms caches; Hamas denies this.\n\nMilitants say they continue to carry out ambush attacks on Israeli troops and armoured vehicles with explosive devices, and are still able to launch limited rocket salvoes into Israel. On Tuesday, Islamic Jihad, a close Hamas ally, said it fired rockets into Israel in response to what it called Israeli 'massacres of civilians.'\n\nThe Israeli military said that over the past week Hamas had fired rockets from launchers embedded near two international humanitarian aid and distribution warehouses, including the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israeli forces had struck those sites, it added. Hamas-led militants set off the Gaza war on Oct. 7 with a cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIn response, Israel has pursued a relentless assault on Gaza that has reduced much of the heavily populated coastal strip to ruins, killed at least 39,600 Palestinians and wounded over 91,500, according to Gaza health ministry figures. The Hamas-led ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death lists.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [],

Nuseirat and Bureij are among the densely populated enclave's eight historic camps and seen by Israel as strongholds of armed militants.\n\nIsraeli aircraft also bombed a house in the heart of Gaza City in the north, killing five Palestinians, while another airstrike in the southern city of Khan Younis killed one person and wounded others, according to medics.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they were firing anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs at Israeli forces operating across Gaza, causing deaths and injuries among them.\n\nIsrael's military said it had struck dozens of military targets across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including rocket launching pads.\n\nHamas-led militants set off the Gaza war on Oct. 7 last year with a shock, cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nSince then, at least 39,699 Palestinians have been killed, including 22 within the past 24 hours, and 91,722 injured in Israel's devastating air and ground war in Gaza, the Gaza health ministry said in an update on Thursday.\n\nThe ministry in the Hamas-run territory does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death lists.\n\nAs Gaza's war churns on, Israel has been battening down for another attack expected in the coming days following vows from Iran and its Lebanon proxy Hezbollah to retaliate for the assassinations last week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.\n\nA relatively contained conflict between Israel and Hezbollah along its northern border, a spillover from the Gaza fighting, now threatens to spiral into an all-out regional war.\n\nMORE BURIALS IN GAZA\n\nOn Thursday dozens of Palestinians rushed into Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis to bid farewell to slain relatives before carrying them away for burials.\n\nReuters footage showed relatives moving out the bodies of their loved ones in plastic bags with names written on them, and holding special prayers before the funerals.\n\nThe Israeli military renewed evacuation orders to Palestinian residents in several districts in eastern Khan Younis, saying it would act forcefully against militants who had unleashed rockets from those areas.\n\nThe army posted the evacuation order on X, and residents said they had received text and audio messages.\n\nOn Thursday, the World Central Kitchen (WCK), a U.S.-based, non-governmental humanitarian agency, said that a Palestinian staff member, Nadi Sallout, had been killed while apparently off duty on Wednesday near Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza. The WCK said it was seeking further details.\n\nThe Israeli military said it did not know of any such incident, adding that it had been in contact with WCK.\n\nIn April, seven WCK employees were killed in an Israeli airstrike, spurring it to suspend operations for nearly a month.\n\nIsrael said then its inquiries had found serious errors and breaches of procedure by its military, and that two senior officers had been dismissed and senior commanders reprimanded.\n\n(Reporting and writing by Nidal al-Mughrabi; editing by Mark Heinrich)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news",

There is no safe place here. They struck everywhere, they already struck Al-Mawasi and many people were killed. There is no safety, the safety is with God,\" said displaced man Ahmed al-Farra.\n\nUm Raed Abu Elyan said she and her family were \"running from the fire, we are running with our children from fear\".\n\nAsked where would she go she replied: \"God knows, we are walking now. They said to go to humanitarian areas, but there is no safe place here in Gaza. It is all destroyed and damaged.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said troops hit dozens of targets belonging to Hamas militants in Khan Younis and Rafah close to the Egyptian border, seizing arms depots, destroying infrastructure and killing dozens of fighters equipped with weapons including rocket propelled grenades.\n\nCEASEFIRE TALKS\n\nThere was no immediate detail on what was expected from the meeting called for Aug. 15 to discuss a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. Previous talks have failed to yield a ceasefire since a single week-long truce last November.\n\nIsrael's prime minister's office said a delegation would be sent to the talks but declined to give further details. There was no immediate comment from Hamas, whose newly appointed overall leader Yahya Sinwar is believed to run the battle, possibly from the tunnels of Gaza.\n\nThe mediators are anxious to revive the effort to halt the fighting in Gaza with fears growing of a possible broader conflict in the region. Iran has vowed to retaliate after Hamas's leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran and Israel killed a top commander of Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in a strike on a Beirut suburb.\n\nA Hamas response to the latest proposal for talks \"needs to be studied carefully with its allies. If Israel was serious about reaching a ceasefire, they could have simply accepted the proposal Hamas agreed to,\" said one Palestinian official familiar with the mediation effort.\n\nIsrael launched its assault on Gaza aiming to wipe out Hamas after the group's fighters launched an assault on Israeli towns on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.\n\nSince then, Israel has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to figures from health officials in the enclave, who say thousands of others are feared dead under the rubble.\n\nIsrael says it has killed or incapacitated more than 14,000 Hamas fighters, roughly half the number it estimated it faced at the start of the war, and broke the group's organised fighting structure.\n\nBut Palestinians say that despite the near total devastation of Gaza Israel has failed to crush Hamas, with fighters able to mount guerrilla attacks and ambushes even as Israel prepares for war on a possible second front on the Lebanese border.\n\nIn the Central Gaza Strip, residents and Hamas media said Israeli tanks had advanced into the western area of Al-Nuseirat, one of Gaza's main historic refugee camps.\n\nThe territory's health ministry said Israeli military strikes in central and southern parts of the enclave had killed at least eight Palestinians so far on Friday.\n\n(Reporting and writing by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo and Hatem Khaled in Gaza; Editing by Peter Graff)", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Four people were also killed in the nearby Al-Nuseirat camp, medics reported.\n\nAircraft also bombed a house in the heart of Gaza City in the north killing five Palestinians, while another airstrike in the southern city of Khan Younis is believed to have killed one person and wounded others.\n\nIsrael was reported to have issued yet another mass evacuation order covering large areas in and around Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, which was devastated by air and ground attacks earlier this year. Israel warned its forces would soon operate in the affected areas in response to Palestinian rocket fire.\n\nResidents said dozens of families had begun to leave their homes and head west towards Al-Mawasi, a humanitarian-designated area but one that is overcrowded by displaced families from across Gaza.\n\nIsrael's military said it had struck dozens of military targets across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including rocket launching pads - as the armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad reported firing anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs at Israeli forces operating across Gaza.\n\nLater on Thursday, a further 15 people were killed and 30 injured in Israeli bombings of two schools east of Gaza City, the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said.\n\nThe Israeli military said it struck Hamas command and control centres embedded in the Abdel-Fattah Hamouda and Al-Zahra schools in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, where it accused Hamas of exploiting civilians for military purposes - which Hamas denies.\n\nIn its daily update, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said at least 39,699 Palestinians had been killed and 91,722 injured since the war began on 7 October, following the cross-border incursion by Hamas in which 1,200 people in Israel were killed and around 250 taken hostage.\n\nIn a call with France's Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday, Iranian state media

The military said it had taken steps \"to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.\"\n\nA number of other people were still missing beneath the rubble, said Mahmoud Basal, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defense.\n\nThe attacks in the school compounds were among a series of Israeli airstrikes across Gaza on Thursday that killed at least 40 people and left several others critically injured, the Civil Defense said.\n\nIsrael has conducted strikes against school buildings and complexes being used as shelters for displaced people in Gaza in recent weeks, arguing that Hamas fighters are operating on the premises. The United Nations Human Rights Office on Tuesday expressed \"horror\" over what it called an \"escalating pattern\" of such attacks, saying that more than 160 displaced Palestinians, including women and children, had been killed in 17 strikes on schools turned shelters over the past month.\n\nThe United Nations has acknowledged that armed groups embedding with civilians or using civilians as shields violate international humanitarian law. But that \"does not negate Israel's obligation to comply strictly\" with the law, the organization said Tuesday, \"including the principles of proportionality, distinction and precaution when carrying out military operations.\"\n\nAn Israeli strike on Al Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza on Thursday also killed 15 people, the Civil Defense said, adding that strikes elsewhere across the strip, including near the Nuseirat camp and near the southern city of Khan Younis, killed at least a dozen others. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said it had transported 14 injured people, including some who were seriously wounded, to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital after a strike on Deir al-Balah but said the hospital was so overcrowded that several patients had to be transferred to a field hospital.\n\nThe continued fighting in Gaza is happening against the backdrop of fears of a wider war in the Middle East, as the region braces for retaliations following the assassinations last week of a Hezbollah commander, Fouad Shukur, in the southern suburbs of Beirut, and the Hamas political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran, Iran.\n\nIsrael claimed responsibility for targeting Shukur and is widely viewed as responsible for the killing of Haniyeh, though it has not officially claimed credit. Iran and its proxies -- including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen -- have all vowed to retaliate, setting off an international diplomatic scramble to avert a wider war.\n\nThere are fears that the assassinations have jeopardized a potential cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel to end the war in Gaza and lead to the return of 115 hostages -- alive and dead -- who have been held in Gaza since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks on Israel.\n\nIn Gaza, fierce fighting continued, and civilians were ordered to evacuate areas that they had fled before. The Israeli military again ordered parts of southern Gaza around Khan Younis to be evacuated Thursday, continuing a cycle of displacement for many Palestinians. Evacuation orders are usually preludes to Israeli military operations, and the military said it intended to \"act forcefully\" against Hamas fighters who had been firing rockets at Israel from the area.\n\nInitial estimates indicated that more than 15,500 people were living in the areas that came under fresh evacuation orders, the United Nations said. Photos showed streams of people of all ages walking while laden with bags and belongings -- bedding and supplies balanced on heads and shoulders -- small children held in their parents' arms and others in overloaded strollers.\n\nThe United Nations has estimated that around 1.9 million people in Gaza have been displaced since the war began, many of them multiple times. Many now live in tents in overcrowded parts of central Gaza, where finding enough food and clean water can be a daily struggle.\n\nSuzan Abu Daqqa, 59, fled her house in Abasan al-Kabira, a suburb of Khan Younis, on Thursday for at least the third time, joining the tide of people seeking to escape a feared Israeli advance. The last time Israel ordered an evacuation, she had stayed in her home with older relatives, hoping the Israeli offensive would not reach them. This time, a shell landed Thursday not far from her house, which was struck by a piece of shrapnel, she said.\n\nGathering her relatives, Abu Daqqa left for her husband's family's home in western Khan Younis, near a major hospital belonging to the Palestine Red Crescent Society. \"There were displaced people everywhere, walking on their feet, from Abasan all the way to Khan Younis,\" said Abu Daqqa, who had been driving.\n\n\"Where can we go?\" she added, sounding exhausted. \"We don't want to be in tents.\"", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle

IDF Arabic Spokesperson Col. Avichay Adraee instructed evacuees to move south \"to known shelters in the center of Gaza City.\" The evacuation call follows a rocket attack on Tuesday that targeted the southern Israeli cities of Ashkelon and Sderot. Adraee warned that \"The IDF will act forcefully and immediately against\" terrorists operating in the designated evacuation zones.\n\nThe clashes occurred as indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas continue. On August 3, Israel sent a high-level delegation to Cairo for talks with American and Egyptian negotiators on reaching a ceasefire agreement with Hamas. The discussions were reportedly centered on two key topics: the release of hostages and security concerns about the Egypt-Gaza border.\n\n\"While Hamas has taken a hit with the IDF targeting senior leaders, battalion commanders, and fighters, it still has the capacity to strike into Israel with mortars and rockets. Israeli leaders have been bullish on the prospect of defeating Hamas. However, this evacuation demonstrates that there is much more work to be done before Hamas is eliminated as a military threat to Israel.\" -- Bill Roggio, FDD Senior Fellow\n\n\"The frequency of rockets fired by Hamas and its allies at the State of Israel has risen in recent months. These attacks have primarily targeted communities near the Gaza Strip, particularly cities like Ashkelon and Sderot. While Israel has seemingly neutralized Hamas and Islamic Jihad's capacity to launch long-range rockets towards major urban centers such as Tel Aviv and Beersheba, southern Israel continues to face sporadic assaults from terrorist groups in Gaza.\" -- Joe Truzman, Senior Research Analyst at FDD's Long War Journal\n\nAs the Israeli military continues to operate against Hamas in Gaza and defend northern Israel against Hezbollah attacks, violence led by Palestinian terrorist groups persists in the West Bank.\n\nOn August 6, the Israeli Air Force carried out two separate airstrikes in the West Bank city of Jenin, killing four terrorists who posed a threat to troops conducting a counter-terrorism operation in the area. Additionally, the Israeli military and Border Police forces killed seven terrorists and wounded others who attempted to throw explosive devices at troops. One IDF soldier was wounded in the operation and was evacuated to a hospital.\n\n\"Israel Orders Evacuation of Gaza City as Ceasefire Talks Persist,\" FDD Flash Brief", "source": {"uri": "fdd.org",

Rights groups and public health experts estimate the death toll to be much higher.\n\n** The death toll in the West Bank and Jerusalem is not updated regularly. This is the latest figure according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health as of August 8.\n\n*** These figures are released by the Israeli military, showing the soldiers whose names \"were allowed to be published.\" Israeli daily Yediot Ahranot reported on August 4, 2024 that some 10,000 Israeli soldiers and officers have been either killed or wounded since October 7. The head of the Israeli army's wounded association told Israel's Channel 12 the number of wounded Israeli soldiers exceeds 20,000 including at least 8,000 permanently handicapped as of June 1. Israel's Channel 7 reported that according to the Israeli war ministry's rehabilitation service numbers, 8,663 new wounded joined the army's handicap rehabilitation system since October 7, as of June 18.\n\nAt least 15 Palestinians were killed earlier on Thursday, August 8, 2024, in two new massacres by Israeli forces in Gaza, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society reported.\n\nAccording to reports, Israeli aircraft conducted separate strikes on the Abdel Fatah Hamoud and the al-Zahraa schools in eastern Gaza City. Both schools sheltered Palestinian families displaced by previous bombings.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said that 15 killed Palestinians and dozens of wounded were transferred to the Baptist Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City. The Palestinian Civil Defense also reported that three Palestinians were killed in a strike on the Zeitoun neighborhood in the city.\n\nThe Palestinian civil defense said earlier this week that Israeli forces had been systematically attacking sheltering centers. The Palestinian presidency reacted to Thursday's massacre in a statement calling on the international community to \"intervene and force Israel to halt its aggression on the Palestinian people.\"\n\nWith the latest massacres in Gaza City, the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli strikes on Thursday alone rises to at least 56.\n\nYahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, was elected as the new president of the movement's politburo and the successor of Ismail Haniyeh, who Israel assassinated in Tehran a week ago.\n\nHamas said that its senior leader, Khalil al-Hayeh, will continue to lead the ceasefire negotiations, by Sinwar's decision.\n\nThe spokesperson of the Israeli army said that the new position of Sinwar will not stop Israel from hunting him down. Palestinian factions welcomed Sinwar's election in separate statements and considered it a sign of Hamas's unity.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that Sinwar must accept a ceasefire deal.\n\nBlinken added that the ceasefire talks reached their final phase before the recent escalation - which was provoked by Israel's assassination of Hamas's leader and Hezbollah's top commander- and that he is confident that it will be concluded.\n\nNetanyahu, for his part, stated that Israel has not yet received a response from Hamas to its latest deal proposal. Last week, Israel's negotiating team returned from Cairo after differing with Netanyahu, as reported by Israeli media.\n\nOn Thursday, the Israeli daily Times of Israel reported that three Israeli officials whom it did not name said that the Israeli negotiating team in Qatar is losing credibility. According to the quoted officials, Israeli negotiators had accepted several points of the deal but returned and opposed them after discussing them with Netanyahu.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting intensified in the Gaza Strip. On Monday, Palestinian factions launched a rocket barrage on the city of Ashdod, to the north of the Gaza Strip's separation line. Israeli media reported a fire in Ashdod and that shelters were opened. The rocket attack was the first of its kind in months. The armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad - PIJ claimed responsibility for the attack. The Israeli army later ordered Palestinians in Beit Lahia, in northern Gaza, to evacuate.\n\nOn Tuesday, the armed wing of Hamas released footage of an ambush against Israeli soldiers, showing an IED explosion, followed by soldiers carrying four of their own to armored vehicles.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israeli strikes killed 19 Palestinians across the strip in separate strikes, one of them targeted a tent camp for displaced families in the Mawasi area in Khan Younis. The Palestinian civil defense said that Israeli strikes have been systematically targeting displaced camps. Last week, Israeli air strikes targeted three schools sheltering Palestinians in less than 48 hours, killing 47 Palestinians.\n\nTensions continued to rise between Lebanon and Israel as the latter braces for a retaliatory strike in response to Israel's assassination of Hezbollah's top commander Fouad Shukr in Beirut a week ago. On Tuesday, Hezbollah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah said in a speech that his group will \"definitely respond,\" adding that making Israel wait for the response is part of the response itself.\n\nIsrael has been making preparations for a large attack, mobilizing troops to the north and preparing underground shelters for members of its government.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hezbollah attacked the headquarters of two Israeli elite units in the western Galilee near Haifa with drones, while an object fell and exploded in Nahariya, wounding at least 17 Israelis. The Israeli military later announced that the explosion was caused by an iron dome round malfunction. Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Israel is \"ready for defense and attack.\"\n\nSince Wednesday, Hezbollah announced that its fighters conducted nine attacks on Israeli positions across the borders, and released footage of a drone attack on an Israeli armored vehicle in the occupied Lebanese Shabaa farms. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes targeted the Lebanese towns of Kafr Kila, Azziyeh, and Yarin, wounding three Lebanese.\n\nMeanwhile, Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian said on Thursday that Iran's response to Israel's assassination of Hamas's leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran \"will be costly for Israel, but it will be for the good of the region.\" Pezeshkian added that \"Israel is not ready to go to war with Iran.\"", "source": {"uri": "mondoweiss.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondoweiss"}, "authors": [{"uri": "qassam_muaddi@mondoweiss.net", "name": "Qassam Muaddi", "type": "author",

Nuseirat and Bureij are among the densely populated enclave's eight historic camps and seen by Israel as strongholds of armed militants.\n\nIsraeli aircraft also bombed a house in the heart of Gaza City in the north, killing five Palestinians, while another air strike in the southern city of Khan Younis killed one person and wounded others, according to medics.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they were firing anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs at Israeli forces operating across Gaza, causing deaths and injuries among them.\n\nIsrael's military said it had struck dozens of military targets across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including rocket launching pads.\n\nHamas-led militants set off the Gaza war on Oct. 7 last year with a shock, cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nSince then, at least 39,699 Palestinians have been killed, including 22 within the past 24 hours, and 91,722 injured in Israel's devastating air and ground war in Gaza, the Gaza Health Ministry said in an update on Thursday.\n\nThe ministry in the Hamas-run territory does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death lists.\n\nAs Gaza's war churns on, Israel has been battening down for another attack expected in the coming days following vows from Iran and its Lebanon proxy Hezbollah to retaliate for the assassinations last week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.\n\nA relatively contained conflict between Israel and Hezbollah along its northern border, a spillover from the Gaza fighting, now threatens to spiral into an all-out regional war.\n\nOn Thursday dozens of Palestinians rushed into Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis to bid farewell to slain relatives before carrying them away for burials.\n\nReuters footage showed relatives moving out the bodies of their loved ones in plastic bags with names written on them, and holding special prayers before the funerals.\n\nThe Israeli military renewed evacuation orders to Palestinian residents in several districts in eastern Khan Younis, saying it would act forcefully against militants who had unleashed rockets from those areas.\n\nThe army posted the evacuation order on X, and residents said they had received text and audio messages.\n\nOn Thursday, the World Central Kitchen (WCK), a U.S.-based, non-governmental humanitarian agency, said that a Palestinian staff member, Nadi Sallout, had been killed while apparently off duty on Wednesday near Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza. The WCK said it was seeking further details.\n\nThe Israeli military said it did not know of any such incident, adding that it had been in contact with WCK.\n\nIn April, seven WCK employees were killed in an Israeli air strike, spurring it to suspend operations for nearly a month.\n\nIsrael said then its inquiries had found serious errors and breaches of procedure by its military, and that two senior officers had been dismissed and senior commanders reprimanded.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

One of the victims was found in Gaza City's Daraj neighbourhood while another was recovered in the Zeitoun area.\n\nOvernight Israeli attacks also destroyed two homes and tents sheltering displaced people in central Gaza's Deir el-Balah, killing three people and wounding 10.\n\nPalestinians who had moved to the area after Israeli forces said it was a designated \"safe zone\", are now forced to pick up their lives again.\n\n\"Most of the people here have been displaced numerous times - from Rafah, Khan Younis and central Gaza - now they're all crammed into Deir el-Balah,\" one resident told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"The Israelis claim it is a safe zone.

This is all false propaganda.\"\n\n\"There is a growing fear right now because of the concentrated air attacks on the central area, coupled with heavy artillery in the past few days,\" Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud reported from Khan Younis in southern Gaza.\n\n\"Deir el-Balah is the only remaining, somehow intact, city with buildings people can shelter in. But right now, there is a growing concern that the repeated attacks on Deir el-Balah indicate that this area, and largely the central area, is on the verge of a wider-scale attack and a larger invasion.\"\n\nFighting has continued in the Gaza Strip even as Israel braces for an expected response from Iran and its close Lebanese ally Hezbollah after the July 31 assassination in the Iranian capital, Tehran, of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nIsraeli military attacks on Gaza have killed 24 people and injured 110 in the latest 24-hour reporting period, according to the enclave's Health Ministry.\n\nIt said on Wednesday that at least 39,677 people have been killed and 91,645 wounded in Gaza since October 7.

The United Nations Human Rights Office on Tuesday expressed \"horror\" over what it called an \"escalating pattern\" of such attacks, saying that more than 160 displaced Palestinians, including women and children, had been killed in 17 strikes on schools turned shelters over the past month.\n\nThe United Nations has acknowledged that armed groups embedding with civilians or using civilians as shields violate international humanitarian law. But that \"does not negate Israel's obligation to comply strictly\" with the law, the organization said Tuesday, \"including the principles of proportionality, distinction and precaution when carrying out military operations.\"\n\nAn Israeli strike on Al Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza on Thursday also killed 15 people, the Civil Defense said, adding that strikes elsewhere across the strip, including near the Nuseirat camp and near the southern city of Khan Younis, killed at least a dozen others. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said it had transported 14 injured people, including some who were seriously wounded, to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital after a strike on Deir al-Balah, but said the hospital was so overcrowded that several patients had to be transferred to a field hospital.\n\nThe continued fighting in Gaza is happening against the backdrop of fears of a wider war in the Middle East, as the region braces for retaliations following the assassinations last week of a Hezbollah commander, Fouad Shukur, in the southern suburbs of Beirut, and the Hamas political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran.\n\nIsrael claimed responsibility for targeting Shukur and is widely viewed as responsible for the killing of Haniyeh, though it has not officially claimed credit. Iran and its proxies -- including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen -- have all vowed to retaliate, setting off an international diplomatic scramble to avert a wider war.\n\nSpeculation over how Iran and Hezbollah might respond has kept the region on edge for days. Israel on Thursday was a country on tenterhooks, with residents stocking up on food and water and hospitals preparing patients to move underground. The streets were quieter than usual -- earlier in the week, officials encouraged Israelis to limit outdoor activity.\n\nIsrael's leaders have sought to project confidence, saying they are ready for anything. The country's security council convened Thursday night in a command bunker in Tel Aviv to discuss preparations for the anticipated retaliation.\n\nThere are also fears that the assassinations have jeopardized a potential cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel to end the war in Gaza and lead to the return of 115 hostages -- alive and dead -- who have been held in Gaza since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks on Israel.\n\nIn Gaza, fierce fighting continued, and civilians were ordered to evacuate areas that they had fled before. The Israeli military again ordered parts of southern Gaza around Khan Younis to be evacuated Thursday, continuing a cycle of displacement for many Palestinians. Evacuation orders are usually preludes to Israeli military operations, and the military said it intended to \"act forcefully\" against Hamas fighters who had been firing rockets at Israel from the area.\n\nInitial estimates indicated that more than 15,500 people were living in the areas that came under fresh evacuation orders, the United Nations said. Photos showed streams of people of all ages walking while laden with bags and belongings -- bedding and supplies balanced on heads and shoulders -- small children held in their parents' arms and others in overloaded strollers.\n\nThe United Nations has estimated that around 1.9 million people in Gaza have been displaced since the war began, many of them multiple times. Many now live in tents in overcrowded parts of central Gaza, where finding enough food and clean water can be a daily struggle.\n\nSuzan Abu Daqqa, 59, fled her house in Abasan al-Kabira, a suburb of Khan Younis, on Thursday for at least the third time, joining the tide of people seeking to escape a feared Israeli advance. The last time Israel ordered an evacuation, she had stayed in her home with older relatives, hoping the Israeli offensive would not reach them. This time, a shell landed Thursday not far from her house, which was struck by a piece of shrapnel, she said.\n\nGathering her relatives, Abu Daqqa left for her husband's family's home in western Khan Younis, near a major hospital belonging to the Palestine Red Crescent Society. \"There were displaced people everywhere, walking on their feet, from Abasan all the way to Khan Younis,\" said Abu Daqqa, who had been driving.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type":

The situation remains highly volatile, with both sides exchanging accusations and continuing their military actions.\n\nAs the conflict persists, the international community's calls for de-escalation and the protection of civilians are becoming more urgent.

Both camps are recognised by Israel as strongholds of resistance fighters. Additional strikes hit Gaza City and Khan Younis, killing a total of six more people.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad have retaliated by firing anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs at Israeli positions, leading to casualties among Israeli forces. The Israeli military has claimed responsibility for targeting numerous military sites, including rocket launch pads.\n\nThe conflict began on October 7 last year, when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israeli communities, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages. Since then, at least 39,699 Palestinians have died, with 22 of these in the past 24 hours, and 91,722 have been injured, as reported by Gaza's health ministry.\n\nAs hostilities continue, Israel is preparing for potential further attacks, especially following threats of retaliation from Iran and Hezbollah for the recent assassinations of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr. The ongoing conflict, initially confined to Gaza, is now raising concerns about a broader regional war.\n\nIn Gaza, families gathered at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis to mourn and bury their deceased relatives. Reuters footage showed relatives moving out the bodies of their loved ones in plastic bags with names written on them, and holding special prayers before the funerals.\n\nAs Gaza's war churns on, Israel has been battening down for another attack expected in the coming days following vows from Iran and Hezbollah to retaliate for the assassinations last week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.\n\nA relatively contained conflict between Israel and Hezbollah along its northern border, a spillover from the Gaza fighting, now threatens to spiral into an all-out regional war.\n\nThe Israeli military renewed evacuation orders to Palestinian residents in several districts in eastern Khan Younis, saying it would act forcefully against fighters who had unleashed rockets from those areas.

China Daily looks at the international community's efforts in finding a solution as well as humanitarian crisis on the strip.\n\nWith both the death toll and humanitarian situation rapidly worsening in Gaza, the international community has made continued efforts to end the conflict, with the UN Security Council adopting at least four resolutions, namely Resolution 2712, 2720, 2728 and 2735.\n\nThe resolutions call for an immediate cease-fire, the immediate and unconditional release of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas, the need to expand the flow of humanitarian goods into the Gaza Strip, and reinforce the protection of civilians in the conflict zone.\n\nHowever, until now, there have been no signs of a letup in the conflict despite the diplomatic efforts, not even after the Paris Summer Olympics torch was lighted on July 26.\n\nThe desperate appeals from the families of Israeli hostages, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to bring their loved ones home, have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nAn advisory from the International Court of Justice, published on July 19, declared that Israel's laws and measures violate the international prohibition on racial segregation and apartheid.\n\nThe court also demanded that Israel end its occupation of Palestinian territories, dismantle its settlements in the West Bank, provide full reparations to Palestinian victims and facilitate the return of displaced people.\n\nBut all these consolidated efforts, legal advice and international opinion continue to be ignored.\n\nA series of international condemnations and resolutions largely aimed at preventing Israel's military strikes on the Gaza Strip have done little to improve the conditions of aid worker Nebal Farsakh and her colleagues, as well as the 2 million Palestinians struggling for survival in their homeland.\n\nDespite the existence of international humanitarian laws, \"our teams have been strategically and repeatedly targeted\", which has resulted in the killing of 19 Palestine Red Crescent Society members up to this moment, Farsakh, a spokesperson for the group, told China Daily.\n\nFarsakh noted that while several United Nations resolutions have been passed to restrain Israel since the conflict in Gaza began, these have had no direct impact on their work -- in terms of ensuring the aid workers' safety.\n\nShe said the group's objective is to ensure \"the protection of our staff, the humanitarians, medical personnel and medical facilities\" so they can continue to provide lifesaving work.\n\nOn Aug 3, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies confirmed the death of one of their own -- Tamer Jalal Muhammad Saqr -- who died after he was shot during an Israeli raid on the Balata refugee camp east of Nablus in the West Bank on July 27. He was helping the wounded civilians after a blast killed two people and injured more than 20 others.\n\nOn Aug 8, the US-based food aid charity World Central Kitchen said on its X account that Nadi Sallout, an integral member of the warehouse team from the early days in Rafah and a humanitarian at his very core, was killed near Deir al-Balah, Gaza.\n\nOn April 1, seven of its staff, which included citizens from the US, Australia, Britain and Poland, were killed after the Israeli military attacked their three-vehicle convoy despite being clearly marked with logos of the organization.\n\nThe schools in Gaza are not safe either. On Aug 4, at least 25 Palestinians were killed when an Israeli airstrike hit the al-Nasr and Hassan Salama schools in Gaza City, Xinhua News Agency reported. Many of the victims were children and women. Israeli Army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said the attack was aimed at militants operating inside Palestinian schools.", "source": {"uri": "global.chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title":

It wrongly assumes that the Israeli people oppose Netanyahu's war in Gaza though, in reality, they have been quite approving of all tactics used by the Israeli army, so far.\n\nFor example, over 300 days into the war, 69 percent of all Israelis support Netanyahu's desperate tactics of assassinations, including the killing of Hamas' top political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran on July 31.\n\nWhile Netanyahu's decision to target a political leader reflects his own failure and desperation, how is one to explain the Israeli people's enthusiasm for the expansion of the circle of violence?\n\nThe answer does not lie in the event of October 7, namely the Palestinian assault on the Gaza Envelope region and the unprecedented defeat of the Israeli army. Indeed, it is time to start thinking beyond the confines of the revenge theory, which has dominated our understanding and analysis of the Israeli genocide in Gaza.\n\nFor years prior to the current war, Israel has been moving slowly to the right and far-right, whose political extremism has surpassed that of any generation of Zionist leadership that has ruled over Israel since the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in 1948.\n\nAccording to an Israeli Democracy Institute poll, published in January 2023, 73 percent of Israeli Jews, between the ages of 18 to 24, identify as 'right wing'.\n\nConsidering that the likes of current Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir, Bezalel Smotrich and Orit Strook, are also classified as 'right-wing', one can conclude that the majority of Israeli youth practically identify as right-wing extremists.\n\nThese youth are the core of the Israeli army and the settler movement. They are the ones carrying out the genocide in Gaza, the daily pogroms in the West Bank and serving as the foot soldiers for the widespread racism campaigns targeting the Palestinian Arab communities inside Israel.\n\nThere is a good number of analysts who tried to explain how Israel became a decidedly rightwing society and how youth, in particular, emerged as the gatekeepers of Israel's version of suicidal nationalism.\n\nThe explanation, however, should be straightforward. Israel's far-right extremism is only a natural evolution of the Zionist ideology which, in its most 'liberal' forms, was always predicated on ethnic hatred, a sense of racial supremacy and predictable violence.\n\nThough ideological Zionism in all its manifestations has essentially followed the same trajectory of settler-colonialism and ethnic cleansing, a conflict existed between the various strands of Israeli society.\n\nThe so-called liberals - represented by the upper echelons of the military, business circles and some centrist and leftist political groups - worked to maintain the balance between a colonial, apartheid regime in occupied Palestine, and a selective liberal order that applies only to Jews inside Israel.\n\nThe far-right had other ideas. For many years, the Israeli right camp, led by Netanyahu himself, has perceived his ideological enemies inside Israel as traitors, for even daring to engage in a 'peace process' with the Palestinians - even if that process was a facade, to begin with.\n\nThe right wanted to ensure that the territorial contiguity between the so-called 'Israel proper' and the illegal Jewish settlements was not only a physical one but an ideological one as well.\n\nThis is how the settlers moved slowly, over the years, from the margins of Israeli politics to the center.\n\nBetween April 2019 and November 2022, Israel underwent five different general elections. Though the focus of most remained fixated on Netanyahu's role in dividing Israeli society, the elections, in reality, were a historic fight among Israel's ideological groups to determine the future of the country and the direction of Zionism.\n\nIn the last elections, the far-right extremists won, forming the most stable Israeli government in years. While the right was ready to permanently reconfigure Israel, its political, educational, military and, most importantly, judicial institutions, October 7 took place.\n\nInitially, the Hamas assault and its aftermath posed a challenge to all segments of Israeli society: the humiliated army, the degraded intelligence, the humbled politicians, the confounded media and the angry masses.\n\nBut the greatest challenge was faced by the far-right, which was about to shape the future of Israel for generations. Thus, the Gaza war is not just important to Netanyahu, but to the very future of Israel's far-right camp, whose entire political and ideological program has been shattered, most likely beyond salvation.\n\nThis should help explain the obvious contradictions in Israeli society, for example, the mistrust in Netanyahu's motives, yet the trust in the war itself; the widespread criticism of his overall failure, yet the approval of his actions, and so on.\n\nThis seeming confusion cannot be explained simply based on Netanyahu's ability to manipulate Israelis. Even if the Israeli right has lost all faith in Netanyahu, without him as a unifying figure, all is lost, not only the chances of the far-right camp to redeem itself, but also the very future of Zionism.", "source": {"uri": "palestinechronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Palestine Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type":

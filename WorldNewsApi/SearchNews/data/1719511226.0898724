The Coca-Cola 600 is the second of NASCAR\u2019s crown jewel races and will take place today (May 26) with coverage beginning at 5:30 p.m. Eastern on FOX for the 6 p.m. start. Several streaming services will broadcast the race live and you can watch for free on Fubo and DirecTV Stream, or on Sling, which features promotional offers. The Coca-Cola 600 is the grand finale to one of the biggest auto racing weekends of the year with the Indy 500 and the Monaco Grand Prix taking place earlier in the day. The Charlotte Motor Speedway, which is a home track for several teams based near the area, is the host site for Sunday\u2019s race. Ryan Blaney was last season\u2019s winner and will be back to try to become the first person since Jimmie Johnson from 2003-05 to win the race in consecutive seasons. Meanwhile, NASCAR champion Kyle Larson will attempt to be the first person to pull double duty, completing both the Coca-Cola 600 and the Indy 500 in the same day, since Kurt Busch in 2014. The two races start nine hours apart, which, ironically, is exactly how long it takes to get from Indianapolis to Charlotte in a car. Here are some additional details on how to watch the Coca-Cola 500 for free. What: Coca-Cola 600. When: Sunday, May 26. Where: Charlotte Motor Speedway | Concord, N.C. Time: 6 p.m. Eastern Channel: FOX Best Streaming Options: Fubo, DirecTV Stream (free trial) and Sling (half off first month) Here is some background from the Associated Press on NASCAR handing down its largest fine ever following a major brawl after the All-Star race at North Wilkesboro Speedway. Ricky Stenhouse Jr. was fined $75,000 by NASCAR on Wednesday for fighting with Kyle Busch after the All-Star race at North Wilkesboro Speedway. Stenhouse\u2019s father, who joined the fracas, was suspended indefinitely. The $75,000 fine was the largest ever handed down by NASCAR for fighting. Busch was not penalized for his action in the Sunday night race. The two tangled on the first lap and then Busch seemed to deliberately wreck Stenhouse on the second lap. Stenhouse parked his damaged Chevrolet in Busch\u2019s pit stall and aggressively climbed the spotter\u2019s ladder and exchanged words with members of Busch\u2019s crew. Stenhouse then stormed to his hauler, leaving his car to be towed to the pits. He also foreshadowed that he\u2019d be back after the race to confront Busch. The two did exchange brief words before Stenhouse, wearing shorts and t-shirt, landed a right hook on Busch and a melee broke out involving members of both teams. Stenhouse\u2019s father, who has no affiliation with the team, then went after Busch, throwing punches. NASCAR on Wednesday also suspended Stenhouse mechanic Clint Myrick for eight races and engine tuner Keith Matthews for four races. Stenhouse in the fight vowed to wreck Busch this Sunday during the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. \u201cBring it,\u201d Busch replied. \u201cI suck as bad as you,\u201d implying that both drivers are not having great seasons. Neither driver has won a race this season. Busch is 13th in points standings and Stenhouse, a one-car team, is 26th. Busch\u2019s car owner isn\u2019t taking that threat from Stenhouse lightly, however. Richard Childress vowed to fight Stenhouse himself if he goes near Busch\u2019s car at Charlotte Motor Speedway. The Coca-Cola 600 is the longest Cup Series race on the schedule, so there will be plenty of time for Busch and Stenhouse to meet up on the 1.5-mile track. NASCAR, no doubt, will be keeping an eye on the feuding drivers.", "summary": "'Motorsport Christmas' is getting closer and you can celebrate by watching the NASCAR Coca-Cola 600 for free today.", "url": "https://www.cleveland.com/tv/2024/05/coca-cola-600-how-to-watch-nascar-race-for-free-today.html", "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/NBR2U3EXHRFGFBG54RG5GODITU.jpg?auth=53eb2a02caaeb7474d6782b93b6b72494b1689bea6e7f1abd12cfaf4628c9081&width=1280&quality=90", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:00:00", "author": "Jonathan Simmons,Jonathan X.

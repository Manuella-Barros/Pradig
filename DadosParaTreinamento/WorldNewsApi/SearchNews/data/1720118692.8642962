Gone are the days when risk could be contained to financial stability and investment prospectuses; today, wealth owners and their families are susceptible to not only the same financial risks as their forebears, but further risks to their reputation, physical security, online presence, and more. To wholly become a master of every discipline of risk mitigation and management is likely an impossible task - but for family offices seeking to modernise their operations and future-proof the safety of the next generation, having at least an understanding of the changing landscape of risk is a necessity. Step One: Understanding The Changing Risk Landscape A recent webinar on family office risk illustrated that the only true constant is change. Family offices must adapt to a rapidly evolving risk environment. Today\u2019s world is marked by not only geopolitical shifts, but further technological advancements, and increased mobility - all of which introduce new vulnerabilities. The first stop for many family offices venturing into the topic is - and should be - regular risk assessments and developing a pipeline of information to keep updated with global and regional security trends. According to the results of a survey conducted by Simple in a 2024 report on Family Office Security and Risk management, family offices had varied opinions on their single biggest risk - while the majority (27%) of respondents cited reputation management, investment returns and wealth transfer and succession (22% each) closely followed.

As Edward Marshall, CEO and Founder at Presage Global (an intelligence-powered risk management and business advisory firm) offered during the webinar - \"Families can be victims of their own success. The illusion of security can be a major pitfall, so it\u2019s critical to have a bespoke risk management plan that evolves with changing threats.\u201d Step Two: Developing a Comprehensive Risk Management Strategy A holistic risk management strategy is essential, and is comprised of both an internal strategy, and securing the right help. To do this, Family offices should consider a multi-layered approach that encompasses physical, digital, reputational, and emotional security. This includes securing physical premises, implementing robust cybersecurity measures, protecting the family's reputation, and ensuring the emotional well-being of all family members and staff. Engaging The Right Service Providers Engaging the wrong providers is a risk in and of itself; but partnering with the right service providers can significantly enhance a family office's risk management capabilities. It is important to work with vendors who have specialized expertise and a proven track record in handling the specific needs of family offices. These providers should offer tailored solutions that address the unique risks faced by the family office, from executive protection services to cybersecurity consulting. Fortunately, family offices needn\u2019t be alone when considering their options, as a number of providers in the market have developed expertise across a broad array of risk categories. Starting with holistic risk management is a positive first step for many family offices; providers such as Concentric offer physical security, cyber security, and intelligence solutions, while Zero-Alpha is a network of highly skilled specialists that specialises in advising and assisting private and corporate clients across a wide spectrum of holistic risk management settings. Communication and Reputation On specific risks to family offices, there are many aspects to consider and communication is a key asper to help manage reputation. Internally this could mean secure messaging to ensure nothing makes its way into the wrong hangs, and externally this refers to building and managing reputation. Governance and dynamics is a key area for families to collaborate on - and novel solutions such as Trusted Family provide a secure and centralised governance platform, while systems like Trustworthy provide a communication platform that helps modern families protect key documents and family information. Lastly, reputation is everything - and bespoke service providers have developed new and interesting solutions. For example, Reputation Defender by Norton is an online reputation management service that can help discover negative mentions or other online risks. While other companies and reputation management firms (Sanctuary Counsel as an example) could then follow on to build, enhance and protect reputation through their expert teams. Step Three: Building A Proactive Cybersecurity Posture Cybersecurity deserves its own mention, given that it is a critical component of risk management that can easily influence all of the aforesaid categories. As Scott Augenbaum, a retired FBI agent and Cybersecurity Author said during the webinar, \u201cThe cybercrime problem continues to get worse, but we keep throwing more and more money at the problem. Simple measures like using two-factor authentication and educating against social engineering can prevent 90% of cyber threats.\u201d Additionally, using password managers and securing all remote access points are necessary to safeguard against cyber threats. Family offices should also consider obtaining certifications like Cyber Essentials to benchmark their cybersecurity practices. In Simple\u2019s report, 53% of surveyed family offices indicated that they\u2019d dedicated resources to prevent cybersecurity breaches by engaging external service providers. In this category, Digitalis is one London-based advisory firm that helps clients protect and advance their online interests through digital intelligence and proprietary technology, while Defuse Global offers investigation, intelligence, and threat management services to both private and corporate clients. Cyber Concierge specialises in protecting brand, lifestyle and identity against cyber theft. Step Four: Fostering a Culture of Security Awareness Educating all family members and staff about security risks and best practices is key to effective risk management. An encouraging finding is that 33% of surveyed family offices in Simple\u2019s Security & Risk report highlighted that their primary action for risk management was to perform routine security refreshers. These regular training sessions help develop a proactive mindset towards security can help in building a resilient culture. Involving everyone in the family office, from top executives to household staff, is an essential ongoing educational effort to ensure that everyone understands their role in maintaining security. Managing insider threats is also vital for safeguarding sensitive information and assets, and implementing a comprehensive insider threat program can mitigate risks posed by both intentional and unintentional insider actions. This program should include clear policies, ongoing training, and a culture of security awareness. Perceptions of Security Umbra International & Simple As Kate Bright, CEO and Founder at UMBRA International (a provider of bespoke protective and proactive security solutions) wisely said during the webinar - \u201cIn a world of unknowns, let's control the controlables. Security has to be people-centric, focusing on both physical and emotional well-being.\u201d With these key steps, family offices can begin to fully secure their operations against a wide array of threats - and more importantly, remain responsive and swift in adapting to new threats in the future.

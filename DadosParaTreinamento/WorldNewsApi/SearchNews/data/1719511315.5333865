Mr Harris said: \u201cThis is a country that knows the value of immigration. We are a better country as a result of migration, but we\u2019re also a country that has rules. \u201cI think people want to see, along with compassion, common sense injected into the migration debate. \u201cI think what you're seeing is another example of those practical measures that we're taking to enforce the rules that we have in our country around migration.\u201d The Taoiseach rejected claims the Government is \"dog-whistling\" over changes to social welfare for refugees and more immigration checks to appease far-right activists and boost support ahead of the local and European elections. \u201cNo, what the Government is doing is exactly what I said the Government would do. \u201cIt's making sure that we move from an emergency approach to migration to a much more sustainable model,\" he said. \u201cThere are rules in this country. I expect the rules to be enforced. \"The Irish people expect me to ensure that the rules are enforced and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing happening.\u201d The Taoiseach said he was \"encouraged\" by the reports of cooperation between garda\u00ed and the PSNI on dealing with immigration. He added that it was important that there is no \"abuse\" of the common travel area between Ireland and Britain. The Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and the roads policing units came together for the border operation.

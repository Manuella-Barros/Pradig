When is her Olympics gold medal fight?", "body": "Algerian boxer Imane Khelif is on the verge of winning a gold medal at the Paris 2024 Olympics Games amid a gender dispute that has become one of the competition's biggest stories.\n\nKhelif, who will play for her chance to win gold on Friday, has been caught up in a gender debate after a 2023 decision by the now-banned International Boxing Association (IBA) resurfaced, which disqualified her for failing a gender eligibility test.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has rejected the results of the IBA-ordered tests as arbitrary and illegitimate, saying there was no reason to conduct them.\n\nBut conservative leaders like Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and former US President Donald Trump have chimed in on the debate after misinformation spread about Khelif being a transgender athlete, which she is not.\n\nBut who is Khelif, and when is her fight for the gold?\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nKhelif, 25, grew up playing football in her rural village in Tiaret, western Algeria. After giving up on the sport in her teenage years, Khelif looked to boxing despite her father's dismay.\n\nTraining was not easy. Khelif had to sell scrap metal and her mother's couscous to raise enough money to take the bus for 10km (six miles) to the nearest gym.\n\nBut she swiftly caught the attention of the Algerian boxing federation and competed in the 2018 Women's World Championship, where she came 17th after being eliminated in the first round.\n\nShe was one of the first three Olympic women's boxers Algeria sent to the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nKhelif won her opening game at the competition but lost in the second round to Ireland's Kellie Harrington, who later won gold.\n\nShe went on to raise her profile in the next two world championships and became an ambassador for UNICEF earlier this year to inspire young Algerians to go after their dreams.\n\nKhelif will play for gold on Friday at Roland Garros Stadium at 22.51 Paris time (20:51 GMT).\n\nShe is playing for Algeria's second boxing gold medal since 2000 and the country's first in women's boxing.\n\nKhelif will face China's Yang Liu in the welterweight category during the final match.\n\nThe welterweight category is a designated weight class between lightweight and middleweight.\n\nThose in the welterweight category are competing in the 69kg weight class.\n\nKhelif's winning streak began with her round of 16 win against Italy's Angela Carini on August 1, after Carini pulled out of the game, which lasted only 46 seconds.\n\nThe Algerian boxer went on to face Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori in the quarterfinals, which she won after a unanimous decision.\n\nOn Tuesday, Khelif beat Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng 5-0 in the semifinals at Court Philippe-Chatrier, allowing her to progress to the finals.\n\nFollowing her match with Italy's Carini, a debate about Khelif's gender resurfaced after she failed an unspecified gender eligibility test from the IBA in 2023.\n\nThe decision to abruptly disqualify Khelif before the finals of the world championships was due to eligibility criteria that prevented athletes with XY chromosomes from competing in women's events.\n\nHowever, the IBA did not specify on what ground she failed, alongside Taiwan's featherweight competitor, Lin Yu-ting.\n\nAt the time, Khelif called the decision a \"big conspiracy\" after she had previously competed in the competition without any problems.\n\nThe IOC President Thomas Bach has defended Khelif.\n\n\"We are talking about women's boxing. We have two boxers who were born as women, raised as women, who have passports as women and who have competed for many years as women and this is a clear definition of a woman,\" Bach told a media conference last week.\n\nAfter the Carini fight, Khelif has been the victim of a social media storm with insulting and transphobic comments about her ability to compete in women's competitions and her gender identity.\n\nThe head of the Algerian delegation at the Paris Olympics said the Algerian Olympic Committee supported Khelif and had filed a complaint with the IOC over the \"immoral\" campaign.\n\nHer father also described the attacks against his daughter as \"immoral\" and said she had brought the family \"honour\".\n\nFollowing her semifinal win, Khelif said the \"best response\" to all the uproar would be to win a gold medal.\n\n\"I am very happy,\" Khelif said. \"I've worked eight years for these Olympics, and I'm very proud of this moment. I would like to thank the support from people back home.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Khelif has won three consecutive bouts in Paris, and she will win either a gold or a silver medal on Friday when she completes the tournament against Yang Liu of China.\n\nKhelif has thrived inside the ring in Paris amid criticism and stigmatization outside of it. The trouble has stemmed from the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify her and fellow Paris medalist Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan from the IBA Women's World Boxing Championships last year for allegedly failing an eligibility test.\n\n\"I don't care about that,\" Khelif said through an interpreter. \"I wish to be ready and show a good standard, show my talent, because I want to entertain everyone.\"\n\nKhelif had already clinched Algeria's first medal in women's boxing before she stepped into the ring to rousing roars at Court Philippe Chatrier. She then controlled her bout with Suwannapheng, who took a standing eight-count late in the third after absorbing a series of punches.\n\n\"I had heard about the news regarding her, but I wasn't following it closely,\" Suwannapheng said. \"She is a woman, but she is very strong.\"\n\nKhelif has won every round on every judge's card in her two fights that have gone the distance in Paris. She has made the most important tournament run of her international career while under the most pressure she has ever faced.\n\n\"I am very happy,\" Khelif said. \"I've worked eight years for these Olympics, and I'm very proud of this moment. I would like to thank the support from people back home.\"\n\nKhelif also said she felt the \"best response\" to the uproar around her would be to win a gold medal -- and now she's one win away.\n\nAfter sharing a hug with Suwannapheng and holding open the ropes for her opponent in a traditional boxing gesture of sportsmanship, Khelif celebrated by running furiously in place while pumping her fists as the crowd roared for her again.\n\nThe celebration was more joyous than her cathartic finish to her quarter-final victory over Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori, when she slammed her palm on the canvas as she teared up.\n\nKhelif received her post-fight medical check and was headed out of the Roland Garros arena when she was mobbed by fans near the exit. They hugged Khelif, demanded selfies and waved Algerian flags while she made her way backstage.\n\nKhelif received cheers that echoed through the famed tennis arena from the moment she entered to face Suwannapheng. Roland Garros welcomed a prominent turnout from Algerian fans voicing their national pride in a boxer whose negative spotlight has been taken quite personally in her country.\n\nBoth fighters came out aggressively, and were trading punches from a distance. Khelif was more accurate, while winning the first round on all five cards, and she repeated the performance in the second.\n\nThe fight got more physical in the third, with Suwannapheng pushing forward to make a comeback. The bout was stopped for a standing eight-count late in the third when Suwannapheng absorbed a few head punches in succession, although Suwannapheng appeared to shrug as if it was not necessary -- as is often the case in Olympic boxing, where referees can stop a bout for relatively minor reasons.\n\n\"I tried to use my speed, but my opponent was just too strong,\" Suwannapheng said.\n\nThe 25-year-old Khelif is on the best run of her amateur career at the Olympics. She has performed solidly at the international level and even won some regional tournaments, but she has never been a dominant fighter on the world stage until her two strong performances -- and 46 seconds of easy work against a third -- to reach the final in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Liu_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yang Liu (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yu-ting", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lin Yu-ting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amateur boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2024/08/08/P07-240808-308.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798676", "eventUri": "eng-9798676", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

When is her Olympics gold medal fight?", "body": "Algeria's Imane Khelif will face China's Yang Liu on Friday for a chance to win the country's first women's boxing gold medal.\n\nAlgerian boxer Imane Khelif is on the verge of winning a gold medal at the Paris 2024 Olympics Games amid a gender dispute that has become one of the competition's biggest stories.\n\nKhelif, who will play for her chance to win gold on Friday, has been caught up in a gender debate after a 2023 decision by the now-banned International Boxing Association (IBA) resurfaced, which disqualified her for failing a gender eligibility test.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has rejected the results of the IBA-ordered tests as arbitrary and illegitimate, saying there was no reason to conduct them.\n\nBut conservative leaders like Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and former US President Donald Trump have chimed in on the debate after misinformation spread about Khelif being a transgender athlete, which she is not.\n\nBut who is Khelif, and when is her fight for the gold?\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nKhelif, 25, grew up playing football in her rural village in Tiaret, western Algeria. After giving up on the sport in her teenage years, Khelif looked to boxing despite her father's dismay.\n\nTraining was not easy. Khelif had to sell scrap metal and her mother's couscous to raise enough money to take the bus for 10km (six miles) to the nearest gym.\n\nBut she swiftly caught the attention of the Algerian boxing federation and competed in the 2018 Women's World Championship, where she came 17th after being eliminated in the first round.\n\nShe was one of the first three Olympic women's boxers Algeria sent to the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nKhelif won her opening game at the competition but lost in the second round to Ireland's Kellie Harrington, who later won gold.\n\nShe went on to raise her profile in the next two world championships and became an ambassador for UNICEF earlier this year to inspire young Algerians to go after their dreams.\n\nKhelif will play for gold on Friday at Roland Garros Stadium at 22.51 Paris time (20:51 GMT).\n\nShe is playing for Algeria's second boxing gold medal since 2000 and the country's first in women's boxing.\n\nKhelif will face China's Yang Liu in the welterweight category during the final match.\n\nThe welterweight category is a designated weight class between lightweight and middleweight.\n\nThose in the welterweight category are competing in the 69kg weight class.\n\nKhelif's winning streak began with her round of 16 win against Italy's Angela Carini on August 1, after Carini pulled out of the game, which lasted only 46 seconds.\n\nThe Algerian boxer went on to face Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori in the quarterfinals, which she won after a unanimous decision.\n\nOn Tuesday, Khelif beat Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng 5-0 in the semifinals at Court Philippe-Chatrier, allowing her to progress to the finals.\n\nFollowing her match with Italy's Carini, a debate about Khelif's gender resurfaced after she failed an unspecified gender eligibility test from the IBA in 2023.\n\nThe decision to abruptly disqualify Khelif before the finals of the world championships was due to eligibility criteria that prevented athletes with XY chromosomes from competing in women's events.\n\nHowever, the IBA did not specify on what ground she failed, alongside Taiwan's featherweight competitor, Lin Yu-ting.\n\nAt the time, Khelif called the decision a \"big conspiracy\" after she had previously competed in the competition without any problems.\n\nThe IOC President Thomas Bach has defended Khelif.\n\n\"We are talking about women's boxing. We have two boxers who were born as women, raised as women, who have passports as women and who have competed for many years as women and this is a clear definition of a woman,\" Bach told a media conference last week.\n\nAfter the Carini fight, Khelif has been the victim of a social media storm with insulting and transphobic comments about her ability to compete in women's competitions and her gender identity.\n\nThe head of the Algerian delegation at the Paris Olympics said the Algerian Olympic Committee supported Khelif and had filed a complaint with the IOC over the \"immoral\" campaign.\n\nHer father also described the attacks against his daughter as \"immoral\" and said she had brought the family \"honour\".\n\nFollowing her semifinal win, Khelif said the \"best response\" to all the uproar would be to win a gold medal.\n\n\"I am very happy,\" Khelif said. \"I've worked eight years for these Olympics, and I'm very proud of this moment. I would like to thank the support from people back home.\"", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Khelif has yet to lose one round on a judge's scorecard in her first three fights in Paris, going on the most dominant run of her boxing career while facing an extraordinary amount of scrutiny.\n\nIt stems from Khelif and fellow two-time Olympian Li Yu-ting of Taiwan getting disqualified from last year's world championships by the Russian-dominated International Boxing Association, which claims both fighters failed a murky eligibility test for women's competition.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee took the unprecedented step last year of permanently banning the IBA from the Olympics following years of concerns about its governance, competitive fairness and financial transparency. The IOC has called the arbitrary sex tests that the sport's governing body imposed on the two boxers irretrievably flawed.\n\nThe IBA did nothing to help its argument this week at a shambolic news conference in which its leadership contradicted itself about the tests and declined to answer basic questions about them, citing privacy concerns from the Olympic committees of Algeria and Taiwan.\n\nThe IOC has repeatedly reaffirmed the two boxers' right to compete in Paris, with President Thomas Bach personally defending Khelif and Lin while calling the criticism \"hate speech.\"\n\n\"We have two boxers who are born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman and have competed for many years as women,\" Bach said.\n\nThat hasn't stopped the international outcry tied to misconceptions around the fighters that has been amplified by Russian disinformation networks, but neither has it slowed the two.\n\nKhelif has dominated all three of her bouts, but she faces her most significant test in Yang, the 2023 world champion and the No. 2 seed in their weight class.\n\nKhelif told SNTV, a sport video partner of The Associated Press, that the wave of hateful scrutiny she has received \"harms human dignity,\" and she called for an end to bullying athletes. She also said a gold medal would be \"the best response\" to the backlash against her.\n\nThe crowds in Paris, however, have embraced both Khelif and Lin, who have heard nothing but cheers during their bouts. A huge contingent of flag-waving Algeria fans greeted and serenaded Khelif throughout her semifinal victory Tuesday night, and she's become a hometown hero in her North African country.\n\nKhelif has already secured Algeria's first Olympic medal in women's boxing. She will attempt to become only her country's second boxing gold medalist, joining Hocine Soltani (1996).\n\nThe gold medal fight is the culmination of Khelif's nine-day run through an Olympic tournament that began with a bizarre event. Khelif's first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, abandoned their bout after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nAn already brewing story suddenly became major international news, with the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump and \"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling weighing in with criticism and false speculation about men competing with women in sports. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni personally visited with Carini to share her condolences and to cast doubt on Khelif's eligibility.\n\nCarini later said she regretted her actions and wished to apologize to Khelif.

How the Algerian boxer became the target of controversy.", "body": "Algerian boxer Imane Khelif is competing Friday for the gold medal in the women's welterweight boxing at the Paris Olympics.\n\nBut Khelif's matches have become overshadowed by a misinformation-filled fight raging over social media.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach has passionately defended Khelif, who, along with another boxer, has been the subject of widespread misinformation about their gender. Bach condemned the \"hate speech\" against the two athletes, saying the attacks were \"totally unacceptable.\"\n\nKhelif herself has called for an end to the bullying of athletes, saying it violates the spirit of the Olympics and has \"massive effects\" on competitors.\n\nKhelif easily dispatched Italian boxer Angela Carini on Aug. 1 in the opening seconds of their bout. Carini told her coach that she could not continue the fight after just 46 seconds. \"She's too strong,\" Carini said, according to her coach.\n\nThe controversy kicked off because critics quickly noted that Khelif and another boxer, Taiwan's featherweight Lin Yu-ting, both failed an unspecified gender eligibility test conducted last year by the International Boxing Association (IBA) for the World Boxing Championships in New Delhi. However, that ruling has no bearing on the Olympics, which last year stopped recognizing the IBA as a governing body of the sport, citing issues with the group's financial transparency, governance and fairness.\n\nIn fact, the IOC sharply criticized the IBA's \"sudden and arbitrary decision,\" over the two athletes, which it said was taken \"without any proper procedure -- especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years.\"\n\nRead More:\n\n\ud83d\udca5Wave of misinformation\n\nKhelif is a woman and was assigned female at birth, according to an IOC spokesperson. Despite that, many online critics falsely labeled Khelif as transgender after her victory over Carini, fanning the flames over the issue of transgender women competing in women's sports -- a hot-button political issue in the U.S.\n\n\"I WILL KEEP MEN OUT OF WOMEN'S SPORTS!\" former President Donald Trump declared on his social media platform. The Republican presidential nominee included a video of Khelif's fight to make it clear who he was talking about. His running mate, Sen. JD Vance, echoed that message and used the Paris Olympics controversy as an opportunity to attack their Democratic opponent. \"This is where Kamala Harris's ideas about gender lead: to a grown man pummeling a woman in a boxing match,\" he declared.\n\n\"This is the purest form of evil unfolding right before our eyes,\" influencer and boxer Logan Paul posted on X. He then deleted his tweet.\n\n\"OOPSIES,\" he wrote in a follow-up message. \"I might be guilty of spreading misinformation along with the entirety of this app. .... I stand by my sentiment.\"\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Khelif calls for an end to 'bullying'\n\nThe boxer Sunday night called for an end to bullying of athletes and said the attack against her \"harms human dignity.\"\n\n\"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,\" Khelif said in Arabic in an interview, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"Let's be very clear here. We are talking about women's boxing,\" he said. \"We have two boxers who were born as women, who have been raised as women, who have passports as a woman, and who have competed for many years as women. And this is the clear definition of a woman. There was never any doubt about them being a woman.\"\n\nHe continued: \"What we see now is that some want to own the definition of who is a woman. And there I can only invite them to come up with a scientific-based new definition of who is a woman, and how can someone being born, raised, competed and having a passport as a woman, cannot be considered a woman?\"\n\nKhelif is indeed no stranger to international women's boxing, having competed at major tournaments over the past six years, including the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. She has won over 30 fights and lost 9 according to BoxRec, a website that tracks international boxing matches.\n\n\ud83d\udcac Carini apologizes\n\nCarini didn't shake Khelif's hand after quitting her match. She sank to her knees. \"I am heartbroken because I am a fighter,\" a tearful Carini said after the match, according to the Associated Press.\n\nOn Aug. 2, Carini apologized and said she would \"embrace\" Khelif if they met again.\n\n\"It wasn't something I intended to do,\" Carini told an Italian sports publication. \"Actually, I want to apologize to her and everyone else. I was angry because my Olympics had gone up in smoke.\"\n\nKhelif's father, Amar Khelif, told the Daily Mail that the attacks against his daughter \"are immoral, it is not fair.\"\n\nHe also spoke with Reuters in the Algerian city of Tiaret, showing an official-looking document with her birthday.\n\n\"This is our family official document, May 2, 1999, Imane Khelif, female. It is written here you can read it, this document doesn't lie,\" he said.\n\n\"Having such a daughter is an honor because she is a champion, she honored me and I encourage her and I hope she will get the medal in Paris,\" he said. \"Imane is a little girl that has loved sport since she was six-years-old.\"\n\n\ud83d\udc49 What's next\n\nKhelif's gold medal bout is Friday, 4:51 p.m. ET against China's Yang Liu.

Khelif has yet to lose one round on a judge's scorecard in her first three fights in Paris, going on the most dominant run of her boxing career while facing an extraordinary amount of scrutiny.\n\nIt stems from Khelif and fellow two-time Olympian Li Yu-ting of Taiwan getting disqualified from last year's world championships by the Russian-dominated International Boxing Association, which claims both fighters failed a murky eligibility test for women's competition.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee took the unprecedented step last year of permanently banning the IBA from the Olympics following years of concerns about its governance, competitive fairness and financial transparency. The IOC has called the arbitrary sex tests that the sport's governing body imposed on the two boxers irretrievably flawed.\n\nThe IBA did nothing to help its argument this week at a shambolic news conference in which its leadership contradicted itself about the tests and declined to answer basic questions about them, citing privacy concerns from the Olympic committees of Algeria and Taiwan.\n\nThe IOC has repeatedly reaffirmed the two boxers' right to compete in Paris, with President Thomas Bach personally defending Khelif and Lin while calling the criticism \"hate speech.\"\n\n\"We have two boxers who are born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman and have competed for many years as women,\" Bach said.\n\nThat hasn't stopped the international outcry tied to misconceptions around the fighters that has been amplified by Russian disinformation networks, but neither has it slowed the two.\n\nKhelif has dominated all three of her bouts, but she faces her most significant test in Yang, the 2023 world champion and the No. 2 seed in their weight class.\n\nKhelif told SNTV, a sport video partner of The Associated Press, that the wave of hateful scrutiny she has received \"harms human dignity,\" and she called for an end to bullying athletes. She also said a gold medal would be \"the best response\" to the backlash against her.\n\nThe crowds in Paris, however, have embraced both Khelif and Lin, who have heard nothing but cheers during their bouts. A huge contingent of flag-waving Algeria fans greeted and serenaded Khelif throughout her semifinal victory Tuesday night, and she's become a hometown hero in her North African country.\n\nKhelif has already secured Algeria's first Olympic medal in women's boxing. She will attempt to become only her country's second boxing gold medalist, joining Hocine Soltani (1996).\n\nThe gold medal fight is the culmination of Khelif's nine-day run through an Olympic tournament that began with a bizarre event. Khelif's first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, abandoned their bout after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nAn already brewing story suddenly became major international news, with the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump and \"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling weighing in with criticism and false speculation about men competing with women in sports. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni personally visited with Carini to share her condolences and to cast doubt on Khelif's eligibility.\n\nCarini later said she regretted her actions and wished to apologize to Khelif. The Italian newspaper La Stampa detailed Carini's mindset in the days leading up to the bout, describing pressure from both inside and outside her team to avoid the fight amid the growing speculation over Khelif's status.\n\nThe IBA later offered to pay winner's bonuses to Carini and the Italian Boxing Federation despite Carini's abandonment of the bout. The Italian federation and Carini both rejected the money from the IBA, which volunteered the payments to all Paris winners and their teams despite having nothing to do with the Olympics.\n\nLin also fights for a gold medal Saturday on the final card of the Olympics. She takes on Julia Szeremeta of Poland with a chance to win Taiwan's first boxing gold.\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greg_beacham@aol.com", "name": "Greg Beacham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Liu_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yang Liu (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bach", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Bach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hocine_Soltani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hocine Soltani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgia_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giorgia Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Stampa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Stampa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Khelif has yet to lose one round on a judge's scorecard in her first three fights in Paris, going on the most dominant run of her boxing career while facing an extraordinary amount of scrutiny.\n\nIt stems from Khelif and fellow two-time Olympian Li Yu-ting of Taiwan getting disqualified from last year's world championships by the Russian-dominated International Boxing Association, which claims both fighters failed a murky eligibility test for women's competition.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee took the unprecedented step last year of permanently banning the IBA from the Olympics following years of concerns about its governance, competitive fairness and financial transparency. The IOC has called the arbitrary sex tests that the sport's governing body imposed on the two boxers irretrievably flawed.\n\nThe IBA did nothing to help its argument this week at a shambolic news conference in which its leadership contradicted itself about the tests and declined to answer basic questions about them, citing privacy concerns from the Olympic committees of Algeria and Taiwan.\n\nThe IOC has repeatedly reaffirmed the two boxers' right to compete in Paris, with President Thomas Bach personally defending Khelif and Lin while calling the criticism \"hate speech.\"\n\nAlgeria's Imane Khelif gestures after defeating Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng in their women's 66 kg semifinal boxing match at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024, in Paris, France. (AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos)\n\n\"We have two boxers who are born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman and have competed for many years as women,\" Bach said.\n\nThat hasn't stopped the international outcry tied to misconceptions around the fighters that has been amplified by Russian disinformation networks, but neither has it slowed the two.\n\nKhelif has dominated all three of her bouts, but she faces her most significant test in Yang, the 2023 world champion and the No. 2 seed in their weight class.\n\nKhelif told SNTV, a sport video partner of The Associated Press, that the wave of hateful scrutiny she has received \"harms human dignity,\" and she called for an end to bullying athletes. She also said a gold medal would be \"the best response\" to the backlash against her.\n\nThe crowds in Paris, however, have embraced both Khelif and Lin, who have heard nothing but cheers during their bouts. A huge contingent of flag-waving Algeria fans greeted and serenaded Khelif throughout her semifinal victory Tuesday night, and she's become a hometown hero in her North African country.\n\nKhelif has already secured Algeria's first Olympic medal in women's boxing. She will attempt to become only her country's second boxing gold medalist, joining Hocine Soltani (1996).\n\nThe gold medal fight is the culmination of Khelif's nine-day run through an Olympic tournament that began with a bizarre event. Khelif's first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, abandoned their bout after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nAn already brewing story suddenly became major international news, with the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump and \"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling weighing in with criticism and false speculation about men competing with women in sports. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni personally visited with Carini to share her condolences and to cast doubt on Khelif's eligibility.\n\nCarini later said she regretted her actions and wished to apologize to Khelif. The Italian newspaper La Stampa detailed Carini's mindset in the days leading up to the bout, describing pressure from both inside and outside her team to avoid the fight amid the growing speculation over Khelif's status.\n\nThe IBA later offered to pay winner's bonuses to Carini and the Italian Boxing Federation despite Carini's abandonment of the bout. The Italian federation and Carini both rejected the money from the IBA, which volunteered the payments to all Paris winners and their teams despite having nothing to do with the Olympics.\n\nLin also fights for a gold medal Saturday on the final card of the Olympics.

She faces China's Liu Yang.\n\nA win would highlight a wild journey for Khelif. A dominant victory against Angela Carini sparked a heated discussion about Khelif's participation in the tournament after failing a gender eligibility test at the World Boxing Championships last year. However, Khelif has competed in international boxing competitions for many years in the women's category, including the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, International Boxing Association (IBA), World Championships, and IBA-sanctioned tournaments.\n\nThe International Boxing Association (IBA), which no longer governs Olympic boxing, has not released the results of the gender test or explained how it arrived at that conclusion.

Facing Yang Liu of China in the final bout, Khelif seeks to counter extensive online abuse and international scrutiny with her performance.

But, she faces her most significant test in Yang, the 2023 world champion and the No. 2 seed in their weight class.\n\nKhelif told SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, that the wave of hateful scrutiny she has received \"harms human dignity,\" and she called for an end to bullying athletes. She also said a gold medal would be \"the best response'' to the backlash against her.\n\nThe crowds in Paris, however, have embraced both Khelif and Lin, who have heard nothing but cheers during their bouts.\n\nA huge contingent of flag-waving Algeria fans greeted and serenaded Khelif throughout her semifinal victory Tuesday night, and she's become a hometown hero in her North African country.\n\nKhelif has already secured Algeria's first Olympic medal in women's boxing. She will attempt to become only her country's second boxing gold medalist, joining Hocine Soltani (1996).\n\nThe gold medal fight is the culmination of Khelif's nine-day run through an Olympic tournament that began with a bizarre event. Khelif's first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, abandoned their bout after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nAn already brewing story suddenly became major international news, with the likes of former US President Donald Trump and \"Harry Potter\" author JK Rowling weighing in with criticism and false speculation about men competing with women in sports.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni personally visited with Carini to share her condolences and to cast doubt on Khelif's eligibility.\n\nCarini later said she regretted her actions and wished to apologize to Khelif. The Italian newspaper La Stampa detailed Carini's mindset in the days leading up to the bout, describing pressure from both inside and outside her team to avoid the fight amid the growing speculation over Khelif's status.\n\nThe IBA later offered to pay winner's bonuses to Carini and the Italian Boxing Federation despite Carini's abandonment of the bout.\n\nThe Italian federation and Carini rejected the money from the IBA, which volunteered the payments to all Paris winners and their teams despite having nothing to do with the Olympics.\n\nLin also fights for a gold medal on Saturday on the final card of the Olympics.

Half of the prize money goes directly to the athlete, while the other half is split between the National Federation and for the coach.\n\nShould Khelif lose the bout, then she'll receive a prize of $50,000 (\u00a339,300), $25,000 of this will go to the athlete and the other half given to the coach and the National Federation combined.\n\nA third placed boxer receives $25,000 (\u00a319,600) total -- $12,500 of which goes to the athlete.\n\nThe money is awarded by the International Boxing Association (IBA), which could make things complicated for Khelif.\n\nPrior to the Olympics, Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu\u2011ting, had been disqualified from an IBA tournament in 2023 after failing unspecified gender eligibility tests. The IBA claimed that both Lin and Khelif have XY chromosomes, however, no test evidence has been released.\n\nLin has also reached the final in the women's featherweight division and will face-off against Poland's Julia Szeremeta on Saturday.\n\nKhelif has since issued a defiant statement in response to the online backlash, telling reporters: \"I don't care what anyone is saying about me with the controversy.\n\n\"All that is important to me is that I stay on the level and give my people the performance they deserve. I know I'm a talented person and this is a gift to all Algerians.\"\n\nKhelif's uncle Rachid Jabeur has also spoken out in support of his niece, telling BBC Arabic: \"Imane was born female and has lived as a female.\"", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LADbible"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Liu_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yang Liu (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_featherweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's featherweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/bltcd74acc1d0a99f3a/blt5f6c3dc1d133ec90/66b625c1ab13f8d97790aca8/imane-khelif-prize-money-gold.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798676", "eventUri": "eng-9798676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 259, "textEnd": 267}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Her Italian opponent, 25, quit the round-of-16 bout in Paris just 46 seconds in after she claimed Khelif threw the hardest punch of her career. Her emotional press conference sparked a global uproar, with many speculating over Khelif's gender.\n\nThe athlete, also 25, is a biological female and her father, Amar Khelif, has even gone as far as showing her birth certificate on television. It has, however, been reported that Khelif has a rare condition categorised as differences in sex development (DSD), which can result in female individuals having male chromosomes or anatomy.\n\nBreaking her silence on the matter, Khelif said earlier this week: \"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter. Refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects. It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\"\n\nHer statement came after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) spoke out to confirm that the gender of athletes is based on their passports. Spokesman Mark Adams said last week: \"Everyone competing in the women's category is complying with the competition eligibility rules. They are women in their passports and it's stated that this is the case, that they are female.\"\n\nThe Olympics marks Khelif's impassioned comeback after being disqualified from last year's World Boxing Championships after the IBA said she failed a gender eligibility test. The IBA claimed that the specifics of the test were confidential but did clarify that Khelif was not subject to a testosterone exam. Instead, she underwent a separate test in which the organisation deemed the boxer had competitive advantages over other women athletes.\n\nIBA president Umar Kremlev later said the tests \"proved they had XY chromosomes and were thus excluded\". Speaking about the setback, Khelif said: \"The year 2023 was very difficult for me after a great year... It was a hard blow for me but I came back stronger to show my strength and my determination and show the whole world what a brave woman Imane Khelif is.\"\n\nKhelif previously described her youth as \"really difficult\" in an interview on the Algerian TV channel Canal Algerie. She said: \"I come from a conservative region and family. Boxing was a sport dedicated only to men.\" She told of how she struggled to make ends meet and sold bread to pay for her travel to boxing training.\n\n\"These are obstacles that I encountered when I started. I happened to sell bread in the street, I collected dishes and other objects to earn money and to be able to move around because I came from a very poor family,\" Khelif said. But it was all worth it - because she \"fell in love\" with boxing as soon as she stepped into the ring for the first time.\n\nWith her determination to succeed, Imane moved out of her small Algerian village into the city and then the capital. She describes her career as an \"impressive story\" and is incredibly proud of her achievements.\n\nSpeaking about her journey, she said: \"It was pure chance, I never imagined one day that I would become a boxer and that I would become world champion. I have always loved football and I played it in my little village. My father always preferred football to boxing. But I was very good at sports in my school and my teacher encouraged me to become a boxer since I had good physical qualities and he was right.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter, Facebook , YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nia_dalton@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Nia Dalton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorders_of_sex_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disorders of sex development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chromosome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Testosterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33383007.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Boxing-Olympic-Games-Paris-2024-Day-6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798676", "eventUri": "eng-9798676", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

She wasn't particularly strong. Perhaps a bit angry but people get into this sport for different reasons,\" she explained.\n\nThe 37-year-old continued: \"I remember people commenting to me 'surely she's a man' and 'good on you for beating a man' and it angered me. Sure, it is easy to believe she is a man, she is masculine presenting, but who are we to judge her. Let her look however she wants.\n\n\"I won the fight. Her power was not any worse than any other female in the division,\" the Australian highlighted.\n\nThough Stridsman did say that it was 'time for a conversation about trans athletes in competitive sports', she said people have to be kind to Khelif.\n\n\"Do not judge before you have all the information at hand,\" the boxer stated.\n\nShe isn't the first former opponent to speak out in support of Khelif, with Irish boxer Amy Broadhurst also calling for the hate to stop as she has been 'beaten by nine females' in the past.\n\nKhelif is not the only boxer to have recently failed a gender test, as Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting also failed the test in 2023, with both reaching finals of their weight divisions at the Paris Olympics.\n\nAmidst all the criticism, Khelif spoke out against the controversy following her semi-final win, having mostly steered clear of the media since her opening fight.\n\nShe stated: \"I don't care what anyone is saying about me with the controversy.\n\n\"All that is important to me is that I stay on the level and give my people the performance they deserve. I know I'm a talented person and this is a gift to all Algerians.\"\n\nThe Algerian will face off against China's Liu Yang in the gold medal match in the welterweight division on Friday (9 August),

(Getty/Canva)\n\nAlgeria's Imane Khelif is set to fight for a gold medal in the women's boxing final at the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nThe Algerian welterweight has faced ongoing abuse on social media since beating Italy's Angela Carini last week.\n\nKhelif, who was deemed eligible to enter the women's boxing event by the International Olympic Committee, has come under scrutiny alongside Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting after being disqualified from the World Championships last year after failing to meet eligibility criteria.\n\nThe IOC has questioned the validity of the tests carried out by the International Boxing Association (IBA) at the time.\n\nKhelif made it to the gold-medal bout by beating Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng by a unanimous decision in her semi-final on Tuesday (6 August).\n\n\"I am focused,\" Khelif said afterwards. \"I am here for a good performance and my dream. I will give everything I have for the final. I am happy for all the support here in Paris. I want to thank all of the people of Algeria who came here.\"\n\nJanjaem Suwannapheng is a 23-year-old amateur boxer from Thailand. Competing in the 66kg welterweight category, she became the first athlete from the north-eastern province of Nong Khai to compete in the Games.\n\nLast year, she won a silver medal at the World Championships - losing to Khelif along the way, before the Algerian was disqualified - and eventually went on to qualify for Paris. She beat the Democratic Republic of Congo's Brigitte Mbabi and Turkey's Busenaz S\u00fcrmeneli before going out in the semi-finals.\n\nReaching the semi-finals guaranteed her a bronze medal, making her the only Thai boxer on the podium.\n\nAfter her defeat in Mondday's semi-final, Suwannapheng said had heard about the furore surrounding Khelif but \"wasn't following it closely.\"\n\nSuwannapheng went on to say: \"She is a woman but she is very strong. I tried to use my speed but my opponent was just too strong.\"\n\nKhelif will fight Yang Liu, from China, in the final on Friday (9 August), hoping to become Algeria's first female boxing gold medallist.\n\nIn an interview with Somalia news outlet SNTV, Khelif urged critics to \"uphold the Olympic principles\" and to stop bullying athletes.\n\n\"This has effects, massive effects,\" she said. \"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind.

You know, you're fighting a bloke', which, I think is quite ignorant and stupid,\" Stridsman told 7.30.\n\nShe says that Khelif in the last five years has improved dramatically from the boxer she was.\n\n\"I remember not being very impressed with her, thinking that she wasn't using her reach, you know, she didn't have a good jab,\" Stridsman said.\n\nSpeculation around Khelif's gender has led to a global debate with politicians and commentators weighing in.\n\nIn 2023, Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting were both disqualified from the 2023 Women's World Boxing Championships by the International Boxing Association (IBA), which claimed the pair had failed gender eligibility tests.\n\nWall Street Journal journalist Jared Diamond says there is not enough information about what tests were undertaken.\n\n\"We don't exactly know the validity of these gender tests,\" Diamond said.\n\n\"The IOC considers them illegitimate. We also know that these tests on Imane Khelif were done ... and the results came out days after she defeated a Russian boxer that had been undefeated before that, which is certainly curious timing in the eyes of many people.\"\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) withdrew its recognition of the IBA last year after it failed to implement reforms following its suspension in 2019 over governance issues and alleged corruption.\n\nFollowing the invasion of Ukraine, the IOC put further restrictions on Russia, forcing its athletes to compete as Individual Neutral Athletes.\n\nDiamond believes the governance issues at the IBA have prompted the IOC to wholly dismiss the organisation and its claims about Khelif and Lin.\n\n\"In the eyes of the IBA, they are not eligible to compete as women,\" he said.\n\n\"So the IBA is sort of using the fact that they are allowed to compete in the Olympics as further opportunity to sort of sow discord in the Games. And that's [what] we've known for months, years, really, that Russia was, let's say, unhappy with the Olympics, and would try to sort of sow that discord,\" he said.\n\nMillicent Agboegbulem is Australia's super welterweight champion and won a bronze medal at the 2018 Commonwealth Games. She has watched the unfolding drama and wants more clarity on Khelif's eligibility.\n\n\"In my years of boxing, I've never seen any woman punch as hard as the boxer [Khelif] I saw in the ring,\" Agboegbulem said.\n\nAs it stands, the IOC does not recognise a governing body for boxing at the Olympics and it's not yet known what the arrangements will be at the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games.\n\nIf the sport stays in the Games, some are calling for stricter rules around gender issues.

In her first three fights in the Paris Olympics, Khelif has yet to see a losing round from judges. The two fighters have faced widespread criticism over their gender identities.\n\nLast year, the two fighters were banned from the World Championships due to the International Boxing Federation, a Russian-dominated organization, claiming that they both previously failed a sex-verification tests. The federation did not provide further details on the testing, but many have questioned the boxers' gender throughout their ongoing Olympic Games.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced it was permanently banning the International Boxing Federation from future Olympic Games last year due to issues with its governance, transparency and fairness in competition. The sex-tests required by the International Boxing Federation have been criticized by the IOC and said that misgendering Khelif and Lin was \"so flawed that it's impossible to engage with it.\"\n\n\"There's a whole range of reasons why we won't deal with this,\" IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said earlier this month, The Associated Press (AP) reported. \"Partly confidentiality. Partly medical issues. Partly that there was no basis for the test in the first place. And partly data-sharing of this is also highly against the rules, international rules.\"\n\nIn response, the International Boxing Federation held a press conference this week where leaders declined to answer questions about the two boxers and offered contradicting responses to the tests.\n\nIOC President Thomas Bach previously expressed support for Khelif and Lin saying \"We have two boxers who are born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman and have competed for many years as women.\" Bach also called criticism against the two \"hate speech.\"\n\nWhile speaking with SNTV, a sports partner of The Associated Press (AP), Khelif spoke about the recent criticism she has faced saying \"This has effects, massive effects ... It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people.\"\n\nKhelif also said that winning a gold medal in the 2024 Paris Olympics would be the \"best response\" to the backlash she has faced.\n\nIn Paris, both Khelif and Lin have been met with overwhelming support, with the crowd offering nothing but cheers during their bouts. A large group of Algeria fans, waving flags and chanting, celebrated Khelif throughout her semifinal win on Tuesday night.\n\nKhelif will attempt to win Algeria's second gold medal in boxing on Friday evening, and with a win she would join the only other boxing gold medalist from the nation, Hocine Soltani, who won in 1996.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_impelli@newsweek.com", "name": "Matthew Impelli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bach", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Bach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hocine_Soltani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hocine Soltani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of the International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2446757/imane-khelif.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=4a1c588655a6c8197bcad1b78fd6d347", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798676", "eventUri": "eng-9798676", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nImane Khelif has fought her way to within one bout of Olympic gold, separated from glory by just nine minutes of combat in Paris. Yet she has been standing in the eye of a storm, as much as she has been standing in a boxing ring.\n\nSome might have first felt the swirl last week, when Angela Carini withdrew 46 seconds into her fight with the Algerian, tearfully saying she had \"never been hit so hard\" in her life. But the cumulus stage played out long before that controversial contest, which drew attention to Khelif's disqualification for allegedly failing a gender eligibility test at the 2023 World Championship. The origin of this particular tempest can be traced back to 2022.\n\nBecause, according to the International Boxing Association (IBA), it was in 2022 that Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting first returned adverse test results - two years before both claimed medals in Paris this summer. \"Blood tests were taken, a gender test was taken - as it was - during the Women's World Championship in 2022 in Istanbul,\" said the IBA's General Secretary and CEO, Chris Roberts, at a press conference on Monday (5 August). \"The blood tests were taken by a lab in Istanbul. The results that were brought out were inconsistent, further to which there's been a number of questions as to why.\"\n\nFurther to which, there were a number of questions as to why the IBA waited until the 2023 World Championship to follow up on this matter, despite the body's concerns and Lin clinching gold at featherweight.\n\nThe IBA did not have many sound answers to those questions, beyond that this is a complicated, sensitive issue. That much, admittedly, is true. And so the 2023 tournament rolled around, and \"both boxers were asked to take a further blood test\", as Roberts explained. \"The results came through, and it demonstrated the chromosomes that we referred to within the competition rules - that make both boxers ineligible.\"\n\nRoberts did not mention XY chromosomes, which relate to male biological development, but told reporters to \"read between the lines\". The face of IBA President Umar Kremlev, slightly stretched and pixelated, was beamed down from a big screen behind Roberts. In one of his many extended rants on Monday, the Russian said Khelif and Lin were also found to have \"very high\" levels of testosterone, despite a prior IBA statement saying neither boxer had been tested for that hormone.\n\nIn any case, Khelif, 25, and Lin, 28, were disqualified from the 2023 World Championships. Lin is said not to have appealed; Khelif did, per the IBA, but later withdrew her challenge. It remains unclear why.\n\nOverall, not the clearest communication by the controversial IBA, which is no longer recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and which ceased to organise boxing at the Olympics before the 2021 Games. The IOC, which itself oversaw boxing in Tokyo and has set up the Paris Boxing Unit to do so this month, parted ways with the IBA over concerns relating to the organisation's finances and links to Russia, and due to fears of corruption.\n\nThe IOC has hit out at the IBA's means of testing (although the specifics of the testing have been withheld) and is using passports to determine an athlete's sex. For all the criticism of the IBA, perhaps the body has a point in its counter-criticism of the IOC: that using a passport alone is a flawed method here.\n\nAnd the IBA's concerns over sporting fairness and fighter safety may even be valid. This is a complicated, sensitive topic, and conversations over fairness and safety are worth having. The issue is: almost no one is having these conversations, because the narratives around Khelif and Lin's Olympic campaigns have been hijacked, and dragged into the mire of wider culture wars. And among the verbal grenades, lobbed haphazardly over battle lines, are entirely unfounded allegations that Khelif is a transgender athlete.\n\nThat is despite Khelif having been, to all knowledge, born and raised as a woman and never having identified as transgender or intersex. The same applies to Lin. And somewhere in here lies the fact, trivial as it may seem, that Khelif and Lin have lost to fellow women a combined 23 times - and that both competed at the Tokyo Games without winning medals.\n\nIn any case, the most vicious region of this ever-spinning cyclone has seen Khelif and Lin wrongly accused of being men, fighting women. Among those spreading this sentiment were X owner Elon Musk and Harry Potter author JK Rowling.\n\nAnd it was always likely that the storm would intensify if either boxer secured a medal, and that a downburst could accompany a gold medal.\n\nKhelif has fought twice since Carini's withdrawal, which was followed by an apology from the Italian. The 25-year-old has beaten Luca Anna Hamori and Janjaem Suwannapheng via unanimous decision, winning both fights comfortably, her victories accompanied by further complaints from some corners.\n\nBefore facing Khelif, Hamori said she was \"not scared\" of the Algerian and shared a controversial image on Instagram - initially posted by another account - of a horned cartoon monster facing off with a female boxer.

Some people are wondering whether she should be competing in the Olympics at all.\n\nKhelif's performance at the 2024 Olympics has become a flashpoint in the discourse about allowing transgender athletes to compete in sports.\n\n\"Beating women is now a spectator sport,\" a July 30 post's text read. \"Why are the #Olympics allowing this male to enter the boxing ring with a woman?\"\n\n\"Imagine training your whole life, making (it) to the Olympics just to get your dreams literally smashed by some men!\" the caption said. \"Enough is enough.\"\n\nKhelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan have been deemed eligible to participate in women's boxing in the Paris Olympics, a decision that has drawn controversy and speculation, particularly after Italian boxer Angela Carini quit in a Thursday bout against Khelif after 46 seconds.\n\nSocial media users claimed that Khelif was a man because she was disqualified in a previous tournament. Russian state-controlled media quoted the president of the disqualifying boxing organization saying the results of a DNA test showed Khelif has XY chromosomes. Biological females typically have two X chromosomes (XX) and biological males typically have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).\n\nPublic figures such as former President Donald Trump, X owner Elon Musk and author J.K. Rowling amplified the claims that Khelif is a man.\n\nBut those claims lack context about Olympics eligibility requirements, the circumstances of Khelif's and Lin's previous disqualifications and the lack of information surrounding the DNA tests the International Boxing Association said it administered.\n\nThe claims that Khelif is not a woman are not substantiated. Khelif has always competed as a woman; she has never come out as transgender or intersex. \"The Algerian boxer was born female, was registered female, lived her life as a female, boxed as a female, has a female passport,\" International Olympic Committee spokesperson Mark Adams said in a Aug. 2 media briefing (14:34). \"This is not a transgender case.\"\n\n\"Scientifically, this is not a man fighting a woman,\" he said.\n\nAlgeria's Olympic Committee denounced the attacks against Khelif in an Aug. 1 statement, calling them \"malicious and unethical.\"\n\n\"These attempts at defamation, based on lies, are totally unfair, especially at a crucial time when she is preparing for the Olympic Games, the peak of her career. The COA (Le Comit\u00e9 Olympique et Sportif Alg\u00e9rien) has taken all necessary measures to protect our champion,\" the statement read.\n\nTaiwanese President Lai Ching-te's spokesperson supported Lin in an Aug. 1, X post.\n\nKhelif and Lin were disqualified at the 2023 Women's World Boxing Championships in New Delhi after they failed an eligibility test.\n\nThe Russian-led International Boxing Association, which organized the World Championships, said DNA tests showed the two athletes had XY chromosomes, according to a March 2023 statement from the president to Russian news agency Tass. But the International Boxing Association does not oversee qualification for the 2024 Olympics; the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit, set up by the International Olympic Committee, does.\n\nThe International Boxing Association was stripped of its Olympic recognition in 2023, because of a dispute involving its management, its finances and its judging integrity. In an Aug. 1 statement, the International Olympic Committee reiterated that the gender and age of athletes competing in boxing are based on their passports, as it has been with previous Olympics and with tournaments during the qualification period during 2023 and 2024.\n\n\"We have seen in reports misleading information about two female athletes competing at the Olympic Games Paris 2024. The two athletes have been competing in international boxing competitions for many years in the women's category,\" the statement read. \"These two athletes were the victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA. Towards the end of the IBA World Championships in 2023, they were suddenly disqualified without any due process.\"\n\nThe statement named neither Khelif nor Lin, but Adams read out that statement in an Aug. 2 press conference while fielding questions about the two athletes.\n\nBoth Khelif and Lin competed in the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nEligibility standards for boxing in the 2024 Paris Olympics are determined by an ad hoc unit the International Olympic Committee set up after it stopped recognizing the International Boxing Association.\n\nThe International Boxing Association appealed the committee's decision, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed the appeal, saying the association did not improve financial transparency and sustainability, has not ensured its integrity by changing its process involving referees and judges and has not reformed its governance.\n\nIn a July 31 statement addressing the controversy, the International Boxing Association said Khelif and Lin \"did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognized test, whereby the specifics remain confidential.\" The test, it said, showed the athletes have \"competitive advantages over other female competitors.\"\n\nThe International Boxing Association's board of directors meeting minutes from March 25, 2023, said that the board asked why the disqualification of the two athletes was being raised at the end of the championships after they had already gone through different tournament stages.

But I was very good at sports in my school and my teacher encouraged me to become a boxer since I had good physical qualities and he was right.\"\n\nGrowing up in a conservative area in Algeria, where it is illegal to transition gender and to be gay, Khelif explained that the people around her thought boxing was a sport only suitable for men.\n\n\"I come from a conservative region and family. Boxing was a sport dedicated only to men,\" she said of her \"difficult\" start.\n\nKhelif, who spoke movingly about coming from an impoverished background, said that even training as a boxer was challenging and she had to raise the money she needed to pay for training herself.\n\n\"These are obstacles that I encountered when I started,\" she said.\n\n\"I happened to sell bread in the street, I collected dishes and other objects to earn money and to be able to move around because I came from a very poor family.\"\n\nBut her perseverance paid off and she eventually moved to the Algerian capital before making a life for herself abroad as she pursued her sporting dreams.\n\nHowever, Khelif has faced new challenges over the past year because of what has been described as a \"medical condition\".\n\nThis saw her and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting disqualified from last year's World Championships at the eleventh hour because they did not meet gender eligibility criteria.\n\nReacting to her previous ban, Khelif said: \"The year 2023 was very difficult for me after a great year...\n\n\"It was a hard blow for me but I came back stronger to show my strength and my determination and show the whole world what a brave woman Imane Khelif is.\"\n\nCarini, who forfeited her Olympic dreams when faced with Khelif, said that she was left fearing for her life.\n\n\"I couldn't carry on,\" she later told reporters. \"I have a big pain in my nose and I said, 'Stop'. It's better to avoid keeping going. My nose started dripping from the first hit.\n\n\"It could be the match of my life but, in that moment, I had to safeguard my life, too. I felt to do this, I didn't have any fear, I don't have any fear of the ring or to get hit.\n\n\"I fought very often in the national team. I train with my brother. I've always fought against men, but I felt too much pain today.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, the International Olympic Committee has defended its decision to allow the women disqualified from the World Championships to compete.\n\n\"What I would say is that this involves real people and we are talking about real people's lives here,\" spokesperson Mark Adams said on Thursday.\n\n\"They have competed and they continue to compete in the women's competition. They have lost and they have won against other women over the years.\"\n\nWhile little is known about Khelif's medical history, the International Boxing Association's (IBA) president had previously claimed a test had shown she had XY chromosomes [male] and therefore did not meet their eligibility criteria.\n\nBut the presence of these chromosomes would not mean that Khelif is transgender. It has been speculated that she has differences in sex development (DSD) - the collective name for a series of rare conditions that causes a person to develop differently from what would be typically expected of their assigned sex.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trans woman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_verification_in_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex verification in sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_Semenya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caster Semenya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yu-ting", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lin Yu-ting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorders_of_sex_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disorders of sex development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_assignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex assignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chromosome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/bc0064ce3ac779e7dfcd8ee54bd1eb35", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798676", "eventUri": "eng-9798676", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Females, in contrast, have XX chromosomes.\n\nHowever, the governing body of the Olympic movement, the IOC, which has long been known to favour inclusivity over fairness given the option, has differing eligibility criteria.\n\nTo be eligible to compete in the female category at the Olympic Games, the information on an individuals passport must state they are female. No further proof of gender is required.\n\nKhelif's passport states she is female, as does Lin's.\n\nTherefore, both were permitted to fight in the female category.\n\nThe furore, which has centred on Khelif far more than Lin, began as soon as the Algerian set foot in the ring for her opening bout of Paris 2024.\n\nIn round one, she faced Italian fighter, Angela Carini. The bout lasted only 46 seconds, with the Italian voluntarily pulling out, which is extremely unusual in top-level boxing.Imane Khelif defeated Italy's Angela Carini in round one\n\nIn the aftermath of the fight, Carini said she'd \"never felt a punch like this\".\n\nFrom there, the torch paper was lit, with Khelif being accused of being a male fighting as a female, and the Algerian claimed she'd been on the receiving end of a barrage of abuse and threats .\n\nEven now, a week on, it remains unclear as to whether or not Khelif is definitively male or female.\n\nThere have been reams of conflicting information about Khelif bouncing around but, to cut a long and extremely complicated story short, it seems that the Algerian was born with XY (male) chromosomes but based on the observed external genitalia, was assigned female at birth, hence why she's a female on her passport.\n\nShe is not, as was claimed in the early days of the Olympic competition, a trans-woman, which would be a different conversation entirely.\n\nSo, given the information that's been made public - and not enough for everyone to agree on exactly what Khelif's situation is has been made public - Khelif was born with male chromosomes but her body \"looks\" female hence why she's fighting in the female category.\n\nThere are so many issues with this case that make me uncomfortable.\n\nThe first, and this is before we even get to question of which category Khelif shoud be fighting in, is why is this being played out on the Olympic stage?\n\nMany within boxing saw this controversy coming, so why on earth did the IOC not?\n\nThe IOC is, in so many ways, unfit for purpose, and this is yet another example of its failings.\n\nMidway through the Olympic Games is not the time for a conversation about Khelif's gender, and the gender eligibility rules, to take place.\n\nThe Olympic Games should be about sport and instead, the IOC has ensured much of the Paris 2024 boxing competition has been about gender.\n\nSecondly, if Khelif is, indeed, biologically male then of course she should not be fighting women.\n\nKhelif's case has many similarities with that of middle-distance runner, Caster Semenya, who was at the centre of a comparable gender controversy.\n\nThe major difference is that if Semenya competes in the wrong gender category then all that happens - and I use the word \"all\" in the loosest possible terms as I'm well aware of what victory and defeat mean on the Olympic stage - is that her opponents lose a running race.\n\nIn contrast, if Khelif is, indeed, competing unfairly as a women, she could, potentially, seriously harm or even kill her opponent.\n\nA man punching a woman in a boxing ring is an unspeakably dangerous scenario and so, if it's ultimately proven that Khelif should be fighting in the male category, the IOC have a raft of questions to answer as to why they let her enter the ring against women in Paris.\n\nThis conversation will not end with the final bell of the gold medal bout tonight.\n\nWhether Khelif departs Paris as Olympic champion or not, this gender controversy will remain a stain on Paris 2024, and one that has, in so many ways, been unfair to so many people.\n\nYet again, as happened with Semenya, this has become about one individual athlete and that, whichever side you're on, is unacceptable.\n\nClear and understandable rules need to be decided upon so that never again is a controversy like this played out on the Olympic stage. At Paris 2024, whoever departs as Olympic welterweight champion, no one has won in this.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chromosome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Taipei", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Taipei"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_Semenya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caster Semenya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-distance_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle-distance running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/18397741/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798676", "eventUri": "eng-9798676", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Khelif's participation at the Paris Olympics 2024 became a global debate after her bout against Angela Carini lasted just 46 seconds. The Italian boxer abandoned the match, which then led to a lot of misinformation about Khelif's gender, with many including, author JK Rowling and tech billionaire Elon Musk, calling her male.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) put no ear to the controversy and let the Algerian talent continue competing at the event. Recently, her uncle Rachid Jabeur addressed the topic and confirmed that Khelif was \"born female\".\n\nAs per a report by the BBC, a boxing coach first drew Khelif's attention to the sport after he saw her playing with a few kids on the street. When Khelif started her training, her father was against it as it could lead to a big issue in her conservative village. Her uncle, who was staying in a city, then came to her rescue. Initially, Khelif used to sell scrap copper to cover the expenses of her boxing training.\n\n\"We welcomed her into our home in the city, Tiaret, where we cared for her with special meals and sports training. We supported and encouraged her as part of our family. I always told my sons to accompany her to and from training sessions to protect her,\" Rachid Jabeur told BBC.\n\nAbout the gender row at the Paris Olympics, he said, \"She is always trying to overcome this bullying, and there are people around her who support her. She does not believe in defeat and does not care about these rumours.\"\n\nA few days ago, Thomas Bach, the President of the IOC, rubbished all of the claims of Imane Khelif being transgender or male. He said, \"We are talking about women's boxing. We have two boxers who were born as women, raised as women, who have passports as women and who have competed for many years as women and this is a clear definition of a woman.\"\n\nAmid the row, Imane Khelif has advanced to the final of the Paris Olympics. She triumphed over Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng in the women's 66kg semi-final.

You know, you're fighting a bloke', which, I think is quite ignorant and stupid,\" Stridsman told 7.30.\n\nShe says that Khelif in the last five years has improved dramatically from the boxer she was.\n\nSpeculation around Khelif's gender has led to a global debate with politicians and commentators weighing in.\n\nIn 2023, Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting were both disqualified from the 2023 Women's World Boxing Championships by the International Boxing Association (IBA), which claimed the pair had failed gender eligibility tests.\n\nWall Street Journal journalist Jared Diamond says there is not enough information about what tests were undertaken.\n\n\"We don't exactly know the validity of these gender tests,\" Diamond said.\n\n\"The IOC considers them illegitimate. We also know that these tests on Imane Khelif were done ... and the results came out days after she defeated a Russian boxer that had been undefeated before that, which is certainly curious timing in the eyes of many people.\"\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) withdrew its recognition of the IBA last year after it failed to implement reforms following its suspension in 2019 over governance issues and alleged corruption.\n\nFollowing the invasion of Ukraine, the IOC put further restrictions on Russia, forcing its athletes to compete as Individual Neutral Athletes.\n\nDiamond believes the governance issues at the IBA have prompted the IOC to wholly dismiss the organisation and its claims about Khelif and Lin.\n\n\"In the eyes of the IBA, they are not eligible to compete as women,\" he said.\n\n\"So the IBA is sort of using the fact that they are allowed to compete in the Olympics as further opportunity to sort of sow discord in the Games.

She has watched the unfolding drama and wants more clarity on Khelif's eligibility.\n\nAs it stands, the IOC does not recognise a governing body for boxing at the Olympics and it's not yet known what the arrangements will be at the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games.\n\nIf the sport stays in the Games, some are calling for stricter rules around gender issues.

Yet readers of most legacy news outlets are likely unaware of the key details.\n\n\"Boxer Imane Khelif dominant again, into gold medal bout,\" says an ESPN headline from Tuesday. The article goes on to say Khelif has faced \"scrutiny over misconceptions about her gender.\"\n\nThe AP used similar phrasing, headlining a story \"Olympic boxer Imane Khelif calls for end to bullying after backlash over gender misconceptions.\"\n\nWhile there are some \"misconceptions\" about Khelif - this situation is bizarre and inherently confusing - the outlets are burying the lede.\n\nNowhere in the stories mentioned do the outlets mention some very basic facts about Khelif; facts critical to the story.\n\nAccording to the International Boxing Association (IBA) Khelif failed a genetic test and has XY chromosomes. Khelif likely tested for XY chromosomes due to a condition known as DSD (difference in sex development) that naturally causes elevated testosterone.\n\nKhelif's male chromosomes are an obvious edge over female fighters. That's a pretty important detail to omit, is it not?\n\nOutlets like ESPN and the AP grossly misrepresent the story by not telling readers about Khelif's failed test and chromosomes. The legacy media's coverage of the story is shameful, as is the case for far too many polarizing topics.\n\nEarlier this week, the AP blamed the outrage on \"racism and slavery.\" Yes, you read that correctly. NBC, the network carrying the Olympics in America, has also failed to provide viewers the full context of Khelif's situation. \"The Daily Show\" blamed the controversy on \"right-wing culture warriors,\" claiming Khelif is \"just another woman.\"\n\nIt's all a game of deception.\n\nThe story is not that people may have used the wrong terminology to describe Khelif, racism, sexism, or right-wing politics.

However, despite many baseless claims online, the Algerian has never identified as transgender or intersex.\n\nIn any case, Khelif's victories in Paris - including her 46-second win over Italy Carini, who withdrew from their fight and broke down in tears - have proven controversial.\n\nOn Friday night (9 August), Khelif boxes for gold against China's Liu Yang, and before that fight, Stridsman spoke to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation about her own experience in the ring with Khelif.\n\nAustralia's Stridsman, a 2018 Commonwealth Champion who beat Khelif on points in 2019, said: \"I do remember people saying to me: 'Oh, she looks like a bloke,' you know? 'You're fighting a bloke,' which I think is quite ignorant and stupid.\n\n\"I remember not being very impressed with her, thinking that she wasn't using her reach, you know? She didn't have a good jab,\" Stridsman said, before adding that Khelif has improved since they fought.\n\nPer the Daily Mail, reporting from Australia, Stridsman also said: \"She wasn't particularly strong.

Team MAGA will continue to demonize, denigrate and degrade the transgender community to the bitter end, across the country and right here in River City.\n\nLatest case in point: Female Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who will fight China's Liu Yang for the gold medal in the welterweight division at the Paris Olympics this Friday.\n\nLast week, Khelif advanced to the semifinals after Italian boxer Angela Carini withdrew from the match 46 seconds into the first round. Khelif landed a solid left jab to Carini's face and the Italian retreated to her corner, where her coach adjusted her headgear. When she returned to the center of the ring, Khelif landed a solid overhand right to Carini's head and the Italian abruptly quit the fight.\n\nCarini complained that her nose hurt and she'd never been punched so hard. A review of the short fight reveals that Khelif landed several solid blows shortly before Carini exited, but nothing spectacular, no blows with Leon Spinks-ish knockout power. There are no welts on Carini's face, her nose appears intact and there's no blood.\n\nBut here's the deal. Khelif, 25, was born a female, raised a female and has boxed in the female amateur ranks for nearly a decade. Nevertheless, last year at the International Boxing Association World Championships, Khelif was disqualified mid-tournament after the IBA claimed she didn't meet the eligibility requirements for female competition.\n\nThe disqualification came after Khelif defeated a Russian opponent, and perhaps not coincidentally, the IBA has been banned from the Olympics as a sanctioning agency for alleged corrupt practices that include ties to Russian oligarchs and the Kremlin.\n\nWhat female requirements Khelif didn't meet has never been specified by the IBA. Last year, one IBA official claimed a test revealed Khelif has XY chromosomes, more typical for males, as opposed to XX chromosomes, more typical in females.\n\nEarlier this year the IBA rescinded that claim and an allegation Khelif failed a testosterone test, stating the results are confidential. The truth is, no one outside of the IBA knows for certain.\n\nBut no matter. Khelif's seemingly easy defeat of Carini sparked an immediate social media firestorm as thousands of anti-trans posters, a la Austin Powers in the 1990s comedy film, raced to out Khelif to the online world: \"It's a man, baby!\"\n\nThose posters included such luminaries as \"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling, X owner Elon Musk, and former president Donald Trump.\n\nTo be certain, Imane Khelif has androgynous qualities. At 5'10\" and 145 pounds, she is stick-slender, like many boxers who have to diet to compete in their respective weight divisions.\n\nWith her short-cropped black hair (sometimes streaked with blond) and angular facial features she might be mistaken for a man by strangers.\n\nNevertheless, Khelif is a woman, as recognized by the International Olympic Committee, her boxing peers, and her family and friends back home in Algeria.\n\nIt's possible (though not by any means proven) that Khelif has some differences of sexual development, a medical term that refers to a vast array of conditions known to the public by the catch-all word, intersex.\n\nFor example individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome can be born with XY chromosomes, a clitoris, a vagina, breasts, undescended testes and testosterone levels higher than the female average. They are generally raised as females.\n\nCaster Semenya, the female South African middle distance runner who won the gold in the 800 meters at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, was born with a similar intersex condition known as 5?-Reductase 2 deficiency.\n\nShe has XY chromosomes, a clitoris, a vagina, undescended testicles and male levels of testosterone. Semenya, who was raised as a female, was required to take medication to reduce her testosterone levels in order to compete in both Olympics. The medicine, which she described as poison, made her quite sick, but she still managed to win two gold medals.\n\nNo one knows if Khelif has differences of sexual development; the results of the IBA test have never been publicly released and are tainted in advance, thanks to that organization's alleged corruption.\n\nKhelif is definitely not a trans female, since their very existence is banned in her home country. But that hasn't stopped Rowling, Musk, Trump and the MAGAverse from piling on the Algerian boxer, particularly on Musk's social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nLacking any scientific evidence, their allegations that Khelif is a man competing against women seems to be entirely based on the boxer's androgynous appearance. This is a disturbing social media trend that currently cuts across all women's sports.\n\nMany female athletes have long been pressured by the male gaze to not only excel at their sport but to look beautiful doing it. Social media merely amplifies this rancid misogyny.\n\nFor example, basketball phenom Caitlin Clark's demolition of the NCAA scoring record for women and men and her rise to the WNBA is arguably the biggest sports story of the year. But that's not enough for some men, and it usually is men who harsh on Clark's looks online.\n\nLike Khelif, the six-foot-zero, 154-pound Clark is tall, slender and androgynous. The basketball prodigy plays like a guy because her skills were next-level from grade school on, so she grew up practicing against the boys. The training regime worked to spectacular effect. She's now the white female analog of Steph Curry. She's glorious to watch.\n\nBut Clark's detractors can't see the beauty when she swishes a three-pointer from virtually anywhere outside the line on her side of the court. They don't chuckle when she befuddles taller players with the crossover dribble and no-look passes. These joyless weirdos have only one thing on their mind: tearing down successful females.\n\nTherefore the many social media posts about Clark proclaiming, \"she's a man, baby!\"\n\nUSA Rugby women's team member Ilonah Maher knows the territory. She's 5'10,\" 200 pounds and a formidable tackler on the field. She helped USA Rugby win a bronze medal in the Olympic Women's 7 in Paris last week.\n\nMaher is equally famous on TikTok as a body positive influencer, where she's been posting her often humorous reflections on gender since the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Despite her successes since then, online trolls still reduce her to tears sometimes, as she shared last week.\n\nWhile no one in the reality-based community has ever officially challenged Clark and Maher's gender, in the MAGAverse they're often lumped together with androgynous female boxers like Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, who was also disqualified at the 2023 IBA World Championships, and transgender female American swimmer Lia Thomas.\n\nThe anti-trans community remembers Thomas as the \"fully intact male\" swimmer who won the women's 500-meter freestyle at the 2022 NCAA championships. What they don't mention is shortly thereafter Thomas, and all transgender female swimmers who have gone through puberty as males, were banned from competition by the International Swimming Federation.\n\nThis pattern has been repeated just about every time a transgender female athlete wins her division or event. When two transgender female high school athletes dared to qualify for the California state track and field championship last year, they were forced to withdraw after violent threats to their lives.\n\nLocally, transphobic Christian Nationalist public officials such as Shasta County Board of Education trustee Authur Gorman and Anderson Union High School District president Jackie LaBarbera claim they won't follow laws -- like AB 1955 -- designed to protect LGBTQ kids.\n\nThat's the SAFETY act, AKA the forced outing law passed last month that prevents school boards from implementing policies that require administrators, teachers and staff to out LGBTQ students, especially transgender students, against their will.\n\nLaBarbera, Gorman, Rowling, Musk, Trump and his MAGA minions want us to believe, with no evidence, that woke public school teachers are grooming students and changing their gender identities and sexual orientations.\n\n\"They're coming for our children!\" is their frequent panicked refrain. We're sure to be hearing more of it as Shasta County gears up for the November election, which includes more than 60 local school board seats.\n\nIn reality, no one is coming for our children. The truth is that a small percentage of people -- less than two percent of the population -- are born with differences of sexual development. An even smaller percentage is born with gender dysphoria that results in an incongruence between gender identity and the sex given an birth.\n\nImane Khelif is not some sort of female Mike Tyson who has ripped through the amateur female boxing ranks with an endless string of first-round knockouts. Her record stands at 38 wins, 9 losses, including a loss to Ireland's Amy Broadhurst for the 2022 IBA World Championship in the welterweight division.\n\nIn that fight, the 5'8\" Broadhurst overcame Khelif's height and reach advantage by keeping her defenses up and working inside, tagging Khelif with combinations to the body and the head. The strategy paid off when the majority of the 5 judges awarded the world championship to Broadhurst for scoring the most points in the three-round bout.\n\nThis Friday's gold medal match in the welterweight division pits Khelif against China's Liu Yang. She's 32 and like Khelif, 5'10\" tall.

There's no indication she identifies as transgender.\n\nOpponent Angela Carini of Italy quit after just 46 seconds in Thursday's bout.\n\nCarini and Khelif had only a few punch exchanges before Carini abandoned it, an extremely unusual occurrence in Olympic boxing. Carini's headgear apparently became dislodged twice before she quit.\n\nCarini refused to shake Khelif's hand after the decision was announced, and she cried in the ring before leaving.\n\nAfterward, a still-tearful Carini said she quit because of intense pain in her nose after the opening punches. Carini, who had a spot of blood on her trunks, said she wasn't making a political statement and was not refusing to fight Khelif.\n\n\"I felt a severe pain in my nose, and with the maturity of a boxer, I said 'enough,' because I didn't want to, I didn't want to, I couldn't finish the match,\" Carini said.\n\nKhelif is an accomplished amateur who won a silver medal at the International Boxing Association's 2022 world championships.

Celebrities including JK Rowling and Judy Murray reacted furiously to her participation in the competition.\n\nThe IOC later reversed its decision and allowed both fighters to compete in the women's category at the Games, citing the fact that Khelif and Yu-ting are both listed as female in their passports.\n\nFormer Team GB Olympian Sharron Davies has warned that female boxers could be 'killed' in the ring if athletes who fail the gender test are allowed to continue competing\n\nAlgeria's Imane Khelif (blue) is at the centre of a controversial gender row at the Olympics\n\nTaiwanese fighter Lin Yu-ting is also involved in the gender row after he was banned from the International Boxing Association World Championships last year for allegedly failing a gender test.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nDefeated Italian boxer Carini previously claimed she had pulled out of her match against Khelif out of fear for her safety. Now former Olympic gold and silver medallist Davies has issued similar warnings.\n\nThe 61-year-old boxer said at a press conference on Thursday: 'It is insane to put a man in a ring with a woman in boxing and for the IOC to say that the only thing that matters to them is the information in the passport is pure neglect.\n\n'The duty of care has been thrown out the window and my head wants to explode...\n\n\"We're literally at the point where a female athlete could potentially be killed if we're not careful. It's just that bad.\"\n\nOther boxers competing in the Games have expressed their concerns and feelings of injustice in more cryptic ways. For example, Turkey's Esra Yildiz, who was defeated by Yu-Ting, made an \"X\" sign with her fingers, just as the Taiwanese boxer's Bulgarian opponent had done in the previous match.\n\nItalian boxer Angela Carini (pictured) was devastated after being defeated by Khelif in just 46 seconds\n\nImane Khelif (left) and Yu-Ting (right) both secured medals at the Olympic Games\n\nSome female contestants, such as Svetlana Staneva, made an 'X' gesture after losing to Yu Ting\n\nMany believe that the single 'X' symbol refers to the fact that male chromosomes are denoted by an X and a Y,

avoidable\".\n\n\"Boxing is the sport with the greatest gender inequality, with men hitting 162 percent harder than women,\" Blade said.\n\n\"The potential harm to women from being assaulted by an

But the 25-year-old boxer's time in Paris has become the latest focus of a global debate about gender and competition eligibility.\n\nThe controversy was first reignited following Khelif's win over Italy's Angela Carini. After 46 seconds in the Olympic ring with Khelif, Carini tapped out. \"A punch hurt too much, and so I said enough,\" Carini told reporters after the match. In most events, this would be a celebrated win. But because Khelif -- and fellow women's boxer, Lin Yu-Ting -- allegedly \"failed\" the International Boxing Association's gender eligibility testing, her blowout win over Carini reignited a debate over biology, genetics and fairness in athletics. It's also set off a firestorm of misinformation about her gender and eligibility to compete in the Olympics.\n\n\ud83d\udd0e What started the controversy?\n\nIBA president Umar Kremlev claimed last year that \"it was proven they have XY chromosomes\" (which are typically associated with males) during the organization's testing. But neither the results, nor the names of the tests have been made public. The International Olympic Committee did not consider the tests conducted by the IBA -- which is no longer the governing body of Olympic boxing -- in its eligibility assessments. But that hasn't stopped rumors about Khelif and Lin from circulating online.\n\nKhelif, who competed in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and other women's tournaments, does not identify as either transgender or intersex, according to a statement from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD).\n\n\ud83e\uddec Khelif reportedly has a variation in her sex traits.\n\nSeveral outlets have said that Khelif may have a developmental sex difference (DSD), sometimes referred to as disorders of sexual development, though she hasn't commented publicly.\n\nThese are a wide array of rare conditions in which someone's genitalia, reproductive organs and other characteristics may be \"mismatched\" with their genetics, according to the Cleveland Clinic. In some cases, that means that people are born with what are typically considered as male chromosomes -- one X and one Y chromosome -- but outwardly have female characteristics, including a vulva. Or people with these conditions may be born with female chromosomes (XX) and a penis.\n\nFalse online claims about Lin's and Khelif's bodies have misrepresented how the condition can affect anatomy. Having a DSD can mean a wide variety of things in terms of how a person's body develops. \"The reason why the [intersex] athletes we're talking about would have been recorded as being female at birth will probably be because that decision was based on outward genitalia,\" which look like those of a typical female, says Williams. \"In some cases, they could be quite different internally; they may or may not have a cervix, they may have internal testes, instead of ovaries, depending on the type of DSD.\"\n\nFor example, women and girls with Swyer syndrome typically have a uterus and fallopian tubes. Some have ovaries that may not function properly, or instead have internal testes. Still others have completely normal internal reproductive systems, according to the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\ud83d\udcca How common is this?\n\nAlthough these conditions are rare -- estimates range from a fraction of a percent to nearly 2% of the population -- there are likely \"thousands\" of people with DSDs worldwide, Alun Williams, a professor of sport and exercise genomics at the Manchester Metropolitan University Institute of Sport, tells Yahoo Life. But there are so many different specific conditions and physiologies that fall under this umbrella term that \"almost no two individuals are the same,\" he says.\n\n\u2640\ufe0f Khelif and Lin are not transgender.\n\nThere's no evidence that Khelif or Lin are anything other than cisgender women, and people with DSDs are not transgender. They are often described as intersex (although Khelif does not identify by this term, according to GLAAD), or as having a variety of sex traits. Unlike someone who is transgender, an intersex person has not gone through any form of transition; they were simply born with some male characteristics -- typically unseen ones, including their chromosomes -- and some female characteristics, which are often the outward, visible ones.\n\nBeing intersex and being transgender \"are really quite different situations,\" says Williams. Female transgender athletes \"are, at birth, male, and then go through some transition later in life,\" he adds. In many cases, intersex people go their entire lives without knowing that they have a DSD, as was the case for South African track star, Caster Semenya, who discovered she has Y chromosome as the result of competition testing.\n\n\u2696\ufe0f Do female athletes with DSDs have an unfair advantage?\n\n\"It's not at all clear that athletes who happen to have DSD conditions have a performance advantage over others,\" Roger Pielke, a professor of sports governance and the University of Colorado, Boulder, tells Yahoo Life.\n\nOne study suggested that higher testosterone levels in intersex athletes were linked to better performance than other female athletes, but it was controversial and not definitive. And Williams says there haven't been many other high-quality studies of intersex people across various sports. However, \"adult levels of testosterone can be associated with athletic advantage when acting on some tissues (like muscle) with the result that some advocate for using testosterone levels to assess eligibility for the female category in certain sports,\" Dr. Joshua Safer, executive director of the center for transgender medicine and surgery at Mount Sinai Health System, tells Yahoo Life.\n\nDifferences in testosterone may make a bigger difference in athletics that involve a lot of upper body \"power movements,\" including boxing, says Williams. Chromosomes and other so-called gender tests aren't the answer, experts say. \"But when you get to contact sports like rugby or combat sports like boxing, you are introducing extra safety risk,\" rather than just questions of competitive advantage in sports like track or swimming, Williams says.\n\n\ud83e\udd4a Now what?\n\nThe IOC has stood by its decision that Khelif is eligible to compete in women's boxing. The organization said in an Aug. 1 statement that there's nothing in its framework to disqualify either Khelif or Lin, and later called the IBA's tests \"cobbled together\" during a press conference. Despite her loss in the boxing match against Khelif, Carini was apologetic for not shaking her opponent's hand, according to the Italian sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport. \"All this controversy makes me sad,\" Carini said. \"I'm sorry for my opponent too.\" She added that she respected the IOC's decision and would \"embrace\" Khelif if she saw her again.\n\nBoth Khelif and Lin won their quarterfinal bouts. Lin will fight in the finals against Julia Szeremeta of Poland on Saturday. Khelif will face off against China's Yang Liu for a gold medal Friday evening.\n\nThis article was originally published on Aug. 2, 2024 and has been updated.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links;

On Wednesday, August 7, Oumayma Belahbib, a Moroccan boxer, filed a complaint for \"electronic harassment\", \"insult\", \"death threats\", and \"defamation\", according to a police source cited by the French newspaper Le Parisien.\n\nBelahbib confirmed to the same newspaper that she has received numerous hate messages and threats on social media from users accusing her of orchestrating the controversy surrounding Imane Khelif.\n\nSince the start of the Olympic Games in Paris, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif's gender identity has been a subject of intense public scrutiny. Many have accused her of being a \"man\" or \"transgender\" following her swift knockout of Italian rival Angela Carini during their fight on Thursday, August 1.\n\nThe controversy was further fueled by Khelif's disqualification from the World Boxing Organization (WBO) World Boxing Championships after a 2023 International Federation gender test. Khelif was found to have \"high levels of testosterone\", while Taiwan's Lin Yu Ting did not meet \"eligibility criteria\" after a biochemical test.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not recognize these tests and permitted both boxers to participate to the Paris Olympic Games. IOC spokesman Mark Adams confirmed on Friday that Imane Khelif was \"born a woman, registered as a woman, and lives her life as a woman\".\n\nCyber harassment : More than 200 hate messages daily\n\nBelahbib, a 27-year-old Moroccan who resides in France and is also a member of the International Boxing Federation's athletes' committee, has reported receiving thousands of threatening and insulting messages on social media -- \"more than 200 per day\" -- since August 1, the day of the match between Khelif and Carini. She added that some of these messages included \"violent content\" featuring her identity and face.\n\nBelahbib, who did not qualify for the Olympics, feels she is being used as a \"scapegoat\". She stated, \"I am accused of being the cause of the conspiracy against Imane because I am her rival, because I am Moroccan, and because I am a member of the International Boxing Federation. It's an issue between these two boxers (Khelif and Carini), and I'm in the middle. I didn't receive any support\", she lamented.\n\nIn addition to social media backlash, Algerian media outlets have published several incendiary articles against the Moroccan boxer. The newspaper Awras accused her, along with \"other influential members of Moroccan nationality\", of leading the \"rabid campaign against Imane\".\n\nAlgerian media have frequently blamed Morocco for every sporting failure in Algeria.

It was an emotional moment for the Algerian not just in terms of her sporting achievement but because she had spent the past week embroiled in a misinformation storm.\n\nKhelif - who is now guaranteed at least a silver medal after her victory over Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng - was labelled as transgender in several viral social media posts, an inaccuracy which was then parroted by some news organisations and politicians. Khelif is neither transgender nor identifies as intersex.\n\nMuch of the recent viral outrage at Khelif's Olympic success stemmed from a claim by the Russian-led International Boxing Association in 2023 that she and fellow boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan had failed certain gender tests. These tests have never been published and are, as of today, unverified. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) revoked the IBA ruling, stating the decision was \"arbitrary\", \"sudden\" and \"taken without any proper procedure\".\n\nThe disqualification resulting from the IBA tests also apparently came after Khelif beat a Russian prospect at an IBA event.\n\nThere have been mixed reports over the content of the apparently secret gender testing, with IBA president Umar Kremlev claiming in a chaotic press conference that the pair had high levels of testosterone while the organisation's chief executive alleged these were actually chromosome tests. Even beyond the lack of cohesion and clarity, the issue with sex testing itself is that every version collapses under scrutiny because most sports are organised according to a strict male-female binary, while nature does not follow such a binary - sex is more complex than that.\n\nThe IBA does not oversee Olympic boxing. Their credibility was seriously damaged in recent years following longstanding accusations of a lack of transparency and poor governance. They were finally suspended as boxing's governing body and stripped of involvement in the Olympic games. Neither the IOC nor World Boxing endorse the ruling made by the IBA.\n\nThe IBA has close links to Vladimir Putin and Russia, a country which has been involved in massive misinformation campaigns around the Olympic games because their athletes were not allowed to compete under the Russian flag.\n\nAccording to AP, Russian bots have been responsible for amplifying the Khelif controversy. The story was soon picked up by voices with huge followings, including billionaire X owner Elon Musk. It travelled beyond social media, with several news organisations and politicians wrongfully asserting that Khelif is transgender. US-based newspaper The Boston Globe were forced to issue an apology for labelling Khelif as transgender in one of their headlines. Fox News also labelled her as a transgender boxer live on air, while host Ainsley Earhardt wrongly described her as someone who identifies as a trans woman. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump repeated these false claims.\n\nThe dangers of misinformation have been well-documented in the age of social media but are as relevant as ever in sewing division. Fake news spreading on social media sites is currently fuelling a number of political agendas and was cited as one of the catalysts for the far-right Islamophobic and anti-immigration riots in the UK.\n\nBBC disinformation correspondent Marianna Spring, who deals with such viral mistruths on a daily basis, told Index in February that the unregulated spread of misinformation can cause real-world harm, so it's crucial in a free society to call it out.\n\n\"If you are being repeatedly hounded or abused online, your freedom of expression is compromised,\" she explained. \"What I'm doing is exposing the harm these extremist truths can cause rather than policing what people can say.\"\n\nKhelif herself has been subjected to hate and abuse on a huge scale, as has Yu-ting, who is also competing at the games and is guaranteed a medal. IOC president Thomas Bach condemned the narrative surrounding the two athletes, calling it \"politically motivated\".\n\n\"All this hate speech, with this aggression and abuse, and fuelled by this agenda, is totally unacceptable,\" he said during a news briefing.\n\nEven more worryingly, these allegations could have had serious consequences when you consider that in Algeria - Khelif's home country - being transgender is illegal.\n\nThere are legitimate questions in a free society to be raised around gender in sport and the IOC's Framework on Fairness, Inclusion and Non-discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sex variations was criticised by some international sports medicine bodies in 2022. No one should be silenced for asking these questions or having the conversation.\n\nBut the heat around Khelif has not been about asking questions. Instead the issue here is one of jumping to conclusions. What could have been a heartwarming story of a woman finding sporting success against all odds became a cautionary tale of the dangers of misinformation and the speed at which unchecked information or false claims can be spread on social media platforms, endangering people's lives and distorting reality. Who wins the gold medal here?

(Fabio Bozzani/Anadolu/ Getty Images)\n\nItalian Olympian Angela Carini's heartbreaking boxing match is just the latest indication of how dangerous the Biden-Harris Title IX rewrite will be for women.\n\nThe 25-year-old female boxer from Naples, Italy, withdrew from her Aug. 1 boxing match after only 46 seconds and two hits from Algeria's Imane Khelif.\n\nControversy over the inclusion of Khelif arose well before the Olympic match. The boxer was disqualified from the 2023 International Boxing Association Women's World Boxing Championships after failing two gender eligibility tests. They didn't identify which tests, but they did say it was not a test for testosterone levels. That strongly suggests that at least one of the tests revealed that Khelif has male-typical XY chromosomes.\n\nPiecing together other reports, it's likely that Khelif has 5-alpha reductase deficiency. As a result, the external genitalia would not have fully masculinized and could have been mistaken as a female at birth. But the boxer has testes, with the testosterone levels of a male, a body that responds to the hormone like a male, especially during puberty.\n\nIn other words, despite having a disorder of sexual development, Khelif otherwise enjoys the very advantages that justify female-only competitions. Indeed, it would be foolish to ignore those biological advantages. Carini confirmed that when she told interviewers after the match that she had never felt a punch like that.\n\n\"I started to feel a strong pain in my nose,\" she explained. \"I didn't give up, but a punch hurt too much and so I said, 'Enough.' I'm leaving with my head held high.\"\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) responded to critics via a statement on X. It said that all athletes participating in the boxing tournament complied with eligibility standards and medical regulations set by the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit.\n\nThe IOC failed to acknowledge that its decision to allow Khelif to compete violates its own Framework on Fairness, Inclusion, and Non-Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity and Sex Variation.\n\nIt's in that framework that the IOC explicitly states that \"the physical, psychological, and mental well-being of athletes should be prioritized when establishing eligibility criteria.\" It leaves to question whether the IOC chose to ignore the physical well-being of female boxers when they opted to allow two biological men, Khelif and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan, to participate in the Paris 2024 boxing competition.\n\nIn this case, a group of scientists already uncovered the answer for the committee.\n\nPhiladelphia University researchers used sensors to determine the average force of a punch for male boxers weighing about 66 kilograms (145 lbs.), the weight class of Carini and Khelif. They found males at that weight deliver punches with a force ranging from 932 newtons to 1,149 newtons. That's equivalent to the force of a small motorcycle.\n\nAs if that were not reason enough to question male participation in female boxing matches, a University of Utah study found that males can deliver punches with 162% more force than females. Males have 75% more muscle mass than their female counterparts.\n\nAllowing men to compete against women in elite sports is always unjust. But in boxing, where the differences between males and females are so vast, and the risks so high, it borders on criminal.\n\nThese biological, science-backed differences may explain why this boxing match felt different to Carini, or at least why she experienced severe pain in her nose.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni quickly responded in support of Carini's decision to end the match.\n\nThis problem is not limited to this summer's Olympic boxing spectacle It has become the new norm for some American athletes after the Biden-Harris overhaul of Title IX went into effect on Aug. 1\n\nMales who \"identify as women\" are now protected by law against discrimination in women's spaces, sports, and scholarships after the definition of sex was expanded to include gender identity.\n\nThis new interpretation requires educational institutions and programs that receive federal funding to comply with the Department of Education's redefinition. That leaves many biological women like Carini at a scientific disadvantage.\n\nBut this isn't just about the opportunities and scholarships that are already being taken away from women. Some lawmakers are concerned for their health and safety.\n\nLawmakers have already challenged the regulation, arguing the Biden-Harris administration's redefinition of sex greatly oversteps its legal authority and conflicts with state laws that govern their public schools.\n\nAfter legal debate, the 11 U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an injunction to temporarily block it from going into effect in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. Federal courts have enjoined the changes in 26 states. That's a huge win for female athletes.\n\nBe it local varsity teams or the Olympics, lawmakers who support legislation like the Biden-Harris administration's reinterpretation of Title IX risk discouraging generations of women from becoming exceptional, equal members of society.\n\nCarini's refusal to compete against a man with XY chromosomes forced the world to acknowledge the true victims of this woke ideology; namely, women.", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Signal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristen_eichamer@dailysignal.com", "name": "Kristen

The former middleweight champion, known for his lethal striking and quick wit, faced against the spread of misinformation. The target? Algerian Olympic boxer Imane Khelif, a rising star caught in a whirlwind of controversy.\n\nIsrael Adesanya, who found himself in hot water, recently issued a heartfelt apology to Algerian Olympic boxer Imane Khelif. Adesanya's apology comes after he shared misleading information about Khelif on social media. The controversy stemmed from confusion surrounding Khelif's eligibility to compete in women's boxing at the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"I don't like to get triggered and when something triggers me, I'm a fighter, I saw the news or articles and I was like, 'Why they letting a trans person [fight women]' and then I find out later she wasn't actually a trans [person]. So to the lady, my bad. I got that wrong. To the lady, the boxer, I'm sorry. I didn't understand what was going on,\" said Adesanya via The Rock.\n\nThe saga began when reports surfaced about Khelif's gender test results. These reports, later proven inaccurate, set off a firestorm of speculation. Adesanya, like many others, reacted to the unverified information circulating online. He shared a clip of Khelif's previous fight, accompanied by a controversial comment.\n\nRealizing his mistake, Adesanya didn't dodge responsibility. Instead, he faced it head-on and admitted to being misled by the swirling misinformation. It's refreshing to see a fighter show such humility outside the cage. Meanwhile, Khelif has been focused on her Olympic journey. She's been battling in the ring, not on social media. The Algerian boxer has advanced to the gold medal match and is on the verge of making history for her country.\n\nControversy can sometimes overshadow athletic achievements, as recently seen around Algerian boxer Khelif. The 25-year-old fighter has found herself at the center of a heated debate. It's not about her skills in the ring but her eligibility to compete.\n\nThe Algerian Olympic Committee (COA) has come out swinging in Khelif's defense. They're not pulling any punches in their criticism of foreign media outlets. These outlets have been questioning Khelif's gender status at the Paris Olympics. It's a situation that's raising eyebrows and tempers in equal measure.\n\n\"COA strongly condemns the unethical targeting and maligning of our esteemed athlete, Imane Khelif, with baseless propaganda from certain foreign media outlets. Such attacks on her personality and dignity are deeply unfair, especially as she prepares for the pinnacle of her career at the Olympics. The COA has taken all necessary measures to protect our champion,\" via Reuters.\n\nThe timing of this controversy couldn't be worse for Khelif, as she's on the verge of making history for Algeria. If successful, she could become the country's first female boxing gold medalist. This situation highlights the complex issues surrounding gender in sports. It's a topic that often leads to heated debates and difficult decisions. In Khelif's case, it became a diplomatic incident of Olympic proportions.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zaid_quraishi@totalprosports.com", "name": "Zaid Quraishi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Adesanya", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Adesanya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_verification_in_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex verification in sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algerian Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Imane-Khelif-Israel-Adesanya-1024x563.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798676", "eventUri": "eng-9798676", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

IOC's Mark Adams confirmed both boxers were women as Izzy apologized.\n\n\"From now on, I will leave women's fights to women. I tried to speak up about it and apparently, I got it wrong, a lot of people got it wrong, there was misinformation. I spoke up about it because I don't like to get triggered, but when something triggers me, I'm a fighter and I saw that I'm like, 'What?' And I saw the news or the articles speaking on it, 'Why they letting a trans person [in]?' Then I find out later, okay, she wasn't actually trans.\n\n\"So, to the lady, my bad. I got that wrong. But for me, still is that -- all this grey area, even now, they let some pedo guy compete. Wait, so what?

It really is that bad.'\n\nOther boxers competing at the Games have aired their worries and feelings of unjust in more cryptic ways with Turkey's Esra Yildiz - who was beaten by Yu-Ting - making an 'X' sign with her fingers just as the Taiwan boxer's Bulgarian opponent had done in the previous bout.\n\nMany believe the single 'X' symbol is reference to the fact that male chromosomes are designated by an X and a Y, while females have two X's.\n\nLinda Blade, co-founder of the International Consortium on Female Sport followed on from Davies and highlighted that the controversial gender issue could have been 'entirely avoidable'.\n\n'Boxing is the sport with the greatest disparity between males and female - with males punching 162 per cent harder than females,' Blade said.\n\n'The potential harm to females that could result from the pummelling delivered by an unverified participant who is male is catastrophic.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharron_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sharron Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_verification_in_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sex verification in sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yu-ting", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lin Yu-ting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

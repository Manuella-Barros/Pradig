Case in point: Hale\u2019s 18-year-old daughter Loy Ann is graduating high school within days of the Disney and Pixar sequel\u2019s June 14 release. \u201cShe's going to create her own path and forge her own path,\u201d the Emmy-winning Veep star, 53, tells PEOPLE exclusively of his college-bound daughter. \u201cIt's really beautiful and it's daunting as hell.\u201d Hale shares Loy Ann with Martel Thompson, his wife since 2003. The last days of their daughter\u2019s senior year, he says, means she\u2019s \u201calways just going, going, going. And we're the old folks that just want to sit around and watch Netflix.\u201d The idea of an \u201cempty nest\u201d after their only child leaves, he adds, is \u201creally surreal.\u201d On the one hand, \u201cYou feel calm and settled because you know that she's having a great time,\u201d says Hale. \u201cWe know that she's going to be taken care of\u2026 When she was young, if we were going out and she had a really good babysitter, you just had that, \u2018She's taken care of\u2019 [feeling].\u201d On the other hand, however, there\u2019s the fear. \u201cThis is not going to stop any of my anxiety,\u201d states Hale. He laughs, adding, \u201cI'll be surprised if I don't rent the dorm room next to her! But we're taking it day to day.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. For Hale, parenting has been an ongoing \u201cexperiential process,\u201d particularly when it comes to letting Loy Ann forge that unique path. \u201cI have to stop my mind going to the \u2018What if?\u2019 or creating, \u2018What could happen?\u2019 and \u2018How can I defend her from that?\u2019 \u201d he shares. \u201cYou just worry about her and just hope she's going to be okay. College is kind of escalated. It's even more charged because she is really going off and doing her own thing.\u201d Hale\u2019s work as a father, he says, is \u201cto control those narratives in my head and give her that freedom.\u201d It\u2019s all too relevant to Inside Out 2, which finds Hale voicing Fear (replacing Bill Hader from the original film) alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness and more. Jumping into the fray is the chaotic Anxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke. \u201cFear is what you see and anxiety is what you can't see,\u201d notes Hale. In the movie, Anxiety creates imaginary narratives designed to protect pre-teen Riley (Kensington Tallman) \u2014 much like he does with his daughter. \u201cThis sounds so dark, but parenting sometimes is just heartbreak,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause not only does your heart break when theirs breaks, if they're disappointed by something, if they don't get something. But then your heart breaks when they're going on their own path. You love them. And a part of that love is that heartbreak.\u201d Then, he quips, \u201cI say all this and I'm going to be eating beside her every day of her college years, so I don't know why I'm even having this discussion! I'm going to get a meal card right alongside her.\u201d Inside Out 2 is in theaters June 14. Hale next appears in the Netflix comedy The Decameron.", "summary": "\u201cI&#39;ll be surprised if I don&#39;t rent the dorm room next to her,&#34; jokes Tony Hale, a soon-to-be &#34;empty nester&#34;", "url": "https://people.com/tony-hale-daunting-daughter-go-college-inside-out-exclusive-8660234", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/uykc6kfq79bq6W8GfLxUmM_Dlvc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(770x374:772x376)/tony-hale-060624-1433a1ee26224bac9512e9640bd574a1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:35:00", "author": "Jack Smart", "authors": ["Jack Smart"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.157}

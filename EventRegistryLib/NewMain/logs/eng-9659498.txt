Cyprus is part of the solution. Cyprus is part of the answer,\" Kombos said.\n\nThe U.S. has embarked on similar strategic dialogues with 30 other countries, 13 of which are European Union member states.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken, right, meets with Cyprus' Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos, Monday, June 17, 2024, at the State Department in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nTo illustrate the added value that Cyprus can bring to such a partnership with the U.S., Cypriot officials have pointed to the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor from which hundreds of tons of humanitarian aid has been shipped to the Palestinian territory through a U.S.-built pier and causeway.\n\nAll aid is security screened in Cyprus with Israeli and U.S. oversight. Assisting in the overall security of the initiative is a U.S.-funded center that helps train Cypriot and other personnel from neighboring countries on issues of maritime safety and security.\n\nKombos said Cyprus is no longer just viewed through the political lens of its ethnic division that has remained unresolved since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded in the wake of a Athens junta-engineered coup aimed at union with Greece.\n\nCyprus, an EU member since 2004, has in recent years made a clear strategic policy shift toward the West - and in particular the U.S. - after decades of close relations with the former Soviet Union and later the Russian Federation. The Cyprus-Russia rift became more clearly defined following Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe annual strategic dialogue, that will be held this year in September, will also touch on cultural and education issues as well as investment opportunities.\n\nAmong the Cypriot government's key priorities through the dialogue is to fully lift a U.S. embargo on military arms sales to Cyprus without the need for annual Congressional approval. It also hopes to expedite the development of a natural gas field off Cyprus' southeastern coast that's licensed to U.S. energy company Chevron.\n\nAnother priority is to be admitted into the U.S. visa waiver program as Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania remain the only EU member states that aren't included.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken, right, meets with Cyprus' Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos, Monday, June 17, 2024, at the State Department in Washington.

In addition, the prospects for investments in our country, as well as for the strengthening of our trade relations with the US, are important for the Cypriot economy. These are decisive factors in our effort to strengthen and shield the Republic of Cyprus.\"\n\nAt the same time, President Christodoulides said, \"we are working intensively with the US authorities for the inclusion of our country in the visa waiver programme that will allow Cypriot citizens to travel to the United States without the need to obtain, in advance, an entry permit. In this context, a bilateral cooperation agreement on the use of travel data has been signed.\"\n\nAs of today, our country's bilateral relationship with the US is significantly strengthened, President Christodoulides said.\n\nHe welcomed \"once again with great satisfaction the signing of the agreement\", expressing the certainty \"that in addition to the positive results for the two countries and our citizens, it will strengthen the international footprint of the Republic of Cyprus and the recognition it enjoys as a reliable and stable partner, as well as a pillar of security, cooperation and peace in the wider region of the Middle East.\"\n\nCyprus and US confirmed on 17 June the strategic aspect of their relationship and set the timetable for launching a Strategic Dialogue, that will be starting in September.\n\nKombos meets with Blinken\n\nAnnouncements were made in Washington following a 45 minute meeting that Cyprus FM Constantinos Kombos had with State Secretary Antony Blinken at the State Department.\n\n\"This is an important moment in the relationship between the United States and Cyprus,\" said Secretary Blinken.\n\n\"We will be announcing and initiating a strategic dialogue between our countries. The first will take place this Fall in Cyprus. I think it's very powerful evidence of the strengthening, the deepening, the broadening of the relationship between our countries, acting together in so many different areas,\" Secretary Blinken said.\n\nThe head of American diplomacy also referred to the maritime corridor for the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza as a typical example of the upgrading of US-Cyprus relations.\n\n\"The maritime corridor in Gaza is a prominent example. But if you look at what we're doing in terms of trade, in terms of science and technology, in terms of security, in terms of education, in terms of people-to-people ties, you see a partnership, a relationship that's growing stronger, that's growing deeper,\" he pointed out.\n\nSecretary Blinken said that this is a reflection of the fact that Cyprus is an important player in the region and a partner for the United States \"that we deeply value.\"\n\n\"So I'm so glad to have you here today as we work on actually practical ways of deepening this partnership and launching the strategic dialogue\" he added, addressing Cyprus Minister.\n\nKombos in his statements said that \"this is a very important day for our two countries.\"\n\n\"The announcement for the establishment of the strategic dialogue is a very important development, and of course with that comes a responsibility,\" he said.\n\nKombos went on to say that Cyprus and the US are moving forward in order to create a structured dialogue, \"a dialogue that is going to be intensive, and that's for the benefit of our people of our two countries.\"\n\n\"We share common foundation - our core values; our respect, commitment to democracy, to the rule of law; our opposition to aggression and to revisionism. And upon those we stand together, whether that's in Ukraine or in relation to other places where we have such incidents,\" the Cyprus Foreign Minister said.\n\nKombos said that Cyprus is a credible, predictable partner for the US at a very complicated region.\n\n\"The message is very simple: Cyprus is part of the solution. Cyprus is part of the answer. It is through this lens that five decades of occupation of Cyprus by Turkey should be approached. And on that, we count on the support of the United States,\" he noted.\n\nIn his own statements following the meeting, the Cypriot Minister said that Cyprus operates autonomously, exercises its sovereignty, and we have seen this approach in a number of issues of global interest, such as the issue of the humanitarian corridor for Gaza.\n\nHe said that the initiative is progressing through the good cooperation that exists with the American side.\n\nAs regards the Cyprus issue, Kombos noted that he pointed out our side's sincere will for the resumption of negotiations.\n\nOur intention, he said, is to continue the effort, to intensify the meetings and discussions so that we can finally go back to the negotiating table. He said that there was full understanding and support on this by the American side, noting that \"no discussion can take place outside the framework of the UN.\"\n\nAccording to an official announcement, the meeting was held in a friendly and cordial atmosphere, the high level of Cyprus-US relations was confirmed and the start of a Strategic Dialogue between the two countries was announced.\n\nAfter the meeting, according to the announcement, a bilateral agreement was signed between the Republic of Cyprus and the United States for cooperation in relation to the use of travel data. By signing this agreement, Cyprus moves one step closer to the inclusion of the Republic of Cyprus in the US Visa Waiver Program, the announcement reads.\n\nThe agreement was signed on behalf of the Republic of Cyprus by the Ambassador of the Republic of Cyprus in Washington Evangelos Savva and on behalf of the USA by the American Ambassador in Nicosia Julie Fisher, in the presence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Constantinos Kombos and the Assistant Secretary of State of the USA for European and Euro-Asian Affairs James O'Brien.", "source": {"uri": "cbn.com.cy", "dataType": "news",

In no way whatsoever,\" he said, adding that lines of communication are open with the Lebanese and Iranian governments.\n\nWhile experts say war between Israel and Hezbollah remains unlikely, the very mention of Cyprus adds a new dimension to the Israel-Gaza conflict. It risks drawing a European Union nation into a war that has already spread across the Middle East and puts the spotlight on Cyprus's ties with Israel.\n\nHere's what we know.\n\nWhy is Cyprus' location important?\n\nAn island in the Eastern Mediterranean located on a geopolitical fault line between the Middle East and southern Europe, Cyprus is geographically much closer to the conflicts in the Middle East than it is to European power centers.\n\nThe island is twice the size of the US state of Delaware, and it is split into two parts: a Greek-speaking southern part known as the Republic of Cyprus, and a Turkish-speaking region known as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The island's divide reflects the rivalry between regional foes Greece and Turkey. Most of the international community only recognizes the sovereignty of the Greek part of Cyprus, and that was the nation Nasrallah's threats were directed at.\n\nThe Republic of Cyprus is a member of the EU but not of the NATO defense alliance that obliges member nations to come to each other's defense in case of attack. It is home to around 920,000 people, with Nicosia as its capital.\n\nHow close are Cyprus' ties with Israel?\n\nDiplomatic relations between Cyprus and Israel started in 1960, following the island's independence from British colonial rule, but Cyprus didn't open an embassy in Tel Aviv until 1994. Relations went sour in the 1980s and 1990s over issues including Israel's close ties with Turkey and the Arab-Israeli conflict, in which Cyprus sided with Arab states and supported Palestinian statehood.\n\nTies bounced back in the late 1990s and 2000s, as Israel began turning to the Eastern Mediterranean for economic partnerships, especially after the discovery of natural gas in the region. Experts say Israel has also looked to Cyprus as a partner to thwart regional threats, particularly from Turkey and Iran-linked groups.\n\nIsrael has in recent years used Cypriot territory to train its troops on possible war with Hezbollah. Cyprus' terrain is similar to that of Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said, according to Israeli media.\n\nIn 2022, the IDF conducted a joint military drill with Cypriot forces. Some of the joint training focused on fighting multiple fronts and focusing on battling Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israeli media reported. Their latest exercises were conducted in May 2023 in Cyprus.\n\nCyprus' Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos welcomes his Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen in Larnaca, Cyprus, on December 20.\n\nStavros Ioannides/PIO/Reuters\n\nWhat has Cyprus' role been in the Gaza war?\n\nCyprus has been keen to dispel any suggestions that it is implicated in the Gaza war, noting its humanitarian efforts that helped bring some aid into Gaza.\n\n\"The Republic of Cyprus is not part of the problem. The Republic of Cyprus is part of the solution,\" said Christodoulides, the president. \"And our role in this, as demonstrated, for example, through the humanitarian corridor, is recognized not only by the Arab world but by the international community as a whole.\"\n\nIn March, Cyprus began allowing aid ships to sail from its ports as part of international efforts to create a humanitarian aid route via sea toward Gaza.\n\nThe first maritime shipment to Gaza carried 200 tons of food, which equates to roughly 500,000 meals. An EU logistics hub was also set up in Cyprus to facilitate the flow of aid into Gaza.\n\nNicosia has criticized some of Israel's actions in Gaza, especially those that have hampered the delivery of humanitarian aid.\n\nIn April, it issued a joint statement with the UAE, condemning the deadly Israeli attack on the World Central Kitchen charity group that killed seven people.\n\nIt has also repeatedly condemned Hamas for its October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nHumanitarian aid for Gaza is loaded on a platform next to a rescue vessel of the Spanish NGO Open Arms at the port of Larnaca, Cyprus on March 11.\n\nYiannis Kourtoglou/Reuters\n\nWhat is the likelihood of Cyprus getting more deeply involved?\n\nThe island has previously been caught in the crossfire of regional conflicts, a reminder of its proximity to the volatile Middle East. In 2019, a suspected Russian-made missile exploded over the region of northern Cyprus. Cypriot officials believed the missile was linked to military operations in Syria, saying it landed less than 15 (24km) miles north of the capital Nicosia.\n\nA scenario in which Israel uses Cypriot bases for its military forces, which Hezbollah warned against, would \"effectively expand Gaza war into the European Union,\" Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran analyst and editor of Amwaj.media, wrote on X.\n\nIt would mean that an EU country is, for the first time, directly involved in an expanded Gaza war.\n\nSome experts say that the prospect of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict breaking out into an all- out war is unlikely, however, as neither side want such an escalation.\n\n\"Hezbollah's release of drone footage of sensitive positions inside Israel is meant as a deterrent to Israel,\" Lina Khatib, associate fellow in the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN, referring to the 9-minute drone video released by Hezbollah on Tuesday, showing civilian and military locations in and around the Israeli city Haifa.\n\n\"It is normal for both Israel and Hezbollah to have military plans in place for handling a potential escalation. But as things stand, neither Israel nor Hezbollah benefits from all-out war,\" Khatib said, adding that \"Hezbollah knows that war with Israel would be devastating for Lebanon and that there is no popular appetite for such a scenario in the country.\"\n\nThe Biden administration is also unlikely to let Israel fight a two-front war on its own, she said, adding that US involvement may pull in \"other Iran-backed actors as well as the potential for Iran itself to be targeted.\"\n\n\"This is a high cost that Iran wants to avoid paying,\" she said. \"The US also does not want to find itself in another Middle East quagmire, especially with presidential elections looming.\"\n\nCNN's Sharon Braithwaite, Tamara Qiblawi, Mostafa Salem and Abbas Al Lawati contributed reporting.", "source":

In these troubled times, your leadership is critical, and you personally have been leading the way. This is a very important day for our two countries. The announcement for the establishment of the strategic dialogue is a very important development, and of course with that comes a responsibility.\n\nWe are moving forward in order to create a structured dialogue, a dialogue that is going to be intensive, and that's for the benefit of our people of our two countries. We share common foundation - our core values; our respect, commitment to democracy, to the rule of law; our opposition to aggression and to revisionism. And upon those we stand together, whether that's in Ukraine or in relation to other places where we have such incidents.\n\nAt the same time, Cyprus is a credible, predictable partner for the U.S. And in a very complicated region, the message is very simple: Cyprus is part of the solution. Cyprus is part of the answer. It is through this lens that five decades of occupation of Cyprus by T\u00fcrkiye should be approached. And on that, we count on the support of the United States.\n\nDear Tony, thank you very much, and I look forward to continued discussion.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you so much.

It's a great pleasure to have my friend Constantinos Kombos, the foreign minister of Cyprus, here today at the State Department.\n\nThis is an important moment in the relationship between the United States and Cyprus. We will be announcing and initiating a strategic dialogue between our countries. The first will take place this fall in Cyprus. I think it's very powerful evidence of the strengthening, the deepening, the broadening of the relationship between our countries, acting together in so many different areas.\n\nOf course, the maritime corridor in Gaza is a prominent example, but if you look at what we're doing in terms of trade, in terms of science and technology, in terms of security, in terms of education, in terms of people-to-people ties, you see a partnership, a relationship that's growing stronger, that's growing deeper. And it's a reflection of the fact that Cyprus is an important player in the region and a partnership for the United States that we deeply value. So I'm so glad to have you here today as we work on actually practical ways of deepening this partnership and launching the strategic dialogue.

allow any country to carry out military operations through Cyprus by permitting the use of its territory and military installations.\n\nHowever, Cyprus does not have control over Britain's sovereign military bases in Cyprus, which have their own special status, Letymbiotis said.\n\nUnder the Treaty of Establishment which led to the creation of the first Cypriot state in 1960, former colonial

Always follow the advice of local authorities.\"\n\nWhat is official Government advice on travelling to Cyprus?\n\nThe UK Government hasn't issued a \"do not travel\" warning, but it gives information about people's safety and security when abroad on its website.\n\nIt warns: \"There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.\"\n\nIt says, while there have not been any terrorist attacks recently in Cyprus, it \"cannot be ruled out\".\n\nIt also warns that although the Republic of Cyprus is a full EU member, not all of it is included in that.\n\nThe country is divided by the Green Line and the British Government does not recognise the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.\n\nDo I need a Covid test to travel to Cyprus?\n\nThere are no Covid-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Cyprus and travellers will not have to prove they have been immunised.\n\nHowever, your passport must have been issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the 'date of issue') and be valid for at least three months after the day you plan to leave (check the 'expiry date').\n\nYou must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before October 1, 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.\n\nDo I need a visa to enter Cyprus from the UK?\n\nIf travelling for a holiday or leisure, you do not need a visa to visit Cyprus. This rule allows you to stay for up to 90 days for tourism, visiting friends or family, attending business meetings, or short-term study.\n\nTo stay longer or if visiting for other reasons, check what you need from the Cyprus High Commission.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sian_baldwin@ca.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Sian Baldwin",

It's a great pleasure to have my friend Constantinos Kombos, the foreign minister of Cyprus, here today at the State Department.\n\nThis is an important moment in the relationship between the United States and Cyprus. We will be announcing and initiating a strategic dialogue between our countries. The first will take place this fall in Cyprus. I think it's very powerful evidence of the strengthening, the deepening, the broadening of the relationship between our countries, acting together in so many different areas.\n\nOf course, the maritime corridor in Gaza is a prominent example, but if you look at what we're doing in terms of trade, in terms of science and technology, in terms of security, in terms of education, in terms of people-to-people ties, you see a partnership, a relationship that's growing stronger, that's growing deeper. And it's a reflection of the fact that Cyprus is an important player in the region and a partnership for the United States that we deeply value. So I'm so glad to have you here today as we work on actually practical ways of deepening this partnership and launching the strategic dialogue. Welcome.\n\nFOREIGN MINISTER KOMBOS: Mr. Secretary, dear Tony, thank you for the invitation, for the warmth, for the hospitality, and also for your kind words. In these troubled times, your leadership is critical, and you personally have been leading the way. This is a very important day for our two countries. The announcement for the establishment of the strategic dialogue is a very important development, and of course with that comes a responsibility.\n\nWe are moving forward in order to create a structured dialogue, a dialogue that is going to be intensive, and that's for the benefit of our people of our two countries. We share common foundation - our core values; our respect, commitment to democracy, to the rule of law; our opposition to aggression and to revisionism. And upon those we stand together, whether that's in Ukraine or in relation to other places where we have such incidents.\n\nAt the same time, Cyprus is a credible, predictable partner for the U.S. And in a very complicated region, the message is very simple: Cyprus is part of the solution. Cyprus is part of the answer. It is through this lens that five decades of occupation of Cyprus by T\u00fcrkiye should be approached. And on that, we count on the support of the United States.\n\nDear Tony, thank you very much, and I look forward to continued discussion.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you so much. Thanks, everyone.\n\n/Public Release. This material from the originating organization/author(s) might be of the point-in-time nature, and edited for clarity, style and length.

Blinken himself announced the launch, noting that it is the first round of a discussion which will take place in Cyprus this fall.\n\nI think it's very powerful evidence of the strengthening, the deepening, the broadening of the relationship between our countries, acting together in so many different areas,\" Secretary Blinken said. He noted the growing strategic value the U.S. places on Cyprus, particularly for military and humanitarian operations.\n\nKombos echoed the sentiment, calling it \"a very important day for our two countries\" and emphasised the creation of \"a dialogue that is going to be intensive, and that's for the benefit of our people of our two countries.\"\n\nUnderscoring Cyprus's role as \"part of the solution\" to regional challenges, he stressed the importance of U.S. support in resolving the long-standing Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.\n\nThe Strategic Dialogue establishes a framework for annual high-level consultations in both Nicosia and Washington. The inaugural round is expected to occur in September with senior officials from both Foreign Ministries.\n\nThe format aligns with the U.S.'s existing Strategic Dialogues with 30 other countries, including 13 EU member states. Cyprus's inclusion elevates its position as a close partner of the US.\n\nThis development comes on the heels of the successful collaboration on the Amalthea humanitarian corridor, highlighting a new level of U.S.-Cyprus cooperation. The Strategic Dialogue further solidifies Cyprus's role as a reliable and predictable partner in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nPotential benefits for Cyprus include strengthened political, economic, social, and cultural ties; enhanced collaboration on security and energy; and a more prominent role as a regional stabilising force.\n\nAdditionally, the dialogue could open doors for increased American investment, boost trade, and new opportunities for Cypriot youth in education and research.\n\nFollowing the meeting, a bilateral agreement on travel data cooperation was signed, potentially moving Cyprus closer to inclusion in the U.S. Visa Waiver Programme. This programme would allow Cypriot citizens visa-free travel for business or tourism for up to 90 days.\n\nThe Cyprus issue also featured in the discussions, with Kombos reiterating the commitment to a U.N.-backed solution based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality.\n\nBlinken reaffirmed U.S. support for a Cyprus settlement within the U.N. framework.", "source": {"uri": "in-cyprus.philenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "in-cyprus.philenews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andreas_bimbishis@in-cyprus.philenews.com", "name": "Andreas Bimbishis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Cyprus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicosia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicosia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nicosia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_problem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus problem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Mediterranean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Mediterranean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Strategic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Strategic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Interfaith", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Interfaith", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle_East", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle East", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic Management", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kombos_blinken1-1024x576-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659498", "eventUri": "eng-9659498", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Cypriot President Christodoulides reassured that Cyprus was neutral, while EU, Lebanon's Prime Minister Mikati, and Foreign Minister Bou Habib sought to calm the situation.\n\nCyprus reacted with incredulity on Thursday to warnings from Lebanon's Hezbollah that the island could be dragged into conflict if tensions with Israel blew up into a fully-fledged war. The EU member state closest to the Middle East, Cyprus was caught off guard by comments from Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Wednesday that the island could be a target if it permitted Israel to use its military facilities in the event of an attack on Lebanon.\n\n\"The Republic of Cyprus is in no way involved in war conflict,\" Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides responded, describing Nasrallah's comments as \"not pleasant\". The EU also weighed in. \"Any threats against our member state are threats against the EU,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nLebanon's government appeared to try to contain any possible fallout from Nasrallah's comments. Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati contacted Christodoulides on Thursday to thank him for his measured diplomatic response, referring to Christodoulides as a \"dear friend\", a Cypriot source said.\n\nForeign minister Abdallah Bou Habib also spoke to his Cypriot counterpart Constantinos Kombos to highlight Lebanon's \"continued reliance\" on the role Cyprus has played in regional stability, according to a statement by Bou Habib's office. A Lebanese diplomatic source told Reuters that the two had spoken \"to clarify matters\" but did not elaborate on how Lebanese officials had specifically addressed Nasrallah's threats.\n\nOfficials in Nicosia made clear they did not want to pursue the matter further. NATO member Greece, a key ally, said Cyprus and its people had its unwavering support. \"The threat of use of violence is a flagrant violation of the U.N. Charter,\" it said on X.\n\nNEUTRAL IN SEA OF CONFLICT Cyprus has always viewed itself as above Middle Eastern politics and offered sanctuary to tens of thousands of Lebanese fleeing civil war in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nIt has lobbied its EU partners to offer Lebanon financial assistance, and recently set up a maritime corridor to dispatch humanitarian aid to famine-threatened Palestinians in Gaza. \"Cyprus is a credible enabler of stability, and an acknowledged regional hub for humanitarian operations, based on excellent relations with all the countries in the region,\" said government spokesperson Konstantinos Letymbiotis.\n\nBut it also comes against the backdrop of improved Cyprus ties with Israel, and the more visible involvement of British sovereign bases on the island in military operations in Syria and more recently, Yemen. The Israeli air force is also known to conduct exercises in Cyprus's airspace, and in recent years the two countries have conducted joint military drills. Cypriots in the divided capital Nicosia said people had enough to deal with from the lingering complications of Turkey's invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup.\n\n\"Last night when I heard about the news, yes, I was worried,\" said Filios Christodoulou, 84. Others were unfazed.\n\n\"We have nothing to do with this war,\" Stella Patatini, 62, said. \"On the contrary, we are helping peace in the region and assistance to the Palestinians so I feel safe in Cyprus.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"},

[Reuters/Yiannis Kourtoglou]\n\nCyprus reacted with incredulity on Thursday to warnings from Lebanon's Hezbollah that the island could be dragged into conflict if tensions with Israel blew up into a fully-fledged war.\n\nThe EU member state closest to the Middle East, Cyprus was caught off guard by comments from Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah late on Wednesday that the island could be a target if it permitted Israel to use its military facilities in the event of an attack on Lebanon.\n\n\"The Republic of Cyprus is in no way involved in war conflict,\" Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides responded, describing Nasrallah's comments as \"not pleasant.\"\n\nThe EU also weighed in. \"Any threats against our member state are threats against the EU,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nCyprus has always viewed itself as above the politics of its neighbours and offered sanctuary to tens of thousands of Lebanese fleeing civil war in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nIt has lobbied its EU partners to offer Lebanon financial assistance, and recently set up a maritime corridor to dispatch humanitarian aid to famine-threatened Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\"Cyprus is a credible enabler of stability, and an acknowledged regional hub for humanitarian operations, based on excellent relations with all the countries in the region,\" said government spokesperson Konstantinos Letymbiotis.\n\nBut it also comes against the backdrop of improved ties with Israel, and the more visible involvement of British sovereign bases on the island in military operations in Syria and more recently, Yemen. The Israeli air force is also known to conduct exercises in Cyprus's airspace, and in recent years the two countries have conducted joint military drills.\n\nCypriots in the divided capital Nicosia said people had enough to deal with from the lingering complications of Turkey's invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup.\n\n\"Last night when I heard about the news, yes, I was worried,\" said Filios Christodoulou, 84.\n\nOthers were unfazed.\n\n\"We have nothing to do with this war,\" said Stella Patatini, 62. \"On the contrary, we are helping peace in the region and assistance to the Palestinians so I feel safe in Cyprus.\"\n\n[Reuters]\n\nCyprus Terrorism Subscribe to our Newsletters\n\nEnter your information below to receive our weekly newsletters with the latest insights, opinion pieces and current events straight to your inbox.\n\nSIGN UP NOW Kathimerini may send occasional special offers and promotions.

Most of the fatalities have been fighters but they also include more than 80 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed over the past eight months.\n\nThe level of threats between Israel and Hezbollah intensified following last week's killing by Israel of Hezbollah's most senior commander since the fighting began. Hezbollah retaliated by firing hundreds of rockets into northern Israel in retaliation.\n\nCyprus and Lebanon have had close and historic relations for decades and the island became a refuge for thousands of Lebanese who resided on the island during Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war. Many Lebanese citizens moved again to Cyprus following the historic economic meltdown in Lebanon that started in late 2019.\n\nIn recent years, Cyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel and the island has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not been involved in any military operations.\n\nNasrallah said his group has information that the Israel's military is conducting maneuvers in Cyprus in mountainous areas similar to those of Lebanon adding that they also use Cypriot airports.\n\nHe added that Hezbollah has information that Israel believes that in case an all-out war breaks out, Hezbollah will target its airports and for that reason Israel might use \"in its war against Lebanon Cypriot airports and bases.\"\n\nNasrallah added that when Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides visited Lebanon recently, Lebanese officials spoke with him about the matter and he denied there were such plans.\n\n\"The Cypriot government should be careful that opening the airports and bases in Cyprus for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon, means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war,\" Nasrallah said. \"The resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it (Cyprus) as part of the war.\"\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus, either through its infrastructure or territory, would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nNasrallah was criticized by some Lebanese politicians who warned that his comments could harm relations with Cyprus and the European Union.\n\n\"Cyprus was a refuge and welcomed all Lebanese but Nasrallah is insisting that we have no friend left,\" legislator Elias Hankash of the Christian Kataeb Party told Al-Arabiya TV. \"The threat to Europe leaves Lebanon in complete isolation.\"\n\nPeter Stano, a spokesman for the European Union's executive arm, said Thursday that any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nLast year, Cyprus said it had disrupted an alleged Iranian plot to target Israeli businessmen with the arrest of two Iranian asylum-seekers who were in contact with another Iranian associated with the Revolutionary Guard.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Cyprus perplexed by Hezbollah threats", "body": "NICOSIA (Reuters) -Cyprus reacted with incredulity on Thursday to warnings from Lebanon's Hezbollah that the island could be dragged into conflict if tensions with Israel blew up into a fully-fledged war.\n\nThe EU member state closest to the Middle East, Cyprus was caught off guard by comments from Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Wednesday that the island could be a target if it permitted Israel to use its military facilities in the event of an attack on Lebanon.\n\n\"The Republic of Cyprus is in no way involved in war conflict,\" Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides responded, describing Nasrallah's comments as \"not pleasant\".\n\nThe EU also weighed in. \"Any threats against our member state are threats against the EU,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nLebanon's government appeared to try to contain any possible fallout from Nasrallah's comments.\n\nLebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati contacted Christodoulides on Thursday to thank him for his measured diplomatic response, referring to Christodoulides as a \"dear friend\", a Cypriot source said.\n\nForeign minister Abdallah Bou Habib also spoke to his Cypriot counterpart Constantinos Kombos to highlight Lebanon's \"continued reliance\" on the role Cyprus has played in regional stability, according to a statement by Bou Habib's office.\n\nA Lebanese diplomatic source told Reuters that the two had spoken \"to clarify matters\" but did not elaborate on how Lebanese officials had specifically addressed Nasrallah's threats.\n\nOfficials in Nicosia made clear they did not want to pursue the matter further. NATO member Greece, a key ally, said Cyprus and its people had its unwavering support.\n\n\"The threat of use of violence is a flagrant violation of the U.N. Charter,\" it said on X.\n\nNEUTRAL IN SEA OF CONFLICT\n\nCyprus has always viewed itself as above Middle Eastern politics and offered sanctuary to tens of thousands of Lebanese fleeing civil war in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nIt has lobbied its EU partners to offer Lebanon financial assistance, and recently set up a maritime corridor to dispatch humanitarian aid to famine-threatened Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\"Cyprus is a credible enabler of stability, and an acknowledged regional hub for humanitarian operations, based on excellent relations with all the countries in the region,\" said government spokesperson Konstantinos Letymbiotis.\n\nBut it also comes against the backdrop of improved Cyprus ties with Israel, and the more visible involvement of British sovereign bases on the island in military operations in Syria and more recently, Yemen. The Israeli air force is also known to conduct exercises in Cyprus's airspace, and in recent years the two countries have conducted joint military drills.\n\nCypriots in the divided capital Nicosia said people had enough to deal with from the lingering complications of Turkey's invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup.\n\n\"Last night when I heard about the news, yes, I was worried,\" said Filios Christodoulou, 84.\n\nOthers were unfazed.\n\n\"We have nothing to do with this war,\" Stella Patatini, 62, said. \"On the contrary, we are helping peace in the region and assistance to the Palestinians so I feel safe in Cyprus.\"\n\n(Reporting by Michele Kambas, Marinos Meletiou and Yiannis Kourtoglou in Nicosia; Additional reporting by Maya Gebeily in

WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war.

If they can target the outskirts of Tel Aviv then they can hit Cyprus. It's not something that can be excluded,\" Haritos said.\n\nNasrallah's threat against Cyprus came as its foreign minister, Constantinos Kombos, was in Washington meeting with his counterpart Antony Blinken.\n\n\"Cyprus is an important player in the region, and a partnership for the United States that we deeply value,\" Blinken said.\n\nSince 7 October, Cyprus has emerged as a hub for US special forces. US Naval Special Warfare Operators conducted joint training with Cypriot counterparts this year. Cyprus also actively billed itself as a staging ground for aid into Gaza and the Port of Larnaca has been the first point of entry for aid traveling to the US-built pier in Gaza.\n\n'Abraham Accords on the Med'\n\nNasrallah's message to Cyprus suggests that Hezbollah has been watching with concern Israel and the US's deepening relationship with the Eastern Mediterranean island nation that sits just 260km off the coast of Lebanon.\n\n\"Hezbollah is clearly frustrated that Cyprus has signed a strategic cooperation pact with the Americans,\" Constantinos Filis, director of the Institute of Global Affairs in Athens, told MEE.\n\nIn the last decade, Israel has grown increasingly close to both Cyprus and Greece. The former is split between a mainly Greek internationally recognised government in the south and a Turkish-Cypriot government in the north recognised only by Ankara.\n\nThe decision of Arab states like the UAE and Morocco to normalise ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords eclipsed Israel's burgeoning relations with Greece and Cyprus, but their newfound cohesion has been quietly impacting the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nCyprus was a founding member of the Eastern Mediterranean Gas Forum, which sought to deepen energy cooperation with Israel and Arab states, amid maritime tensions with Turkey. Last year, Cyprus pushed to cement its energy ties with Israel by lobbying for a new gas pipeline between the two, MEE reported.\n\nCyprus, like Greece, has also benefitted from an influx of Israeli real estate investment in recent years, ironically, along with renewed interest from Lebanese investors.\n\nWith fighting in Gaza and along the border with Lebanon raging, Israel has tapped its strategic ties to Cyprus for military purposes.\n\n'A clever move'\n\nIsrael's air force has reportedly also used Cypriot airspace to conduct a drill simulating the scenario of an Iranian attack on Israel.\n\nBut Cyprus has been cooperating with Israel on security for years.\n\n'Cyprus will be extremely worried and [with] Greece will create some pressure on Israel'\n\n- Michael Harari, Israel's former ambassador to Cyprus\n\nSince 2021, it has participated with Greece and the US in annual naval exercises under the moniker \"Noble Dina\". They also conducted largescale naval exercises in 2023 that saw Israeli naval fleets sail to Cyprus.\n\nIsraeli special forces also train in Cyprus where the rocky terrain resembles Lebanon.\n\nMichael Harari, Israel's former ambassador to Cyprus, told Middle East Eye that Nasrallah's threat against the island suggested it was concerned Israel was on the verge of launching an operation.\n\nMiddle East Eye reported on Wednesday, that US envoy Amos Hochstein told Lebanese officials that the US would back an Israeli offensive on Lebanon after five weeks if there was no halt to daily fighting between the Iran-backed group and Israel.\n\n\"Throwing Cyprus into the mix means Nasrallah is under pressure and believes Israel may go ahead with an attack,\" Harari said.\n\n\"It's a clever move,\" he added, \"because he knows Cyprus will be extremely worried and Greece will create some pressure on Israel about an attack on Lebanon.\"\n\nArms embargo lifted\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have exchanged near-daily fire since 8 October, but the conflict ratcheted up last week after Israel killed Taleb Sami Abdullah, one of the most senior members of Hezbollah. The group responded by launching hundreds of drones and rockets at Israel.\n\nCyprus's growing alignment with Israel is part of Nicosia's wider realignment with the West, as it positions itself as a pro-US bulwark in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\n'Cyprus does not have an army able to conduct operations against Hezbollah'\n\n- Gabriel Haritos, Eliamep\n\nIn 2018, it signed a bilateral security cooperation statement and in 2022, US President Joe Biden's administration lifted a decades-old arms embargo on the island.\n\nDespite this, Haritos told MEE that Cyprus would feel exposed to any threat from Hezbollah.\n\n\"Cyprus does not have an army able to conduct operations against Hezbollah,\" he said.\n\nCyprus's burgeoning relations with Israel marks an extraordinary change since its independence from British colonial rule in 1960 when the country's then-leader, Greek Orthodox Archbishop Makarios III, welcomed figures like Gamal Abdel Nasser and the island openly embraced Palestinian resistance fighters.\n\nFor years, Cyprus harboured anti-Americanism over lingering frustration that the US quietly backed Turkey's 1974 invasion of the island after a failed coup attempt to unite it with Greece. Turkey maintains more than 35,000 troops in occupied northern Cyprus.\n\nFilis said Hezbollah believes Cyprus is vulnerable because of those geopolitical tensions.\n\n\"Nasrallah sees Cyprus as the weakest link in the eastern Mediterranean balance of power because it has no real military and is under pressure from Turkey.\"\n\n\"He is saying if you help Israel there will be ramifications.\"",

Western diplomats stationed in the divided island's internationally recognised south also voiced dismay at the spectre of Cyprus, a popular tourist destination and barely a 40-minute flight away from Tel Aviv, being drawn into the Middle East tumult if a fully fledged war erupted between the two foes.\n\n\"Hezbollah has a history of acting on its threats,\" said one EU envoy. \"Hezbollah knows Cyprus does not have the military capability to respond and in that respect it's an easy target.\"\n\nWithin hours of Nasrallah issuing the threat, the Cypriot president, Nikos Christodoulides, sought to emphasise the island's policy of neutrality, underscoring the role it had played in establishing a sea corridor to transfer humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\n\"Cyprus is not part of the problem ... [it] is part of the solution,\" he said. \"And our role, as manifested, for example, through the humanitarian corridor [to Gaza], is recognised not only by the Arab world but by the entire international community.\"\n\nScores of vessels carrying aid have travelled to Gaza under the initiative from the southern Cypriot port of Larnaca since March. But in a conflict where perceptions play an equally vital role, the island's alignment with Israel and ever improving relations with the US have also been noticed by Hezbollah's leadership.\n\nNicosia's approach was for years more pro-Arab than pro-Israeli. Deteriorating relations between Israel and Turkey and the discovery of gas reserves off the Israeli coast have paved the way for an energy alliance and much closer ties.\n\nThe two countries share intelligence and increasingly close military links. Two years ago the Israel Defence Forces used Cyprus to stage war games simulating combat in Lebanon, involving what was said to be the largest ever number of troops sent abroad by Israel. The drills focused on possible invasion tactics, the island having been picked for the exercises because of the similarity of its terrain with that of Lebanon.\n\nLast year armed forces from both nations conducted military exercises on the island \"to respond to particularly demanding operational scenarios\".\n\n\"Both were seen as a provocation by Hezbollah,\" said another diplomat. \"And we know that Christodoulides was told as much when he visited Beirut with EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen in May.\"\n\nBy virtue of its location, Cyprus is often involved in events beyond its borders. In 2006 Cyprus became a transit hub for the evacuation of more than 30,000 foreign nationals fleeing war in Lebanon, and last year thousands of British passport holders were airlifted from Sudan to the country.\n\nAlthough not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military, Cyprus has allowed Israel to use its airspace to conduct drills simulating an Iranian attack on Israel.\n\nEarlier this year protests were staged outside one of Cyprus's two British military bases - retained by London after the Cypriots won independence in 1960 - over concerns that the installations were being used by the US and UK to send military aid to Israel. RAF Akrotiri was previously used by UK forces in the air campaign against Islamic State.\n\nOn Thursday Cypriot officials emphasised that under the treaty of establishment, Britain was not obliged to inform Nicosia about movements on the bases.\n\nPolitical analysts have described Nasrallah's inflammatory rhetoric as \"classic deterrence\" but also said it was a warning of how bad the situation could get if the conflict escalates. Some said it was likely to spur Greece, which also enjoys excellent ties with Israel, to implore its ally to give peace a chance before launching an offensive against Hezbollah.\n\n\"The Cypriots would never allow their facilities or territory to be used by Israel for armed confrontation because they know it would seriously harm their relations with all other countries in the region,\" said Prof Hubert Faustmann, who teaches history and political science at the University of Nicosia. \"Hezbollah also knows that if it acts on its threat and attacks Cyprus, the EU and Nato would very likely be brought into the conflict which it doesn't want either.\"\n\nBut for the EU's nearest state to the unfolding theatre of war, the unprecedented threat could not be ignored. \"This is the first serious challenge and the price Cyprus might have to pay for the pro-Israeli shift it has made in the last years,\" Faustmann said.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nCyprus is the starting point of a maritime corridor to Gaza under which aid is shipped to the U.S.-built pier and causeway.\n\nIsrael's war against Hamas in Gaza, now in its ninth month, has killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians who are facing widespread hunger.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- The fate of the latest cease-fire proposal hinges on Netanyahu and Hamas' leader in Gaza.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nPier for delivering vital aid to Gaza is functioning again\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nEU warns against threats against Cyprus from Hezbollah\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them

The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians who are facing widespread hunger.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- The fate of the latest cease-fire proposal hinges on Netanyahu and Hamas' leader in Gaza.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nPier for delivering vital aid to Gaza is functioning again\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nEU warns against threats against Cyprus from Hezbollah\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters,\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

Cypriot President Christodoulides and EU officials condemned the threats, highlighting Cyprus's role in regional stability. Lebanon's leaders sought to defuse tension through diplomatic engagements with Cypriot counterparts.\n\nCyprus reacted with incredulity on Thursday to warnings from Lebanon's Hezbollah that the island could be dragged into conflict if tensions with Israel blew up into a fully-fledged war. The EU member state closest to the Middle East, Cyprus was caught off guard by comments from Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah late on Wednesday that the island could be a target if it permitted Israel to use its military facilities in the event of an attack on Lebanon.\n\n\"The Republic of Cyprus is in no way involved in war conflict,\" Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides responded, describing Nasrallah's comments as \"not pleasant\". The EU also weighed in. \"Any threats against our member state are threats against the EU,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nLebanon's government appeared to try to contain any possible fallout from Nasrallah's comments. Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati contacted Christodoulides on Thursday to thank him for his measured diplomatic response, a Cypriot source said.\n\nForeign minister Abdallah Bou Habib also spoke to his Cypriot counterpart Constantinos Kombos to highlight Lebanon's \"continued reliance\" on the role Cyprus has played in regional stability, according to a statement by Bou Habib's office. A Lebanese diplomatic source told Reuters that the two had spoken \"to clarify matters\" but did not elaborate on how Lebanese officials had specifically addressed Nasrallah's threats.\n\nOfficials in Nicosia made clear they did not want to pursue the matter further. NEUTRAL IN SEA OF CONFLICT\n\nCyprus has always viewed itself as above Middle Eastern politics and offered sanctuary to tens of thousands of Lebanese fleeing civil war in the 1970s and 80s. It has lobbied its EU partners to offer Lebanon financial assistance, and recently set up a maritime corridor to dispatch humanitarian aid to famine-threatened Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\"Cyprus is a credible enabler of stability, and an acknowledged regional hub for humanitarian operations, based on excellent relations with all the countries in the region,\" said government spokesperson Konstantinos Letymbiotis. But it also comes against the backdrop of improved Cyprus ties with Israel, and the more visible involvement of British sovereign bases on the island in military operations in Syria and more recently, Yemen. The Israeli air force is also known to conduct exercises in Cyprus's airspace, and in recent years the two countries have conducted joint military drills.\n\nCypriots in the divided capital Nicosia said people had enough to deal with from the lingering complications of Turkey's invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup. \"Last night when I heard about the news, yes, I was worried,\" said Filios Christodoulou, 84.\n\nOthers were unfazed. \"We have nothing to do with this war,\" said Stella Patatini, 62. \"On the contrary, we are helping peace in the region and assistance to the Palestinians so I feel safe in Cyprus.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

That is where the \"Cypriot\" airports and bases to which Nasrallah was referring are located.\n\nPresident Christodoulides of Cyprus told reporters on Wednesday that \"Cyprus remains uninvolved in any military conflicts and positions itself as part of the solution rather than the problem.\"\n\nWhen asked if he would communicate with foreign leaders about these developments, Mr. Christodoulides said, \"Certainly, through the diplomatic channel. But, I repeat, what the Republic of Cyprus is doing is public, it is not in secret. The Republic of Cyprus is part of the solution and not part of the problem.\"\n\nMr. Christodoulides also said that \"Of course there is a channel of communication with both the government of Lebanon and the government in Iran.\"\n\nIn October, just weeks after Hamas's deadly attacks in southern Israel, Haaretz reported that dozens of American military planes were flying arms and equipment to Israel from Cyprus. An unspecified number of British cargo planes assisted with the airlift. Again, nothing unusual there: from August 2014 onward, America put Cyprus's strategic location to use in Operation Inherent Resolve to deter the Islamic State in northern Syria.\n\nSeveral weeks ago the former British armed services minister, James Heappey, stated that \"the purpose behind the bolstered presence of British troops in Cyprus is to support emergency plans and humanitarian efforts in the region.\"\n\nWere Nasrallah to initiate attacks against \"Cypriot airports and bases\" as retaliation against Israel, it would inevitably draw Great Britain into a regional war -- and potentially right before Britain heads to a general election on July 4.\n\nMeanwhile, when asked if he was worried by Nasrallah's statements, Mr. Christodoulidis said: \"The statements are not pleasant, but they do not respond in any way to what is being attempted, to present an image that Cyprus is involved in military operations.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

After some hard-fought matches, Cyprus emerged as winners, beating Slovakia (who they had played in their opening match of the pool stages) 19 - 12. This result means that Cyprus will be promoted to the Conference 1 division next season.\n\nThe squad that travelled was a mixture of experience and youth, led by Head Coach Marko Mladenovic assisted by Alex Zavallis-Roebuck, with Physio Lucy Wood and Team Manager Dave Lee making up the staff.\n\nA lot of hard work had been put in behind the scenes over the past 6 months by players and staff to make sure that Cyprus went in to the Championships in the best possible shape and with the best chance of coming away with a win. The players had been given a tough training program to follow which would get them in good physical condition for the rigors of tournament rugby in what turned out to be extremely warm conditions.\n\nA month ago, as part of the preparation for these Championships, Cyprus Rugby 7s entered Manor 7s in England which was part of the LIT 7s series. There they played 4 very tough games against top class opposition which was exactly what they wanted and demonstrated how tournament rugby feels over the course of a day.\n\nOnto Montenegro, and Cyprus was grouped together with Slovakia, Montenegro A and Kosovo, which meant 3 games to play on Day 1.\n\nCyprus opened the tournament with the first game v Slovakia, which resulted in a 24 - 22 victory. A close final score although the victory was never in doubt.\n\nAfter a break of 3 hours, the second pool game was v Montenegro A (the hosts). Cyprus tackled this game head-on from the off and never gave Montenegro an opportunity to get a foothold in the game. Some excellent team support play and a couple of individual pieces of skill to break the line and race away for a score meant that Cyprus won 38 - 21.\n\nAfter a further break, which is normal in tournament play, Cyprus played Kosovo in the final pool game of the day. A fast start saw Cyprus score a couple of early tries and with conversions they had a healthy lead going in to halftime. The second half saw Cyprus really put Kosovo under pressure whilst being clinical and showing that support play is hugely important in the 7s format, eventually running out winners with a final score of 35 - 0.\n\nDay 1 came to a close with only 2 of the 8 competing teams unbeaten, Estonia who topped Pool A and Cyprus who topped Pool B.\n\nThe Cyprus Squad, having played well on the pitch, now had to be as professional off the pitch in order to recover properly, refuel and rest so that they were fresh and ready to attack day 2 with the same application and commitment they had done on day 1.\n\nA review of the day's play was done by the coaching staff, which was then delivered in a team meeting with the squad to highlight a number of learning points and formulate how they wanted the team to play on day 2 in the semi final v Slovenia.\n\nDay 2 got under way with the ranking games for the teams that finished 3rd & 4th in the pools, then the first semi final, which was Estonia v Slovakia, and was won by Slovakia 10 - 0.\n\nNow it was Cyprus' turn for their semi final v Slovenia.\n\nCyprus made a racing start to the game and soon had a healthy lead which was never in danger. The players executed the game plan to the letter, playing with flair, moving the ball quickly, supporting each other in attack and seemingly scoring at will. A very powerful performance saw Cyprus run out winners with a final score of 25 - 0.\n\nThe last game of the day was the final, but that was some 4 \u00bd hours away, so the squad needed to manage themselves properly by resting, recovering and fueling correctly so that they would be 100% ready for the final against their opening game opposition, Slovakia who looked strong in their semi final.\n\nThe final kicked off and Cyprus immediately found their rhythm, exploiting gaps in the Slovakian defence to establish a 19 - 0 lead at half time. The second half was a long 7 minutes and saw Cyprus withstand pressure from Slovakia who scored two late tries with a conversion making the final score Cyprus 19 - Slovakia 12.\n\nThe final was won, and Cyprus were crowned Rugby Europe Conference 2 Champions 2024!\n\nAt the conclusion of the tournament, the pool of referees voted the Cyprus Captain, Marcus Holden, Player of the Tournament, which is a great honour for him personally and also a reflection of how the whole squad had performed across both days of the tournament, which helped him reach the heights of performance that he did.\n\nAcross the Championships, Cyprus scored a total of 23 tries, which is a reflection of the talent within the squad to finish off good approach play and make it count when it matters.\n\nAfter the presentation, Head Coach Marko said: \"What a feeling this weekend has been. Personally, it's up there with one of the best feelings I have ever felt being involved with Cyprus Rugby. Lifting that trophy this weekend was a massive achievement for everyone involved. As Coaches, myself and Zav want to thank the players and reiterate how proud we are of the way they went about their business, both on and off the field. They were united in everything they did, smiles on faces, adapted and solved challenges quickly and played with serious determination in both the semi and final.\"", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montenegro"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Montenegro"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kosovo"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar,_Montenegro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar, Montenegro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bar, Montenegro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Montenegro"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://cms.cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sevens.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659498", "eventUri": "eng-9659498", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

NATO member Greece, a key ally, said Cyprus and its people had its unwavering support.\n\n\"The threat of use of violence is a flagrant violation of the U.N. Charter,\" it said on X.\n\nCyprus has always viewed itself as above Middle Eastern politics and offered sanctuary to tens of thousands of Lebanese fleeing civil war in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nIt has lobbied its EU partners to offer Lebanon financial assistance, and recently set up a maritime corridor to dispatch humanitarian aid to famine-threatened Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\"Cyprus is a credible enabler of stability, and an acknowledged regional hub for humanitarian operations, based on excellent relations with all the countries in the region,\" said government spokesperson Konstantinos Letymbiotis.\n\nBut it also comes against the backdrop of improved Cyprus ties with Israel, and the more visible involvement of British sovereign bases on the island in military operations in Syria and more recently, Yemen. The Israeli air force is also known to conduct exercises in Cyprus's airspace, and in recent years the two countries have conducted joint military drills.\n\nCypriots in the divided capital Nicosia said people had enough to deal with from the lingering complications of Turkey's invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup.\n\n\"Last night when I heard about the news, yes, I was worried,\" said Filios Christodoulou, 84.\n\n\"We have nothing to do with this war,\" Stella Patatini, 62, said. \"On the contrary, we are helping peace in the region and assistance to the Palestinians so I feel safe in Cyprus.\"\n\n(Reporting by Michele Kambas, Marinos Meletiou and Yiannis Kourtoglou in Nicosia; Additional reporting by Maya Gebeily in Beirut; Writing by Michele Kambas;

But what is the current situation for those who have intentionally purchased stolen artworks to repatriate them, and what message does this give to the world, particularly those who have dedicated their lives to fighting for art justice? Should there be a financial condition on repatriating a country's stolen heritage?\n\nOn Tuesday, June 11, Cyprus' Synodal Committee issued a press release announcing that an agreement had been reached between Cypriot and German authorities for the repatriation of sixty ecclesiastical and prehistoric artefacts looted after the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974.\n\nAlthough the Church of Cyprus hailed the day as historic and joyful, marking the culmination of nearly three decades of efforts and legal battles, undisclosed sources have revealed the repatriation transaction involved Cyprus - and, in this case, His Eminence Porphyrios of Neapolis, Head of the Church of Cyprus Representation to the European Union - paying a sum of money to German authorities to reclaim Cyprus' stolen antiquities.\n\nI reached out to renowned Greek Cypriot cultural activist and author of the best-selling memoir, The Icon Hunter, and asked about her thoughts on the Church's recent declaration and the financial transaction behind their repatriation.\n\n\"There is something intuitively wrong - and foreign to the spirit of our times - about the idea of people in Cyprus being asked to pay for the repatriation of parts of their cultural and spiritual heritage, which were stolen in horrible circumstances,\" Tasoula Hadjitofi said.\n\n\"Many important Cypriot treasures remain in Germany, and people in Cyprus have a profoundly legitimate desire to see them all returned.\"\n\nHadjitofi is knowledgeable of the legal intricacies surrounding stolen artworks, as well as the time-consuming quest for art justice and repatriation, having spent most of her life combatting art trafficking. As an authorised representative of the ancient Church of Cyprus, former Honorary Consul of Cyprus in the Netherlands, and founder of Walk of Truth, a Dutch-based non-governmental organisation that combats cultural crime, Tasoula Hadjitofi followed procedure in January 2024 by requesting that German authorities facilitate the return of all the island's religious cultural artefacts in a detailed letter addressed to Germany's Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs, Annalena Baerbock.\n\nIn her letter, Hadjitofi recounted the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, the coordinated effort to steal Cyprus' cultural heritage, and her own participation in coordinating the 1997 'Munich Case', one of the largest art trafficking sting operations in European history. Tasoula also copied on her letter the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Nikos Christodoulides, the Archbishop of the Autocephalous Church of Cyprus, Georgios, and the German Ambassador to the Republic of Cyprus, Anke Schlimm.\n\nDespite Hadjitofi's continuous efforts and adherence to procedures, Bishop Porphyrios of Neapolis went ahead on his own accord and paid the German authorities for the restitution of Cyprus' stolen treasures. In addition to the money given by the Church, it has been reported that Cyprus' Department of Antiquities also contributed financially to the repatriation 'deal'. \"Cyprus' cultural heritage is not for sale. Paying for art repatriation is wrong and goes against ethical practices,\" Hadjitofi said. \"Moreover, should not one European neighbour to the next support justice rather than taking advantage of one nation's vulnerability,\" she added.\n\nTo acquire a better understanding of the broader context of how Cyprus' stolen antiquities ended up in Germany, and what led to Tasoula's involvement in combating art trafficking, as well as the life risks she encountered along the way, we need to go back fifty years. Tasoula, like many other Cypriots at the time, was forced to flee her home to escape the 1974 Turkish military invasion of Cyprus, eventually settling in a foreign country as a refugee.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the invasion, an organised operation was launched to steal icons, frescoes, and mosaics from Cyprus' centuries-old churches and religious sites, including some of the world's oldest and most magnificent samples of Christian art. Electric drills were employed on the walls of ancient churches to extract religious art that had served as a source of inspiration and hope for Cyprus' faithful populace, which was then sold internationally. \"The theft of these treasures was part of a horrific campaign of looting and plunder at the expense of people who were already suffering the dire consequences of the war,\" she added.\n\nIn the late nineties, Hadjitofi coordinated \"The Munich Case,\" one of the most extensive art trafficking sting operations in European history since World War II. During her intensive work, having worked closely with Archbishop Chrysostomos I of the Orthodox Church of Cyprus, as well as Dutch art dealers, Canadian sellers, and German detectives and police, Tasoula was at times compelled to play 'cat and mouse'. She was targeted by art traffickers; fearing for her own and her family's safety, she was forced to pay for private security.\n\nAfter a joint police operation by the German and Cypriot authorities in 1997 - an action which remains unique in the story of international efforts to combat cultural crime - over 5,000 artefacts were discovered hidden in the double ceilings and hollow floors of the Munich apartments of the late Aydin Dikmen, a Turkish dealer known as \"The Archaeologist.\"\n\n\"People in Cyprus were relieved when they learned that at least 350 of the 5,000 or so artefacts in Dikmen's hoard were antiquities stolen from the island. They were subsequently disappointed as I hope you can understand, when those products remained in Germany for a long time.\"\n\nAccording to Hadjitofi, 173 stolen artefacts from Cyprus were returned to the island in 2013 following a lengthy legal struggle. However, many significant Cypriot relics from Dikmen remain in Germany, \"and people in Cyprus have a profoundly legitimate desire to see their cultural heritage returned.\"\n\nThe German tax authorities have filed a claim against Dikmen's estate alleging that he failed to declare his profits from the sale of certain illegally trafficked cultural property while he was alive, thus preventing their repatriation. It was suggested that the Cypriot authorities settle this claim before repatriating the remaining objects. \"The taxes Dikmen owed were for the sale of Cypriot mosaics that had been ripped out of churches before he trafficked them abroad,\" Hadjitofi stated.\n\nBut the laws of buying stolen products are simple. When a thief sells a stolen artefact, the general rule is that whoever buys the item, regardless of the purchase price or the terms of the sale, does not obtain legal possession (good 'title') to it. This is because the thief never had a 'title' - and you cannot sell something you do not have. The original owner can take action to require the purchaser to return the artefact (or any damages to its value) to them.\n\nAcross the Western world, a new consensus emerged in support of the restitution of artefacts acquired illegally or immorally. Interestingly, Germany has been a leader in this effort, evidenced by the return of 20 Benin Bronzes in 2022, which were removed during an inhumane British colonial attack on Nigeria in 1897. Furthermore, it was even acknowledged that all the Benin Bronzes, which are currently displayed in German collections, belong to Nigeria.\n\nThe Ethnological Museum of Berlin eventually returned 23 relics confiscated from Namibia during Germany's colonial era. The Namibian returns were motivated by Germany's historical legacy, while the repatriation of the Benin Bronzes by British colonial forces exemplified universal moral norms.\n\n\"These values abhor the idea that people who are already enduring the consequences of war, anarchy, or alien domination, should have their suffering compounded by the loss of precious objects, which reflect their collective identity and spirituality,\" Hadjitofi stated. \"In the name of those values, I am calling on the German authorities to facilitate the return to Cyprus of all the religious and cultural artefacts that were stolen from our island, (with or without evidence of which Church they originated from), with no financial conditions attached.\"\n\nBut the question remains as to why Bishop Porphyrios of Neapolis went ahead on his own initiative by paying the German authorities for the return of some of Cyprus' stolen treasures, and what precedence is he setting with his actions. Does this imply that Greece will eventually have to purchase their own Parthenon Marbles from the United Kingdom if they wish to see their return, or that Egypt will have to buy back the iconic Rosetta Stone? Stolen or unlawfully removed antiquities should be returned to their rightful place of origin without financial compensation. Porphyrios' actions could potentially alter the narrative, justifying the act of purchasing stolen art.\n\nAnd, more importantly, how does this affect cultural activists like Tasoula who have dedicated their lives to repatriating art lawfully, and to counteract criminal activity through financial contributions from donors?\n\nTasoula Hadjitofi's Walk of Truth is the long-term extension of her four decades' work. Her independent, non-governmental organisation aims to counter the ongoing destruction and looting of cultural heritage by engaging the public and to spread awareness of the value of our shared patrimony and the responsibility of each of us to protect it. Among other things, it has set up a digital research facility containing thousands of documents from cases all over the world, including Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Iran, the Balkans, and Cyprus, for use in training, research, and education.\n\n\"Nothing would please us more, the people of Cyprus, than to see Germany sending or delivering these antiquities in Cyprus this year without financial expectations in return,\" Tasoula said. \"This year marks fifty years since the 1974 invasion and Germany could send a clear message of understanding and hope for sustainable peace through the return of our cultural antiquities.\"", "source": {"uri": "cyprustimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "cyprustimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Cyprus bemused by Hezbollah threats", "body": "NICOSIA (Reuters) - Cyprus reacted with incredulity on Thursday to warnings from Lebanon's Hezbollah that the island could be dragged into conflict if tensions with Israel blew up into a fully-fledged war.\n\nThe EU member state closest to the Middle East, Cyprus was caught off guard by comments from Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah late on Wednesday that the island could be a target if it permitted Israel to use its military facilities in the event of an attack on Lebanon.\n\n\"The Republic of Cyprus is in no way involved in war conflict,\" Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides responded, describing Nasrallah's comments as \"not pleasant\".\n\nThe EU also weighed in. \"Any threats against our member state are threats against the EU,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nCyprus has always viewed itself as above the politics of its neighbours and offered sanctuary to tens of thousands of Lebanese fleeing civil war in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nIt has lobbied its EU partners to offer Lebanon financial assistance, and recently set up a maritime corridor to dispatch humanitarian aid to famine-threatened Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\"Cyprus is a credible enabler of stability, and an acknowledged regional hub for humanitarian operations, based on excellent relations with all the countries in the region,\" said government spokesperson Konstantinos Letymbiotis.\n\nBut it also comes against the backdrop of improved ties with Israel, and the more visible involvement of British sovereign bases on the island in military operations in Syria and more recently, Yemen. The Israeli air force is also known to conduct exercises in Cyprus's airspace, and in recent years the two countries have conducted joint military drills.\n\nCypriots in the divided capital Nicosia said people had enough to deal with from the lingering complications of Turkey's invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup.\n\n\"Last night when I heard about the news, yes, I was worried,\" said Filios Christodoulou, 84.\n\nOthers were unfazed.\n\n\"We have nothing to do with this war,\" said Stella Patatini, 62. \"On the contrary, we are helping peace in the region and assistance to the Palestinians so I feel safe in Cyprus,\"", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group\u00b4s primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war.

Cyprus Bemused by Hezbollah Threats", "body": "NICOSIA (Reuters) - Cyprus reacted with incredulity on Thursday to warnings from Lebanon's Hezbollah that the island could be dragged into conflict if tensions with Israel blew up into a fully-fledged war.\n\nThe EU member state closest to the Middle East, Cyprus was caught off guard by comments from Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah late on Wednesday that the island could be a target if it permitted Israel to use its military facilities in the event of an attack on Lebanon.\n\n\"The Republic of Cyprus is in no way involved in war conflict,\" Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides responded, describing Nasrallah's comments as \"not pleasant\".\n\nThe EU also weighed in. \"Any threats against our member state are threats against the EU,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nCyprus has always viewed itself as above the politics of its neighbours and offered sanctuary to tens of thousands of Lebanese fleeing civil war in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nIt has lobbied its EU partners to offer Lebanon financial assistance, and recently set up a maritime corridor to dispatch humanitarian aid to famine-threatened Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\"Cyprus is a credible enabler of stability, and an acknowledged regional hub for humanitarian operations, based on excellent relations with all the countries in the region,\" said government spokesperson Konstantinos Letymbiotis.\n\nBut it also comes against the backdrop of improved ties with Israel, and the more visible involvement of British sovereign bases on the island in military operations in Syria and more recently, Yemen. The Israeli air force is also known to conduct exercises in Cyprus's airspace, and in recent years the two countries have conducted joint military drills.\n\nCypriots in the divided capital Nicosia said people had enough to deal with from the lingering complications of Turkey's invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup.\n\n\"Last night when I heard about the news, yes, I was worried,\" said Filios Christodoulou, 84.\n\nOthers were unfazed.\n\n\"We have nothing to do with this war,\" said Stella Patatini, 62. \"On the contrary, we are helping peace in the region and assistance to the Palestinians so I feel safe in Cyprus,\"\n\n(Reporting by Michele Kambas, Marinos Meletiou and Yiannis Kourtoglou, writing by Michele Kambas, Editing by Alex Richardson)",

Therefore, the statements made by the Hezbollah leader do not correspond with reality,\" he said.\n\nHe echoed what President Nikos Christodoulides said on Wednesday, namely that Cyprus is \"part of the solution and not part of the problem\" and insisted that the island is \"a pillar of peace and stability in the wider region\", while also adding that relations between the Republic and Lebanon are \"excellent\".\n\nHe went on to say that no country will be allowed by the government to carry out military operations on the island but did note the \"peculiarity\" of the existence of the British bases in Cyprus, which, he said, \"have a different status\".\n\nMeanwhile, Justice Minister Marios Hartsiotis said the measures taken by his ministry regarding matters such as terrorism are \"evaluated and updated daily\".\n\n\"It is self-evident and understandable that the statements [made by Nasrallah] are also evaluated and the measures taken are updated on a daily basis, according to the information at our disposal,\" he said.\n\nRetired lieutenant general Ioannis Baltzotis said Cyprus should \"always be concerned and take the appropriate measures\", given the fact that Hezbollah has a \"strong military and weapons systems\", which mean that it could theoretically hit Cyprus.\n\n\"I consider this threat to be a warning. All this started from the developments in Gaza and the decision taken by the Israeli government, that after finishing with Hamas, it will turn to Hezbollah,\" he said.\n\nHe pointed out that Hezbollah has put northern Israel under fire since the beginning of violence in Gaza last October, which has resulted in deaths on both sides and the displacement of almost 200,000 people.\n\n\"This situation may be a harbinger of a future war, the Israelis want to end every evil they have in their region,\" he said.\n\nHe also pointed out the \"unavoidable\" existence of the British bases but called for calm preparedness.\n\n\"Let us be restrained and take precautions, but as Nasrallah is a rational leader, he will not take things to extremes. Hitting Cyprus is like hitting the western powers. It is something he wants to avoid. I think the risk is probably small,\" he said.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz also reacted to Nasrallah's statements in a post on X, the social media platform better known as Twitter.\n\n\"Nasrallah threatens to attack Cyprus. Iranian missiles and extremist Islamic terrorism threaten European countries and the entire free world. We must stop Iran now before it's too late,\" he said.\n\nElsewhere, reaction was less than easily forthcoming.\n\nThe Cypriot and British defence ministries as well as the European Commission promised that statements would be made in due course, while a spokesperson for the Greek defence ministry told the Cyprus Mail they were \"not aware\" of the statements, and the Turkish defence ministry elected not to pass comment.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters,\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

It dealt with the economic crisis pragmatically and effectively and has taken initiatives on the geopolitical chessboard that serve not just its own interests, but also those of powerful international players, hence adding to its value.\n\nIt is in this framework of constant evolution that the cooperation between Nicosia and Washington just became that much closer.\n\nThe launching of a strategic dialogue between the two countries - following a meeting between foreign ministers Antony Blinken and Constantinos Kombos at the US State Department - comes as the natural extension of the Cypriot government's earlier targeted actions. This deepening and solidifying of cooperation both at the bilateral and multilateral level further confirms the existing - and mounting - momentum.\n\nThe value of Cyprus' geographical location is unquestionable. The ongoing situation in Gaza brought the strategic dimension of US-Cyprus cooperation back to the fore and upgraded the important role that Nicosia has been playing in recent months. On the diplomatic front, Cyprus has been playing a role that is far bigger than its size would indicate, such as with the humanitarian corridor getting aid to Gaza or offering use of its naval infrastructure, while also having managed to maintain close cooperation with Israel and excellent relations with the Arab world at the same time.\n\nWashington and Nicosia had signed a joint declaration of intent on security cooperation in 2018, while in the past year in particular, President Nikos Christodoulides has embarked on a bold and very close partnership with the FBI and other US agencies to crack down on financial crime and corruption. Given how things work on the island, this was not an easy task on the part of the Cypriot leader.\n\nIn addition, there is also the important dimension of energy. Given Washington's support for any effort at diversifying energy supply sources and the strategic partnership that is already in play, it makes sense that the two sides would be on the same page with regard to natural gas exploitation in Cyprus' exclusive economic zone, and especially if this is by American companies like Chevron. Cyprus' small size means that any investment by the US - in diplomacy, security, the economy and trade - however small, will bring much greater benefits to both sides.\n\nFinally, the launch of the strategic dialogue between the US and the Republic of Cyprus just days before the 50th anniversary of Turkey's invasion gives it added symbolic weight.\n\nCyprus Diplomacy Subscribe to our Newsletters\n\nEnter your information below to receive our weekly newsletters with the latest insights, opinion pieces and current events straight to your inbox.\n\nSIGN UP NOW Kathimerini may send occasional special offers and promotions.

The agreement sets in motion a structured dialogue between the two governments which will engage in high-level talks twice a year on a range of issues, including humanitarian crisis management, terrorism and security, energy, trade and investment and education.\n\nThe US has a formalised strategic dialogue with 30 countries of which 13 are EU member-states. Cyprus has now joined this club and Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that this development, \"is indicative of the further deepening and broadening of the relationship between the two countries in a number of ways.\" And as part of this deepening of the relationship, Cypriots could soon be able to travel to the US without a visa - it was reported that this would be one of the matters that would be discussed.\n\nThis is part of an ongoing strengthening of relations between Nicosia and Washington, made possible by Christodoulides' full cooperation on sanctions and combatting money laundering. He had asked for US help on these matters and invited the FBI and Justice Department to help the government investigate money laundering and sanction-violations in Cyprus, a move that underlined his commitment to cleaning up Cyprus' image. The role he played in promoting and facilitating the Amalthea corridor also went down well in Washington, according to government sources.\n\nThese decisions would have earned Washington's praise for another reason that nobody mentioned - they are certain to lead to the cooling of Nicosia's, until recently, close relations with Moscow, which were viewed with suspicion in the West. Deputy government spokesman Yiannis Antoniou, on Tuesday, dismissed suggestions that the strategic dialogue agreement with the US would not affect Cyprus' relations with other countries, but it is very clear it will, with country in particular - Russia.\n\nWe live in a polarised world, in which countries are increasingly being forced to take sides and Cyprus has chosen the West, something that is certain to negatively affect relations with the Russian Federation. We are, after all, too small a country to try to play both sides like Turkey had done for some time now. It is reassuring Christodoulides chose the West, after decades of close political and economic ties with Russia, which no other president ever dared to tamper with.\n\nChristodoulides avoided talking about the agreement in political terms, in a written statement in which he welcomed the signature of the agreement. He spoke instead about the possibility of visa-free travel and the good prospects for the economy, as the agreement could attract investment and boost trade relations.

We want to know what military operations [were] carried out over the past eight months [involving Cyprus], in the time during which Israel carried out a genocide against the Palestinians,\" Akel said on Tuesday.\n\nCyprus' \"subservience\" to the US does not constitute a geopolitical upgrade, but on the contrary raised the spectre of \"turning the island into a staging point for warfare, entailing immense risks for our people,\" Akel claimed.\n\nThe newly defined and formalised relationship with the US would bring benefits in a wide range of sectors for Cyprus, including the economy, as well as opening the possibility of ending the island's division with US support, Kombos reiterated while speaking to state broadcaster CyBC.\n\n\"It is not a matter of the US putting pressure,\" the minister explained, but more a matter of \"hitting on the solutions to break the deadlock.\"\n\nThere is a keen \"mood\" now among US officials to support the Republic in this task, Kombos said.\n\nThe minister once again brought up the Amalthea initiative, as well as previous successful rescue missions, such as the evacuation of US and other foreign nationals from Sudan and Israel, as the catalyst for Cyprus' boost in credibility within US circles.\n\nAs well as this, the Cyprus's faithful implementation of EU policy towards Russia and moves against corruption following that country's invasion of the Ukraine-something that had not been viewed as a given-has reassured Washington, he said.\n\nQuestioned on what precisely the US stands to gain from the intensified strategic partnership, Kombos pointed out that the Middle East is a region frequently in conflict and therefore the recent humanitarian and rescue missions were not just a windfall opportunity for the US to utilise the island as an operational base.\n\n\"The main aim of the Amalthea [corridor] was never just humanitarian, it was looking to the \"next day\" reconstruction in Gaza, following the brokering of a peace deal,\" Kombos said, indicating that its intent from the start had been for a longer-term collaboration.\n\nAs to how other states, such as Russia or the UK (which has bases on the island) would take the intensified alignment, Kombos noted that relations with the former had become by necessity \"less warm\" due to the Ukraine invasion.\n\nThe minister brushed off concerns that identification with US interests would be to the country's detriment in the region, saying that there was no question of Cyprus becoming anyone's \"satellite state\".", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType":

Press Office, Nicosia\n\nThe Christodoulides government continues on the path of the Anastasiades government in subordinating Cyprus to the strategic plans of the United States in the region through the deepening US-Cyprus military cooperation. This is the core of the Cyprus-US Strategic Dialogue as is evident from the public statements made and about which AKEL will request an official briefing at the level of the National Council and the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nAt the same time, it is clear that the Cyprus problem has been left out of the Cypriot government's discussions with Washington as if our country faces another greater danger to its security that the ongoing Turkish occupation.\n\nAccording to press reports in \"Phileleftheros\" newspaper, HellasJournal and ANT1live, the US Secretary of State also stated that \"over the past eight months, the US has learned about the strategic value of the island for military and humanitarian operations.\" This puts the Christodoulides government once again before the questions that AKEL has been raising for months and to which it has never responded.\n\nWhat are the military operations carried out \"over the last eight months\" in which Cyprus has been involved, i.e. during the period when Israel's ongoing genocide against the Palestinians has been raging?\n\nWhen will the Christodoulides government at long last reply to AKEL's questions about the US use of the British bases in support of Israel in its barbaric war in Gaza?\n\nIt also raises the relentless question of how it is possible for Mr. Christodoulides to declare himself a staunch defender of\n\ninternational law in the case of Ukraine, and at the same time to stand by the side of the Netanyahu government that is slaughtering an entire people?\n\nCyprus' subordination to the United States does not constitute a geopolitical upgrade or make our country a pillar of security, but quite the opposite is true. The involvement of the Republic of Cyprus in the further militarisation of the Eastern Mediterranean to serve the USA and its allies in the region is turning our island into an aggressive launching pad of war posing enormous dangers for our people. At the same time, it nullifies the credibility of Cyprus when it asserts respect for international law.\n\nMembers of the Special Operations Team of the Cypriot National Guard and U.S. Navy SEALs participate in a joint military training in Limassol, Cyprus, September 10, 2021.

However, Letibiotis noted that there is a peculiarity with the British Bases area, which has a different status, as they are sovereign and are British territory.", "source": {"uri": "en.protothema.gr", "dataType": "news", "title": "protothemanews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Christodoulides", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikos Christodoulides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constantine the Great"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Overseas Territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Metrology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Metrology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle_East", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle East", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://en.protothema.gr/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/marios-xartsiotis-1.jpg-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659498", "eventUri": "eng-9659498", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them

Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them

Tasoula also copied on her letter the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Nikos Christodoulides, the Archbishop of the Autocephalous Church of Cyprus, Georgios, and the German Ambassador to the Republic of Cyprus, Anke Schlimm.\n\nDespite Hadjitofi's continuous efforts and adherence to procedures, Bishop Porphyrios of Neapolis went ahead on his own accord and paid the German authorities for the restitution of Cyprus' stolen treasures. In addition to the money given by the Church, it has been reported that Cyprus' Department of Antiquities also contributed financially to the repatriation 'deal'. \"Cyprus' cultural heritage is not for sale. Paying for art repatriation is wrong and goes against ethical practices,\" Hadjitofi said. \"Moreover, should not one European neighbour to the next support justice rather than taking advantage of one nation's vulnerability,\" she added.\n\nTo acquire a better understanding of the broader context of how Cyprus' stolen antiquities ended up in Germany, and what led to Tasoula's involvement in combating art trafficking, as well as the life risks she encountered along the way, we need to go back fifty years. Tasoula, like many other Cypriots at the time, was forced to flee her home to escape the 1974 Turkish military invasion of Cyprus, eventually settling in a foreign country as a refugee.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the invasion, an organised operation was launched to steal icons, frescoes, and mosaics from Cyprus' centuries-old churches and religious sites, including some of the world's oldest and most magnificent samples of Christian art. Electric drills were employed on the walls of ancient churches to extract religious art that had served as a source of inspiration and hope for Cyprus' faithful populace, which was then sold internationally. \"The theft of these treasures was part of a horrific campaign of looting and plunder at the expense of people who were already suffering the dire consequences of the war,\" she added.\n\nIn the late nineties, Hadjitofi coordinated \"The Munich Case,\" one of the most extensive art trafficking sting operations in European history since World War II. During her intensive work, having worked closely with Archbishop Chrysostomos I of the Orthodox Church of Cyprus, as well as Dutch art dealers, Canadian sellers, and German detectives and police, Tasoula was at times compelled to play 'cat and mouse'. She was targeted by art traffickers; fearing for her own and her family's safety, she was forced to pay for private security.\n\nAfter a joint police operation by the German and Cypriot authorities in 1997 - an action which remains unique in the story of international efforts to combat cultural crime - over 5,000 artefacts were discovered hidden in the double ceilings and hollow floors of the Munich apartments of the late Aydin Dikmen, a Turkish dealer known as \"The Archaeologist.\"\n\n\"People in Cyprus were relieved when they learned that at least 350 of the 5,000 or so artefacts in Dikmen's hoard were antiquities stolen from the island. They were subsequently disappointed as I hope you can understand, when those products remained in Germany for a long time.\"\n\nAccording to Hadjitofi, 173 stolen artefacts from Cyprus were returned to the island in 2013 following a lengthy legal struggle. However, many significant Cypriot relics from Dikmen remain in Germany, \"and people in Cyprus have a profoundly legitimate desire to see their cultural heritage returned.\"\n\nThe German tax authorities have filed a claim against Dikmen's estate alleging that he failed to declare his profits from the sale of certain illegally trafficked cultural property while he was alive, thus preventing their repatriation. It was suggested that the Cypriot authorities settle this claim before repatriating the remaining objects. \"The taxes Dikmen owed were for the sale of Cypriot mosaics that had been ripped out of churches before he trafficked them abroad,\" Hadjitofi stated.\n\nBut the laws of buying stolen products are simple. When a thief sells a stolen artefact, the general rule is that whoever buys the item, regardless of the purchase price or the terms of the sale, does not obtain legal possession (good 'title') to it. This is because the thief never had a 'title' - and you cannot sell something you do not have. The original owner can take action to require the purchaser to return the artefact (or any damages to its value) to them.\n\nAcross the Western world, a new consensus emerged in support of the restitution of artefacts acquired illegally or immorally. Interestingly, Germany has been a leader in this effort, evidenced by the return of 20 Benin Bronzes in 2022, which were removed during an inhumane British colonial attack on Nigeria in 1897. Furthermore, it was even acknowledged that all the Benin Bronzes, which are currently displayed in German collections, belong to Nigeria.", "source": {"uri": "fastforward.com.cy", "dataType": "news",

It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Cyprus Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nCyprus is the starting point of a maritime corridor to Gaza under which aid is shipped to the U.S.-built pier and causeway.\n\nIsrael's war against Hamas in Gaza, now in its ninth month, has killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians who are facing widespread hunger.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- The fate of the latest cease-fire proposal hinges on Netanyahu and Hamas' leader in Gaza.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nPier for delivering vital aid to Gaza is functioning again\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nEU warns against threats against Cyprus from Hezbollah\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with ''a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is ''totally groundless.''\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation ''is not part of the problem'' but ''part of the solution'' thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has ''approved and validated'' plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters,", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway", "type": "wiki",

He urged everyone who is concerned about the great cost of the green transition, to take into consideration the cost that we will have to bear as a state or as businesses, as households, as a society, in general, if we do not act collectively immediately.\n\nHe also said that another major goal he has set since the beginning of his administration is \"to safeguard the name of Cyprus as a reliable business and financial centre\", adding that \"from the very first moment, we have been working in cooperation always with the supervisory bodies, but also with the technical support of internationally reliable authorities, to safeguard the name of our country\".\n\nAlso, the President of the Republic said that the government pledge for the rebranding of Cyprus is progressing and we are working to \"present our country as an ideal business and investment destination\".\n\nThe President of the Republic also said that we are facing challenges, such as digitalisation, the emergence of new technologies, climate change, the demographic crisis and the aging of the population, with all the consequences in the sectors of the economy, while in relation to the rapid digital transition, which crucially touches the competitiveness of our country, as he said, \"we must ensure that both the state and Cypriot businesses will successfully adapt to this new one reality.\"", "source":

And we urgently need bold steps to further integrate our Single Market in crucial areas such as capital markets, energy and telecoms\" he stressed.\n\nCyprus third in EU funding on research per capita\n\n\"Cyprus clearly recognises the key importance of research and innovation for economic growth and social prosperity\", Breton said responding to a question on assessing the progress made in the country after the creation in recent years of the Deputy Ministry for Research and Innovation.\n\nThe Commissioner recalled that key actions under the new Deputy Ministry include the design and early implementation of a Research and Innovation Strategy for the period 2024 - 2026, \"which aims to cultivate R&I culture, upgrade the national research capacity for sustainable development and facilitate the exploitation and commercialisation of research results\".\n\n\"The implementation of this Strategy will help solidify some of the key innovation strengths of the country while addressing the need to increase R&D (Research & Development) investment in Cyprus\" he said.\n\nHe noted that NextGenerationEU and Horizon Europe, the EU research and innovation programme, offer significant opportunities, and that so far Cyprus \"has attracted more than 243 million euro in funding from Horizon Europe\". \"In EU contribution per inhabitant, Cyprus is in 3rd position with 194 euro per inhabitant\" he stressed.\n\nThe Commissioner underlined that he wants to sent the message to all EU countries that Europe has \"incredible assets\", such as \"highly qualified engineers, excellence in research, quality infrastructure, a solid manufacturing base and a strong services sector\", adding \"let's make the most of it!\"\n\n\"Some will tell us that we should focus on research or produce well-established technology, and leave the commercialisation of ground-breaking advanced technology to others. But, be it clean technologies, semiconductors, quantum or artificial intelligence, I am convinced that we now have the vision and the means to lead on the markets of the future!\" he stressed.\n\nCyprus is active in EU projects for the defence industry\n\nThe Commissioner for the Internal Market was also asked how Cyprus could contribute in the wider effort to develop Europe's defence industry, and even though he avoided to refer to specific sectors, he noted that the important thing is for Cypriot companies to participate in the european ecosystem, adding that this is already happening.\n\n\"It's not for me to tell Cypriot companies which domain they should invest into. But I can tell them: 'be part of the European defence industry ecosystem'\", Breton stressed.\n\nHe added that already the EU's instruments for supporting defence industry competitiveness and innovation, especially the European Defence Fund, have \"so far funded 17 Cypriot companies with about 25 million euro, for their participation in 35 projects\".\n\n\"Cypriot companies were present in 16% of the projects we have funded\", a share which corresponds to \"25 out of 220\" as the Commissioner said.\n\nBreton pointed out that the new European Defence Investment Programme will prolong this support for industrialization and production ramp-up, and that the Commission has proposed a 1.5 billion euro budget until 2027.\n\n\"So there are opportunities to seize, either to increase Cypriot industrial capability building (through joint procurement for instance) and for Cypriot industries (by supporting industry along the supply chain)\" he explained.\n\nCypriots recognise the dangers of disinformation\n\nCypriots realise that disinformation is the most serious threat to democracy and that they are likely to encounter it on social media, Thierry Breton commented responding to a question on how the EU can help in practice in dealing with issues such as low media literacy, narratives amplified by political populism and the under-staffing of media organisations.\n\n\"Disinformation is a complex phenomenon. It has always existed in the offline world, but the digital era has allowed disinformation to proliferate and flourish online, especially on social media platforms\" Breton noted, referring to the impact disinformation can have on the ability of citizens to take informed decisions, ultimately eroding trust in democracies.\n\n\"And citizens know it. According to the Eurobarometer, Cypriots see disinformation as the most serious threat to democracy and believe they are most likely to encounter disinformation on online social networks\" he added.\n\nThis is the reason, he continued, that the Commission has from the beginning of its mandate acted \"to equip ourselves with the tools to fight online disinformation effectively. This is a key priority for us\".\n\nAs a first example, Breton referred to the Digital Services Act (DSA) with which \"we have put in place a regulatory framework to make sure that online platforms have a legal responsibility to address the risk of disinformation and do their job effectively\".\n\n\"The fight against disinformation is key in our enforcement of the DSA and we have already started enforcement actions against X (Twitter), Facebook and Instagram\" he added.\n\n\"Second, we are working to support media freedom and pluralism to offer our citizens a more robust and resilient media environment, capable of withstanding the pressures of disinformation and providing with reliable information sources\" continued the Commissioner for the Internal Market.\n\n\"We do this with regulatory tools, such as the European Media Freedom Act, but also funding instruments with a budget more than 70 million euro for the period 2021 - 2027\" he explained.\n\n\"We also support media literacy practitioners, independent fact-checkers and academic researchers through the financing of the European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO), whose work is crucial to debunk and expose false claims, provide more insight in the phenomenon of disinformation and support media literacy initiatives\" he also said.\n\nLast but not least, he noted, the Commission works with Member States and other stakeholders \"to promote measures for the development of media literacy and digital skills, ensuring that citizens of all ages can effectively use, understand, and critically assess online content\".\n\nBreton pointed out that the EU funds several media literacy projects through the Erasmus and the Creative Europe Programme, and that through its Digital Decade strategy the EU has set a target to have 80% of the population with at least a basic level of digital skills in 2030.\n\nCyprus is strongly committed to this objective with 22 million euro of planned investments, of which 14 million euro will be supported by the EU with the Recovery and Resilience Facility, Breton said.", "source": {"uri": "cbn.com.cy", "dataType": "news", "title": "Israeli Fattal Hotel Group presents

We want to know what are the military operations carried out 'over the last eight months' which Cyprus was involved in, that is, during the time period that Israel has been carrying out a genocide against the Palestinians.\"\n\nAkel also demanded answers regarding the use of the British bases here by the United States \"in supporting Israel in the barbaric war it wages in Gaza\".\n\nThe statement added: \"How can Mr Christodoulides state that he is a defender of international law when it comes to Ukraine, while at the same time he stands by the Netanyahu government that is steeping an entire people in bloodshed?\"\n\nAkel said Cyprus' \"subservience\" to the United States \"does not constitute a geopolitical upgrade, nor does it make our country a pillar of stability.\n\n\"To the contrary - the involvement of the Republic of Cyprus in the further militarisation of the eastern Mediterranean to serve the interests of the United States and its regional allies, turns our island into a staging point for warfare, entailing immense risks for our people.\"", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Christodoulides", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikos Christodoulides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_(Switzerland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Council (Switzerland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Mediterranean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Mediterranean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle_East", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle East", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Educational_and_Academic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Educational and Academic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Simulations", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Simulations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic Management", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://cms.cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AKEL.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659498", "eventUri": "eng-9659498", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

through responsible and rational policies and approaches - to make Cyprus' economy one of the top performers in the European Union in terms of economic performance\".\n\nThis, he continued, \"is confirmed by the upgrades of the Cypriot economy by two major international rating agencies in the last two weeks\".\n\n\"Our country recorded the highest acceleration in the Eurozone and the entire European Union, with a growth rate of 3.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the EU average growth rate of just 0.4 per cent,\" he added.\n\nRegarding the years 2024 and 2025, President Christodoulides said that growth is expected to strengthen compared to 2023, unemployment is projected to continue its downward trend, and inflation will keep decelerating.\n\nAt the same time, he mentioned that \"significant public debt reduction is being achieved, aiming to reduce it to below 60 per cent of GDP by 2026\".\n\nConcerning the recent issuance of a seven-year bond worth \u20ac1 billion on international markets with an interest rate of 3.25 per cent and a yield of 3.31 per cent, President Christodoulides said \"the strong interest from international and domestic investors quickly translated into a book of offers amounting to \u20ac9.6 billion, allowing the process to be completed swiftly with positive results for the Republic\".\n\n\"This issuance and its results demonstrate international investors' confidence in the resilience and dynamism of the Cypriot economy, complementing the corresponding view of international rating agencies that have upgraded the Republic of Cyprus in the past two weeks,\" he added.\n\nThe president also stressed that \"with this successful issuance, executed in a challenging international environment marked by significant volatility and political turmoil affecting capital markets, the Republic of Cyprus proves its ability to continue financing its needs without issues and at a reasonable cost, ensuring the country's long-term economic prospects\".\n\nRegarding the agreement with the USA to institutionalise a strategic dialogue between the two countries, the President noted that it \"enhances our country's international standing, the status of the Republic of Cyprus, and provides a stable foundation for advancing our interests in security, defence, energy, research, and especially the economy, where there are vast opportunities\".\n\nSpecifically, he said that \"the agreement provides for dialogue on cooperation in trade, investment, and development, areas whose importance we all understand to create a more resilient, competitive economy\".\n\nAdditionally, Christodoulides said that Cyprus' high-quality professional infrastructure in the fields of administrative and advisory services is internationally recognised.\n\n\"Our vision includes, among other things, the modernisation of our tax system, a long-standing position of ICPAC, as the last transformation occurred in 2002,\" he explained.\n\n\"The main pillars are to increase our country's competitiveness, reduce the administrative burden for taxpayers and businesses, and provide fairer redistribution of the tax burden, with an emphasis on the middle class, which has traditionally been the backbone of Cyprus' economy and society,\" he added.\n\nAt the same time, he continued by saying \"we aim to align our tax policies with the goals of the European Green Deal as part of the green tax reform, addressing the enormous challenges of climate change, whose consequences we experience daily\".\n\nHe stated that the green tax reform would undoubtedly contribute to achieving the country's climate goals and \"will help address some distortions in the economy, changing habits in polluting sectors such as transport, energy, and water, while promoting the circular economy\".\n\nMoreover, he noted that it would boost innovation and green investments in energy, environmental protection, and waste reduction.\n\n\"Our roadmap to the green transition is very specific, and we must all contribute to its implementation because, as I repeat, the impacts of climate change are not distant; they are here,\" he said.\n\n\"We must acknowledge this and, unfortunately, we have been delayed,\" he added.\n\nReferring to current issues, the President mentioned air conditioning in schools, fires, and migration, adding that \"all these are directly related to climate change.\"\n\n\"Think about the impact on our tourism with the temperatures in Cyprus, how it will affect tourism. Consider the pressure on the healthcare system due to all the factors I mentioned,\" he said, adding that \"the impacts are here\".\n\n\"We must move clearly faster; we were slow to realise the challenges of climate change,\" the president stressed.\n\n\"Since some speak of the high cost of the green transition\", he continued, \"what I urge us to consider is that any short-term cost we bear will be significantly lower than the cost we would have to undertake as a state, as businesses, as households, as a society if we do not act collectively and immediately\".\n\nHe also mentioned that another major goal set from the beginning of his administration is \"the safeguarding of Cyprus's reputation as a reliable business and financial centre\".\n\n\"From the outset, we have been working in cooperation with supervisory bodies, as well as with the technical support of international credible authorities, to protect our country's reputation,\" he added.\n\n\"We all need to approach this matter with absolute seriousness and with specific actions, such as the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism for administrative service providers, to overturn a prevailing perception about our country,\" he noted.\n\nAt this point, Christodoulides thanked the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Cyprus (ICPAC) for its contribution to this effort, particularly in the effort to establish a Single Supervisory Mechanism.\n\n\"We must see this great challenge as an opportunity to eliminate any shadow over business activities in our country,\" he said.\n\n\"It was precisely within this context that we dared - we were criticised, I know, not publicly, but in discussions - to seek the assistance of the US authorities because we need to resolve all these cases, especially those that have come to light and created problems for our country,\" he added.\n\nMoreover, the President said that the implementation of the Government's announcements \"for the rebranding of Cyprus, based on real data and not communication tactics, to present our country as an ideal business and investment destination\" is proceeding.\n\n\"Just last month, the relevant tender was announced to secure the necessary advisory services, and very soon we will invite you to contribute and participate in this great effort,\" he added.\n\nThe president also said that we face challenges such as digitalisation, the emergence of new technologies, climate change, the demographic crisis, and the ageing population, with all the consequences in the economic sectors.\n\nRegarding the rapid digital transition, which critically affects our country's competitiveness, he said that \"we must ensure that both the state and Cypriot businesses successfully adapt to this new reality\".\n\n\"And it is precisely within this context that we promote the digital citizen in practice and not in words,\" he said, adding that \"the digital citizen is just one of the government's initiatives, expected to be operational from September 2024, and will be used as a new tool for citizen interaction with the state\".\n\nAccording to Christodoulides, an application will be developed to digitise and store official documents such as driving licenses, biometric identity cards, and vehicle suitability documents in digital form. This initiative will gradually expand to include all government-issued documents.\n\n\"It is unacceptable in 2024 to go to a public service and be asked for a copy of a document issued by the same service,\" he noted.\n\nMoreover, the president assured ICPAC that the government is here to listen to the association, cooperate with it, and \"identify effective solutions to the common challenges our country faces\".\n\nMoreover, in her address read by MP Christiana Erotokritou, House Speaker Annita Demetriou highlighted \"the importance of the collaboration between the legislative body and ICPAC and the continuation of our effort to formulate the appropriate legislative frameworks that will support the association and accountants in general, aiming to shape the appropriate legislative framework for the development of the Cypriot economy\".\n\nShe also thanked the association \"for its cooperation and contribution so far,\" as with its suggestions, she said, \"it has played a significant role in discussions on relevant bills and law proposals\".\n\n\"The state, recognising the significant role of ICPAC, has granted it further responsibilities under Article 113 of the Auditors Law of 2017, as the only body of accountants recognised by the Council of Ministers,\" she added.\n\nShe also mentioned that in its sixty-three years of operation, the association has continually supported its members, providing them with the necessary guidance and support, encouraging lifelong learning and continuous education regarding their professional activities.\n\nAdditionally, Erotokritou, speaking on behalf of the House Speaker, said that \"since the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus, the Cypriot economy has faced enormous challenges\", referencing a number of events, including the recent war in Ukraine and the conflict in Israel.\n\n\"In this fluid economic environment, the role of accountants is significant,\" she stated, adding that \"with your valuable knowledge, you have the power to provide solutions to many issues that concern both the state and the business world, acting as the connecting link between taxpayers, businesses, and the government machinery\".\n\n\"The profession of a certified accountant constitutes a profession with such demands that daily require the demonstration of reliability, integrity, and transparency,\" Demetriou concluded.\n\nFurthermore, in his speech, ICPAC president Nikos Cheimaridis stressed that \"what will determine our immediate future is unquestionably the advancement of technology and the application of artificial intelligence, the green transition together with sustainable development and the circular economy, while social changes also play a crucial role\".\n\nHe added that within this context, he includes migration and social integration, opportunities for quality employment, demographic trends, and pensions.\n\n\"There is a need for action, tangible evidence, and decisiveness from both the State, the House of Representatives, the business community, and social bodies,\" he said, adding that \"it is imperative that we work collectively, both the public and private sectors, to establish connections with the productive sectors of the economy, academia, and civil society\".\n\nReferring to the course of the Cypriot economy, Cheimaridis said that the growth rate of the economy in the first quarter of 2024 amounted to 3.5 per cent of GDP, \"a very encouraging fact,\" he said.\n\nIn terms of inflation and unemployment, he noted that both are showing noticeable deceleration, adding that \"the positive course of the economy is also evident from the improvement in the fiscal situation, with the appearance of a significant fiscal surplus and the reduction of public debt\".\n\n\"We have an obligation to closely and soberly monitor geopolitical and geostrategic developments in our broader geographical region, but also at a global level,\" he said.\n\n\"Risks are looming, while our strong deterrents should be political and economic diplomacy, through strong alliances and a robust economic background,\" he added.\n\nHe also said that the reopening of the Amalthea sea corridor \"will significantly contribute to the desired political outcome\".\n\nReferring to three very important and recent factors that allow the Cypriot economy to look \"more optimistically towards the near and medium-term future,\" the ICPAC president said that these are the initiation of a strategic dialogue between Cyprus and the USA, the upgrade of the economy by international rating agencies, and the reduction of interest rates by the European Central Bank.\n\nReferring to the establishment of a credible policy and economic diplomacy, Cheimaridis emphasised the need to succeed in restoring the country's reputation and credibility, advancing the national long-term strategic development of the economy under 'Vision 2035', transforming the tax system, attracting foreign investment, enhancing professional services, and implementing reforms.\n\nRegarding the need to restore the reputation and credibility of the country, Cheimaridis said that the association supports efforts for rebranding and is ready to assist in this effort, both institutionally as an association and as professionals.\n\nHowever, he added that \"good intentions are not enough because tangible actions are needed\".\n\nIn this context, Cheimaridis supported the establishment of the Unified Supervisory Authority, stating that it would enhance the effectiveness and comprehensiveness of monitoring the quality of foreign direct investment flows to Cyprus and the investors themselves.\n\nThis would be achieved by applying corresponding European Directives, including sanctions and anti-money laundering measures.\n\nAdditionally, it would reinforce the framework for coordination, cooperation, and management of supervisable cases by individual supervisory authorities.\n\nSpeaking about the implementation of tax transformation, Cheimaridis expressed the satisfaction of the association, stating that \"for the project to have substance and results, it is necessary to examine the entire system horizontally, strengthening its flexibility and simplicity on the one hand, and on the other, inoculating it with modern international practices, provisions, and technological upgrades\".\n\nHe also said that the way for the system to survive is \"to find the golden mean that will maintain the necessary balances, giving proper incentives to taxpayers, while preventing any erosion of public finances\".\n\nRegarding the association, Cheimaridis said that ICPAC \"is one of the main contributors to the country's financial ecosystem with an active and substantive contribution to a significant range of issues, always working with objectivity, professionalism, technical knowledge, and selflessness\".\n\nHe added that ICPAC is gradually advancing further in the development of its administrative structure and technical infrastructure, \"to be able to perform the roles entrusted to us by our members and the responsibilities placed on us by the state\".\n\n\"We will continue to stand by ministries and many other government departments and parliamentary committees on various issues, such as bills, proposals, recommendations, and joint work,\" he concluded.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Christodoulides", "type":

This year's rise was due to improvements in the subcategories of public finances, boosted by surpluses, and the institutional framework, such as upgrading the country's credit rating, and a gradual reduction of bureaucracy.\n\nOn the other hand, Cyprus' ranking slightly worsened in the subcategories of tax policy (e.g., tax revenues as a percentage of GDP), the legislative framework for businesses (e.g., legislation for employing foreign labour, threat to business activities from state ownership of enterprises), and the social framework (e.g., shrinkage of income for poorer households, gender inequalities).\n\nDespite the deterioration, Cyprus continues to excel against most countries in criteria such as redundancy costs, new business density, corporate tax rates, and personal taxation. In the business efficiency category,\n\nIn this regard, Cyprus remained stagnant in 2024, being ranked 55th among all evaluated countries, the same position it held in 2023.\n\nThis year's ranking identifies serious weaknesses in criteria related to businesses' awareness of changing market conditions, the ability of boards of directors to exercise effective control, the use of large databases and analytics in business decision-making, and the country's branding abroad.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, Cyprus ranks 42nd out of 67 countries, remaining at the same level as in 2023.\n\nThe greatest deterioration was noted in the basic infrastructure subcategory, where the country ranks among the worst, due to worsening criteria related to water resource management and urban management, as well as serious deficiencies in energy infrastructure and production.\n\nFurthermore, in 2024, Cyprus showed improvement in the technological infrastructure subcategory, as weaknesses identified in previous assessments, such as the low percentage of mobile broadband subscribers and inadequate cybersecurity, seem to be gradually being addressed. The country continues to excel against most countries in ICT service exports.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Institute_for_Management_Development", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Institute for Management Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foreign direct investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixed capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real versus nominal value (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate social responsibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Migrant worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water resources"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially_Responsible", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially Responsible", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_and_Society", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business and Society", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cms.cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cyprus-Business-Now-Limassol-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659498", "eventUri": "eng-9659498", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

This article examines the numerous benefits of setting up an EMI in Cyprus, highlighting key aspects such as regulatory advantages, tax incentives, business environment, and strategic positioning within the European Union. Additionally, this article highlights AGPLAW, a leading law firm in Cyprus that specializes in fintech and financial services regulatory support.\n\nAGPLAW offers comprehensive services, including EMI licensing and ongoing legal assistance, ensuring that EMIs receive expert guidance and support throughout their operational journey. With AGPLAW's expertise, EMIs can navigate the complexities of the regulatory landscape, achieve compliance, and drive long-term success.\n\nCyprus is a member of the European Union (EU), which means that an EMI licensed in Cyprus can passport its services across all EU and European Economic Area (EEA) member states. This EU passporting ability is a significant advantage, allowing EMIs to operate seamlessly across multiple jurisdictions without needing additional licenses.\n\nCentral Bank of Cyprus (CBC)\n\nThe Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) is the primary regulatory authority overseeing EMIs. The CBC provides a clear and robust regulatory framework that aligns with EU directives, such as the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) and the Electronic Money Directive (EMD). This alignment ensures that Cypriot EMIs adhere to high regulatory standards, enhancing their credibility and trustworthiness.\n\nStreamlined Licensing Process\n\nThe licensing process for EMIs in Cyprus is relatively streamlined compared to other EU jurisdictions. The CBC offers detailed guidance and support throughout the application process, which typically involves the submission of a business plan, organizational structure, risk management policies, and proof of capital adequacy. The CBC may only authorize electronic money institutions if they are legal entities incorporated within the Republic, where their headquarters and registered office must be located. Additionally, a portion of their business must involve electronic money services and/or payment services that are not directly related to the issuance of electronic money.\n\nThe supportive regulatory environment expedites the establishment of EMIs, reducing bureaucratic hurdles and time-to-market. For expert assistance during the licensing process, AGPLAW provides comprehensive licensing services and regulatory support.\n\nCompliance and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Measures\n\nCyprus has stringent AML regulations, ensuring that EMIs operate with high levels of transparency and integrity. Compliance with AML directives not only protect the EMI's reputation but also fosters trust among clients and partners. The CBC's rigorous enforcement of AML measures further ensures that Cyprus remains a safe and secure financial hub. AGPLAW offers specialized AML compliance services to help EMIs maintain regulatory standards and mitigate risks.\n\nCyprus offers one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the EU, currently set at 12.5%. This competitive tax rate significantly reduces the overall tax burden on EMIs, enhancing their profitability and enabling them to reinvest in growth and innovation.\n\nDouble Taxation Treaties\n\nCyprus has an extensive network of double taxation treaties (DTTs) with over 60 countries. These treaties prevent the double taxation of income, ensuring that EMIs benefit from reduced withholding taxes on dividends, interest, and royalties. The DTT network enhances Cyprus' attractiveness as a base for international business operations.\n\nTax Exemptions and Incentives\n\nIn addition to the low corporate tax rate, Cyprus offers various tax exemptions and incentives for EMIs. These include exemptions on dividend income, capital gains, and profits from the disposal of securities. Such incentives make Cyprus a tax-efficient jurisdiction for EMIs, fostering an environment conducive to business growth and financial stability.\n\nVAT Exemptions on Financial Services\n\nFinancial services, including those provided by EMIs, are generally exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) in Cyprus. This exemption reduces the cost of providing financial services and enhances the competitiveness of Cypriot EMIs in the European market.\n\nCyprus' strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa makes it an ideal base for EMIs looking to serve diverse markets. The island's proximity to major economic hubs facilitates business expansion and fosters international trade and investment opportunities.\n\nHigh-Quality Financial Infrastructure\n\nCyprus boasts a sophisticated financial infrastructure, with a well-developed banking system, modern payment networks, and a plethora of financial services providers. This infrastructure supports the efficient operation of EMIs, enabling them to offer innovative and reliable financial products to their clients.\n\nSkilled Workforce\n\nThe availability of a highly skilled and multilingual workforce is another key advantage of establishing an EMI in Cyprus. The country's education system produces a steady stream of graduates with expertise in finance, technology, and business management. This talent pool ensures that EMIs have access to the skills and knowledge necessary to drive innovation and growth. AGPLAW's talent acquisition and recruitment team can assist EMIs in employing skilled personnel at all levels and positions.\n\nBusiness-Friendly Legal System\n\nCyprus has a business-friendly legal system based on English common law, which is widely recognized and respected internationally. The legal framework provides a high degree of certainty and protection for businesses, facilitating smooth and efficient operations for EMIs.\n\nRobust ICT Infrastructure\n\nCyprus has made significant investments in its Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure. The country's advanced telecommunications networks and high-speed internet connectivity support the digital operations of EMIs, enabling them to offer seamless and secure electronic money services to their clients.\n\nStrategic Positioning within the European Union\n\nAccess to the European Single Market\n\nAs an EU member state, Cyprus offers EMIs unrestricted access to the European Single Market, one of the largest and most lucrative markets in the world. This access allows Cypriot EMIs to offer their services to over 500 million consumers, providing vast opportunities for business growth and expansion.\n\nHarmonized Regulatory Standards\n\nCyprus adheres to harmonized EU regulatory standards, ensuring that EMIs based in Cyprus comply with the same rules and regulations as their counterparts in other EU member states. This harmonization simplifies cross-border operations and enhances the credibility of Cypriot EMIs in the European market. The issuance and management of electronic money (e-money) are governed by the Electronic Money Laws of 2012 and 2018.\n\nThese laws integrate essential EU directives into Cypriot national legislation, establishing a regulated e-money market in the country. They specifically implement Directive 2009/110/EC, which ensures that electronic money institutions adhere to sound business practices and supervisory standards, and the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) of 2015, aimed at improving payment services throughout the EU.\n\nEU Funding and Support Programs\n\nEMIs in Cyprus can benefit from various EU funding and support programs aimed at fostering innovation, digital transformation, and business development. These programs provide financial assistance, grants, and resources to help EMIs enhance their services and expand their market reach.\n\nAGPLAW: Your Partner in Setting Up an EMI in Cyprus\n\nAGPLAW is a leading law firm in Cyprus with a dedicated focus on fintech and financial services regulatory matters.\n\nThe firm provides comprehensive services to EMIs, including:\n\nLicensing Support\n\nAs a law firm, we offer comprehensive support throughout the entire application process. Our services include consulting on organizational structure, preparing initial drafts of business plans, advising on business models and investment services, and assisting with the payment of fees to the CBC. We also prepare and submit the Promoter's Application File, including necessary forms, questionnaires, and documentation, followed by continuous correspondence and support regarding any inquiries related to the application process, ensuring a smooth and efficient licensing process\n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance\n\nThe firm's extensive 20-year knowledge of local and EU regulations ensures that EMIs remain compliant with all legal requirements. AGPLAW offers ongoing legal and regulatory support, helping EMIs manage their compliance obligations effectively.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering (AML) Services\n\nAGPLAW provides specialized AML compliance services, helping EMIs develop and implement robust AML policies and procedures. This ensures that EMIs operate within the regulatory framework and maintain the highest standards of transparency and integrity.\n\nStrategic Advisory\n\nThe firm offers strategic advisory services, guiding EMIs on business development, market expansion, and regulatory changes. AGPLAW's insights and expertise help EMIs with respect to the complexities of the financial services industry and achieve sustainable growth.\n\nBy partnering with AGPLAW, EMIs can leverage their extensive experience and deep understanding of the Cypriot regulatory environment to establish a successful and compliant operation.\n\nRevolut, a leading fintech company, successfully expanded its operations to Cyprus, leveraging the country's favorable regulatory and business environment. The company's Cypriot EMI license enabled it to offer a wide range of financial services to EU customers, contributing to its rapid growth and market penetration. AGPLAW provided essential legal and regulatory support throughout Revolut's expansion process.\n\nSuccess Story: Payoneer's Strategic Move\n\nPayoneer, a global payment solutions provider, chose Cyprus as a key location for its European operations. The company's decision was influenced by Cyprus' advantageous tax regime, strategic location, and robust financial infrastructure. Payoneer's presence in Cyprus has facilitated its access to the European market, driving significant business growth. AGPLAW played a crucial role in ensuring Payoneer's compliance and regulatory alignment in Cyprus.\n\nWhile Cyprus offers a favorable regulatory environment, EMIs must navigate complex compliance requirements to maintain their licenses. This includes adhering to AML regulations, data protection laws, and financial reporting standards. EMIs can mitigate these challenges by investing in robust compliance systems and seeking professional advice from local experts, such as those at AGPLAW.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe growing popularity of Cyprus as a hub for EMIs has increased competition in the market. To stand out, EMIs must focus on innovation, customer service, and strategic partnerships. Leveraging advanced technology and offering unique value propositions can help EMIs differentiate themselves in a competitive landscape.\n\nThe future of EMIs in Cyprus is closely tied to digital transformation. The islands nation, with its robust regulatory framework and strategic positioning, stands at the cusp of a significant evolution in financial services, propelled by cutting-edge advancements in financial technology (fintech), blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nRegulatory Evolution\n\nThe regulatory landscape for EMIs is continuously evolving, with new directives and guidelines being introduced to address emerging risks and opportunities. The country's regulatory framework is designed to foster innovation while maintaining rigorous standards of compliance and security. This balance enables EMIs to operate with confidence, knowing that they can meet regulatory requirements while pursuing innovative business models and service offerings. Cyprus is expected to remain at the forefront of regulatory developments, providing a supportive environment for EMIs to thrive.\n\nMarket Expansion\n\nAs global demand for electronic money services continues to grow, EMIs in Cyprus are poised to expand their market reach. By capitalizing on Cyprus' strategic location, favorable regulatory framework, and access to the European Single Market, EMIs can pursue new opportunities and achieve sustainable growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nSetting up an Electronic Money Institution in Cyprus offers a multitude of benefits, from regulatory advantages and tax incentives to a supportive business environment and strategic positioning within the EU. Fintech innovations are reshaping the way financial services are delivered, offering unprecedented levels of efficiency, security, and customer satisfaction. Cyprus, with its dynamic fintech ecosystem, skilled workforce, and favorable legal system collectively create an ideal ecosystem for Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) to thrive.

He was asked to comment on the President's statements at the beginning of the Cabinet meeting that we are at the final stage in the issue of entry visas for Cyprus nationals to travel to the US.\n\nLetymbiotis recalled that during the visit of the Foreign Affairs Minister to the US one of the last pending agreements for Cyprus to join the program has been signed and after this agreement we are basically entering the final stage to be added to the program.\n\nHe went on to say that the Deputy Minister to the President, who has been appointed since last year as the coordinator of the efforts to enter the program is preparing all the data, which will be handed to the US authorities.\n\nHe explained that what is pending is a practical difficulty that exists as a parameter on the part of the US, namely that the rejection rate be less than 3%.\n\nIn other words, Letymbiotis said, out of 100 applications made by Cypriot passport holders, less than three must be rejected. He also said that last year we were very close to the goal and we are hopeful that this year we will be able to reach the goal. He added that there is still an agreement to be signed and \"we hope that this will be done in the next period.\"\n\nThe Spokesperson added that once the data are submitted to the American authorities, there will be a period of approximately three months for the US to evaluate whether to accept or reject the rate. Therefore, he said, the target of late 2024 to early 2025 is perfectly achievable.\n\nIn another question the Spokesperson said that any country applying to join the program must meet this condition of the rejection rate.\n\nReplying to another question on when the President will meet again with UNSG's personal envoy Maria Holguin, Letymbiotis said that there is nothing set so far regarding the date of her arrival.\n\nHe added that once there is anything new in in relation to either the submission of her report to the UN Secretary-General or to setting a new meeting with the President of the Republic, it will be announced.\n\nCyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey invaded and occupied its northern third. Repeated rounds of UN-led peace talks have so far failed to yield results.\n\nThe latest round of negotiations, in July 2017 at the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana ended inconclusively.\n\nGuterres last January appointed Holguin as his personal envoy for Cyprus, to assume a Good Offices role on his behalf and search for common ground on the way forward in the Cyprus issue.", "source": {"uri": "parikiaki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Parikiaki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_passport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cypriot passport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_problem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus problem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crans-Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crans-Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Crans-Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle_East", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle East", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://parikiaki-cdn-1.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20201001155502/CNA_Mc6629b5c7404492b9dabefc008717217-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659498", "eventUri": "eng-9659498", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 2472, "textEnd": 2481}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

This article examines the numerous benefits of setting up an EMI in Cyprus, highlighting key aspects such as regulatory advantages, tax incentives, business environment, and strategic positioning within the European Union. Additionally, this article highlights AGPLAW, a leading law firm in Cyprus that specializes in fintech and financial services regulatory support.\n\nAGPLAW offers comprehensive services, including EMI licensing and ongoing legal assistance, ensuring that EMIs receive expert guidance and support throughout their operational journey. With AGPLAW's expertise, EMIs can navigate the complexities of the regulatory landscape, achieve compliance, and drive long-term success.\n\nEuropean Union Membership\n\nCyprus is a member of the European Union (EU), which means that an EMI licensed in Cyprus can passport its services across all EU and European Economic Area (EEA) member states. This EU passporting ability is a significant advantage, allowing EMIs to operate seamlessly across multiple jurisdictions without needing additional licenses.\n\nCentral Bank of Cyprus (CBC)\n\nThe Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) is the primary regulatory authority overseeing EMIs. The CBC provides a clear and robust regulatory framework that aligns with EU directives, such as the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) and the Electronic Money Directive (EMD). This alignment ensures that Cypriot EMIs adhere to high regulatory standards, enhancing their credibility and trustworthiness.\n\nStreamlined Licensing Process\n\nThe licensing process for EMIs in Cyprus is relatively streamlined compared to other EU jurisdictions. The CBC offers detailed guidance and support throughout the application process, which typically involves the submission of a business plan, organizational structure, risk management policies, and proof of capital adequacy. The CBC may only authorize electronic money institutions if they are legal entities incorporated within the Republic, where their headquarters and registered office must be located. Additionally, a portion of their business must involve electronic money services and/or payment services that are not directly related to the issuance of electronic money.\n\nThe supportive regulatory environment expedites the establishment of EMIs, reducing bureaucratic hurdles and time-to-market. For expert assistance during the licensing process, AGPLAW provides comprehensive licensing services and regulatory support.\n\nCompliance and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Measures\n\nCyprus has stringent AML regulations, ensuring that EMIs operate with high levels of transparency and integrity. Compliance with AML directives not only protect the EMI's reputation but also fosters trust among clients and partners. The CBC's rigorous enforcement of AML measures further ensures that Cyprus remains a safe and secure financial hub. AGPLAW offers specialized AML compliance services to help EMIs maintain regulatory standards and mitigate risks.\n\nFavorable Corporate Tax Rate\n\nCyprus offers one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the EU, currently set at 12.5%. This competitive tax rate significantly reduces the overall tax burden on EMIs, enhancing their profitability and enabling them to reinvest in growth and innovation.\n\nDouble Taxation Treaties\n\nCyprus has an extensive network of double taxation treaties (DTTs) with over 60 countries. These treaties prevent the double taxation of income, ensuring that EMIs benefit from reduced withholding taxes on dividends, interest, and royalties. The DTT network enhances Cyprus' attractiveness as a base for international business operations.\n\nTax Exemptions and Incentives\n\nIn addition to the low corporate tax rate, Cyprus offers various tax exemptions and incentives for EMIs. These include exemptions on dividend income, capital gains, and profits from the disposal of securities. Such incentives make Cyprus a tax-efficient jurisdiction for EMIs, fostering an environment conducive to business growth and financial stability.\n\nVAT Exemptions on Financial Services\n\nFinancial services, including those provided by EMIs, are generally exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) in Cyprus. This exemption reduces the cost of providing financial services and enhances the competitiveness of Cypriot EMIs in the European market.\n\nStrategic Geographical Location\n\nCyprus' strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa makes it an ideal base for EMIs looking to serve diverse markets. The island's proximity to major economic hubs facilitates business expansion and fosters international trade and investment opportunities.\n\nHigh-Quality Financial Infrastructure\n\nCyprus boasts a sophisticated financial infrastructure, with a well-developed banking system, modern payment networks, and a plethora of financial services providers. This infrastructure supports the efficient operation of EMIs, enabling them to offer innovative and reliable financial products to their clients.\n\nSkilled Workforce\n\nThe availability of a highly skilled and multilingual workforce is another key advantage of establishing an EMI in Cyprus. The country's education system produces a steady stream of graduates with expertise in finance, technology, and business management. This talent pool ensures that EMIs have access to the skills and knowledge necessary to drive innovation and growth. AGPLAW's talent acquisition and recruitment team can assist EMIs in employing skilled personnel at all levels and positions.\n\nBusiness-Friendly Legal System\n\nCyprus has a business-friendly legal system based on English common law, which is widely recognized and respected internationally. The legal framework provides a high degree of certainty and protection for businesses, facilitating smooth and efficient operations for EMIs.\n\nRobust ICT Infrastructure\n\nCyprus has made significant investments in its Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure. The country's advanced telecommunications networks and high-speed internet connectivity support the digital operations of EMIs, enabling them to offer seamless and secure electronic money services to their clients.\n\nAccess to the European Single Market\n\nAs an EU member state, Cyprus offers EMIs unrestricted access to the European Single Market, one of the largest and most lucrative markets in the world. This access allows Cypriot EMIs to offer their services to over 500 million consumers, providing vast opportunities for business growth and expansion.\n\nHarmonized Regulatory Standards\n\nCyprus adheres to harmonized EU regulatory standards, ensuring that EMIs based in Cyprus comply with the same rules and regulations as their counterparts in other EU member states. This harmonization simplifies cross-border operations and enhances the credibility of Cypriot EMIs in the European market. The issuance and management of electronic money (e-money) are governed by the Electronic Money Laws of 2012 and 2018.\n\nThese laws integrate essential EU directives into Cypriot national legislation, establishing a regulated e-money market in the country. They specifically implement Directive 2009/110/EC, which ensures that electronic money institutions adhere to sound business practices and supervisory standards, and the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) of 2015, aimed at improving payment services throughout the EU.\n\nEU Funding and Support Programs\n\nEMIs in Cyprus can benefit from various EU funding and support programs aimed at fostering innovation, digital transformation, and business development. These programs provide financial assistance, grants, and resources to help EMIs enhance their services and expand their market reach.\n\nAGPLAW is a leading law firm in Cyprus with a dedicated focus on fintech and financial services regulatory matters.\n\nThe firm provides comprehensive services to EMIs, including:\n\nLicensing Support\n\nAs a law firm, we offer comprehensive support throughout the entire application process. Our services include consulting on organizational structure, preparing initial drafts of business plans, advising on business models and investment services, and assisting with the payment of fees to the CBC. We also prepare and submit the Promoter's Application File, including necessary forms, questionnaires, and documentation, followed by continuous correspondence and support regarding any inquiries related to the application process, ensuring a smooth and efficient licensing process\n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance\n\nThe firm's extensive 20-year knowledge of local and EU regulations ensures that EMIs remain compliant with all legal requirements. AGPLAW offers ongoing legal and regulatory support, helping EMIs manage their compliance obligations effectively.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering (AML) Services\n\nAGPLAW provides specialized AML compliance services, helping EMIs develop and implement robust AML policies and procedures. This ensures that EMIs operate within the regulatory framework and maintain the highest standards of transparency and integrity.\n\nStrategic Advisory\n\nThe firm offers strategic advisory services, guiding EMIs on business development, market expansion, and regulatory changes. AGPLAW's insights and expertise help EMIs with respect to the complexities of the financial services industry and achieve sustainable growth.\n\nBy partnering with AGPLAW, EMIs can leverage their extensive experience and deep understanding of the Cypriot regulatory environment to establish a successful and compliant operation.\n\nCase Study: Revolut's Expansion\n\nRevolut, a leading fintech company, successfully expanded its operations to Cyprus, leveraging the country's favorable regulatory and business environment. The company's Cypriot EMI license enabled it to offer a wide range of financial services to EU customers, contributing to its rapid growth and market penetration. AGPLAW provided essential legal and regulatory support throughout Revolut's expansion process.\n\nSuccess Story: Payoneer's Strategic Move\n\nPayoneer, a global payment solutions provider, chose Cyprus as a key location for its European operations. The company's decision was influenced by Cyprus' advantageous tax regime, strategic location, and robust financial infrastructure. Payoneer's presence in Cyprus has facilitated its access to the European market, driving significant business growth. AGPLAW played a crucial role in ensuring Payoneer's compliance and regulatory alignment in Cyprus.\n\nRegulatory Compliance\n\nWhile Cyprus offers a favorable regulatory environment, EMIs must navigate complex compliance requirements to maintain their licenses. This includes adhering to AML regulations, data protection laws, and financial reporting standards. EMIs can mitigate these challenges by investing in robust compliance systems and seeking professional advice from local experts, such as those at AGPLAW.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe growing popularity of Cyprus as a hub for EMIs has increased competition in the market. To stand out, EMIs must focus on innovation, customer service, and strategic partnerships. Leveraging advanced technology and offering unique value propositions can help EMIs differentiate themselves in a competitive landscape.\n\nDigital Transformation\n\nThe future of EMIs in Cyprus is closely tied to digital transformation. The islands nation, with its robust regulatory framework and strategic positioning, stands at the cusp of a significant evolution in financial services, propelled by cutting-edge advancements in financial technology (fintech), blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nRegulatory Evolution\n\nThe regulatory landscape for EMIs is continuously evolving, with new directives and guidelines being introduced to address emerging risks and opportunities. The country's regulatory framework is designed to foster innovation while maintaining rigorous standards of compliance and security. This balance enables EMIs to operate with confidence, knowing that they can meet regulatory requirements while pursuing innovative business models and service offerings. Cyprus is expected to remain at the forefront of regulatory developments, providing a supportive environment for EMIs to thrive.\n\nMarket Expansion\n\nAs global demand for electronic money services continues to grow, EMIs in Cyprus are poised to expand their market reach. By capitalizing on Cyprus' strategic location, favorable regulatory framework, and access to the European Single Market, EMIs can pursue new opportunities and achieve sustainable growth.\n\nSetting up an Electronic Money Institution in Cyprus offers a multitude of benefits, from regulatory advantages and tax incentives to a supportive business environment and strategic positioning within the EU. Fintech innovations are reshaping the way financial services are delivered, offering unprecedented levels of efficiency, security, and customer satisfaction. Cyprus, with its dynamic fintech ecosystem, skilled workforce, and favorable legal system collectively create an ideal ecosystem for Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) to thrive.

Also, despite positive developments, labour market and social cohesion challenges persist, while the country is facing significant challenges in transitioning to a more sustainable economy.\n\nAlso, in the context of an assessment of macroeconomic imbalances in EU member states, the Commission found that Cyprus continues to experience imbalances, with vulnerabilities related to private, government and external debt having overall receded but remain relevant, while the large current account deficit has widened further.\n\nCypriot economy competitiveness\n\nAccording to a summary provided in the report on Cyprus on elements related to the competitiveness of the country's economy, the Commission finds that Cyprus records mixed performance on competitiveness, making no significant progress since 2022 and the pre-pandemic years.\n\nThe country performs well on exports of professional, ICT and tourism services and in attracting foreign investment. It is well integrated into the single market and is taking further action to boost its performance, the report says.\n\nCyprus' recovery and resilience plan \"comprehensively tackles several challenges related to improving the business environment,\" it notes. The measures include reducing red tape in the public sector, streamlining permitting procedures, improving the efficiency of public administration, boosting the effectiveness of the tax system, promoting a robust anti-corruption framework, tackling the issue of non-performing loans and creating incentives for innovation.\n\nHowever, the report authors point out that the following competitiveness challenges remain for Cyprus:\n\n- skills mismatches, a decline in basic skills and a low level of digital skills which hold back productivity, knowledge valorisation, labour supply and the green and digital transitions;\n\n- insufficient access to finance for companies, especially outside the monetary and financial institution sector, and access to private investment in manufacturing and innovative businesses are limiting the potential for growth;\n\n- insufficient roll-out of renewable energy and the delayed transition to a circular economy pose risks to energy autonomy and efficiency and could potentially undermine the long-term competitiveness of the country.", "source": {"uri": "cbn.com.cy", "dataType": "news", "title": "Israeli Fattal Hotel Group

Editorial credit: Edward Rowe\n\nIn the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. All praise is due to Him, and may His peace and blessings be upon His final Messenger, Muhammad.\n\nContentsA Sahabiyya in CyprusShared sovereigntyThe Ottomans arriveLefko\u015fa's lavish legacy!Action points\n\nWhen we think about Europe's Islamic history, Cyprus is unlikely to be foremost in our minds, but the East Mediterranean island's links to the faith date back well over a millennium.\n\nSplit between the Greek Cypriot-administered Republic of Cyprus (RoC) in the south, and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), both major parts of the island have deep Muslim roots.\n\nAnd while a significant part of this heritage dates back to Ottoman rule, some can be traced all the way back to the Sahaba (radiy Allahu 'anhum). [1]\n\nA Sahabiyya in Cyprus\n\nOne of the island's earliest known Islamic connections sits in a small complex known locally as the Hala Sultan Tekke, near the Republic of Cyprus' main airport in the coastal city of Larnaca.\n\nWhile the site's Ottoman mosque and the nearby salt lake may catch one's eye in the first instance, its most unique feature is the tomb of Umm Har\u0101m bint Milh\u0101n (radiy Allahu 'anha) -- the aunt of the Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa -- who died on the island in the 640s, during the reign of the rightly guided Caliph, Uthm\u0101n (radiy Allahu 'anhu). [2]\n\nUmm Har\u0101m, known by Turks as Hala Sultan, is mentioned in the S\u012brah. The Prophet \ufdfa is narrated to have fallen asleep as his aunt passed her hand over his head, and later to have woken up with a smile on his face.\n\nHe (\ufdfa) went on to relate a dream to her, saying,\n\n\"Some people of my Ummah were shown to me striving in the way of Allah, sailing in the middle of the seas like kings on their thrones.\"\n\nUmm Har\u0101m replied,\n\n\"O Messenger of Allah! Pray to Allah to make me one of them.\"\n\nThe Prophet \ufdfa obliged, went back to sleep, and woke up smiling yet again.\n\nHe (\ufdfa) related the same vision as before, but added,\n\n\"You will be among the first ones.\"\n\nSure enough, years later, Mu'\u0101wiya (radiy Allahu 'anhu) -- then the Governor of Syria -- advised Caliph Uthm\u0101n to send his forces to Cyprus, which the Romans had been using as a base to attack the Muslims. [3]\n\nUthm\u0101n agreed with the advice, and gave an order that launched the first ever naval campaign in Islamic history.\n\nUb\u0101dah ibn S\u0101mit (radiy Allahu 'anhu) was put in command and his wife, Umm Har\u0101m, volunteered to join him. After landing on the island, Umm Har\u0101m's horse was spooked and the Sahabiyya fell, sustaining fatal injuries.\n\nAfter passing away, she was buried on Cyprus. Her tomb complex remains a beloved site for Turkish Cypriot Muslims to this day.\n\nShared sovereignty\n\nUb\u0101dah's campaign was followed by a period of dual sovereignty over the island between the caliphate and the Romans. [4]\n\nA violation of the peace by the Romans prompted another Muslim campaign and, in turn, the establishment of settlements and a military presence on the island.\n\nThereafter, a power-sharing agreement concluded in 680 by the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik and the Roman Emperor Justinian II led to nearly three centuries of relatively peaceful co-existence. Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (r.963-969) later broke this status quo, bringing the whole island under Roman control.\n\nMustafa Kurey\u015fi, a British Turkish-Cypriot researcher and subject matter expert, told Islam21c,\n\n\"Cyprus' early Islamic heritage is truly marvellous.\n\n\"Sahaba (radiy Allahu 'anhum) set foot on this island. We still have evidence of early Muslim life there, too. There are inscriptions and seals, for instance, in Paphos, which we call 'Baf' in Turkish.\"\n\nMr. Kurey\u015fi, who founded the Cezire Derne\u011fi, or Island Society, to research and promote Cyprus' Islamic history, believes this heritage belongs at the forefront of the island's identity.\n\nAs he explains,\n\n\"It saddens me that Muslim history in Cyprus is so little-known, while its -- though still important -- ancient Greek heritage is so widely celebrated, even by Turkish Cypriots in the island's North.\n\n\"When you visit the TRNC, you can stay in a hotel built to look like a Graeco-Roman temple, explore ancient sites like Salamis, and study Greek mythology about the 'birth of Aphrodite' from the Cypriot sea foam.\n\n\"But, as Muslims, we should really know Cyprus as the island of Hala Sultan. The Ottomans certainly valued this past. In fact, their chief Islamic scholar, the Shaykh al-Islam, gave a ruling sanctioning the conquest of the island based on the fact that Muslims had previously had influence there.\"\n\nThe Ottomans arrive\n\nThe Ottoman presence came to Cyprus some six hundred years after the end of shared rule.\n\nIn 1571, under the reign of Sultan Selim II (1566-1574), the Ottomans wrested control of the island during a war with its then Venetian rulers. The sultans remained dominant there until 1878, when Constantinople leased Cyprus to London, keeping only nominal sovereignty until 1914 when Britain annexed the territory during the First World War.\n\nThe conquest brought about the settlement of thousands of Turkish Muslims; many of their descendants remain on the island over four centuries on, as the Turkish Cypriots of today.\n\nThe Ottomans undoubtedly left a huge mark on Cyprus' material culture. Along Larnaca's seafront, for instance, the city's old medieval fort -- now a tourist attraction -- exhibits a selection of Ottoman artefacts such as headstones.\n\nMeanwhile, the neighbouring Grand Mosque or Djami Kebir (though formerly a Catholic church) sports a magnificent pencil-like minaret, resembling others found throughout Turkey, the Balkans, and beyond.\n\nLefko\u015fa's lavish legacy!\n\nAround an hour's bus ride north in Nicosia -- which serves as the capital of both the Republic of Cyprus and the TRNC respectively -- the Muslim heritage is no less resplendent.\n\nIslamic worship continues daily in marvellous Ottoman mosques in the city, which is known as Lefko\u015fa in Turkish. These houses of prayer adorn both Nicosia's largely Greek Cypriot southern part, where they are primarily used by diverse Middle Eastern, African, and South Asian-origin congregations, as well as the mainly Turkish Cypriot Northern side.\n\nNorth Nicosia, for instance, is home to the late sixteenth century Arap Ahmet Mosque. Built in classical Ottoman style, the house of prayer takes its name from the military commander Ahmed Pasha \"the Arab\", who took part in the conquest of Cyprus. [5]\n\nIn addition to Beyaz (a friendly white cat who drinks water from worshippers' hands at the wud\u016b fountain), the mosque's courtyard is also home to the grave of Kamil Pasha, a Nicosia native who served as Grand Vizier to Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid II (r.1876-1909). [6]\n\nThe Turkish Cypriot side boasts a magnificent Ottoman caravanserai as well. Known as B\u00fcy\u00fck Han or the Great Inn, which is said to have been built in 1572 to accommodate travellers and merchants.\n\nIt continues to be a major focal point for visitors to this day, with tourists regularly frequenting an array of cafes and souvenir shops. [7]\n\nBest of all, these examples are just a few of many spectacular Islamic historical sites to discover across the island.\n\nMay Allah preserve this heritage and make it continuously beneficial to the Ummah of Muhammad \ufdfa.\n\nAction points Reflect on the significance of Cyprus' Islamic history to contemporary debates about Islam in Europe and the wider Western World.

internationally recognised as the \"legitimate\" government of the entire island, with the exception of two British military bases.\n\nThe Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, on the other hand, is currently only recognised by Turkey, but it is an observer member of several international bodies.\n\n[2] https://youtu.be/e8CUezErX0s\n\n[3] Also sometimes referred to as \"Byzantines\".\n\n[4]

could include references to their ethnicity, homeland, physical features, fathers, or relationships.\n\n[6] The position of Grand Vizier is somewhat comparable with that of a Prime Minister.\n\n[7]

{"id": 243363760, "title": "Gareth Southgate picks replacement if Kieran Trippier misses Slovakia clash", "text": "England boss Gareth Southgate has pencilled in Aston Villa star Ezri Konsa for his first start of Euro 2024. The Three Lions manager is considering changes ahead of Sunday\u2019s last-16 clash with Slovakia. One of those could be enforced with Newcastle defender Kieran Trippier struggling to shake off a calf issue. He trained away from the main group on Friday, with the FA confirming that his individual workload was being managed. But there are still doubts over his fitness. And according to Sky Sports, Southgate has earmarked Konsa as a replacement should Trippier not be fit. The 26-year-old can deputise at left-back. The four-time England international has not yet played a minute in Germany. It would see him called into a slightly unconventional left-back position, having played predominantly as a central defender for Aston Villa. The position has proven to be a real problem for Southgate throughout the tournament. He chose not to call up Ben Chilwell, while Manchester United's Luke Shaw has only just returned to full training. Arsenal icon Ian Wright has also shared some advice with Southgate over how to overcome the issue. He believes that moving Bukayo Saka to left-back could potentially work. What team should England name vs Slovakia? Share your suggestions in the comments below Speaking after the 0-0 draw with Slovenia, Wright said: \"As great as Saka has done for England in terms of what he creates and his goals and assists, he is a natural left-sided player. He started playing for England on the left at youth level, he started at Arsenal on the left. If that\u2019s going to give you the balance and get you Cole Palmer in the team, it\u2019s something you have to at least look at. \"Yes, Kyle Walker can play there [at left-back], it\u2019s the same situation where you have the player coming inside, you have no one going around. He\u2019s a natural left-footer Saka, we could activate the whole left side.\" Saka has already shared his view on that potential idea. He said: \u201cNo, obviously I love Ian Wright and he says so many great things about me but I don't think putting me out of position is the solution. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I think we can we can talk about this but it's in Gareth's hands so we will just have to trust whoever Gareth selects on the day.\u201d Away from the left-back position, Southgate is also reportedly considering one more change. Kobbie Mainoo is a candidate to start against Slovenia next to Declan Rice. Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

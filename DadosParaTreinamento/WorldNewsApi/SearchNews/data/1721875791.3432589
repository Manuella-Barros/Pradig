The pro-Biafran group described the recent viral videos of some teenage girls from the South-East trafficked for prostitution in Ghana as a disturbing development. They stated this in a statement signed by its spokesman, Emma Powerful, on Saturday, adding that IPOB is against any form of sexual exploitation and human trafficking. The statement read partly, \u201cThe noble family and movement of IPOB calls for collective actions to stop the trafficking of teenagers, both girls and boys. \u201cWe believe that the trafficking of innocent and ignorant teenage girls from Nigeria to Ghana, to other African countries, Europe, and American countries for prostitution is an international cartel that needs the collaboration of inter-country security and other international agencies to tackle. \u201cThese teens were trafficked through land borders in connivance with the security agencies at borders and checkpoints. We call on Nigerians and Ghanaians to arrest and prosecute the human traffickers. \u201cIPOB is against any form of sexual exploitation and human trafficking. Igbo girls are important for productive procreation among Ndigbo. Those trafficking these Igbo girls and those using them as sex slaves locally and internationally are enemies of Ndigbo and must be treated as such.\u201d It further stated that its leadership has given orders to all IPOB coordinators both home and abroad to be on the lookout for anywhere Igbo teenagers are being held hostage as sex slaves and report it.", "summary": "<p>The Indigenous People of Biafra have called for collective action to end the trafficking of teenagers in the South-East, including boys and girls, and sexual exploitation locally and internationally.

Father Gabriel Ukeh, has been kidnapped by bandits. Rev. Father Gabriel Ukeh was in the early hours of Sunday abducted at the parish rectory. In a press statement on Sunday, the Vicar General (Pastoral), Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Kazah, said, \"While we solicit for fervent prayers for his urgent and safe release, we equally condemn this act of incessant kidnappings for ransom of innocent and defenceless citizens of our communities, and we call upon the government to horn its security intelligence as we approach the celebration of Sallah.\" He assured that the Church would work with security operatives for the victim's quick release, calling on all to stay away from taking the laws into their hands. He added that they would use every legitimate means to ensure that Rev. Father Gabriel Ukeh came back to them safe and sound. The statement said, ''through the intercessions of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of Priests and Religious, may Jesus the crucified hearken to their prayers and hasten the unconditional release of His Priest and every other abducted person''.

{"id": 231934306, "title": "Editorial cartoons for June 9, 2024: D-Day anniversary, asylum limit, Trump trial delays", "text": "The 80th anniversary of the Allied invasion of Normandy drew dozens of aged survivors of the bloody battle that turned the tide of World War II. It was likely their last visit, as many are over 100 years old. President Joe Biden used the occasion to warn against a new tide of authoritarianism, a veiled swipe at his opponent, former President Donald Trump. Bill Bramhall leads the editorial cartoon gallery with a somber image of a veteran in a wheelchair saluting the now-placid beaches where thousands of his comrades died on June 6, 1944. Scott Stantis draws a similar scene, featuring a veteran at the \u201cLes Braves\u201d memorial on Omaha Beach. \u201cWorth it,\u201d he thinks to himself. Walt Handelsman exhausts the letter \u201cD\u201d to describe the valor of those men. Cartoonists also commented on Biden\u2019s executive order setting a limit on the number of migrants who can seek asylum before the border closes. Dana Summers portrays the president as putting out the fire he started. Other topics in this week\u2019s gallery include more delays in the various legal cases against Trump; fallout from a jury\u2019s \u201cguilty\u201d verdict in the New York hush money trial; the president\u2019s son Hunter Biden on trial in a case involving guns and drugs; and Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s testimony before a hostile committee in the House over his direction of the U.S. response to Covid-19. Cartoons were drawn by Nick Anderson, Bill Bramhall, Dana Summers, Drew Sheneman, Scott Stantis, Walt Handelsman, David Horsey, Phil Hands, Joel Pett and Joey Weatherford of Tribune Content Agency; and Mike Luckovich and Steve Breen of Creators Syndicate.", "summary": "The week in visual commentary.", "url": "https://www.cleveland.com/opinion/2024/06/editorial-cartoons-for-june-9-2024-d-day-anniversary-asylum-limit-trump-trial-delays.html", "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/6CI2ADFVQZBGDFAOF3MIZSYGXA.jpg?auth=a28b964921b572fa61fcdaaf658ae3ba7eaa798235ec8c89ba81d890a184dc74&width=1280&quality=90", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:00:00", "author": "Marie Morelli", "authors": ["Marie Morelli"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.165}

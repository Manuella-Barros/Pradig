Charles told her: \"Nothing a strong drink won't help.\"\n\nWhen Cpl Newman told him that his role was as an electrician, he said to Mrs Newman: \"Terribly helpful to have an electrician around.\" She replied jokingly: \"Well, you say that!\"\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Mrs Newman, 34, from Poole, Dorset, said: \"It was amazing, nerve-wracking, but amazing. I just said how many children I had, I said I had three children, and he said 'It was nothing a strong drink won't help' He was really funny, he appeared absolutely fine and upbeat.\"\n\nCpl Newman, 32, said: \"He is a really lovely person, he liked to engage with you, it wasn't a fleeting chat, it was an in-depth conversation.\"\n\nThe King also met officers from the 8 Engineer Brigade HQ, which provides engineering support to military operations and, before he left, Charles signed the regiment's visitors' book and was presented with gifts of flowers and Royal Engineer china mugs from the children of some of the barracks' serving soldiers.\n\nHe also took the chance to meet families and staff members who waited outside to see him leave and the King told them: \"Aren't you all meant to be having lunch?\"\n\nThe King was then presented with a portrait of himself drawn by six-year-old Louie Bacon, son of Warrant Officer 2 Mark Bacon. Louie said it was good to meet the King and he was very excited.\n\nMother Kim Lewis, of Fleet, said: \"It was really exciting, a once-in-a-lifetime chance, definitely worth half a day off.\"\n\nThe 3RSME was formed in September 1939 as the Combat Engineer Centre of Excellence.\n\nAll Royal Engineer soldiers and officers pass through 3 RSME to receive combat engineer initial trade training. The school is responsible for providing command courses at the junior and senior level, as well as combat engineer courses, teaching skills such as bridging, demolitions and water supply.\n\nCharles attended three events last week as he resumed engagements, indicating the positive effect of his treatment.\n\nOn Monday, the Lord President of the Privy Council, Penny Mordaunt, said the King is feeling \"very good\" and \"would have been so pleased\" to return to public-facing events. The Privy Council is a body of senior advisers to the King.\n\nAsked how Charles is doing, Ms Mordaunt told GB News: \"He's very good. And I know that he would have been so pleased to get back to public duties. He would have missed it tremendously.\n\n\"I think everyone is really pleased to see him back and I know that he wants to do more, so it's been a good week.\"\n\nThere was speculation that the Duke of Sussex, who has travelled to the UK to celebrate the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games, may have seen his father, but a spokesman for Harry said the King's \"full programme\" meant the get-together would not happen.\n\nCharles and Harry last met soon after the King announced his cancer diagnosis in February. Harry, who lives with his family in California, travelled from the US to see his father.\n\nA spokesman for the duke said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to his majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nGet more news from SurreyLive straight to your inbox for free here.", "source": {"uri": "getsurrey.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Surrey Advertiser Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucy_williamson@getsurrey.co.uk", "name": "Lucy Williamson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

{"id": 232040640, "title": "Warning over popular holiday scams that could empty \u00a31,851 from bank account", "text": "In the thrill of planning a holiday, it's easy to overlook crucial red flags that could indicate a scam. The disappointment is even more profound when hard-earned savings, often accumulated over months, end up in a fraudster's account. Last year, victims of holiday fraud lost an average of \u00a31,851, with July and August witnessing a surge in such scams, as per Action Fraud data. Often, holidaymakers only discover they've been defrauded when they're due to travel or upon reaching their destination. A recent survey by travel debit card Currensea revealed that over a third (35%) of travellers aged 18 to 35 claimed they'd been scammed on holiday in the past year, suggesting this age group is particularly vulnerable. Common holiday frauds include booking flights or accommodation on fraudulent websites and bogus trips advertised on social media. Deceptive social media promotions may involve event tickets, package holidays, or accounts posing as airlines or hotels requesting banking details or additional payments. Scams tend to be especially successful when people are in the \"holiday mood\" and let their guard down. ATM skimming is a real threat, where criminals install devices on cash machines to harvest personal details, including a user's PIN, and engage in \"shoulder surfing\" to observe customers entering their PIN before stealing their card. Holidaymakers are also being duped by offers of non-existent tours. However, it seems many are vigilant; a survey found that 78% of travellers are adopting extra safety measures against scams while on holiday. In fact, 43% of those surveyed prefer using cards over bank transfers for better protection, as per the Opinium survey of 2,000 UK residents in March. Using credit or debit cards, or services like PayPal, can provide additional security if issues arise. Victims of undelivered goods or services who paid by card may seek a chargeback from their provider. Credit card payments might be eligible for a claim under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act for purchases above \u00a3100, even if less than \u00a3100 was charged to the card. For items or services costing less than \u00a3100, chargeback claims could still be an option. The survey also revealed that over two-fifths (43%) of holidaymakers are now more cautious about safety when handling cash, with 28% being careful when withdrawing money overseas. James Lynn, co-founder of Currensea, advises: \"Travellers need to ensure they're taking more safety precautions when abroad by remaining vigilant with offers that seem too good to be true, minimise the amount of cash they carry and opting for secure spending options that are much lower risk than a wallet full of notes.\" To help people stay safe, Lynn suggests that when booking accommodation on platforms, be wary if the host or owner asks to communicate via phone or email rather than through messages over the platform, particularly if they are asking for direct payment. If you do take significant sums of cash with you while you're abroad, Lynn suggests splitting the money between wallets and secured spaces such as a safe. This also applies to your plastic cards so that if your wallet does become lost or stolen, you still have some forms of payment available. Lynn advises: \"If something goes wrong you don't want to lose all access to money. Consider options to pay via your phone too, such as Apple Pay or Google Pay.\" Also, be aware of your surroundings when withdrawing cash from ATMs.. \"Shoulder surfing\" is a common tactic where fraudsters watch a customer enter their Pin and then later steal their card. When planning your next holiday, it's crucial to understand what protection you have in case things go awry. Ensure the company you're dealing with is a member of the trade association ABTA. If you're booking flights or package deals, check if you're covered under the ATOL financial protection scheme. Remember, fraudsters can mimic logos of legitimate organisations to make their websites seem more credible. If you're unsure about an organisation, consider checking ABTA's website for its members. Exercise caution when sharing your personal information and consider only providing the mandatory details when making a purchase. Be sceptical if the price seems too good to be true. You might also want to perform an image search online as scammers often copy photos of idyllic destinations from other sources. It's also advisable to check the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) travel advice for your chosen destination. If you suspect you've fallen victim to fraud, contact your bank immediately and report it to Action Fraud. Those residing in Scotland should call Police Scotland on 101.

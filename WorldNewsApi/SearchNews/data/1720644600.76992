The actor starred in No Small Affair alongside Moore in 1984 before either of the two were well known, and art began to imitate life as they briefly dated while making the film. \u201cWe dated for a short time while we were working on No Small Affair, but I guess our particular affair was, in fact, pretty small,\u201d says Cryer, 59, who is featured in the new documentary BRATS, directed by Andrew McCarthy and streaming on Hulu June 13. \u201cShe was already struggling with a drug problem. One that I was blissfully unaware of until a couple of weeks before the movie ended,\" he adds. In the 1980s, Moore, now 61, went to rehab for drug and alcohol addiction. Then, after remaining sober for more than 20 years, she relapsed in 2012, eventually going back to rehab for addiction as well as an eating disorder, sources told PEOPLE at the time. Still, even as early as the '80s, Cryer knew Moore had that unmistakable spark despite her private troubles. \u201cWhat would always be great about her was already evident; that incredible combination of vulnerability, toughness and beauty,\u201d he says. While Moore famously became a member of the Brat Pack, Cryer always considered himself more adjacently related to the group. \u201cI didn\u2019t perceive myself as part of the 'Brat Pack' because I didn\u2019t think I was one of the cool kids. And they were definitely the cool kids,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought the two films that defined the group were The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo\u2019s Fire, neither of which was I in.\u201d Moore, on the other hand, joined the crew of up-and-coming teen stars when she appeared in St. Elmo's Fire in 1985 \u2014 just a year after her role with Cryer in No Small Affair.

She might be over Dance Moms, but her time on reality TV is far from over.\n\nNow, the prospect of JoJo Siwa's reality show looms before us. It's happening -- but what will it be like?\n\nYears after Dance Moms finally came to an end, creator Jeff Collins is reuniting with one of its biggest breakout stars: JoJo Siwa.\n\nJoJo recently came out, is rolling out new music, and is transitioning from a children's entertainer to a grown-up singer. Clearly, there is plenty of potential material for a series to cover.\n\n(Speaking of which, JoJo's \"Guilty Pleasure\" title track from her upcoming EP releases on Friday, July 12)\n\nAccording to Resilient Content, Jeff Collins' production company as part of the Sony deal, the unnamed series will be a \"coming of age premium docuseries that will follow the personal and professional life and career of JoJo Siwa.\"\n\nThe description adds: \"Cameras will get an in-depth look into her creative process as she charts her course as an adult pop star - evolving from the beloved child star audiences adored on screen.\"\n\nAdditionally: \"JoJo will reveal what it's like to be one of the world's most famous 20-year-olds running various businesses, fulfilling a recording deal, and living by herself for the first time.\"\n\n\"The storylines will emanate from JoJo, told in first person by her and those within her inner circle,\" Resilient Content assures.\n\n\"For the first time, audiences will get a glimpse of the persona as she reveals who she is in the quiet moments away from the blaring lights of the stage,\" the description adds.\n\nImportantly, this could be part of JoJo's evolving image. No longer entertaining small children but letting the world see her as an adult ... while perhaps avoiding the Miley Cyrus (circa 2010) over-the-top displays. Maybe.\n\nJoJo became famous when she was 8, appearing on Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition.\n\nAs an adult, she competed on Dancing With The Stars -- in fact, making history as part of the show's first same-sex dancing pair.\n\nFrom performing at L.A. Pride to releasing her upcoming EP, JoJo's career is in bloom now that she's an adult.\n\nThis upcoming, unnamed JoJo Siwa reality show could really help fans to see her in a new light. To so many (especially adults), she's still a children's entertainer.\n\nWhile some edgy antics can disabuse people of the notion (she is 21 years old!), JoJo showcasing more of her life could do a lot more.\n\nSometimes, appearing on a reality series can be ruinous. But it can also be a win for someone's personal brand -- especially if JoJo has any editorial input.

WAM's intact mineralized CRD system encompasses the (past producing) Illinois Creek gold-silver mine, the Waterpump Creek high-grade silver-lead-zinc deposit, open to the north, and the Honker gold prospect. Twenty-five kilometers northeast of the Illinois Creek CRD lies the Round Top copper and the TG North CRD prospects. All prospects were originally discovered by Anaconda Minerals Co. in the early 1980's. Since 2010, WAM, along with its precursor company, Western Alaska Copper & Gold, reassembled the Anaconda land package and has been engaged in exploring the district.\n\nHeadquartered in both Alaska and Arizona, WAM brings together a team of seasoned professionals with a shared vision of pioneering new frontiers in mineral exploration. Our strategic approach is underpinned by cutting-edge technology, innovative techniques, and a deep understanding of the geological intricacies of the region.\n\nOn behalf of the Company\n\n\"Kit Marrs\"\n\nKit Marrs\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nPhone: 520-200-1667\n\nFor further information please contact:\n\nVanessa Bogaert, Director of Corporate Communications/IR at This email address is being protected from spambots.

The Brokered Offering was led by Paradigm Capital Inc. (the \"Lead Agent\"), as the lead agent and sole bookrunner, on behalf of a syndicate of agents, including Canaccord Genuity Corp.

The issuance of Units to these related parties is considered to be a related party transaction within the meaning of TSX Venture Exchange (\"TSXV\") Policy 5.9 and Multilateral Instrument 61-101 (\"MI 61-101\"). The Company has relied on the exemptions from the valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 (and Policy 5.9) as the fair market value of the Units issued to such person does not exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization.\n\nThis news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States.

The Brokered Offering was led by Paradigm Capital Inc. (the \"Lead Agent\"), as the lead agent and sole bookrunner, on behalf of a syndicate of agents, including Canaccord Genuity Corp.

Each Unit is comprised of one common share of the Company (a \"Common Share\") and one Common Share purchase warrant (a \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant shall entitle the holder thereof to purchase one Common Share (a \"Warrant Share\") at an exercise price of $0.54 per Warrant Share for a period of 36 months from the closing of the Offering.\n\nThe gross proceeds of the Offering will be used for exploration and development and general working capital purposes.\n\nIn connection with the Brokered Offering, the Agents received an aggregate cash fee of $287,680.46. In addition, the Company granted the Agents 719,201 non-transferable compensation warrants (the \"Compensation Warrants\").

The Company has relied on the exemptions from the valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 (and Policy 5.9) as the fair market value of the Units issued to such person does not exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization.\n\nThis news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States. The securities have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons unless registered under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.\n\nAbout DLP Resources Inc.\n\nDLP Resources Inc. is a mineral exploration company operating in Peru and Southeastern British Columbia exploring for Base Metals and Cobalt.

Generally, but not always, forward-looking information and statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"plans\", \"expects\", \"is expected\", \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\", or \"believes\" or the negative connotation thereof or variations of such words and phrases or state that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will be taken\", \"occur\" or \"be achieved\" or the negative connation thereof.\n\nSuch forward-looking information and statements are based on numerous assumptions, including among others, that the Company will be able to utilize the proceeds of the Offering as anticipated. Although the assumptions made by the Company in providing forward-looking information or making forward-looking statements are considered reasonable by management at the time, there can be no assurance that such assumptions will prove to be accurate and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.\n\nImportant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's plans or expectations include risks relating to the inability of the Company to use the proceeds of the Offering as anticipated, market conditions and timeliness of regulatory approvals. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking information or implied by forward-looking information, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that forward-looking information and statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or intended.

In addition, the Company intends to grant the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 5 percent of the number of common shares and/or warrants offered in the Offering.\n\nMaxim Group LLC is acting as sole book-running manager for the Offering.\n\nGreenPower currently intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for the production of all-electric vehicles, including BEAST school buses and EV Star commercial vehicles, as well as for product development, with the remainder, if any, for general corporate purposes.\n\nThe offering is subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, including the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange and notification to The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nThe Offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form F-3, as amended, (File No. 333-276209) previously filed with and subsequently declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on February 2, 2024.

GreenPower was founded in Vancouver, Canada with primary operational facilities in southern California.\n\nForward Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements with the meaning of applicable securities laws. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections about future events and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as \"upon\", \"may\", \"should\", \"will\", \"could\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"plan\", \"anticipate\", \"expect\", \"believe\" or \"continue\", or the negative thereof or similar variations. Such forward-looking statements include, among other things, whether or when the Offering may be completed, or as to the actual size, pricing or other terms of the Offering and GreenPower's anticipated use of the net proceeds of the Offering, if any. The material assumptions supporting these forward-looking statements include, among others, Greenpower's ability to complete the Offering in the manner described, or at all, the receipt of all required regulatory approvals with respect to the Offering, and the Company's continued production of BEAST school buses and EV Star commercial vehicles. Actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including, without limitation, delays or changes of plan with respect to the Offering described herein, termination of the Offering in accordance with its terms, the dilutive effects of the Offering, market conditions, and changes to the intended use of proceeds from the Offering. Although GreenPower believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking information or statements are reasonable, prospective investors in GreenPower's securities should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information and statements because GreenPower can provide no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release are as of the date of this press release and GreenPower assumes no obligation to update or revise this forward-looking information and statements except as required by law. Consequently, readers should not place any undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. \u00a92024 GreenPower Motor Company Inc.

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections about future events and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as \"upon\", \"may\", \"should\", \"will\", \"could\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"plan\", \"anticipate\", \"expect\", \"believe\" or \"continue\", or the negative thereof or similar variations. Such forward-looking statements include, among other things, whether or when the Offering may be completed, or as to the actual size, pricing or other terms of the Offering and GreenPower's anticipated use of the net proceeds of the Offering, if any. The material assumptions supporting these forward-looking statements include, among others, Greenpower's ability to complete the Offering in the manner described, or at all, the receipt of all required regulatory approvals with respect to the Offering, and the Company's continued production of BEAST school buses and EV Star commercial vehicles. Actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including, without limitation, delays or changes of plan with respect to the Offering described herein, termination of the Offering in accordance with its terms, the dilutive effects of the Offering, market conditions, and changes to the intended use of proceeds from the Offering. Although GreenPower believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking information or statements are reasonable, prospective investors in GreenPower's securities should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information and statements because GreenPower can provide no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release are as of the date of this press release and GreenPower assumes no obligation to update or revise this forward-looking information and statements except as required by law.

The multi-million ounce Candelones gold deposits are within the 100% owned Neita Fase II exploration concession located in Dajab\ufffdn province, in the northwest part of the Dominican Republic. The Company delivered a feasibility study for the Oxide portion of the Candelones deposit in Q4 of 2022. The Company applied to split the \"Neita Fase II\" concession into an Exploitation Concession and an Exploration Concession in late February 2022. The application for the 9,990 Ha \"Neita Sur\" concession has moved smoothly through various permitting stages and the Company expects that a decision will be given on the application in the second quarter of 2024. The 10,902 Ha \"Neita Norte\" Exploration Concession was awarded to the Company in Q2 2023. Unigold has been active in the Dominican Republic since 2002 and remains the most active exploration Company in the country. The two concessions together form the largest single exposure of the volcanic rocks of the Cretaceous Tireo Formation. This island arc terrain is host to Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide deposits, Intermediate and High Sulphidation Epithermal Systems and Copper-gold porphyry systems. Unigold has identified over 20 areas within the concession areas that host surface expressions of gold systems. Unigold has been concentrating on the Candelones mineralization and is moving to bring these deposits into production.\n\nCertain statements contained in this document, including statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results, financial position and cash flows, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

The multi-million ounce Candelones gold deposits are within the 100% owned Neita Fase II exploration concession located in Dajab\u00f3n province, in the northwest part of the Dominican Republic. The Company delivered a feasibility study for the Oxide portion of the Candelones deposit in Q4 of 2022. The Company applied to split the \"Neita Fase II\" concession into an Exploitation Concession and an Exploration Concession in late February 2022. The application for the 9,990 Ha \"Neita Sur\" concession has moved smoothly through various permitting stages and the Company expects that a decision will be given on the application in the second quarter of 2024. The 10,902 Ha \"Neita Norte\" Exploration Concession was awarded to the Company in Q2 2023. Unigold has been active in the Dominican Republic since 2002 and remains the most active exploration Company in the country. The two concessions together form the largest single exposure of the volcanic rocks of the Cretaceous Tireo Formation. This island arc terrain is host to Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide deposits, Intermediate and High Sulphidation Epithermal Systems and Copper-gold porphyry systems. Unigold has identified over 20 areas within the concession areas that host surface expressions of gold systems. Unigold has been concentrating on the Candelones mineralization and is moving to bring these deposits into production.\n\nFor further information please visit www.unigoldinc.com or contact:\n\nMr. Joseph Hamilton\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.

While some feel it\u2019s necessary to have a bridal party in matching gowns and suits, others feel that\u2019s outdated. Traditional vows may ring true to one couple, but deeply inauthentic to another. In 2024, is there really one proper way to throw or attend a wedding? The short answer is no. But there are some ways to make it easier for all involved. To help, we\u2019ve gathered tips from industry experts, Guardian readers and wedding attendees around the world. Rules for planning a wedding Nix the wedding cars: \u201cWedding cars are overrated. Unless cars are something that you as a couple are passionate about, of course! But nobody ever sees the cars. They turn up and drop you at the ceremony while everyone is already inside and seated. Also, classic cars often don\u2019t have air-conditioning or airbags, two modern conveniences I appreciate every day and wouldn\u2019t want to be without on my wedding day!\u201d \u2013 Jonathan Suckling, wedding photographer If you provide food and drink (and fun), make sure there\u2019s enough: \u201cGuests are only really concerned about three things at your wedding: great food, great drinks and great entertainment. Of course they will always enjoy the beautiful view of your seaside wedding, but truly, guests are always happy as long as they have a full and satiated belly. And good dancing too!\u201d \u2013 Michal Cohen, makeup artist Less decor is more: \u201cDon\u2019t try to incorporate everything you see on Pinterest into your wedding. The simpler the better. If invitees have gone to the trouble of purchasing gifts and attending, all they really want to do is enjoy your day with you, not be wowed.\u201d \u2013 Johanna from Florida Parents should share the cost: \u201cI suggest that both sets of parents pay for the wedding! Absurd to think the bride\u2019s family should pay in 2024.\u201d \u2013 Alex from Maine Skip anything you\u2019re doing out of obligation: \u201cDon\u2019t invite people you don\u2019t love and don\u2019t involve things in the day that could make you feel overwhelmed. If you don\u2019t like a first dance, cut it. Eliminate anything stressful, even if you cut half the guests or the creepy uncle! \u201d \u2013 Joel Edwards, film-maker at White Ark Weddings Do your hair and makeup research carefully: \u201cFor the love of all things gorgeous, avoid typing any variation of \u2018wedding hair and makeup\u2019 into Google for inspiration. The results come up with overdone and dated looks. Instead, choose a model or celebrity with similarities to you and search their beautifully photographed moments. Then, you and your team can create a custom look that best suits your style.\u201d \u2013 Emily Valerio, hairstylist and founder of Brushed With Honey NYC \u2026 consider a divorce fund? \u201cAdd this item to the gift registry: \u2018Donate to an escrow fund to help cover the costs of separation and divorce.\u2019\u201d \u2013 Rick Hepner, a photographer from Salt Lake City, Utah Wedding etiquette for guests No drama: \u201cIf family members can check their drama at the door and keep the focus on supporting the couple, this can greatly impact the overall enjoyment of the day for all involved. The couple is typically feeling a lot of emotions already, they don\u2019t need the drama. I shot a wedding where one set of parents wanted to make sure they had the same number of photos as the other set of parents and it put a lot of stress on the couple leading up to the wedding.\u201d \u2013 Casi Yost, film and digital wedding photographer based out of northern California Leave photos to the experts: \u201cGuests with cameras and phones: please don\u2019t try to get \u2018the shot\u2019. Your friend is paying a lot of money for someone to take that shot. Be present for those big moments \u2013 you\u2019ll have plenty of time throughout the day to snap your own photos. And please, don\u2019t hesitate to ask us to take some of you with the couple or your date. That\u2019s what we\u2019re there for!\u201d \u2013 Jes Workman, photographer Wedding etiquette for the couple Send thank you notes: \u201cPlease give the basic courtesy of sending your guests a thank you card to acknowledge the wedding gifts they\u2019ve given you.\u201d \u2013 Tina from St Louis, Missouri Avoid peak holiday season: \u201cDon\u2019t plan a wedding for the few days between Christmas and New Year\u2019s. People will resent you for it.\u201d \u2013 Sterling from British Columbia Smaller might be better: \u201cQuality over quantity. Please, no 100+ guest parties. Nobody is able to talk with so many people in one night. Smaller is better, or stagger it, add a backyard barbecue for some, a brunch the next day.\u201d \u2013 Isabel Bubel from North Carolina Consider what guests are going to do during your photo break: \u201cDon\u2019t keep your guests waiting over an hour while you take pictures. At the last wedding [reception] I attended, the bride and groom, both sets of parents and the bridesmaids and groomsmen showed up over 90 minutes after the wedding. A lone aunt whom no one knew was left in charge of the reception during that time.\u201d \u2013 Carolyn Martinez from Atlanta, Georgia Ensure your guests are comfortable: \u201cConsider your guests\u2019 comfort during the ceremony \u2013 no one likes to be hungry or cold. Even if you have your heart set on an outdoor event, it\u2019s often best to move inside if the weather isn\u2019t agreeable. And everyone loves a snack or drink on their way in.\u201d \u2013 Freyan Billimoria, owner of Studio Rien Take care when addressing invitations: \u201cDo NOT refer to your guests on the invitation as Mr and Mrs His-First-Name His-Last-Name. I don\u2019t care how formal your wedding is, it\u2019s extremely insulting \u2026 There are plenty of ways to indicate formality without erasing somebody\u2019s fundamental identity in the world. Modern rule: Women have their own names. Use them.\u201d \u2013 Virginia from Boston, Massachusetts Extend cocktail hour: \u201cCocktail hour doesn\u2019t actually have to be exactly one hour. Extend it and add some fun apps and cocktails. Guests will love it and you\u2019ll have time to wrap up all your photos without missing anything!\u201d \u2013 Megan Lentz from Vida Events Be present with your spouse and guests: \u201cYou do not need to be the host of your own party. You paid your vendors to do that. Just focus on having fun with your partner \u2013 stick by their side, tear it up on the dance floor. Your guests will feed off of your energy and follow suit.\u201d \u2013 Kirsten Bierlein-Hollenback, owner and lead planner at The Opal Affair Speak now: A Guardian guide to the realities of a modern wedding", "summary": "<p>There\u2019s no \u2018proper\u2019 way to get married.

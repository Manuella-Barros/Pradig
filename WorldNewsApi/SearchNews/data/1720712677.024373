Representing President Bola Tinubu on a condolence visit to Niger State Governor, Umar Bago, in Minna, Mr Alake conveyed the President\u2019s sympathies following the recent mine pit collapse in Galadima Kogo, Shiroro Local Government Area. \u201cI bring the condolences and sympathies of Mr. President to the families of victims, those injured, the entire community, and the government and people of Niger state on the mine pit collapse. It is unfortunate and avoidable. Though we learned the disaster was due to heavy downpours, we are committed to intensifying the monitoring of mining operations to ensure conformity to environmental standards,\u201d Alake stated. The minister commended the state government for swiftly mobilising emergency rescue operations in collaboration with federal agencies, stressing that all efforts must be made to rescue those still trapped. To enhance safety measures and relieve miners and their families in the event of accidents, Mr Alake declared that insurance policies for miners across the country will be enforced. The minister also emphasised the federal government\u2019s stance that remediation plans must accompany mining licence applications, stating that irresponsible mining operations that threaten the environment and communities will no longer be tolerated. \u201cWe must also put in place contingency plans to mitigate the impact of natural disasters on mining sites. For instance, we are making installing support pillars under shafts mandatory. This practice is common in other countries,\u201d he added. Governor Bago expressed gratitude to President Tinubu for the condolence visit. He emphasised the need for a concerted effort between the federal government and subnationals to ensure mining companies comply with safety standards. He advocated the strengthening of collaborative measures to enhance periodic monitoring and evaluation of the environmental impact of mining operations to minimise the recurrence of the unfortunate incident. Citing the preponderance of commercially viable critical minerals in the state, Governor Bago appealed to the federal government to focus on making the state the pivot of developing the nation\u2019s mining sector. Governor Bago accompanied the minister to visit recuperating victims at IBB Specialist Hospital. On behalf of President Tinubu, he announced a donation of N50 million to assist affected patients and families.", "summary": "<img width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/06/IMG-20240609-WA0006.jpg?fit=1600%2C1066&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Niger Collapsed Mine: Alake condoles victims, vows to enforce miners insurance\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/06/IMG-20240609-WA0006.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/06/IMG-20240609-WA0006.jpg?resize=524%2C349&amp;ssl=1 524w, https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/06/IMG-20240609-WA0006.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/06/IMG-20240609-WA0006.jpg?resize=1536%2C1023&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/06/IMG-20240609-WA0006.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1 150w, ht", "url": "https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/702260-niger-collapsed-mine-alake-condoles-victims-vows-to-enforce-miners-insurance.html", "image": "https://media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/06/IMG-20240609-WA0006.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:28:22", "author": "Chideraejemeka,Press Statement", "authors": ["Chideraejemeka", "Press Statement"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": 0.086}

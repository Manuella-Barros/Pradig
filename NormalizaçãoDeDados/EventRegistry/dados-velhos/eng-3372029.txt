A technicality like this shouldn't be allowed to derail that stability that we've shown to the rest of the world.\"\n\nRoger Corbett, chairman of Mayne Pharma and former Woolworths chief executive, said such instability was harmful to confidence, and could deter investment when it was needed by the economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's very disruptive and it breaks confidence,\" Mr Corbett said.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Business AM Newsletter Business AM Newsletter\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\n\"Stability and leadership from the government are very important aspects in providing confidence in the future. One of the things that has marked Australia's economy in the last few years has been a lack of non-mining, non-property investment.\"\n\nIndependent senator Cory Bernardi this week argued that Parliament should be suspended until the issue has been resolved, but business leaders rejected such an idea. Mr Corbett said suspending Parliament would be \"the worst possible thing to do\".\n\nBusiness Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott\u200b agreed, saying it would be disappointing if \"political opportunism allows the parliamentary gears to grind to a halt\".\n\n\"The community expects a functioning parliament whose members work hard to keep the country moving,\" she said.\n\nAi Group's chief executive Innes Willox\u200b said while the everyday machinery of government was still working normally, \"long-term certainty\" was being undermined as the crisis continued.\n\nIt's very disruptive and it breaks confidence.\n\nRoger Corbett\n\n\"Regardless of what's happening in Parliament the machinery of government is still working normally. Taxes are still being collected and borders are open,\" he said.\n\n\"That said, boardrooms overseas have a wary eye on Australia and the longer the instability persists the higher the political risk.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, other business leaders played down the significance of events in Canberra on the corporate world.\n\nWesfarmers chief executive Richard Goyder\u200b said Australia was still a \"pretty good\" environment for investing, even though he worried about the state of politics.\n\n\"From a personal point of view I probably worry ... but I think the results we've released today prove that if you just get on with things, businesses like Wesfarmers can actually - notwithstanding the environment we're operating in - can actually do some really good stuff,\" he said this week at its profit result.\n\nDarren Steinberg, chief executive of Dexus Property said investors seemed \"comfortable\" with the broader policies being pursue to support a stable economy.\n\n\"With all the changes that have happened in Canberra over the past few years ... I think investors are becoming immune to the political shenanigans,\" he said.\n\nQBE Group's chief executive John Neal said the issue was \"very much in the background\".\n\n\"I think all we can do is watch and react to political activity almost anywhere in the world, whether it's at home here or dealing with the European fallout post-Brexit, or indeed watching the Trump administration in the US,\" Mr Neal said.\n\nNational Australia Bank's chief economist Alan Oster\u200b said there was only one occasion in the 30-year history of the bank's business confidence survey where business confidence appeared to have been affected by politics. That occurred the month before Tony Abbott's election win in 2013, when business confidence surged.\n\nwith Patrick Hatch and Carolyn Cummins", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

Over the next two weeks\" - a lull between parliamentary sitting weeks - \"I will continue discussions with the Prime Minister. Who knows where we'll end up?\"\n\nMs Sharkie said: \"What we have seen in the past four days is a Parliament that's disrupted and I don't want it to be further denigrated in the weeks to come.\n\n\"It's supposed to be a working chamber but it's not working at the moment - the actions of both major parties are disrespectful. When Barnaby Joyce got up to speak as a minister in the house yesterday, half of Labor turned their backs. It's really terrible.\"\n\nThe leader of Ms Sharkie's party, senator Nick Xenophon, on Friday became the latest legislator to announce he could be a dual national with Australian and British citizenship, potentially violating section 44 of the constitution.\n\nHe said that he was remaining in the Parliament while seeking urgent legal advice. Ms Sharkie said that there was no contradiction in her support for Senator Xenophon to stay on and her demand that Mr Joyce and Senator Nash stand down from the ministry.\n\nThe crossbenchers agree that Mr Joyce and others under a cloud are entitled to sit in the Parliament until the High Court rules, but argue that they should not serve in the executive because it is too disruptive to the workings of the Parliament.\n\nThe High Court is expected to decide the cases in October, although a government minister told Fairfax Media that there was a possibility that the court might bring the matter forward to late August.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World_Literature", "wgt": 100, "id": 549, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World Literature"}],

With only minor exceptions over some hundreds of years and across all the major religions, this is how marriage has been, and continues to be, defined.\n\nIt's also true that about 98 per cent of Australians identify as heterosexual and according to the 2011 census figures only 1 per cent of Australian couples are same-sex, with surveys suggesting only a minority want same-sex marriage.

Such is the nature of conceiving and giving birth that to pretend otherwise is to deny how nature works.\n\nTo put it bluntly, gays and lesbians are physically incapable of procreation and having their own children. For them to believe otherwise is to deny the life choice they have made and to believe they should be entitled to something normally associated with biological parents.\n\nIt's also true that the ideal situation is where children are raised by their biological parents instead of conception involving a third party donating sperm or paying a surrogate mother. As any parent well knows, the intimate and unique bond between a biological parent and his or her child is primal in its force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo wonder children conceived by donor sperm now have the legal right to discover their true parentage and less privileged countries such as Thailand and Cambodia are banning surrogacy.\n\nParents who have conceived naturally as a key aspect of what it means to be married also know that children require a male and a female role model if they are to fully mature and develop as young adults.\n\nBoth genetically and emotionally, and what is expected socially, men and women are different. While much has been done to promote equality of the sexes the fact is that boys need strong, male role models.\n\nThis I know from personal experience after losing a father to alcoholism and domestic violence as a young child and missing out on the love and companionship that only a father can provide.\n\nIn the same way, despite the campaign by feminists to erase gender stereotyping, young girls generally copy their mothers and express themselves in a feminine way. As a general rule, boys are more physical than girls and less emotionally demonstrative.\n\nForget the mantra that equality only occurs when all sexes are the same - it is possible to be equal but different.\n\nChanging the marriage act to include same-sex couples radically redefines and alters the meaning of a sacred union that provides more than just a physical and emotional connection.\n\nSuch is the special union of body and spirit involved in a marriage between a man and a woman that it necessitates a unique ritual and sacred compact that should not be weakened by being radically redefined as argued by same-sex activists.\n\nThe argument that the marriage act should not be radically redefined is based on the fact that gays and lesbians already enjoy all the rights and privileges of de-facto couples. Long gone are the days when gays and lesbians were ostracised or discriminated against.\n\nThere's no doubt that we are living in a time of significant social change, where social institutions such as marriage that have stood the test of time are being critiqued and undermined.\n\nWhile some argue the benefits of such change, including increased autonomy, freedom and diversity, there is also an obvious downside. The English poet T. S. Eliot argues, \"by far the most important channel of transmission of culture remains the family: and when family fails to play its part, we must expect our culture to deteriorate\".\n\nWhile not being as strident as Eliot it is true that family is central to a society's continued prosperity and growth. And central to the concept of family is the traditional definition of marriage.\n\nDr Kevin Donnelly is a Senior Research Fellow at the Australian Catholic University and author of The Culture of

Gonorrhoea is more common among men who have sex with men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the largest relative increase in the gonorrhoea notification rate was in females - up 43 per cent, compared to 23 per cent for men.\n\nYou will now receive updates from AM & PM Update Newsletter AM & PM Update Newsletter\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\n\"We use women as bit of a marker for the heterosexual population, so the fact we have seen this increase suggests we're seeing more transmission in heterosexual people as well,\" said Dr Selvey.\n\nThe number of chlamydia cases also rose in 2016. There were 337 notifications per 100,000 people, a 13 per cent increase on the 2015 figure. Interestingly, NSW Health observed a change in trend by gender.\n\n\"In 2016, the rates of chlamydia notification in both males and females were very similar, whereas in previous years the female chlamydia notification rate was consistently higher than males,\" the report said.\n\nThe report also shows the infectious syphilis rate remains stable.\n\nDr Christopher Bourne, head of NSW STI Programs Unit at NSW Health said much of the increases reflected the \"big ramp-up\" in service delivery to encourage more testing.\n\n\"So we're seeing lots more testing, more frequent particularly in high-risk populations and testing in different anatomical sites, depending on how people are having sex,\" he said.\n\n\"We're having more comprehensive, more frequent testing, so I would expect we're finding infections that we weren't finding before.\"\n\nHe said increased testing meant people could find out they were infected before they showed symptoms and take action so that gonorrhoea, for example, didn't lead to septicaemia.\n\nHe said NSW Health would continue to consistently send out messages to the public about the importance of using condoms.\n\nThe report shows the proportion of gay men with casual partners reporting consistent condom use has fallen, from 47 per cent in 2014 to 42 per cent last year.\n\nChief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said condoms were the most effective way to prevent the transmission of STIs.\n\n\"NSW Health has invested in a variety programs promoting condom use across all age groups, through online and social media platforms as well as face-to-face education,\" Dr Chant said.\n\n\"This includes the ACON Condom and ACON Choose Prevention Campaigns, which target gay and homosexually active men.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories":

spreading euthanasia laws around the globe.\n\nIt's a matter of faith to him that any suffering one experiences in this life is connected with one's past lives, and should be borne into the next.\n\n\"Reincarnation basically says you have to live for what you have - past life, current life; if you are to pay a penalty you have to,\" Mr Guduru says, clarifying that this is merely his personal view.\n\nRelated Articles New laws could see Victorians get a lethal dose in days How Victoria's euthanasia laws would work\n\nThere is nothing in the Hindu faith that compels its followers to oppose assisted dying, which will be debated in Victoria's parliament within weeks.\n\n\"It's an individual choice,\" Mr Guduru says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the matter of individual choice, Victorians overwhelmingly want the right to end their own lives when terminally ill, a poll suggests.\n\nFairfax Media this month asked almost 3000 Victorians the question, via a ReachTel phone poll: do you support or oppose the Andrews government's planned new assisted dying laws?\n\nAlmost two-thirds said they either supported or strongly supported the laws, which will be subject to a conscience vote among MPs.\n\nSupport for the proposed laws was high in all categories: among men, women, the young, middle aged, elderly, Labor, Liberal and Greens voters.\n\nAbout 15 per cent of people polled said they were opposed or strongly opposed to assisted dying.\n\nThe poll was conducted in the electorates of Bentleigh, Mordialloc, Carrum and Frankston, four marginal seats in Melbourne's south-east.\n\nSupport was strongest in the seat of Carrum, where the Shri Shiva Vishnu Hindu Temple, Australia's largest, is located.\n\nThere, 40 per cent of people polled said they strongly supported the proposed law change, 23 per cent expressed support, 7 per cent opposed assisted dying and 6 per cent strongly opposed it.\n\nCarrum MP Sonya Kilkenny, one of 128 MPs who will vote on the legislation, has said publicly she will vote yes.\n\nOther MPs in the polled seats are more circumspect.\n\nBentleigh MP Nick Staikos and Mordialloc MP Tim Richardson both said they would wait to see the legislation.\n\nMr Staikos, who described himself as Christian but not socially conservative, said he would have to be convinced that the law's safeguards against coercion, exploitation or elder abuse were strong.\n\n\"I want to be sure it's a not a system people can go through because they feel like they are a burden to their friends and family,\" he said.\n\nMr Richardson also took a \"cautionary\" view, though his was not based on religious faith.\n\n\"Can representatives be sure not one person will be wrongly put to death or coerced?\" he said.\n\nBoth MPs were at the receiving end this month of a letterbox campaign by the Right to Life group, which opposes assisted dying and has called on people to contact their MPs.\n\nYet the poll results suggest a backlash, if any, could hit MPs who vote no.\n\nAbout 75 per cent of Labor voters polled backed the law change; fewer than 10 per cent said no.\n\nAmong Liberal voters, support was just below 50 per cent; opposition was below 25 per cent, with many taking a neutral view.\n\nLabor and Liberal MPs have been given a rare conscience vote and are divided.\n\nDeputy Premier James Merlino has spoken against the laws, and front bench MP Marlene Kairouz hosted a meeting of disability advocates against assisted dying.\n\nPremier Daniel Andrews leads the \"yes\" camp.\n\nMatthew Guy will vote no but has given his colleagues a free vote.\n\n\"I've been very clear on my personal view against euthanasia but I've also been very clear that I respect everyone's views on this complex issue which is why my colleagues have a free vote,\" Mr Guy said.\n\nLiberal MPs including upper house leader Mary Wooldridge and corrections spokesman Ed O'Donohue have indicated they support assisted dying.\n\nUnder the proposed Victorian model, lethal medication will be available to terminally ill adults who are in pain with less than 12 months to live.\n\nPoll Would you like to vote?\n\nYou will need Cookies enabled to use

The said entity is jointly owned by two brothers Alif Nur a.k.a. Mukul and Anisur Rahaman a.k.a. Bidesh, with the latter being Trinamool Congress' Deganga block president.\n\nThese two brothers, as revealed through investigation, are also the cousins of businessman Bakibur Rahman, the first to be arrested by the ED officials in the ration distribution case.\n\nInvestigations have further revealed that the two brothers also ancestrally own a private B.Ed & D.El.Ed College which is quite profit-making. Bidesh successfully contested the panchayat elections in 2018 and became the PWD executive officer of Deganga panchayat samiti.\n\nAfter the 2021 West Bengal Assembly elections, he became the ruling party's Deganga block president.\n\nBidesh was quite cool in his reactions given to the media after the raid and search operation. \"Raids by central agencies are regular affairs these days. However, we have extended full cooperation to the ED officials and handed them over all the documents that they sought. We will continue cooperating with the investigating officials in the coming days. They have seized my mobile phone,\" he said.\n\nThe second empire that has been tracked by the ED officials is that of Abdul Barik Biswas, known to be a close aide of former state food and supplies minister Jyotipriya Mallick, who is currently in judicial custody in connection with the ration distribution case.\n\nOn Tuesday, the ED officials conducted raid and search operations at the residences of Biswas at Basirhat, Rajarhat and Barasat, all in North 24 Parganas district. The investigating officials also recovered cash worth Rs 20 lakh from his Rajarhat residence.\n\nAlthough he had never been directly into politics, his close family members are. His elder brother Ghulam was an elected member of the North 24 Parganas Zilla parishad from 2013 to 2018. The latter's wife Safiza Begum replaced him in the 2018 panchayat polls.\n\nAbdul Barik Biswas has a past criminal record. He was arrested by the customs department in connection with gold smuggling. A consignment of gold was also seized from his possession then. He remained behind bars for some years and was then released on bail.

A consignment of gold was also seized from his possession then.\n\nHe remained behind bars for some years and was then released on bail. After being released, he started multiple businesses like rice mill, cola trading, brick kiln and transport.\n\nExactly at that point of time, sources said, he became extremely close to the ruling Trinamool Congress leaders, especially Jyotipriya Mallick, who is currently in judicial custody in connection with the ration distribution case.\n\nMeanwhile, another team of ED officials started conducting raid and search operations at the office of Jahangir PG Agro Food Products Private Limited at Bhangar in South 24 Parganas district, which is owned by local Trinamool Congress leader Jahangir Alam aka Pappu in connection with the ration distribution case.\n\nPappu's brother Kaizer Ahmed is a heavyweight ruling party leader at Bhangar. Pappu, however, claimed that once he had a 10 per cent share in said entity, but never was he involved in the day-to-day functioning of that. \"It is unfortunate that my name is surfacing in the matter,\" he said.\n\nAnother place where the ED officials have been conducting raid and search operations since Tuesday morning is the office of PG High Tech Rice Mill at Deganga in North 24 Parganas district. Sources said that the owners of the entity reportedly had a close connection with businessman Bakibur Rahman, the first person to be arrested by the ED officials in connection with the ration distribution case.", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyotipriya_Mallick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jyotipriya Mallick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajarhat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajarhat"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barasat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barasat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barasat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basirhat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basirhat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Basirhat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhangar_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhangar Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinamool_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trinamool Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahangir", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jahangir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_24_Parganas_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North 24 Parganas district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North 24 Parganas district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deganga", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deganga"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_24_Parganas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South 24 Parganas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South 24 Parganas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?url=Ration+distribution+case%3A+ED+raids+10+locations+in+two+Bengal+districts", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774849", "eventUri": "eng-9774849", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 9, "textEnd": 16}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}
